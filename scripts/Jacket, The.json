Around it loom those of DR.

It is THE JACKET: an apparatus\n               designed to encase a man's body. Made of coarse, sickly-\n               stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would\n               first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped\n               around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests\n               its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN.\n\n               \n               STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying\n               nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement.\n               Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them\n               as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in. Then Starks,\n               sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to\n               him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them.\n\n               \n\n                                     STARKS\n                           Wait.

BECKER writes some details down, presumably\n               about Starks' treatment.\n\n               \n               A CADAVER DRAWER -- just barely deep enough for a body or tall\n               enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and STARKS,\n               already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET, is crammed inside.\n\n               \n               The ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall.\n\n               \n\n               INT.

Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with\n               formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern\n               before they change into something else. Only after STARKS\n               blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW\n               from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in\n               the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time\n               between BLINKS.\n\n               \n                1) A little river of RED marring the snow around it,\n                spilling from...\n\n               \n                2) OFFICER HARRISON'S mouth just seconds before his last\n                breath.

He walks closer to them,\n               when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside\n               one of the stalls. He checks the first stall, pushing it\n               open. It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock.\n\n               \n               The sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past the second\n               stall to the third and then... WHACK! The door swings all the\n               way towards STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- his head\n               just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink.\n\n               \n               DAMON, the ORDERLY, walks out.\n\n               \n\n                                     DAMON\n                           I'm sorry, Starks.

MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE\n\n\n               \n               They're all in the room. STARKS seems pretty calm. Only in a\n               C.U. do we see his eyes register the JACKET...\n\n               \n\n                                     BECKER\n                           I'm glad to see you're cooperating\n                           this time, Mr. Starks.\n\n               \n\n                                                                              23.\n\n               \n               STARKS looks at the WIDE, STURDY restraints on it. They would\n               really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with\n               them. They might even knock someone out...\n\n               \n               DAMON and HARDING move to undress him, when STARKS makes a\n               move to do it himself. They look to DR. BECKER who NODS that\n               it's all right.\n\n               \n               DAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps\n               on one of Starks' bare feet.\n\n               \n               STARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away from them and\n               bends down to take off his pants. On his way up, he GRABS THE\n               JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, using it like a weapon, aims to\n               smack it across Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks and the\n               JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force of the blow sends\n               Becker down, and as he falls against the wall, DAMON and\n               HARDING leap to restrain Starks.\n\n               \n               BECKER   opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into\n               focus.   His right cheek is cut pretty bad. DR. GRIES helps\n               BECKER   to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the\n               floor.

He looks back at the WAITRESS and then to the few\n               PICTURES on the mantle: they are of JACKIE and her mother,\n               JEAN. STARKS runs his hand through his hair, trying to\n               swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the\n               situation.\n               STARKS' EYES search the room for ANYTHING that could help him\n               figure out what's happening. On the console is an OLD PAPER\n               and some MAIL. Totally disoriented, STARKS nearly STUMBLES on\n               his way to the PILE.\n\n               \n               The label on the first BILL reads \"Jackie Price.\" On the\n               second, the same.

DR. GRIES drips some WATER in\n               Starks' mouth. As some of it trickles out, it runs into the\n               JACKET, burning STARKS' chafed skin.\n\n               \n               STARKS' EYES flutter and DR.

WARD 3, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY\n\n\n               \n               STARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more\n               threatening and disturbed. As he is anxiously looking around --\n               presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS\n               humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it\n               comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young,\n               fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY,\n               administering medication from a dated CART.\n\n               \n               STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS\n               or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused\n               on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her.\n\n               \n               The BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards\n               the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up\n               speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as\n               the BRUTE reaches the NURSE.\n\n               \n               He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She\n               starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up\n               the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it.\n\n               \n               The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his\n               balance. It's clear he's impaired. But it's also clear he\n               understands pain.\n\n               \n\n                                                                             62.\n\n               \n                                      STARKS [To Sally]\n                            You ok?\n\n               \n               As she NODS, her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike\n               him. Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the\n               BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the piece of GLASS\n               he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes\n               perilously close to STARKS' head.\n\n               \n               The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified.\n               Is this when he dies?\n\n               \n               The BRUTE -- incensed more than ever -- lunges at him a final time.\n               STARKS gets him by the NECK, expertly applying PRESSURE\n               POINTS and, after only a few seconds, subdues him. STARKS\n               himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them. He lets\n               out a suspended BREATH, instinctively touching his FOREHEAD\n               to make sure he's not cut. He looks back at SALLY.\n\n               \n\n                                     SALLY\n                           Are you ok?\n\n               \n\n                                     STARKS\n                           Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone?\n                           Where is everyone?\n\n               \n                                     SALLY [Defensively]\n                           There's a state rep visiting so\n                           they've moved everyone around.

He runs his hand over his\n               forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT.\n\n               \n               They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS\n               appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON\n               beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS.\n\n               \n               In slow motion, we hear a DISTANT, GARBLED VOICE CALL OUT...\n\n               \n\n                                     DISTORTED VOICE\n                           No!

In the terrific SHOWER OF\n               GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks'\n               head.\n\n               \n               BLOOD starts to flow. As STARKS' eyes struggle to regain\n               their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the\n               PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right.\n\n               \n               The details start to make sense, even to Starks.

BLOOD pours from his head\n               onto the floor.\n\n               \n               The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight\n               onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently,\n               as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the\n               JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one.\n\n               \n               When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and\n               the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles\n               kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the\n               room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in.\n\n               \n               As the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on\n               the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the\n               room.

This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as\n               though he's traveling in a heaven of his own. The IMAGES he\n               sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a\n               tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally\n               retrieved his memory without it haunting him...\n\n               \n\n                                      STARKS (V.O.)\n                            I promise you, Jean.

I can offer you\n                            some proof: when you die, there's\n                            only one thing you want to have\n                            happen...sometimes so badly it\n                            comes true, I guess.

JACKIE looks back curiously as JEAN\n               wraps her arms around Jackie's LEGS and rests her head in her\n               lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly\n               missed a tragedy.\n\n               \n\n                                                        FADE TO BLACK.\n\n               \n\n               EXT.

After a slightly\n               longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the\n               same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM\n               and an unmistakable air of vitality.\n\n               \n               Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same\n               attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even\n               as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a\n               BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is\n               someone we see she wants to be near.\n\n               \n               Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful,\n               alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to\n               leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the\n               world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her\n               being.\n\n               \n\n                                     JACKIE\n                           Hey there.

Sensing this, she\n               moves closer to calm him.\n\n               \n\n                                      JACKIE\n                            It's ok. It's ok. Relax.
