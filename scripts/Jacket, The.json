DAMON deftly ducks and the\n               JACKET hits BECKER instead.

As he is anxiously looking around --\n               presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS\n               humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it\n               comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young,\n               fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY,\n               administering medication from a dated CART.\n\n<b>               \n</b>               STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS\n               or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused\n               on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her.\n\n<b>               \n</b>               The BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards\n               the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up\n               speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as\n               the BRUTE reaches the NURSE.\n\n<b>               \n</b>               He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She\n               starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up\n               the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it.\n\n<b>               \n</b>               The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his\n               balance.

JACKIE looks back curiously as JEAN\n               wraps her arms around Jackie's LEGS and rests her head in her\n               lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly\n               missed a tragedy.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>                                                        FADE TO BLACK.\n</b>\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

After a slightly\n               longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the\n               same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM\n               and an unmistakable air of vitality.\n\n<b>               \n</b>               Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same\n               attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even\n               as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a\n               BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is\n               someone we see she wants to be near.\n\n<b>               \n</b>               Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful,\n               alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to\n               leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the\n               world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her\n               being.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>                                     JACKIE\n</b>                           Hey there.
