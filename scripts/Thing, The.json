MacReady heads back toward the \n               chopper.\n\n<b>               THE CHOPPER\n</b>\n               MacReady unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel \n               behind the seats.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He \n               slowly pushes it open with his gun. A creaking. A long pitch-\n               black corridor. Copper shines a flashlight.\n\n<b>                                     DR.

NARROW CORRIDOR\n</b>\n               The two men move slowly. It is dank and cold. Their breath, \n               bleating like exhaust. A soft, steady wind howls overhead.  \n               The flashlight is not much help.\n\n               Further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get \n               closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door \n               at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from \n               within.\n\n               The face of the door has been shredded. An ax sticks out \n               from its middle. MacReady wrenches out the ax. There is blood \n               on it. The men acknowledge this for a beat.\n\n               MacReady tries the knob. It opens slightly. Something is \n               blocking it from the other side.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Anybody in there?!\n\n               Nothing.\n\n<b>                                     DR.

The door gives a bit. Finally more. \n               It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer-\n               like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and \n               shines the flashlight.\n\n               It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed \n               in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the \n               radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room.\n\n               A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman \n               lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter \n               light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio \n               chair.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Hey, Sweden...! You okay?\n\n               The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch \n               closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor.  \n               He pokes his gun at the chair's back.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Sweden?!\n\n               Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the \n               armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in \n               a pool of frozen blood on the floor.\n\n               The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up \n               in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth.\n\n               His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor \n               in his lap.\n\n               MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the \n               other door.

Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high \n               as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a \n               cavernous, underground causeway.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Hey, Sweden!!!\n\n<b>                                     DR.

Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the \n               darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor \n               stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in \n               different directions. A panting beat. Silence.\n\n               Dr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted \n               by the wind. MacReady takes it.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Norwegian of the Month, Doc.

THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS\n</b>\n               The supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked \n               from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of \n               fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks \n               overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down.\n\n               The two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries \n               to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam.

MacReady's knee bumps into something along the \n               wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light \n               on it.\n\n               An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off \n               the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, \n               its fist still gripping a small welding torch.\n\n               The flame long since gone out.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                              (wincing)\n                         Holy shit...\n\n               He tries the door.

MacReady stands before a huge block of \n               ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall.\n\n               It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been \n               stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost.\n\n               Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and \n               scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. \n               The two men study it uncomprehendingly.\n\n               MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. \n               He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted \n               to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and \n               play.\n\n               He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling \n               is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, \n               careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above.

They come thumping to \n               the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. \n               MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. \n               Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear.\n\n               His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the \n               inside of the cabinet door.\n\n               It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, \n               toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen \n               block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The \n               block looks much thicker.

The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate.\n\n               Palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for \n               MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging \n               the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady \n               knocking him over the table.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Copper!!\n\n               It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst \n               of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps \n               on the Doctor.\n\n               The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings.\n\n               MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to \n               the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously \n               at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him \n               skidding across the floor.\n\n               Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he \n               positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his \n               forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head.\n\n               The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his \n               feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body \n               of Dr. Copper.\n\n               The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire \n               up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work.\n\n               Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering \n               the thick steel instrument over his head.\n\n               The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face.\n\n               Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet \n               another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges \n               outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for \n               the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite.\n\n               MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the \n               table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the \n               Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on \n               balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, \n               spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.\n\n               MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. \n               Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the \n               ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering \n               Childs and Garry with his body.\n\n               A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep \n               within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the \n               room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as \n               he can.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               MACREADY\n</b>\n               perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares \n               to continue the test. He heats the wire.\n\n               The men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled.\n\n               One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes \n               his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. \n               Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes.\n\n               MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays \n               glued to the others.\n\n               MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have \n               torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears.\n\n               The wire is dipped into the plate...

Childs soaks his clothing with a can of \n               gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin \n               pumps, breathing halts.\n\n               The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face.\n\n               Hisssss.\n\n               MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches \n               are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor.\n\n               Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his \n               face.\n\n               A long silence.

The strain on MacReady's \n               jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at \n               Childs' uncontrollable laughter.\n\n               The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he \n               looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic \n               wind vibrating the roof.

A thick arm pins the body to the other side. \n               Unable to stop, Nauls skids out of control, banging into the \n               sides of the wall, his cyanide capsule flying out of his \n               mouth.\n\n               Whatever the rest of it is, it starts to crumble through the \n               wall.

The gas bombs are cocked.\n\n               From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst.\n\n               Stunned, the men stumble back.

The good two-thirds of its \n               body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door.\n\n               Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground.

Garry dies instantly.\n\n               One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends \n               it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its \n               latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it \n               loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening.\n\n               MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

A scratching. Nauls paws, \n               rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his \n               fingers as he tries to break it off the siding.\n\n               A strong blow begins to breach the stall door.

Its enormous shovel scooper \n               tearing half the room to shreds.\n\n               MacReady drives.

Two large, compressed air tanks \n               have been tied together at the top and are draped around his \n               neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN.\n\n               They are used for the weather balloons.\n\n               He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his \n               mouth, grins and bellows.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Okay, creep!

A claw flashes up, splitting \n               the steering wheel but missing his face.\n\n               He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet.\n\n               He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. \n               The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of \n               the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls \n               himself through.\n\n<b>               EXT. ROOF\n</b>\n               He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs.\n\n               Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up \n               through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs \n               outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like \n               acid into the fabric.\n\n               An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball \n               fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating \n               almost immediately.\n\n               The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and \n               the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He \n               rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off \n               the insidious limb.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. CAMP\n</b>\n               A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground.\n\n               MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, \n               from his shoulders to the floor.\n\n               He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches \n               of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. PUB AREA\n</b>\n               Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of \n               the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled \n               considerably.\n\n<b>               CLOSE ON MACREADY\n</b>\n               lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours \n               himself a drink.\n\n               A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame \n               and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs.\n\n               White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         Did you kill it?\n\n               He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         I think so.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         What do you mean \"you think so?\"\n\n               Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Yeah. I got it.\n                              (refers to Childs' \n                              condition)\n                         Pretty mean frostbite.\n\n               Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his \n               puffy white hand.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         It'll turn black again soon enough. \n                         Then I guess I'll be losing the whole \n                         thing...\n                              (refers to feet)\n                         ...Think my toes are already gone.\n\n               MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits \n               down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several \n               decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         So you're the only one who made it.\n\n               MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Not the only one.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         The fire's got the temperature way \n                         up all over camp... won't last long \n                         though.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Neither will we.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         Maybe we should try and fix the \n                         radio... try and get some help.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Maybe we shouldn't.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         Then we'll never make it.\n\n               MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch \n               from under the table and places it beside him on top.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         Maybe we shouldn't make it.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                              (beat)\n                         If you're worried about anything, \n                         let's take that blood test of yours.\n\n<b>                                     MACREADY\n</b>                         If we've got any surprises for each \n                         other -- we shouldn't be in any \n                         condition to do anything about it.\n                              (beat)\n                         You play chess?\n\n               They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits \n               down across from MacReady.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDS\n</b>                         I guess I'll be learning.\n\n               MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs. Childs smiles \n               back and takes a healthy swig.\n\n<b>               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The fires smolder on.
