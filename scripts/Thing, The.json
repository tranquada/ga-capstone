Sturdy, but prefabricated \n               materials have been used in its construction.\n\n               There is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. \n               A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles \n               are for storage and supplies.\n\n               The most spacious area of the building, and the main center \n               of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to \n               this room can be seen the small work chambers with their \n               sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment.\n\n               The below quarter houses the generator and still other \n               compartments for storage.\n\n               A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the \n               dog kennel.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               A STARRY BLACKNESS\n\n               From out of the billions, the smallest of specks drives slowly \n               forward.

HORIZON - BINOCULARS' POV - A DOG\n\n               It turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards \n               to its rear. Then whirls and gallops off. A gun blast kicks \n               up snow at its heels.\n\n               INT. COPTER\n\n               Another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his \n               prey. The pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and \n               implores for better aim. The craft swoops lower and the engine \n               is put into full throttle.\n\n               EXT.

COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31\n\n               A large, almost snow-covered building. Not far from that a \n               tall, meteorological balloon tower.\n\n               A scattering of several small shacks at varying distances \n               from the main compound. The smaller hovels are connected by \n               wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. Multicolored \n               pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions \n               to outdoor experiments.\n\n               A tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds \n               of continuously mounting snow.\n\n               TWO MEN, NORRIS AND BENNINGS\n\n               standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the \n               process of letting up a large red balloon. Childs, a hefty \n               black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. \n               Their beards are caked with ice. It is winter and it is harsh.\n\n               The faint sound of the copter turns their attention.\n\n               THE COPTER\n\n               flying ever lower now. The man with the gun leans dangerously \n               outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.\n\n               THE MEN\n\n               outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.\n\n               THE COPTER\n\n               much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high-\n               speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog.  \n               It bounces violently on the hard-packed surface.\n\n               Once. Twice. Passing the dog.\n\n               A third bounce sends it skidding. It flips; its blades \n               snapping off like toothpicks. It lands belly-up, soundless \n               except for the whine of its engine.\n\n               The man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.\n\n               INT. MAIN COMPOUND\n\n               The half a dozen men, playing cards, monitoring equipment, \n               listening to music -- spring to their feet, startled.\n\n               EXT. COMPOUND\n\n               The dog reaches Norris and Bennings, as they awkwardly wade \n               through the snow, toward the downed copter.\n\n               THE SURVIVOR\n\n               of the crash, his eyes crazed with determination, struggles \n               to his feet. Heedless of his companion, he double-times his \n               way to the men and the dog. He reloads his gun and bellows \n               in his Scandinavian tongue.\n\n               Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying.\n\n               The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming \n               as he does so; his face now caked with blood.\n\n               The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and \n               pawing them, imploring for safety.\n\n               Blam!! The visitor fires.

The crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks \n               after them. His countenance ablaze, mad. Ice and snow kick \n               up about the terrified Americans. A bullet smacks into the \n               dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain.\n\n               Childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving \n               behind his machine.\n\n               Bennings is hit. Norris pulls, drags him back toward the \n               compound. The dog crawls along beside them.\n\n               The intruder is relentless in his assail. He runs, screaming, \n               firing, screaming, reloading and firing.\n\n               INT. COMPOUND\n\n               Total confusion. Some watch helplessly through the small, \n               fogged-up and translucent windows.

He \n               falls to his knees and then face down into the snow.\n\n               NORRIS AND BENNINGS\n\n               stare blankly, but relievedly at the fallen man.

U.S. OUTPOST #31\n\n               Norris, bundled in his sixty-five pounds of clothing, exits \n               the main compound. He walks the prefab wooden planks up the \n               precipice; his destination is someone a hundred yards up the \n               slope -- to a shack. He grabs onto the steadying ropes and \n               pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet.\n\n               INT. MACREADY'S SHACK - CLOSE ON ICE CUBES\n\n               being dumped into a glass, followed by the pouring of whiskey.  \n               An electronic Voice is heard.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Bishop to knight four.\n\n               MacReady takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his \n               electronic chess game. A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his \n               back. He is tall; about thirty-five. His shack is sparse but \n               unkempt. A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by \n               an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American \n               paradise.\n\n               The chess game is of larger than normal size. The pieces \n               move automatically with the press of a button. He sits down \n               and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Poor little son of a bitch.

There \n               is a pounding at his door.

Check.\n\n               More impatient pounding. MacReady glares at his opponent for \n               a beat. He bends forward, opens up a flap containing the \n               chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. There ensues \n               a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the \n               machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish.\n\n               MacReady gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the \n               door.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         ...Cheating bastard...\n\n               He opens the door.

A soft, steady wind howls overhead.  \n               The flashlight is not much help.\n\n               Further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get \n               closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door \n               at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from \n               within.\n\n               The face of the door has been shredded. An ax sticks out \n               from its middle. MacReady wrenches out the ax. There is blood \n               on it. The men acknowledge this for a beat.\n\n               MacReady tries the knob. It opens slightly. Something is \n               blocking it from the other side.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Anybody in there?!\n\n               Nothing.\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         We're Americans!\n\n               Nothing.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Come to help you!!\n\n               MacReady pushes against the door.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Give me a hand.\n\n               They push, shove, grunt. The door gives a bit. Finally more. \n               It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer-\n               like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and \n               shines the flashlight.\n\n               It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed \n               in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the \n               radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room.\n\n               A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman \n               lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter \n               light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio \n               chair.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Hey, Sweden...! You okay?\n\n               The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch \n               closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor.  \n               He pokes his gun at the chair's back.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Sweden?!\n\n               Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the \n               armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in \n               a pool of frozen blood on the floor.\n\n               The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up \n               in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth.\n\n               His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor \n               in his lap.\n\n               MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the \n               other door. It is locked and barricaded.\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                              (more to himself)\n                         My God, what in hell happened here?\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Come on, Copper.\n\n               The two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. \n               MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open.\n\n               More blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high \n               as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a \n               cavernous, underground causeway.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Hey, Sweden!!!\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                              (irritated)\n                         They're not Swedish, goddamn it, \n                         they're Norwegian, MacRe --\n\n               Whap!! Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the \n               darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor \n               stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in \n               different directions. A panting beat. Silence.\n\n               Dr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted \n               by the wind. MacReady takes it.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless.\n\n               MacReady pockets it for further viewing.\n\n               INT. THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS\n\n               The supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked \n               from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of \n               fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks \n               overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down.\n\n               The two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries \n               to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. He \n               brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning \n               roof.\n\n               The two men wait until it subsides and then moves on.\n\n               Further down. MacReady's knee bumps into something along the \n               wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light \n               on it.\n\n               An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off \n               the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, \n               its fist still gripping a small welding torch.\n\n               The flame long since gone out.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                              (wincing)\n                         Holy shit...\n\n               He tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the \n               ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam.\n\n               Its owner is nowhere to be seen.\n\n               MacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles.\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         Christ...\n\n               They step over the arm and into another slim passageway.\n\n               Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with \n               Norwegian lettering on it.\n\n               MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly \n               about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. \n               The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the \n               small room with his flashlight.\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         ...Laboratory.\n\n               Broken beakers, test tubes, a microscope are illuminated.\n\n               MacReady notices a video camera.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Portable video unit.\n\n               Copper makes his way over to the main work table. He shuffles \n               through papers, glancing at the writing.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Anything?\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         All in Norwegian.\n\n               Dr. Copper bends down and begins gathering the papers, strewn \n               about the room.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         Could be important work. Might as \n                         well bring it back.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm \n                         going to check the last few rooms.\n\n               He exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape \n               recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is \n               about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He \n               turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY\n\n               MacReady shoves himself into another room.\n\n               INT. ROOM\n\n               Debris and wood flush down on him. The receding ceiling had \n               been blocking the door from above. He brushes his coat and \n               shines the light upwards.\n\n               The ceiling is a shambles. He then shines the light deeper \n               into the room.\n\n               INT. NORWEGIAN LAB\n\n               Dr. Copper is playing the small tape recorder. A casual \n               Norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. He fast \n               forwards. The same casual drone.\n\n                                     MACREADY (O.S.)\n                         Copper, come here!!\n\n               INT. ROOM\n\n               Dr. Copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. The wood \n               cracks overhead. More debris comes falling down.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Careful. It's about to go.\n\n               Copper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of \n               ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall.\n\n               It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been \n               stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost.\n\n               Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and \n               scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. \n               The two men study it uncomprehendingly.\n\n               MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. \n               He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted \n               to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and \n               play.\n\n               He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling \n               is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, \n               careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of \n               dust float down.\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         Watch it.\n\n               His grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The \n               large metal door flies open.\n\n               Large chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to \n               the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. \n               MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. \n               Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear.\n\n               His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the \n               inside of the cabinet door.\n\n               It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, \n               toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen \n               block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The \n               block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque.\n\n               MacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the \n               photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door.\n\n               An armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing \n               door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go \n               crashing to the floor.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. U.S. OUTPOST - RECREATION ROOM\n\n               The loud beat of Warren Zevon's song, \"The Werewolves of \n               London,\" can be heard throughout the compound. The room is \n               empty. Close on a video pong game, its ball of light lazily \n               traveling back and forth. The dog, its tail wagging, its \n               bandage on, walks by.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN\n\n               Zevon's record is blasting from Nauls' stereo. He skates \n               from the big walk-in freezer and plunks down a large side of \n               beef on the wood-cutting table to thaw. He skates from pot \n               to pan keeping time with his sounds.\n\n               He smells. Tastes. Adds a little something here, a touch \n               there. He clearly enjoys his work.\n\n               Station Manager Garry stops past the open door.\n\n                                     GARRY\n                         Turn that crap down, Nauls.

Can do.\n\n               He skates over and turns it down, but not much.\n\n               INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM\n\n               Garry enters and sees that Sanchez has nodded off in front \n               of his receiver. His headgear is still on. Garry walks over \n               and turns up the volume, the static jolting Sanchez awake.\n\n                                     SANCHEZ\n                         Hey, man...!\n\n                                     GARRY\n                         You reach anybody yet?\n\n                                     SANCHEZ\n                         We're a thousand miles from anybody \n                         else, man.

COMPOUND CORRIDOR\n\n               An empty hallway. Larger than most. Doors to several sleeping \n               quarters on either side. The dog slowly walks through.\n\n               One of the doors is open up ahead of his left. The dog stops \n               in front of it and looks in. Someone is inside.\n\n               Inside the small cubicle, a slight portion of a man's back \n               can be seen as he sits bent over a chair; his large shadow \n               displayed on the wall.\n\n               Back in the corridor. The dog looks up the hall once and \n               casually to the other end. No one. He enters the room. The \n               sound of a man's voice, too indistinct to tell whose, mumbles:\n\n                                     MAN'S VOICE\n                         Hello boy.\n\n               A beat.\n\n               The sound of a glass breaking. A muffled scuffling. The door \n               is slammed shut from the inside. And then silence.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. COMPOUND\n\n               Fuchs, the young biologist, is finishing up his daily jog \n               around the compound. He stops at the end of a long Quonset \n               hut almost completely buried in the snow. The hut is fifty \n               yards long and connects to the main compound. He enters a \n               tunnel from a latch door up top.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL\n\n               He jogs down the steps, passing the underground dog kennel \n               and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel. \n               He passes and waves to Clark, who rolls along a wheelbarrow \n               of dog food.\n\n               CLARK\n\n               opens the door to the small kennel and serves up the dinner.  \n               The dogs, about seven of them, yelp and bark eagerly.\n\n               INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY\n\n               near the fuel supply bladders. Older and more rickety than \n               the quarters above.\n\n               Childs waltzes through, humming, a big smile on his face.\n\n               He stops at a door with six locks on it.

PUB\n\n               Bleary-eyed, MacReady is in the process of blowing up some \n               strange inflatable object. As he puffs away, he still keeps \n               an eye on the Norwegian video tapes. His balloon begins to \n               take shape. It blossoms into a life-size replica of a full-\n               breasted woman. Something on the tape catches his eye. He \n               rewinds, then starts it forward again.\n\n               The screen shows the Norwegians on the surface of what appears \n               to be an enormous, flat glacier. They are spread out on the \n               ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched.\n\n               It fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging \n               childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased \n               with something.\n\n               The tape fades to black again and the picture reappears.\n\n               This time they have marked off the large oval area with flag \n               sticks.\n\n               Closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into \n               the ice. There is a small patch of something dark and metallic \n               at the bottom.\n\n               MacReady leans forward, intrigued.\n\n               The men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various \n               points around the markings. MacReady squints and mumbles to \n               himself.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Decanite...? Thermite charges...?\n\n               The tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. \n               No Norwegian in sight. An explosion kicks up the ice. A beat \n               as the ice sprays to the ground. Then the camera appears to \n               shake as the ground beneath it quivers.\n\n               Another immense explosion follows. An earthquake-like force \n               throws the camera to the ground.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         What in...\n\n               The tape continues, distorted, unviewable. A distinct crack \n               in the lens. MacReady lets go of his companion and quickly \n               rewinds. The deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around \n               the room.\n\n               INT. KENNEL - NIGHT\n\n               Most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. The new dog watches \n               them calmly, silently.\n\n               He takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs \n               and sits upright. Completely still. He stares at them. A \n               beat. The dogs are aware of something. They begin to seem a \n               bit confused, uncomfortable.\n\n               The new dog continues to stare. Sitting rigidly, unnaturally \n               still. His eyes dead, lusterless black spheres.\n\n               Bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something:  \n               a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring \n               growl.\n\n               The new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs \n               begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling.\n\n               Emitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them \n               into a frenzy.\n\n               Barks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. \n               Three dogs start to close in on the stranger.\n\n               They attack.\n\n               THE SHADOW OF THE NEW DOG\n\n               against the kennel wall.

The two dogs, \n               thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door \n               trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied.\n\n               The fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves \n               by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two \n               hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady \n               enter the kennel.\n\n               The light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady \n               snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their \n               animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into \n               MacReady and send him sprawling.

Then shines it around the cramped room trying \n               to get his bearings.\n\n               The light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner.\n\n               Barking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching.\n\n               Dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray \n               with a vengeance.\n\n               The flashlight illuminates parts of some \"thing.\" A dog.\n\n               But not quite.

He then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and \n               hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette.\n\n               From out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid-like leg \n               springs up and wraps around Clark's ax.

Something from beneath \n               the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back \n               down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. \n               He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice.\n\n               Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything \n               be Bennings' screaming head.

Its back is still to him; \n               its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It \n               snarls; its face turns slowly toward him.\n\n               Its skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Childs!!\n\n               Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices \n               the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward \n               MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible \n               jump of some twenty feet.\n\n               Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the \n               force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice \n               in flames.\n\n               MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and \n               engulfs the screeching animal in fire.\n\n               BENNINGS\n\n               howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. \n               Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what \n               has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                              (pulls him back)\n                         Stay back!!\n\n               Bennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the \n               ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving \n               in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a \n               different area and is just as quickly pulled back down.\n\n               MacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         What we going to do?!\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         How the fuck do I know?!\n\n               Bennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the \n               snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls \n               of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, \n               tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls \n               seem to be absorbing his head.\n\n               MacReady runs for the snowmobile.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Torch them!!\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         But...\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         He's gone already!

A screeching.\n\n               MacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a \n               steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with \n               incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the \n               snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps \n               cans of gasoline on the writhing mess.\n\n               He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage.\n\n               He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in \n               flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. \n               The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them.\n\n               They look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated \n               by the flickering flames.

A slight \n               crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask.\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         Again... More current this time, \n                         Sanchez...\n\n               Buzzz. Several more jolts from the prongs. Clark's hand has \n               found a scalpel. He gently lifts it out, bringing it to his \n               side.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         And if anyone tries to wake me...\n\n                                     DR. COPPER\n                         Damn you, MacReady!\n\n               Norris' body begins bounding up. More crackling and popping. \n               His chest begins to break up and spread. The mask pops off -- \n               a hideous mewing escaping from Norris' distorted mouth.\n\n               The men jump back, incredulous. Dr. Copper scrambles off his \n               chest and flops to the floor.\n\n                                     SANCHEZ\n                         God... what...?\n\n               They watch on in stunned horror as The Thing that was Norris \n               begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab.\n\n               Its clothes tearing. A shoe splits in half and falls to the \n               floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon.\n\n               MacReady charges toward it, shooing the men off.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Get out of the way!!\n\n               He unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, \n               belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, \n               lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet.\n\n               A black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and \n               squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the \n               fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped \n               from the walls and put to work.\n\n               MacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, \n               as they twitch and mew on the floor.\n\n               Within seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe \n               as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris.\n\n               MacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their \n               tiny squeals abating into silence.\n\n               INT. REC ROOM\n\n               MacReady, still carrying the industrial torch, has maneuvered \n               all the men into the room. He holds Garry's .44. He has \n               untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the \n               nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite.\n\n                                     CLARK\n                         What you got in mind, MacReady?\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         A little test.\n\n                                     PALMER\n                         What kind of test?\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         I'm sure a lot of you already know.\n\n               He tosses a ream of steel cable and some rope to Palmer.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone \n                         down.

Every piece \n                         of you is self-sufficient, an animal \n                         unto itself. When a man bleeds it's \n                         just tissue. But blood from one of \n                         you Things won't obey. It's a newly \n                         formed individual with a built-in \n                         desire to protect its own life. When \n                         attacked, your blood will try and \n                         survive -- and crawl away from a hot \n                         needle say.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SANCHEZ\n\n               grimacing as Dr. Copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and \n               collects a small portion of his blood in a dish.\n\n               All the men have been tied up. Palmer, Childs and Garry on \n               the small couch. The others, including the lifeless corpse \n               of Clark, in chairs.\n\n               Copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in \n               line with the other plates of blood that he has collected.\n\n               The names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates.\n\n               MacReady slides the Doctor a fresh plate.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Now you.\n\n               Copper cuts his thumb, his blood dribbles onto the plate.\n\n               He stands nervously for a beat.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Slide it back here.\n\n               Copper pushes it toward MacReady.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Now step way back.\n\n               Copper steps backward, moisture beginning to collect on his \n               brow. MacReady begins to heat the copper wire over the Bunsen \n               burner.\n\n               The men watch intently. The wire begins to glow. MacReady \n               points the torch directly at the Doctor. Both of them \n               perspiring. MacReady lifts the glowing wire from the flame. \n               The Doctor is dead still. MacReady slowly touches the wire \n               to the Doctor's plate. A soft hiss.\n\n               MacReady heats it again and tries once more. The same soft \n               hiss. MacReady and the Doctor both let out a sigh.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         I guess you're okay.\n\n                                     DR.

The same harmless \n               hissing. All eyes continue to watch as he tries again. The \n               same result. Childs mumbles.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Load of bullshit.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         We'll see.

The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate.\n\n               Palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for \n               MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging \n               the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady \n               knocking him over the table.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Copper!!\n\n               It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst \n               of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps \n               on the Doctor.\n\n               The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings.\n\n               MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to \n               the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously \n               at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him \n               skidding across the floor.\n\n               Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he \n               positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his \n               forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head.\n\n               The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his \n               feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body \n               of Dr. Copper.\n\n               The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire \n               up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work.\n\n               Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering \n               the thick steel instrument over his head.\n\n               The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face.\n\n               Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet \n               another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges \n               outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for \n               the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite.\n\n               MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the \n               table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the \n               Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on \n               balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, \n               spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.\n\n               MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. \n               Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the \n               ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering \n               Childs and Garry with his body.\n\n               A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep \n               within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the \n               room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as \n               he can.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               MACREADY\n\n               perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares \n               to continue the test. He heats the wire.\n\n               The men are pouring sweat, white-knuckled.\n\n               One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes \n               his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. \n               Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes.\n\n               MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays \n               glued to the others.\n\n               MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have \n               torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears.\n\n               The wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss.\n\n               Sanchez breaks down and sobs.\n\n               CHILDS\n\n               sits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Let's do it, Bwana.\n\n               Nauls and Sanchez take aim five yards away. Fierce, \n               determined. The wire comes off the flame into the plate... \n               the harmless hissing.\n\n               The muscles in Childs' face melt into a sigh.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Muthafu...\n\n               ALL EYES\n\n               snap towards station manager Garry. Childs, suddenly realizing \n               who he is sitting next to, squirms.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Get me... get me the hell away from... \n                         cut me loose, damn it!\n\n               Nauls rips away his bindings. The other two stand guard.\n\n               Childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor.\n\n               GARRY\n\n               stares grimly ahead. Childs soaks his clothing with a can of \n               gasoline. He is then surrounded. The room tenses, adrenalin \n               pumps, breathing halts.\n\n               The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face.\n\n               Hisssss.\n\n               MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches \n               are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor.\n\n               Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his \n               face.\n\n               A long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief.\n\n                                     GARRY\n                         I know you gentlemen have been through \n                         a lot. But when you find the time... \n                         I'd rather not spend the rest of the \n                         winter tied to this couch.\n\n               A beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's \n               jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at \n               Childs' uncontrollable laughter.\n\n               The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he \n               looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic \n               wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at \n               Childs.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Shut the damn hell up.\n\n               Childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His \n               smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes \n               stale, in sudden realization.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                              (almost a whisper)\n                         Blair...\n\n               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT\n\n               The wind rumbles. The storm is at its peak. MacReady, Childs \n               and Nauls, guided by their flares, pull themselves along the \n               steadying rope, headed, for Blair's shack.\n\n               BLAIR'S SHACK\n\n               The door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to \n               balance against the wind. They enter.\n\n               INT. BLAIR'S SHACK\n\n               Empty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them \n               up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. \n               Something is down there. They pull up more boards.\n\n               The hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the \n               same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up \n               by some strange metallic object.\n\n               Crudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined.\n\n               Sheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and \n               welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be \n               unfinished.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Everything that's been missing.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Spaceship of some kind.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Smart S.O.B.

The men \n               jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. \n               He tosses it in.\n\n               EXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE\n\n               The explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their \n               heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness.\n\n               Some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, \n               severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the \n               ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out \n               of sight.\n\n               MacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull \n               feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound.\n\n               The screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his \n               grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building.\n\n               He crawls along looking for an opening.\n\n               Nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel.\n\n               He climbs down through the open stairwell.\n\n               INT. PLANT ROOM\n\n               MacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, \n               landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the \n               glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the \n               door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. \n               MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob.\n\n               He finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and \n               locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, \n               back and forth.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY\n\n               MacReady charges up the stairs from the plant room. He zooms \n               down the twisting corridors, opening and closing doors. He \n               rounds a bend and crashes into Nauls coming the other way.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. REC ROOM - CLOSE ON SANCHEZ\n\n               pouring gasoline into empty bottles, preparing Molotov \n               cocktails.\n\n               Garry is connecting an electrical device: wires attached to \n               two portable generators. MacReady appears to be injecting \n               something into empty contact capsules. The men work \n               feverishly.\n\n               Nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         What about Childs?\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Forget about Childs. He's over.\n\n               Nauls begins cutting the wicks off the dynamite.\n\n                                     GARRY\n                         Make 'em short. They'll go off quicker \n                         if we need to use them.\n\n               The wind belts into the roofing overhead. Garry sets the \n               wiring to the main doorway. MacReady begins blocking off one \n               of the other entrances with a large computer.\n\n                                     SANCHEZ\n                         What if it doesn't come?\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         It'll come.

REC ROOM\n\n               MacReady rips linen, soaks the strips in gas, and stuffs \n               them in the Molotov bottles. Garry tests the current on the \n               door.

REC ROOM\n\n               The same loud music. MacReady and Garry look to the three \n               speakers attached to the walls. MacReady yells his \n               incomprehension to Garry. Garry tries to respond. Their voices \n               drowned out.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY\n\n               Empty.

It saws downward, quickly.\n\n               Black goo drips through the slit. The sawing obscured by the \n               music.\n\n               Sanchez, eyes bulging, points. Nauls turns. A claw rips \n               through the wood. Nauls dives to the floor.\n\n               In the opposite direction, behind Sanchez, another arm splits \n               through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five \n               feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet.\n\n               Sanchez struggles, looking imploringly at Nauls. He bites \n               down on his capsule. Nauls takes off like a speed skater.\n\n               INT. REC ROOM\n\n               The sound of the screeching over the music.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Got to get to the generator.\n\n               He opens the door. Looks down the hall. No one. The speakers -- \n               blaring music.\n\n               NAULS\n\n               full speed down the maze. Left. Right. Totally reckless. He \n               hits a straightaway.\n\n               SANCHEZ'S BODY\n\n               from out of nowhere, blasts through the hallway wall, directly \n               in Nauls' path. A thick arm pins the body to the other side. \n               Unable to stop, Nauls skids out of control, banging into the \n               sides of the wall, his cyanide capsule flying out of his \n               mouth.\n\n               Whatever the rest of it is, it starts to crumble through the \n               wall. Nauls dives over the arm, somersaults to his feet and \n               takes off.\n\n               INT. MAIN HALL\n\n               MacReady, running, spots Nauls careening out of a turn, \n               heading toward him.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Get back!!\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         The generator!\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Screw the generator!!\n\n               Nauls blazes by him. MacReady hears the snarls and screeches \n               heading his way. He streaks after Nauls.\n\n               INT. REC ROOM\n\n               They make it in. Lock the door... MacReady tries to catch \n               his breath. Nauls shakes, pants.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Got Sanchez... World War Three \n                         wouldn't mess with this fucker...  \n                         Can go through walls... And it's \n                         like all over the place...\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Calm down and get in your position.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Position, my ass...\n\n               Garry fiddles with the two generators.\n\n                                     GARRY\n                         I'm going to bump this up, much as I \n                         can.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Boulder Dam might do it.\n\n               The loud music in the compound is turned off. MacReady shuts \n               off the lights. The men spread out. Silence.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. REC ROOM\n\n               The men watch all the doors. Dead silence. Dark. Whispers.\n\n                                     GARRY\n                         How long's it been?\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Little over two hours.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Maybe it ain't coming.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Then we go after him.\n\n                                     NAULS\n                         Bet the last place you ever go.\n\n               The sound of a door opening and closing. Far off.\n\n               Another creaking door is opened. A rustling. Still far off. \n               MacReady and Nauls spread further apart.\n\n               The soft bubbling, cooling sound. A slight scratch at the \n               door. Garry's hand tightens around the generator switches. \n               The scratching gets more pronounced. MacReady cautions Garry \n               with a whisper.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Wait...\n\n               The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady \n               light two cocktails each.\n\n               The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling \n               quivers. The gas bombs are cocked.\n\n               From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst.\n\n               Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. \n               Nauls the same.\n\n               For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous.\n\n               Grotesque.\n\n               Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals \n               from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its \n               body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door.\n\n               Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still \n               another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the \n               switch.\n\n               The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly.\n\n               One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends \n               it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its \n               latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it \n               loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening.\n\n               MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. COMPOUND - HALL\n\n               The distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, \n               his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another \n               sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. \n               But closing.\n\n               The terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain.\n\n               He reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The \n               gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about \n               himself, frantically.\n\n               The Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, \n               rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his \n               fingers as he tries to break it off the siding.\n\n               A strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally \n               unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one \n               side of his throat and rips...\n\n               INT. LAB WALL\n\n               The motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The \n               tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper \n               tearing half the room to shreds.\n\n               MacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks \n               stark raving mad.\n\n               His frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war \n               paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, \n               like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks \n               have been tied together at the top and are draped around his \n               neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN.\n\n               They are used for the weather balloons.\n\n               He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his \n               mouth, grins and bellows.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be \n                         on your toes! We're going to do a \n                         little remodeling!\n\n               MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. \n               Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the \n               prefabricated walls buckling under its force.\n\n               INT. COMPOUND\n\n               A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend.\n\n               Boom.\n\n               MacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, \n               chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. \n               All the while he keeps his eyes on everything.\n\n               Through the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings \n               on.\n\n               NARROW PASSAGEWAY\n\n               Gurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner \n               in retreat.\n\n                                     MACREADY (O.S.)\n                         Chime in if you know that words, old \n                         boy.\n\n               MACREADY\n\n               plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub \n               area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from \n               the bar.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         You like whiskey? Come on, join me \n                         for a drink. Be good for you. Grow \n                         fangs on your chest.\n\n               He takes a drink and rams through another wall.\n\n               INT. REC ROOM\n\n               The tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it \n               directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The \n               Thing when it surprised them earlier.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Damn it, ran out of gas.\n\n               He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over \n               the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing \n               from roof, to doorways, to rubble.\n\n               Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging \n               MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened \n               fingers.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty \n                         cold in here soon... You better make \n                         your move... I mean, hell, I'm only \n                         one person...\n\n               He takes a swig from his bottle.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         I know you're bugged because we ruined \n                         your trip, right? Spiffy little toy \n                         you had there.\n\n               A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through \n               the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in \n               his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         But your real hang up is your looks...\n\n               A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                              (wants him bad)\n                         Atta boy. I know you're around.\n\n               The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around \n               the room.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Come on, sucker.\n\n               The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward \n               and looks straight down through the chassis and into the \n               vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting \n               the steering wheel but missing his face.\n\n               He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet.\n\n               He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. \n               The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of \n               the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls \n               himself through.\n\n               EXT. ROOF\n\n               He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs.\n\n               Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up \n               through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs \n               outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like \n               acid into the fabric.\n\n               An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball \n               fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating \n               almost immediately.\n\n               The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and \n               the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He \n               rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off \n               the insidious limb.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. CAMP\n\n               A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground.\n\n               MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, \n               from his shoulders to the floor.\n\n               He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches \n               of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. PUB AREA\n\n               Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of \n               the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled \n               considerably.\n\n               CLOSE ON MACREADY\n\n               lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours \n               himself a drink.\n\n               A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame \n               and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs.\n\n               White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Did you kill it?\n\n               He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         I think so.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         What do you mean \"you think so?\"\n\n               Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Yeah. I got it.\n                              (refers to Childs' \n                              condition)\n                         Pretty mean frostbite.\n\n               Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his \n               puffy white hand.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         It'll turn black again soon enough. \n                         Then I guess I'll be losing the whole \n                         thing...\n                              (refers to feet)\n                         ...Think my toes are already gone.\n\n               MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits \n               down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several \n               decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         So you're the only one who made it.\n\n               MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Not the only one.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         The fire's got the temperature way \n                         up all over camp... won't last long \n                         though.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Neither will we.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Maybe we should try and fix the \n                         radio... try and get some help.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Maybe we shouldn't.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         Then we'll never make it.\n\n               MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch \n               from under the table and places it beside him on top.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         Maybe we shouldn't make it.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                              (beat)\n                         If you're worried about anything, \n                         let's take that blood test of yours.\n\n                                     MACREADY\n                         If we've got any surprises for each \n                         other -- we shouldn't be in any \n                         condition to do anything about it.\n                              (beat)\n                         You play chess?\n\n               They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits \n               down across from MacReady.\n\n                                     CHILDS\n                         I guess I'll be learning.\n\n               MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs. Childs smiles \n               back and takes a healthy swig.\n\n               EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT\n\n               The fires smolder on. Bright embers dance in the blackness -- \n               pushed by the soughing wind.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nThing, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John W.
