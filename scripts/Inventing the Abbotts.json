Doug scrambles up from under\n     the table with the pencil dangling from his chin,\n     knocking over his chair in the process.

He's ill-at-ease. His conversation\n     with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the\n     gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see\n     things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a\n     group of men in tuxedos...

Doug steers Pam around the dance floor\n     to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott.\n     Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting.

Their\n     chance meeting has not gone unobserved:\n\n     Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of\n     Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair\n     her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips\n     behind the wheel.\n\n     And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door\n     so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in\n     the back seat).

As she\n      moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees\n      Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her\n      from the sidewalk. Doug writes a message on the plate\n      glass window with his index finger (printing the letters\n      in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's\n      POV); his message reads: \"I love you.\"\n<b>\n</b>        INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                     116.\n\n<b>177   EXT.
