MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY\n</b>\nThe Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns\nand ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The\nsheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the\nabsence of man.  On the screen superimpose:\n\n<b>                    MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.\n</b>\n<b>CREDITS BEGIN.\n</b>\nA plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK,\norange and white and violet, with \"FedEx\" blazoned across the\nside.\n\nThe truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II\nera Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings\nare large sculptures of wood and metal.\n\n<b>EXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY\n</b>\nThe door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair\npulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx\nBOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.\nThe Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer\ndangles from his belt.\n\nThe Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,\nprints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.\nBut something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back.\nHe glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings,\nuniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands\nhim a cup of coffee.  They've done this before.\n\nHe takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He\njumps in and heads back onto the plains.\n\n<b>EXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER\n</b>\nThe Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a\ndolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.\nA female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the\ncontainer, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt\nof rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck\nclose.  The latch slams down.\n\nA forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.\n\n<b>EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe 737 lands.\n\n<b>EXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nOne of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737\ntaxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast\nliving organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a\nsymbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times.\n\nFive thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected\nactivity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of\nforklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights\ncrisscrossing like a laser show.\n\nLoaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.\n\n<b>INT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING\nBELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of\npackages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and\nsizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical\narms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of\nstations.  The packages surge and move.\n\nThe Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,\nwhere they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our\nBox is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.\n\nThe Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.\n\n<b>EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT\n</b>\nA forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11.\n\n<b>INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nA jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE\nWALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator\nmoves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board.\n\n<b>EXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY\n</b>\n<b>SERIES OF SHOTS\n</b>\nThe giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box\nmoves quickly on another belt and disappears into another\nCONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE.\n\n<b>EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We\nsee our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.\n\n<b>INT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA\n</b>\n<b>SERIES OF SHOTS\n</b>\nNight.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two\nBoxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small\nChristmas tree.\n\nDaylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up\nthe Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down.\n\nNight again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes\nhave come to rest.\n\n<b>EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nA FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the\nwarehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy,\nthe buildings blanketed in snow.\n\n<b>EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY\n</b>\nThe Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last\nsip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward\nan APARTMENT HOUSE.\n\n<b>EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nA beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young\nAMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes\nthe Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The\nwoman puts her arms around him as the door closes.\n\n<b>                     RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)\n</b>               (accented English)\n          It's pretty.  Who is it from?\n\n<b>                     AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)\n</b>          My wife.\n\nWe stay with the Driver as he ambles back toward the truck.\n\n<b>EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nThe Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI,\nRussian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era\nbuilding.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone.\n\n<b>EXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY\n</b>\nCHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly\ncolored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a\nFilipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck\nglistens with a thin layer of sweat.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          My guess is we're talking fuel filters\n          here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these\n          jitneys get in the mountains, their\n          engines cut out.\n\n<b>                     FERNANDO\n</b>          That could lose us half an hour.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Easy.  Each way.\n\nHis beeper goes off.\n\n<b>INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck is on the phone.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          So it finally turned up...\n\nChuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I'll catch the sweep tonight.\n\n<b>INT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT\n</b>\nStrapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps\nwith a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel\nbrochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys.\n\n<b>EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY\n</b>\nChristmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored\nlights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a\nbag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.\n\n<b>INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY\n</b>\nThe staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the\nstation manager stands in front, occasionally catching the\neye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          It took this test package thirty-two\n          hours to get from Seattle to St.\n          Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand\n          miles.  And then it took forty-one hours\n          to get from our warehouse in St.\n          Petersburg to here, a distance of,\n          what --\n\n<b>                     ALEKSEI\n</b>          Six kilometers.  Four miles.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          So how are we going to get this place\n          shaped up?\n\nThere's a muttered chorus of answers.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          There's only one way.  We have to work\n          together.  Every one of us depends on\n          everyone else.  If one package is late,\n          we are all late.  If one truck misses the\n          deadline, we all miss the deadline.\n          Let's start by taking a look around.\n\nChuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes\nright next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.\nChuck stops.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Here, this table is too far from the\n          wall.  Packages can slip down...like...\n               (pulls out a package from\n                behind a table)\n          ...this.\n\nHe hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          What could be in here?  Let's say one of\n          you sent it.  Could be the closing papers\n          on your dacha, could be a toy for your\n          grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to\n          keep your mother alive.  I don't think\n          you want your mother's kidney to end up\n          behind a table.\n\nThe Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says\nsomething to the Translator.\n\n<b>                     TRANSLATOR\n</b>          He says they have been very busy.  It is\n          hard to get good employees.  He is sure\n          you understand.\n\nWrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei\nappears with a cellular phone.\n\n<b>                     ALEKSEI\n</b>          Phone call.  Malaysia.\n\nChuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them.\n\nHe pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin\nboard as he talks.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L.\n          right now.  The belts are too small for\n          the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never\n          see what's right in front of your face.\n          Look, it's --\n\nChuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.\nThen he notices something over by one of the trucks.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>               (to a loader)\n          Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its\n          own container!\n               (back on the phone)\n          -- three in the afternoon there, right?\n          That gives you five hours until the sweep\n          comes through.  Do the sort by hand\n          tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,\n          say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime\n          is authorized.\n\nHe hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I'm going out on every route, I'm going\n          to work every job here, until I know\n          enough to help you.  That's it.\n\nThe crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk\ntoward the office.  They've done this before.  Chuck lets a\ncorner of his command persona slip.\n\n<b>                     ALEKSEI\n</b>          It's bad.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Worse than Warsaw.\n\n<b>                     ALEKSEI\n</b>          Nobody remembers that.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          The failures they remember.  It's the\n          successes they forget.\n\n<b>EXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nA FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is\ninside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls.\n\n<b>INT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The\nTranslator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep\nhis balance.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You sorted your packages before you left.\n          None of the other drivers did.\n\nThe Translator and Lev exchange a few words.\n\n<b>                     TRANSLATOR\n</b>          He says he wants to be organized.  Do\n          packages in order.\n\nChuck looks at Lev with respect.  Right answer.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          So how come the other drivers haven't\n          left yet?\n\nThe Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,\nthen snorts an answer.  The Translator blushes.\n\n<b>                     TRANSLATOR\n</b>          He says -- he is a very rude fellow --\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Tell me exactly what he said.\n\n<b>                     TRANSLATOR\n</b>          He says why don't his farts smell sweet?\n\nChuck grins.  Lev shrugs and says something else.\n\n<b>                     TRANSLATOR\n</b>          He says that's just the way it is.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is\n          FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way\n          it is.\n\n<b>EXT.  HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG\n</b>\nA weary Chuck enters the hotel.  In the sky above him we see\nthe Northern Lights.  He doesn't even look up.\n\n<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER\n</b>\nChuck is watching CNN on the television, working his\nPowerBook, and holding the phone.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to\n          open up.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>               (to himself)\n          Those damn Northern Lights.\n\nJust then the lights go off.  For a moment everything is\ndarkness.  Then a small light switches on.  Chuck has a\nheadlamp on.\n\nHe gets up, heads into the bathroom.  We stay in the bedroom.\nAfter only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to\nhis bag.  We go with it.\n\nChuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared\nfor anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.\n\nThe lights come back on just as the phone rings.\n\nWe hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.\nChuck charges out, holding up his pants.\n\nGrabs the phone.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Hello?  Great.  Try it.\n\nHe waits.  We hear an ANSWERING MACHINE.\n\n<b>                     KELLY (V.O.)\n</b>          This is Kelly, leave me a message and\n          I'll call you back soon as I can.\n\nThis is not what Chuck wanted to hear.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm\n          going to be a little late.  Well, more\n          than a little.  I had to go to Russia.\n          Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and\n          cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the\n          Keys in March.  It's better then anyway.\n          I'll be back before Christmas.  I\n          promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I,\n          uh --\n\nHe's stumbling over whether to say I love you.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I miss you.\n\nHe gently hangs up the phone.\n\n<b>INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST. PETERSBURG - SERIES OF SHOTS\n</b>\nA surprised Yuri stands with the attractive assistant as\nChuck takes his clipboard away.\n\nAn even more surprised Lev stands by his truck as Chuck hands\nthe clipboard to him.\n\nChuck and the loaders clean off the graffiti.\n\nWorking alongside the sorters as the packages come in, Chuck\npoints out how to organize the inflow.\n\nChuck and Lev go over large maps of St. Petersburg with the\ndrivers.\n\n<b>INT.  FEDEX WAREHOUSE - ST. PETERSBURG - WEEK LATER\n</b>\nA big semi is being loaded with outgoing packages for the\nairport run.  Aleksei, Chuck, Lev and the office executives\nwatch as containers are rolled on.\n\n<b>                     LEV\n</b>          We've never got all the trucks in on\n          time.

He's hands on.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Let's go.\n\nHe heads toward the truck and begins pulling off packages.\nAll the other executives follow him.\n\n<b>INT.

Bermuda is in the\n          Memphis thru container.  No, Azores is\n          Europe.\n\nHe gestures at a closed container.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          The Paris container.  Africa too.  Japan\n          goes to Memphis.\n\nChuck is everywhere, setting the example.  The whole office\nis energized, working together.\n\n<b>INT.  FEDEX OFFICES - ST.

John motions frantically\nfor Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.\nChuck fumbles for them.\n\nHuge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging\nviolently against the side of the plane, spilling out its\nboxes.

PACIFIC - NIGHT\n</b>\nWe catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the\nstorm continues.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\nThe storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a\nscallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered\nFEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a\nMAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket.\n\nChuck.\n\nThe tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes.\nSlowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves.\nHe rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am\nI?  What happened?\n\nChuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his\nwatch, taps it in frustration.\n\nThen he looks around, and we look with him.\n\n<b>CHUCK'S POV - BEACH\n</b>\nThe fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove\nthickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing\nup a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point\nend in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill.\n\n<b>ON CHUCK\n</b>\nas he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's\nthirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We\nstay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in\nthe sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther.\nHe picks up another package.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - WIDE\n</b>\nChuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages,\nleaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we\nnotice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING\n</b>\nChuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm\ntrees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing\ndrawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack.\n\nChuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade,\nmakes himself comfortable, and waits.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET\n</b>\nChuck is still waiting.  He's a systems man, and the system\nisn't working.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the\n          GPS, get moving.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees\ncast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone.\n\nWe HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in\nthe leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a\nwave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He\nlurches to his feet.\n\nWe HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at\nthe barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he\nbends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon.\n\nIn the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up\nin his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands\nfacing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over\nthe moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MORNING\n</b>\nThe morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps\namidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The\nempty sea.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Where the fuck are you?\n\nBut now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the\nbeach.\n\nBeneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one\nof them up and studies it.  It's heavy, almost the size of a\nvolleyball.  How to get in it?\n\nHe throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off.\nHe wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock\ndown on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock.\nIt smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock.\nOW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts\nhim.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Sonofabitch.\n\nThe blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his\nfinger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man\nfirst got when he discovered stone tools.\n\nHe picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp.\nHe throws another rock down, but it doesn't break.  He picks\nup another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again,\nharder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is\neven sharper.\n\nHe has a knife.\n\n<b>OPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS\n</b>\nChuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck.\n\nChuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.\n\nChuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,\nbut the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away.\n\nChuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then\nSLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut\nof the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He\nsmashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand!\nChuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more\nsaliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens.\nCoconut milk splashes everywhere.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          That was smart, really smart.\n\nRotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his\nfingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell\nsplits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a\nswallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white\nliquid dribbles down his face.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Ahhh.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE\n</b>\nChuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips\nare cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him.\nNo one's there -- again.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean\n          airliner did.\n\nClouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves\nare high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the\nreef.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where\n          you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a\n          circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.\n          So, uh, 250,000 times three point one\n          four, that's about 800,000 square miles.\n          Three times the size of Texas.\n\nThis sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          They could use a satellite.\n\nBut even that doesn't give him much hope.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Say each satellite photo is 30 feet\n          square, that's uh...fuck it...billions\n          and billions of photos.\n\nThat sinks in.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Aw, someone will come.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck\nstirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve\nhimself.\n\nHe stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not\nso idly.  Something's out there, something floating on the\ntide.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          What the hell?\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object.\n\nIt's a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It's Al, one of the\npilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Oh Jesus.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses,\nexhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MORNING   \n</b>\nChuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the\npalm trees.  He's been digging with a piece of driftwood\nsharpened with his stone knife.\n\nHe drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That\ncould be me.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Got to cover Al up.\n\nHe wants to say more, can't.  He scoops some sand over the\nbody.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Got to cover Al up.\n\nHe scoops in some more sand.  It's eerily like burying the\ntropical fish in his back yard.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nWith a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the\nsand.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\n</b>\nAs Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks \"Yellow\nSubmarine\" very quietly to himself.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow\n          submarine...\n\nHe looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.\nComes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up\nhis club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.\nHe's ready to go.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight.\nHe's still half-singing to himself.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Yellow submarine.  We all live in a\n          yellow submarine...\n\n<b>EXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck's way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates.\nHe picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad\nthings.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes\na step into the jungle.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nChuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle\ncanopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is\nno path, nothing to show him where to go.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER\n</b>\nChuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a\ndrink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Bad idea.  Should have saved some.\n\nHe throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight\nreaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.\n\n<b>EXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs\nacross a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low\nferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep\ngullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava.\n\nThe lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He\npasses a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious\nand scary.  He gives them a wide berth.\n\n<b>EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nThe land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high\ncliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the\npath smoothes out to a summit.\n\nChuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves\nbreaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will\nhave to cross the bridge.  He's thirsty.  The late afternoon\nsun is hot.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did\n          you enjoy the play?\n\nHugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great\ncaution, he sets out across the bridge.\n\n<b>EXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF\n</b>\nStep by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches\na flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a\nslide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above\nthe waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can't quite, tries\none foot first, then the other.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Shit!\n\nHe looks back, but that seems even scarier.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon...\n          c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold.\n\nHe looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and\njumps.  It's only a few feet, but he's breathing hard when he\nlands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his\nbreath.\n\n<b>EXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an\nISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or\nanything human.  On three sides the waves break against\nsteep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he\ncame from.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No way on.  No way off.\n\nChuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          This is bad.  Really, really bad.\n\nThe last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep\nreddish gold.\n\n<b>EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nGoing down is even scarier.  It's dusk and the light is flat\nand gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Come on.  Crawl if you have to.\n\nChuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and\nprimal.\n\n<b>EXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt's getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the\ndark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nThe moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the\njungle.  The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real\nbranches and vines tug at him.  He heads into thick\nblackness.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER\n</b>\nChuck emerges around the rocks.  He reaches the stack of\nfamiliar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!  He's breathing hard, from\nboth fear and exertion.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Got to drink.  Got to drink something.\n\nWith his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.  He\nbangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.  He stares\nat the stack of FedEx boxes.  What could be inside?  He\nreaches out and touches one.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          They don't belong to you.\n\nResponsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his\nhand away.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MORNING\n</b>\nFace red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his\nstone knife.  He saws the palm frond off near the base,\nleaving it about a foot long.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat.\n\nHe ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it\nupon his head.  It looks amazingly like some sort of\nprimitive cap.\n\nHe grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nChuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out\nwith the FedEx boxes on the beach.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nChuck scrambles down a ravine.  He kneels down and feels the\nground.  It is dry, completely dry.\n\n<b>EXT.  LAVA SLOPE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck traverses the slope, determined to find water.\n\n<b>A FLAT ROCK - LATER\n</b>\nWith a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow.\nSuddenly Chuck flops down into frame.  He tries to scoop up\nsome water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.  He\nlicks his fingers.  Then he gets down on his stomach and laps\nup the water with his tongue.  Like an animal.\n\nIn the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.  He\nrubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Oh, God.  Thank you.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck is drenched in sweat.  He is at the bottom of a hole\nsix feet deep.  He takes one last dig with the flat stick,\nthen licks the moist clay that sticks to it.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nChuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky\nliquid.  With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of\nthe meat, but it's dry and chewy and fibrous.  He spits it\nout, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first\nstars.  Half sings to himself.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You deserve a break today...\n\nHe is desperately thirsty.  Hunger gnaws at him.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nHolding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low\ntide, looking for fish.  It's difficult to keep his balance.\nSuddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning\nsunlight.  Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the\nwater and floats away.\n\nChuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare\nhands.  The fish reverses direction.  Chuck leaps after it\nand goes under.  He comes up spluttering, on his hands and\nknees in the shallows.\n\nSuddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in\nunison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like\nmercury.  He grabs at them desperately.  Nothing.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Damn fish!\n\nOn some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.  He takes a rock\nand tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nDiscouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath.\n\nIdly, Chuck takes out his wallet.  The money is soaked.  He\nlays it out to dry.  He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked\nand mushy.\n\nHe tries to smooth it out.  For a moment he is overcome.  His\nface tightens, his eyes get moist.  He stares out to sea.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute.\n\nHe picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.\n\n<b>EXT.

He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Don't leave home without it.\n\nWith his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,\nthen tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide\noff the shell into his mouth.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Yuck.\n\nHe starts to spit it out.  Tries to make himself like it.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Yumm.\n\nAnd he swallow it.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET\n</b>\nChuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile\nof smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.  He\nchecks his watch for a moment.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Got to get this fixed.\n\nBut what's the point?  Everything that was so valuable before\nis useless now.\n\n<b>EXT.

Slowly water\nis oozing out of the clay, a puddle is building around his\ntoes.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nChuck's eyes snap awake.  He looks down at his feet.  There's\na pool of muddy water there.  He dips his hand in it, touches\na finger to his lips to be sure he's not dreaming.\n\nHe grabs his sharpened stone, begins to attack the clay.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.\n\n<b>EXT.

Very\nChuck.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Let's see, I waited two days.\n               (makes marks)\n          Then I buried Al.\n               (slowly makes another mark)\n          Al.

Shit.\n\nFor a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation.  Then he\nallows himself a deep breath.  There is order now, after all.\nTime is under control.\n\n<b>EXT.  CLIFF - DAY\n</b>\nVery carefully, but standing this time, Chuck makes his way\nacross the ledge.\n\n<b>EXT.

A shape scuttles raggedly\nbeneath him.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          A crab, it's a crab.\n\nHe freezes, holding his spear motionless.  Then he jabs at\nthe crab -- misses!  The crab scurries away toward the rocks.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Dammit!\n\nChuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,\ngetting up, stabbing again.\n\nSuddenly one stab feels different.  Chuck carefully lifts up\nthe spear.  On the end is a squirming crab.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I did it.  I did it!\n\nHe walks carefully with it to the beach.  Lowering the spear,\nhe lets the crab slip off.  It darts toward the water.  Chuck\nheads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.\n\nHe kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on\nit.  He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white\nmeat.  But a crab has an exoskeleton.  The flesh simply pours\nout, like mucous.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Jesus.\n\nThis is too much.  He needs the next step, from the raw to\nthe cooked.  The crucial next step from primitive man to the\nbeginnings of civilization.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE\n</b>\nChuck rubs two sticks together.  Nothing.\n\nChuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped\nout in a piece of driftwood.  He spins the drill with great\neffort.  Nothing.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Stupid fucking thing!\n\nHe quits, exhausted.  He looks at his hands.  They are raw\nand blistered.  He feels like Job.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I don't know what I did, God, but\n          whatever is was, I am really, really\n          sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nChuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the\nocean.

PALM GROVE - DAY\n</b>\nWith his stone knife and spear to help him.  Chuck begins to\nopen the FedEx boxes.  Chuck rips open the end of one box and\nshakes it.  Out tumble some videotapes.  Chuck looks at them:\nwhat good are they?\n\nChuck tears another box open.  Out slide some legal papers\ncovered with Post-its.\n\nIn quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,\nsome designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a\nscript with a red cover -- which he never reads.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nBy now he has taken all the boxes in the P.  Only H E L\nremains.  He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then\ncollects more boxes.  He is even more exhausted.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE\n</b>\nTwo boxes remain.  One is the box with Angel Wings.  Chuck\nsets it aside.  He opens the other box.  Out tumbles a\nDOCTOR'S BAG.  Chuck can't believe it.  He opens the bag.\nIt's full of great stuff.  Medicine.  A scalpel.  A saw.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Okay.  Okay now.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER\n</b>\nHands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller\nblade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing.\n\nHe takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His\ntooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the\nsurgeon's bag and takes two.\n\n<b>EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY\n</b>\nChuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.  They're\nnot bad.  He eats more.  Then more.  What a relief.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his\nstomach.  He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet,\nand throws up in great, violent heaves.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nStill looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his\ntree calendar.\n\n<b>EXT.  SUMMIT\n</b>\nHe stares out to sea.  Nothing.\n\n<b>EXT.  WELL - DAY\n</b>\nChuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has\nfilled with water.  Then he washes his face and splashes\nwater over his neck.  The surface of the well stills,\nbringing CHUCK'S REFLECTION into focus.  He stares at\nhimself.\n\nVery carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel.\n\nChuck checks out his new appearance in the water.  Much\nbetter.  A clean start now.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\n</b>\nHe sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to\n          hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nChuck carefully shaves some tinder.  Puts it under a piece of\nbamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nChuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the\nsplit half of the bamboo.  He saws back and forth with all\nhis might, pressing it down in the groove.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nChuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly\ndefeated.  It's all too much.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Sonofabitch!\n\nHe starts to rub again.  He breathes hard, sweat pours off\nhis face.  He is really going for it, what the hell!  A tiny\nwisp of smoke appears!  Chuck saws with even more energy.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Come on.  Come on.\n\nThe smoke increases.  Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the\nnest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.  The smoke\nflickers and dies.  Chuck can't believe it.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No.  No.  No.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.  He looks up\nat the stars, which blaze furiously.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          That's the big dipper...Orion...or is\n          that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would\n          know.\n\nAnd he misses her so much.  A shower of meteors streaks\nacross the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on\nChuck.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nChuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins\nsawing with tremendous energy.  He smells something.  Is it\nsmoke?  He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of\ntinder.  There's nothing there.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Dammit!\n\nHe replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.\n\n<b>TIME CUT\n</b>\nThe sun has moved in the sky.  Chuck is still sawing.  Again\nthe smoke appears.  Again sweat pours from his face.  The\nsmoke increases.  He saws even harder.  His breath comes in\nanguished gulps.  Smoke is curling up now.  Chuck tears away\nthe bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it\ngently.  The smoke increases.\n\nHe blows some more.  A fragile crimson spark appears.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Careful now, careful...\n\nHe gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then\nblows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life\nitself.  He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny\nflame.\n\nSuddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the\nkindling.  Desperate, Chuck grabs it.  Trying to shield it\nwith his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into\nthe sand, trying to make a windbreak.  They rustle and shake\nand blow over.\n\nThe wind blows harder.  Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to\nmake an eddy.  But the fire is out.  No words now, just a\nloud, primal groan of pure despair.\n\nAnd then, into his vision floats...smoke.\n\nChuck looks down.  A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of\ntinder!  Chuck blows on it gently.  Suddenly a tiny tongue of\nflame flickers and catches on the kindling!\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Yes!  Yes!  Yes!\n\nHe feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.  The flames lick\nout, catch, grow.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I\n          am sure I did, thank you now.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe fire burns on the beach.  Chuck rushes about, piling on\ndriftwood.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - CLOSER\n</b>\nChuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log.\nHe throws it on the fire.  We see his face in the light of\nthe fire.  He is exultant.  He dances.  He sings at the top\nof his lungs.  Papa-ooo-mow-mow!\n\nChuck throws another huge log on the fire.  Papa-papa-papa-\noooo!  The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge\nshower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the\ndarkness...until they merge with the stars.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING\n</b>\nChuck makes a mark on the tree.  Around it he carves a flame\n-- the day he mastered fire.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING\n</b>\nChuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.  Then he\nsticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it,\nscrapes some more.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nChuck wades in the water with his spear.  Suddenly he stabs\nit down.  A crab is on the end.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER\n</b>\nChuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a\nsteaming crab claw.  Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white\nmeat.  Ahhh.  It tastes great.  He takes another bite -- and\nflinches.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Damn tooth!\n\nHe fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.\n\n<b>EXT.  SUMMIT - SUNSET\n</b>\nChuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions.  Then,\nsomething on the island brings Chuck's eyes back from their\ndistant focus on the horizon.  From down on the beach,\nbeneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke.\nChuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it.\nHe kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER\n</b>\nChuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.  The fire burns.\nAround it is a large stack of crab shells.  He stares into\nthe fire.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING\n</b>\nChuck makes another mark on the tree.  He has circled the\ntree with marks several times now.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nUsing a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes\ncarefully.  Suddenly he jerks his hand back.  On the end is a\nflopping fish.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some\nbreadfruit.  He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but\nhis tooth hurts even worse.  There are only a few Tylenol\ntablets left.  He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.\n\n<b>EXT.  SUMMIT - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nChuck arrives with the wood for the night.  He stares out to\nsea as usual, but this time he sees something different.\n\nWHALES.  He sees whales.  Leaping.  Broaching.  Spouting.\nWater pouring off fins and flukes.  Moving.  Going somewhere.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Beautiful.  So beautiful.\n\nChuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he\ncan see them no more.  It's late now.\n\nLeaving, he takes one last look, as he always does.  And\nanother remarkable sight greets his eyes.  There, on the\nhorizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT.  He\nstares at it, fixed.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          A star.  It's a star.\n\nBut then he stares at it really hard.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          It's a ship.\n\n<b>EXT.

He walks to\nanother tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS\n</b>\nUp above the high tide line, Chuck lashes a log to a row of\nfive logs already joined with vines.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No more waiting.  Take action.\n\nChuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and\nsuturing thread for a sail.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          That's right.  Take action.\n\nHe cuts bamboo for the mast.  He carves driftwood for an oar.\n\nHe fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as\nhe sings \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to himself.\n\nHe ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo\nboom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape.  He ties on\nthe doctor's kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.\n\nHe examines his handiwork:  a finished raft.\n\nHe brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then\ngrabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the\nbeach.  It doesn't budge.  He tries to pull it again.\nNothing.  He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.\nNothing.  He collapses on the beach, his breath coming in\nheaves.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          How could I be so stupid?\n\nHe bangs himself on the head, over and over.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Stupid, stupid, stupid.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire.  It comes\nback to life.  Meteors streak again across the sky.  He\nstares at the indifferent stars.  The moon is almost full.\nShadows of palm trees sway on the sand.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the\nreflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his\ntoes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck\nwatches, gets an idea.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nHe begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar\nand digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MORNING\n</b>\nThe rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks\nthe raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it\ntakes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it.\n\n<b>CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE\n</b>\nOver and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first\ntime he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything --\ndifferent rafts, different approaches, but each time the\nocean spits him back.\n\n<b>EXT.  LAGOON - DAY\n</b>\nDefeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his\nlatest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and\nthrows it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so\nhard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly\npossible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws\nit into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You're too low in the water.  Too damn\n          low.\n\nChuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep\nsobs of despair.\n\nAnd then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep\ninside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The\nScream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,\nthe rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.\nIt is powerful, disturbing, primal.\n\nThe breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to\nsway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves\ncrash louder.  The palm trees sway even more.\n\nChuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure\n          -- and unto dust shalt thou return.\n\nA few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and\nsizzling in the fire.\n\nChuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind\nblows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand\nChuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire.\n\nChuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the\nheavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen\nbefore.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching\nfor the fire.\n\nForget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out!\nThis is disaster!\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Shit!\n\nHe springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.\nWith his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out\nof the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides\nthe coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood\nand sets off on a run.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS - DAY\n</b>\nChuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines\ngrab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nChuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke\npours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn\nthrough!\n\n<b>EXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking\nbox.  His face is drenched, desperate.\n\n<b>EXT.  CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nChuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through\nthe FedEx box.\n\nUsing the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot\nthe coals into a dry spot.\n\nOne by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT.\n\nDripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few\ntogether with his fingers, ignoring the burns.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Please...please...please...\n\nHe stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.  He\nplaces this kindling on the coals.  They sputter and sizzle.\nBarely catch.  He fans them with the box.  A tiny flicker\ncatches, then starts to grow.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Firewood.  I need firewood.\n\n<b>SERIES OF SHOTS\n</b>\nOn the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the\ndriving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm,\nthe waves are licking at the palm grove.\n\nHe runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots\ntear at his feet, tripping him.\n\nHe stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely\nable to breathe, the rain is so strong.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - DAY\n</b>\nHe dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where\nthe fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black\nashes.\n\n<b>THE FIRE IS OUT.\n</b>\n<b>INT.

Everything he tried to build\nis gone.\n\n<b>EXT.  LEDGE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the\nwaves breaking on the jagged rocks far below.\n\nHe lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely\nbalanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him\nright off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the\nprecipice.\n\nSuddenly his foot slips!\n\nInstinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One\nhand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other\ncloses, his fingers straining to hold him.\n\nHe breathes in deep gasps.  He had wanted to end it, come so\nclose.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          What the fuck are you doing?\n\nHis deepest instinct was to survive.

BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nChuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of\nstarting over.  The beach is littered with seaweed and\nflotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.  He picks up a\nplastic bottle.  That will come in handy.\n\nThe Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with \"Wilson\" stamped on it in\nbig black letters.\n\nHe picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.  Then he\nkicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach,\ntrying to kick it and keep it out of the water.  Feeling joy\nagain, even here.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - THAT DAY\n</b>\nThe sun is setting on his darkened cave.  The soccer ball\nsits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once\nhis fire.\n\nChuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces\nas the meat hits his sore tooth.  He tosses the shell on a\nsmall new pile of shells.\n\nChuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.  He puts the\ntablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut\ncanteen.  When the water hits his tooth that hurts too.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - MORNING\n</b>\nChuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.  He tries to\npack the tooth with the mash, but it's so sensitive that even\nthis hurts.  He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - LATER\n</b>\nChuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.  He\npositions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.  But the\nthought of what he is about to do is too frightening.  He\nlowers the chisel.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Shit.  Shit.  Shit.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nChuck tries to fill his mouth with sea water.  The pain is so\ngreat his eyes water.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Whoo, pig.  Sooey!\n\nHe falls back in the water and floats there, looking up at\nthe sky.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - LATER\n</b>\nDetermined, Chuck hold the stone chisel again.  He raises it\nslowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No pain, no gain.\n\nHe brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!  The screen\ngoes BLACK as Chuck's SCREAM continues UNDER.\n\n<b>FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER\n</b>\nThe sky takes on the first colors of the day.  The ocean is\nstill dark, but a few waves catch the first light.  The\nsunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights\nthe cove.  On the screen superimpose:\n\n<b>                     \"1000 DAYS LATER\"\n</b>\n<b>REFLECTION - WATER\n</b>\nA spear shimmers in the calm morning water.  Attached to the\nspear is a man, standing completely still.\n\n<b>ON CHUCK\n</b>\nWe move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs\nare scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle.\nA stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt\nmade of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's\nteeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A\ncoconut frond hat is on his head.\n\nThe hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a\nberry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is\ngone.\n\nWe come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.  The eyes\nsay it all.  They stare out with a survivor's intensity,\nstaring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used\nto splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.\n\nThis is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of\nactivity and energy, surrounded by technology and human\nactivity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds\ncount.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.\n\nAnd now he has all the time in the world.\n\nSuddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the\nspear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the\nbottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end\nis a struggling fish.\n\nBut this isn't a thrill anymore.  It's another day at the\noffice.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\n</b>\nChuck makes a mark on a palm tree.  He has completely covered\nthree other trees with marks.  It sinks in how long he has\nbeen here.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - LATER\n</b>\nChuck carries the fish back from the beach.  Now there is a\nwell-worn trail.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON\n</b>\nChuck enters with the fish.  We are greeted with the well-\nordered lair of a primitive stone-age man.\n\nClam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole.\nStrips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks.\n\nTools are lined up neatly:  digging sticks, stone hammers and\nsaws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.  Bits\nand pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all\nneatly arranged.  Strings and cords hang from hooks.  Coconut\nbowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.  A raincoat and\nrain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame.\n\nEvocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.  A wind\nchime of obsidian flakes sways gently.  The watch hangs on a\nstick.\n\nThe Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.  On the\nother side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks.\nSeaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.  Clam shells\nhave been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.  A\ntube shell and conch form a pipe.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe fish are being smoke under a palm frond.  Eel skins hang\nfrom sticks, roasting.  Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a\nstone knife onto a wooden haft.\n\nHe ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string,\nusing both hands and his mouth for the three strands.\n\nHe ties the string tightly around the shaft.  He does his\nwork automatically.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT - LATER\n</b>\nChuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.  He chews\neach bite, his eyes in distant focus.  The firelight flickers\non his face.\n\n<b>EXT.  CLIFF - SUNRISE\n</b>\nChuck carries firewood up to the summit.  He mechanically\nadds wood to the fire.  As he does so, something out to sea\ncatches his eye.  He stops and stands up.\n\n<b>CHUCK'S POV - WHALES\n</b>\nWHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water\nshoot into the air.\n\n<b>ON CHUCK\n</b>\nAs he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He\ngrins.  There's a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns\nand strides down the hill.\n\n<b>EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nHe heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified\nhim, without losing stride.  It's second nature now.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out.\n\n<b>EXT.  SUMMIT - EVENING\n</b>\nThe signal fire burns.  A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up\nthe sky.  Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of\nmashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in\nanother.\n\nAs Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going\nby in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips,\ndips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to\nWilson.  His voice is flat, monotonal.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Chips?  Dip?\n\nBut Wilson declines.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No?\n\nHe takes a big crunchy bite.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Another fucking day in paradise.\n\nPULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the\nbowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER\n</b>\nTorch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across\nthe rocky ledge.  He passes the flume without even noticing.\n\nSuddenly his shoe breaks!  It's sandal made of woven yucca\nleaves.\n\nHe bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.\n\n<b>EXT.  LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of\ntimes, but this time the sandal comes loose.  It catches on a\nrock, and CHUCK FALLS!\n\nHis hands are cut and bruised.  He tries to get up, can't.\nChuck sits back and examines his foot.  His fingers come back\ncovered with blood.  He reaches out to steady himself, and\nleaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - LATER\n</b>\nChuck wraps his foot in bandages.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - LATER\n</b>\nChuck's face is sweaty.  He looks down at his foot.  It is\nred, swollen, infected.  He stands up, tries to put some\nweight on it.  The pain is intense.\n\nChuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.  He\nholds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the\nwound.  The pain is intense.  Chuck passes out.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and\ncollapses back on the floor.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.  He\nstaggers up.  His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.  He\nstruggles to get another log on the fire.  He squints at his\nonly companion, the soccer ball.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Help me, Wilson...\n\nHe collapses again.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck stirs and squints his eyes.  He takes a drink of water.\nHe is feeling better.  He puts another log on the fire and\nslowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nChuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot.\nBut something feels different.  He glances around.  What is\nit?  And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible\nsight.\n\n<b>CHUCK'S POV - SAIL\n</b>\nA SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.\n\n<b>CHUCK\n</b>\nThrows down the spear and waves his arms.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No!  Wait!  Come back!\n\nHe runs into the water and starts to swim.  He is so weak,\nhowever, he can only make a few strokes.  He tries to yell as\nhe swims...\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Wait!  Wait!\n\nChoking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the\nbeach.  In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.\n\n<b>EXT.  SUMMIT - LATER\n</b>\nChuck struggles to the top of the hill.  His fire has been\nextinguished by the rain.  In the distance, far against the\nhorizon, he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud?  The whiteness\nshimmers against the horizon.  Chuck squints.  Whatever it\nwas, it is gone.  Above him some contrails from jets mark the\nsky.\n\nFurious, he kicks his signal fire, scattering the burnt-out\ncoals.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\n</b>\nChuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree.  Then he stops.\nHe CUTS an angry big line under the last mark, then hacks\naway at the palm tree, slashing it with the stone knife,\nripping and marking through all his dates.  Finally the stone\nknife breaks in two.  Chuck drops the broken half and catches\nhis breath.\n\n<b>EXT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck enters the cave.  No signal fires burn.  The island is\ndark.\n\n<b>EXT.  SUMMIT - DAY\n</b>\nChuck stands on the summit, staring out to sea.  Nothing, not\neven a contrail, not even a whale spout.\n\n<b>EXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nHe is on his way down, suddenly he sees something and stops.\nIt's the HANDPRINT, the bloody handprint, his own handprint.\n\nHe slowly extends his hand and covers it, then pulls it away.\nTraces it with his fingers.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - DAYS LATER\n</b>\nChuck has the beginnings of an artist's studio.  Several\nlarge clam shells hold paint.  A few egg shells are lined up.\nBrushes have been made from roots and feathers.\n\nChuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the\nwall of the cave.  He stands back and looks at it.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - DAY\n</b>\nHe chews some berries, then holds his hand against the wall\nof the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it.  When he\ntakes his hand away, the silhouette of his handprint remains.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - DAY\n</b>\nWith the Angel Wing Box as a model, Chuck dips one of his\nfeather brushes in paint, and make a tentative line on the\nwall of the cave.  He works hesitantly, rubs off a line,\ntries again.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a\nman -- himself?  Hard to tell.  He examines his work.  He\ntakes some shells and sticks them on as eyes.\n\nChuck picks up Wilson, thinks.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You old airhead, you need a makeover.\n\nHe takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on\nthe ball.  Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in\nthe juice, and makes lips.  He sticks shells on with clay for\neyes.  Then he looks at the face.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Wilson, you bad!\n\nHe sits back and regards his companion.  He gestures around\nthe cave at the new paintings.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          What do you think?\n\nBut Wilson doesn't have an opinion.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You don't share much, do you?\n\nIdly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I guess I know how Kelly felt.\n\nFor a long time he studies the wings on it.  With a stick, he\ntries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.\nDissatisfied, he wipes it away.  He looks at the Angel Box.\n\nCasually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.\nInside he finds two bottles of green salsa.  And a letter.\n\nHe reads over it.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You said our life was a prison.  Dull.\n          Boring.  Empty.  I can't begin to tell\n          you how much that hurt.  I don't want to\n          lose you.  I'm enclosing some salsa, the\n          verde you like.  Use it on your sticky\n          rice and think of home.  Then come home\n          -- to me.  We'll find the spice in our\n          lives again.  Together.  I love you.\n          Always.  Bettina.\n\nVisibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          He never got it.\n\n<b>EXT.  ISLAND - DAY\n</b>\nThe monsoon pours down.  Wind whips the palm trees.  The\nwaves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - DAY\n</b>\nAs the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,\nruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          She's probably found someone else.  I\n          would have.\n\nChuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and\nstreaks it slowly across his face.  To exorcise his\nloneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there\nis:  his own body.\n\n<b>CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE\n</b>\nClose-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face\nand body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck\nbeing transformed.\n\nChuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses\nit into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow\nspiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning\nbolts on his chest on either side of the hand.\n\n<b>WATER\n</b>\nShimmers in a gourd.  Chuck's face swims into focus.  It has\nbeen painted white.  Looking at himself in the reflection, he\ndots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.\n\n<b>EXT.  CAVE - LATER\n</b>\nThe rains have stopped.  The island is washed bright and\ngreen.\n\n<b>ON CHUCK\n</b>\nAs he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue\nstars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning\nbolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang\nfrom his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his\npath.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark.\n\n<b>EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY\n</b>\nHe covers the calendar trees with handprints.  Then stops.\nSees something.  Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the\nshoreline.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nChuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had\nseen.\n\n<b>A FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM.\n</b>\nAnd another one.  TWO.  Chuck stares at the barrels.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Hello.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nChuck sits staring at the oil drums.  It's almost as if he is\nhesitating to take advantage of them.  That he may not want,\nreally, to leave now.\n\nThen his inner struggle ends.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          What the hell are you waiting for?\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nFilled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - LATER\n</b>\nUsing a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope\nmade of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of\nhis raft.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck is drawing with a purpose now.  And we see what he is\nworking on.  The plans for a raft.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nChuck is making a list of what he needs.  He works intently.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave\n          rope.  Spears.  A sail.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.  Checks the knots.\nLashes more rope.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nHe sews dresses together with handmade fiber string.\n\n<b>INT.  CAVE - NIGHT\n</b>\nHe weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor.\n\n<b>EXT.

I drew\n          these paintings.  I made these marks.\n          And then I took my fate in my own hands\n          and set forth to save myself, God\n          willing.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nChuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.  He has\na sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber\nthread.  A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together\ninto a rope.  Plastic bottles filled with water.  A signal\nkite made of FedEx paper.\n\nThen comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.  Then Wilson.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Wilson, my main man.  Time to go.\n\nAnd he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Wonder what odds Stan would give me on\n          this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against.\n\nHe jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the\nsurf crashes onto the reef.\n\n<b>EXT.  LAGOON - DAY\n</b>\nWaves break against the reef.  With his paddles Chuck\nmaneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.  Boom!  The\nwave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes\nwith a whoosh.\n\nChuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.  He's\ncommitted.  SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second,\nriding the receding wave.  He's out!\n\nBut the next wave is already surging forward.  It smashes the\nraft against the reef!  Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off\nthe raft!\n\nThe barrels cushion the impact.  The raft tilts, spins, but\nstays outside the reef!  The ropes holding the jugs of water\nbreak!  The water sweeps overboard!\n\nThe wave recedes again.  Chuck recovers, paddles with all his\nstrength, and then he's clear of the breakers!\n\nFor a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his\nbreath.\n\nThe water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the\nlagoon.  Chuck could go back and get them.  If he were being\nprudent, he definitely would.\n\nBut he's out.  He might never get back out again.\n\nHe stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs.  Then he\nstares at the island.  Goodbye to all that.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Wilson, we're out of here.\n\nHe turns and begins raising the sail.\n\n<b>EXT.

The still is set up in the\nmiddle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center.\n\nChuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted.\n\nHe lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand,\nstaring intently at the water.\n\nDorados swim like specters, flashing and darting.  Chuck\nstabs with his spear.  Stabs again.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Slow down, damn you!\n\nExhausted, he sinks back to the raft.  Two Dorados leap into\nthe air ahead of him.\n\nChuck tries to stare again into the water.  He spots another\nfish, a flash of silver under the surface.\n\nChuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear.  SPLAT!\nSomething strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into\nthe water.\n\nOn the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue.  A\nFLYING FISH.  Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Catch it catch it catch it --\n\nHe catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck sucks the juice out of the head.  He chews meat off the\ntiny rib bones.\n\nChuck is in the stage of malnutrition, vitamin deprivation,\nsalt insufficiency, and exposure where the personality splits\nand becomes external.  Like all castaways, he has\nconversations with the two sides of himself.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Save some for tomorrow.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Catch another fish tomorrow.\n\nBadChuck wins.  Chuck keeps eating.  He stares up at the sun,\nwhich beats down unmercifully.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nThe raft drifts.  Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it\nas a canopy.  Drenched with sweat, Chuck lies on the raft,\ntrying to sleep.  He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating\nhis body and won't let him get comfortable.  Plus, there's a\nchaffing, squeaking sound.  He looks around for the source.\n\nWe see it with him.  One of the ropes is frayed and about to\nbreak.  If it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Shit!  Shit!

Then sinks back down.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Can't.  Need water.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          You've had today's water.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Thirsty.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Come on, shape up, get going, you can do\n          it.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          No water, no work.\n\nChuck tries another tack.  Sweet reason.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Okay look, I know you're tired, I know\n          you're thirsty, but give it one more\n          shot, you've just got to do a little\n          more.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Do too much, I'll die.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Do too little you'll die.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Going to die anyway.\n\nThat stops GoodChuck for a moment.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Okay, look have an extra swallow.\n\nHe holds up the pathetic little jar with its few teaspoons of\nmurky water.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          No more water, you said.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Take it.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          No.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Take it, damn it.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          No.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the\n          damn water.\n\nSlowly Chuck gets up, lifts up the water jar, and takes a\nswallow.  Then another.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Stop.  Enough.\n\nThen another.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nChuck works to braid a new rope.  He is focused,\nconcentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and\nhard and he's weak and clumsy.  He tests the rope, but it\ndoesn't hold.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Think.  Got to use something else.\n\nHe gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          If they can't see you, what's the point?\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Survive today, that's the point.\n\nThe kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to\ntie the logs, but it's all he has.  He ties the log with the\nkite rope.  Exhausted, he lies back down.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe moon is full.  The waves cast off shadows on the ocean.\nChuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to\nnavigate by.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too\n          far south.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          You don't know where you are.  You missed\n          the shipping lanes.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Moon's too bright.\n\nWe hear the fraying sound again.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - DAY\n</b>\nChuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.  Across the\nwater comes a storm.  We can see it like a waterfall moving\ntoward us.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          You're putting off the inevitable.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          I'm putting it off.\n\nHe looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          That's what's happening to you.\n\nChuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope\nand begins to lash it around the center logs.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          You're rotting away.\n\nThe raft is rocking.  The waves are stronger.  It's hard to\ntie the logs together.\n\nRain falls like a sheet on Chuck.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Get water!\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Fix raft first.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Water water water --\n\nChuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope.\nFinally he does.\n\nThen he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles\nto pull it up.  One corner is stuck and collapses.\nDesperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up.\n\nDrops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar.\nSoaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises.\n\nThen the rain stops.\n\nWe see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering\nthe ocean.  But all around him the ocean is calm again.\n\nAnd out comes the sun.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n</b>\nThe raft floats on quiet seas.  The sky is blue, with few\nhigh cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on.\n\nChuck lies on the raft, sick and weak.\n\nSuddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge\nshape.\n\nA SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.  The blow hole is near\nChuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.  The eye of the whale\nis only a few feet away.  It looks upon Chuck out of an\nintelligence deep and alien.\n\nHe slowly comes to his knees and stares at it.\n\nThe blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine\nspray which settles on Chuck in a mist.\n\nThe whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.  From the whale\ncomes a deep sound like a foghorn.\n\nStartled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.  He catches\nhimself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale.\n\nThe whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray.\n\nChuck touches the whale again.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          You like that?\n\nVery slowly it drifts along with the raft.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Lost your mate?\n\nWe look right into the whale's eye.  Beneath the surface we\ncan see the huge jaws open and close.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          You're beautiful.  Marry me.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the\n          raft.\n\nVery slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body\npassing Chuck.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish.\n\nChuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of\nthe whale, which ignores it.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Please don't dive.  Please.\n\nThe whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back\nand heads straight for the bottom.\n\nFor a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and\nvertical against the dark blue sky.  With one swoop, those\nflukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.  But they don't do\nanything except slowly sink.\n\nThen it is gone.\n\nWe are on Chuck's face as he stares at where the whale had\nbeen, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples\nthat reach out and gently rock the raft.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n</b>\nChuck checks the water.  It is green and full of floaties.\nIt looks awful.  He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and\ndrinks.  Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely\nkeeps from dropping it.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Look what you've done.\n\nHe dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on\nhis face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.  He is so\nthirsty.\n\nHe looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns\naway, begins to work on the sea anchor again.\n\nBut the work makes him even thirstier.  He looks at the jug\nagain.\n\nPicks it up.  Takes a long drink.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n</b>\nThe fish return.  Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it\ndown.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          What are you doing?\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't\n          kill my friends anymore.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or\n          you die.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Why do they have to die for me?\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          They'd eat you if they could.  They're\n          laughing at you.  Listen.\n\nChuck listens.  Doesn't hear anything.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Got to eat.\n\nChuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.\n\nSuddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.  It\nstruggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its\nhead, twists the stone knife into its spine.  The struggling\nstops.\n\nChuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          I am so sorry.\n\nHe cries uncontrollably.  As he cries he cuts off the head,\npulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.  Then he sucks the\nmarrow out of the head.\n\nThen takes the heart and eats that.  Then eats the liver.\n\nAs he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.\n\nWhen he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks\non it.\n\nFish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe raft rocks gently.  Chuck looks up.  The strips of fish\nare glowing.  So is the deck where he killed the fish.\n\nHe reaches out to touch the fish strips.  His hand is glowing\ntoo.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I'm an angel.\n\nSuddenly he sees other lights.  A ship.  A ship is out there.\nAnd he hears it, a humming in deep register.\n\nHe waves his hands.  He yells.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Here!  Here!\n\nHis voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.\n\nThe lights move on.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No...no...no...\n\nHis raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.  Chuck is thrown\ninto the water!\n\nHe comes to the surface, sputtering.  Where is the raft?\n\nHe looks one way, then another.  Darkness.\n\nThis is the worst.\n\nHe turns again in the water.  There, dimly, he can see the\nglow from the fish he killed.  The glow saves his life.\n\nHe swims toward it.\n\nHe pulls himself back on the raft.\n\nHe lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence\ncasting a greenish light on his face.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n</b>\nClouds are building up.  In the distance lightning flashes.\nThe clouds come closer.\n\nLittle bits of electricity jump off the mast.  Saint Elmos\nfire jumps around Chuck's hand.\n\nFascinated, he holds out his hand.  The fire jumps from his\nhand to the mast.\n\nSuddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!\nA huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.  The\nCRACK is intense, then rolls away.\n\nChuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself\ndown on the raft.  Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him\nand the ocean begins to roll.  The thunder is deafening.\nLightning flashes bursts through the rain.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor!\n\nFrantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down\na huge wave.  The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it\nrides the wave down.\n\nThe waves come at him high as houses.  The raft rides up one\nside, then plunges down the next.\n\nAll Chuck can do is hold on.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n</b>\nThe storm has passed.  The raft floats on big dark rollers.\n\nWe hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.  They come\nclose to the raft.  Chuck watches them play.  Then realizes\nthey are chasing his fish.  They drive them along, into the\npath of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the\ndorado, turning the water around the raft into churning,\nbloody foam.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Stop!\n\nHe takes his oar and begins beating the water.  The killing\ncontinues.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          You fucking murderers!\n\nSuddenly the water is still.  One dolphin sticks its head out\nof the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.\n\nAnother dolphin lifts its head up, then another.  They squeak\nto each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I know you're talking about me!\n\nHe splashes the water with his oar.\n\nThey dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>               (very softly)\n          Take me with you.\n\nThey're gone.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Why me?  Why me, God?\n\nHe begins to laugh.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Listen to this, Wilson.\n               (deep voice: God)\n          Because you piss me off.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n</b>\nChuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.  Each movement\ntakes forever.\n\nHe rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.  He\ncan't.  Collapses onto the raft.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          You're falling apart.\n\nTries to do another pushup.  Can't.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          First you eat your fat, then you eat your\n          muscle.\n\nHe rolls over.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Then you eat your mind.\n\nHe looks at the ocean.  They're in a line of garbage, a thick\nslick of debris dumped off of ships.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean\n          roll.\n\nHe closes his eyes.  After a minute they come open.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          I'm late, I'm late, for a very important\n          date.\n\nThey slowly close again.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          I'm lost.  Goodbye.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          No!\n\nHis eyes come open again.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean\n          would feel so good, the water's so soft\n          and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          You quitter you quitter you quitter.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          The sea is lovely, dark and deep.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          But I have promises to keep.\n               (rolls over)\n          And miles to go before I sleep.\n               (props himself up)\n          And miles to go before I sleep.\n               (purpose now)\n          Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Use the sail for a sea anchor and you\n          won't move.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          If I don't have a sea anchor I'll\n          capsize.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Die tomorrow or die today.\n\nHe hums Beethoven's fifth.  BA BA BA BUM.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          That's death knocking, knocking on your\n          door.

Then slowly reaches for\nhis spear.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          What?  Are you sacrificing yourself for\n          me?\n\nCarefully he comes to his feet, then shoots the spear into\nthe fish.\n\nFlapping and struggling, it lands on the deck.  Chuck pounces\non it.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nHe cuts it open.  The other Dorados ram the raft in fury,\nlike a lynch mob.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Damn it!  I had to do it!\n\nThe banging continues.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          I'm sorry!\n\nHe concentrates on his work, then sits back on his heels in\namazement.  There's another fish inside.  He holds that fish\nup, stares at it, then cuts it open.\n\nThere's a smaller fish inside it.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          I know there's a moral here, God, but\n          right now I'm just going to eat.\n\nHe pops out an eyeball, then another, and crunches them\nbetween his teeth.\n\nHe takes the heart and liver, starts to eat, then stops.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Forgot to say grace.  Sorry Mom.\n\nHe struggles to remember.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and\n          Christ and the bounty about to receive,\n          or something...amen.\n\nHe eats them.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - NEXT MORNING\n</b>\nChuck splashes sea water on his face.  Adjusts the water\nstill.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Please don't leak.  Please.\n\nChuck picks up the smallest fish.  It's half digested.  He\nwashes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at\nhis fingers.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Don't look at me.  It was that Dorado.\n\nHe cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          You know, Wilson, every now and then we\n          should say thank you.  Thank you God.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Thank you for fucking up my life.\n\nSuddenly something bumps the raft.  Hard.  Then again.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Not again.\n\nFins cut the water.  SHARKS.  A big hammerhead bumps the\nraft.  BadChuck hums the theme from \"Jaws.\"  Chuck takes his\nspear stabs at the shark.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          He's going to get you, going to get\n          you...\n\nAnother one circles in, bumps the raft.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Get away from me!\n\nThe shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a\nnightmare.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Get him get him get him.\n\nHe stabs at it with his spear.

Where are you?\n\nStabs again and again at the empty ocean.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Stop!  You're using energy.  Move slowly.\n          Be patient.\n\nChuck kneels, wavering, on the raft.  The ocean is calm.\n\nSuddenly, BUMP.  The raft tilts.\n\nChuck hangs on.\n\nThen a shark appears, just out of spear range.  Its lifeless\nblack eyes seem to stare right through Chuck.\n\nIf the Dorado was a gift from God, this is a message from\nHell.\n\nThen the shark is gone.\n\n<b>EXT.

New\n          York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce.\n          Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted\n          potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green\n          Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and\n          cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice\n          salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo\n          shrimp cocktail.\n\nThinks about that, it spoils the picture.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          No shrimp.\n               (then)\n          We eat.\n\nHe closes his eyes.  This is the greatest fantasy.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>               (as the waiter)\n          For dessert, we have pecan pie a la mode,\n          we have a double chocolate cake with\n          creme anglaise, we have a nice pear\n          torte, fresh key lime pie, or perhaps if\n          you care to wait a few minutes, a grand\n          marnier souffle?\n\nChuck thinks over the options, thinking of each one.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Why, bring them all, bring them all.\n\nHe rolls over.  There, square in his vision, is a ship, its\nform coming in and out of a low haze.\n\nChuck jumps to his feet.  Waves.  Screams.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Here!  Over here!\n\nThe ship moves on.  We can see the decks the rigging, the\nvastness of it.\n\nChuck realizes he is naked.  Struggles to pull on the remains\nof his pants finally holds them like a diaper with one hand\nas he continues to wave.\n\nOn the ship no one is to be seen.  It is a spooky sight.\n\nThe big tanker moves on.\n\nWe are on Chuck's face.  Passed up again.\n\nThen he realizes what is about to happen.  He throws out the\nsea anchor.\n\nHe throws himself onto the raft and grips it as tight as he\ncan, wiggles his feet into the ropes.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Oh, shiiiittt!\n\nThen comes the wake of the ship.  It rocks the raft like a\npiece of flotsam.  The raft rides high up on the wave, then\nshoots down it, but the sea anchor holds, and the raft slows\nand rides along with the wave.\n\nAnd then the sea is calm again.\n\nSlowly Chuck sinks to his knees.  His hand lets loose his\npants.\n\nHe lies down on the raft and imagines the conversation with\nthe ship's captain.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Permission to come aboard, sir.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN\n</b>          Permission granted.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          May I ask, where are you bound?\n\n<b>                     CHUCK/CAPTAIN\n</b>          San Francisco.

OCEAN - AERIAL - EVENING\n</b>\nChuck lying curled up on the raft, Wilson cradled in his\narms, and all around the vast empty ocean.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - NEXT MORNING\n</b>\nChuck slowly wakes up.  Sets Wilson aside.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't\n          be lazy.  We're okay today.

A bank of\nclouds.  A cone of -- land.\n\nHe squints, stares again.  The clouds part.  It looks like --\nhis island.\n\nChuck doesn't know whether to feel joy or despair.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Jesus.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          Look again, asshole.

Far\nabove him, great frigate birds circle.  Suddenly one dives on\na booby which has caught a fish.  The great frigate bird\nswoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the\nfish, which plummets toward the sea.\n\nWith a graceful dive, the huge bird grabs the fish and then\nsoars up on a thermal, high into the sky.\n\nLightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is\nturning black and dark.  Thunder rolls.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe raft goes up and down huge waves.  Every few seconds\nlightning flashes, illuminating the raft and Chuck holding\ndesperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - MORNING\n</b>\nThe waves continue.  Chuck holds on, his face pale.\n\n<b>                     BADCHUCK\n</b>          You can't make it.\n\n<b>                     GOODCHUCK\n</b>          Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nThe sky clears.  The waves are still big.  The fish are back.\nAnd then come the sharks, cutting through the water.  Chuck\ncan't get up to get his spear, he just has to watch as blood\ndarkens the water.\n\nAnd then the sharks are gone.\n\nChuck comes to his knees slowly, then a big wave hits.\nWilson is swept into the ocean!\n\nFor a moment Chuck is uncomprehending.  He watches as Wilson\nslowly floats away.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Please, no sharks.\n\nThen he dives in to the water!  Swims frantically after\nWilson.\n\nWilson floats away from him.  He swims, but he's so weak.\nFinally he gets to Wilson.  He reaches out, but only pushes\nthe ball farther away.\n\nIt bobs on the waves.  Chuck treads water, exhausted.\n\nWhere is the raft?\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.\n\nThen he turns back the other way.  The raft has drifted by\nhim.  He can go after Wilson, or he can go after the raft.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Shit!  Wilson!\n\nHe swims toward the raft, barely moving.  No matter how hard\nhe swims, the raft seems to recede from him.\n\nFinally he reaches it, hangs on the side, breathing hard,\nchoking, crying.\n\nHe struggles to pull himself on board.\n\nBut he is weak, so weak.  He can't do it.\n\nSummoning some primitive reserve of strength, he tries again.\nThis time he slides on.\n\nHe lies on the raft, panting.\n\nThen with all his strength he pulls himself to his feet,\nholds on to the mast, scans the ocean for Wilson.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Wilson!\n\nNothing but waves.\n\nThis is too much.  Chuck starts to cry.\n\n<b>EXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nChuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his\nmouth, then swallows.  With his wet tongue he licks his\ncracked lips.\n\nThe sun breaks through the clouds.\n\nWith what strength he has left, Chuck raises the canopy,\nfastens it.\n\nHe sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees.\n\nCloses his eyes.  Just for a minute.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nA different sort of shadow crosses Chuck's face.  He opens\nhis eyes.\n\nThere, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty\ntanker.  Someone shouts down in a language we don't\nunderstand.\n\nChuck sits up, can't believe it.  Struggles to cover himself.\n\n<b>EXT.  OCEAN - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nChuck is lifted up the rusted steel side of the boat in a\nJacob's ladder.\n\n<b>EXT.  SHIP - DAY - LATER\n</b>\nChuck steps on board, can't support himself.\n\nThe crew gathers around.  None of them speak English, but\nthere is a spontaneous outburst of human connection.\n\nOne man brings some water.  Another a blanket.  Another some\nwarm tea.\n\nChuck sits there, shivering now.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Thank you.  Oh thank you.\n\nDeliriously happy.  Delirious.\n\n<b>INT.  U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL - HAWAII\n</b>\nA cavernous hanger-sized ward brightly lit and filled with\nrow upon row of hospital beds, each with its table, side\nchair, and lamp, each with a stainless steel bedpan and\nneatly folded sheets and blankets stacked ready to use, and\neach completely empty.\n\nExcept for one.\n\nAnd on that bed we see Chuck, in a blue hospital gown.  An IV\ndrips into his arm.  He plays idly with the remote control of\nthe bed.  He raises the head, then the foot.  He pushes\nanother button and the knee rest bends the bed again.\n\nA DOCTOR enters, carrying a thick chart.  Chuck gives him a\nbig manic grin.

You may\n          experience swelling in your extremities\n          as you rehydrate and discharge the salt.\n          In spite of your dietary deficiencies\n          there's no sign of mental deterioration.\n\nChuck has been trying not to laugh.  Now he can't stop\nhimself.\n\n<b>                     DOCTOR\n</b>          What's so funny.\n\nChuck can't seem to help laughing at everything.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Sorry...sorry...

So you're going to\n          burn up your own cells no matter how much\n          you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and\n          pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C,\n          so you didn't get scurvy.\n\nChuck laughs again.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I am one lucky guy.\n\n<b>                     DOCTOR\n</b>          Your body chemistry and your exposure to\n          the elements would normally lead to\n          irritability, depression, anxiety,\n          periods of self-reproach.  It's almost\n          like schizophrenia.

HAWAII - BEACH RESTAURANT\n</b>\nA terrace by the ocean.  Tables filled with diners.  Food\nbeing delivered by waiters.  So simple, eating.  So taken for\ngranted.\n\nAt one table sits Chuck, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and\nshorts, with a half-dozen plates in front of him.  He\ngestures to the waiter.  Bring me more.  It all tastes so\ndamned good.\n\nBehind him is the ocean.  Chuck doesn't glance at it.\n\n<b>INT.  DENTIST - NEXT DAY\n</b>\nAn attractive DENTAL TECHNICIAN with an Australian accent\ncleans Chuck's teeth with an ultrasound device.  She's close,\nvery close.  Chuck looks up at her.  She looks really good.\nShe smiles at him, then touches the gap where he knocked out\nhis tooth.\n\n<b>                     TECHNICIAN\n</b>          You sure you don't want to have the\n          implant done here?

She scrapes behind his front\nteeth.\n\n<b>                     TECHNICIAN\n</b>          Hmmm, you do have such a lot of tarter\n          behind these front incisors.  A little\n          wider, please.\n\nChuck opens his mouth even further.  The technician talks on\nin the self-absorbed way dental technicians sometimes do,\nthat constant babble of human contact which Chuck has not\nheard for four years.\n\n<b>                     TECHNICIAN\n</b>          Anyway, so the second prosthetic foot\n          worked better, but he still couldn't\n          drive his new Cortina, it being a\n          standard shift, if you follow me.\n\nChuck nods.  I follow you.\n\n<b>                     TECHNICIAN\n</b>          But would he hear of me driving him\n          around?  Not on your bloody life.  Rinse\n          please.\n\nChuck does.  Stan bursts into the room.\n\n<b>                     STAN\n</b>          Chuck!  God damn!\n\nChuck struggles out of the chair.\n\n<b>                     STAN\n</b>          God damn.  God damn.

Stan holds Chuck by the\nshoulders and looks at him.\n\n<b>                     STAN\n</b>          You're alive, you're fucking alive!\n\nChuck laughs, thrilled to see Stan.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I beat the odds!\n\n<b>                     STAN\n</b>          You beat 'em to shit, pal!

Her boyfriend lost his\n          foot in a shark attack.\n\nHe says this with an absolute straight face, holding back the\nlaughter with great effort.  Instantly there's this\nconnection again between him and Stan.\n\n<b>                     TECHNICIAN\n</b>          Ex-boyfriend.\n\n<b>                     STAN\n</b>          Really.\n\nAnd he and Chuck make eye contact and we see a glimpse of\ntheir shared unspoken irony.\n\n<b>                     STAN\n</b>          Uh, there's somebody out here who wants\n          to see you.\n\nChuck stares sharply at him.  Kelly?  Stan nods, but there's\nsomething he wants to say.\n\n<b>                     STAN\n</b>          She thought you were dead.  We all did.\n\nThat's not all Stan wants to say.  But Chuck is limping out\nthe door.\n\n<b>INT.  DENTIST - WAITING ROOM\n</b>\nTypical dentist waiting room.  Chairs, tropical fish tanks,\nmagazines, a few waiting patients...and Kelly, looking\nnervous.\n\nSlowly and painfully Chuck enters.  He's quite a sight.  She\nstands up.  There's a long moment where they look at each\nother.\n\nThen she comes into his arms.  Holds him tight.  She's part\nlaughing, part crying.\n\n<b>                     KELLY\n</b>          I'm sorry... I'm sorry...\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Hey...hey...it's okay!\n\nChuck is happy, he's still riding the high.\n\n<b>                     KELLY\n</b>          You're so thin.

I like your hair.\n\nHe notices the ring on her hand.\n\n<b>                     KELLY\n</b>          I got married.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I thought you might have.\n\n<b>                     KELLY\n</b>          I would never --\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I know.\n\n<b>                     KELLY\n</b>          If I'd known you were alive --\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I would have done the same thing.\n\nHis responses come so quick.  Chuck seems blissfully sure of\nhimself.\n\n<b>                     KELLY\n</b>          I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One\n          day Gary was there.  He took care of\n          everything.  He took care of me.

It is funny, sort of.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Life's just one big joke after another.\n\nStan appears, takes in the scene.

Then\nthere's a sound of a truck in the driveway.\n\nThe engine cuts off.  There are steps on the porch.  The door\nopens.  A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes\ncomes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.\n\nHe looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a\nman in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual\noccurrence.\n\n<b>                     MAN\n</b>          Hey.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Hey.\n\n<b>                     BETTINA (O.S.)\n</b>          In here!\n\nThe Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.  We are on\nChuck's face.  Who's this?  We hear muffled laughter from\ninside.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER\n</b>\nArms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to\nChuck.  In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two\nangel wings.  The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin.\n\n<b>                     MAN\n</b>          Come back anytime.  Coffee's always on.\n          Don't even have to bring us a package.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          That was my last one.\n\nBettina hands Chuck a sheet of paper.\n\n<b>                     BETTINA\n</b>          The list of paints and brushes I did for\n          you.\n\nHe takes it, not exactly sure he wants it.\n\n<b>                     BETTINA\n</b>          Keep painting.  Promise me.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Sure.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck rides his bicycle away, along the shore.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER\n</b>\nChuck rides along the beach.  Up ahead we see a FedEx truck.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck gets off his bike as a female FEDEX DRIVER puts chocks\nunder the wheels, which have stuck in the sand.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Need some help?\n\n<b>                     DRIVER\n</b>          You bet I do.  High tide comes right up\n          to this road.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nChuck pushes on the truck as the driver gives it gas.  The\ntruck slowly pulls back onto the pavement.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nThe Driver gets out of the truck with a grin.  She has an\nopen, friendly face.  There's an instant connection between\nthem.\n\n<b>                     DRIVER\n</b>          Hey, thanks.  I'd never have got that out\n          by myself.\n\nLooks at his uniform.  At the bike.\n\n<b>                     DRIVER\n</b>          You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          No.\n\nWhere is he from, anyway?\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I used to drive one of those.  A long\n          time ago.\n\n<b>                     DRIVER\n</b>          Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You\n          want a lift?  I've just got one more\n          pickup.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Sure.\n\nHe picks up his bike.\n\n<b>INT.  FEDEX TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nThe FedEx truck makes its way down the beach, Chuck in his\nuniform, the Driver in hers.  Two FedEx people in a truck.\nThe Driver looks over at Chuck.\n\n<b>                     DRIVER\n</b>          You're Chuck Noland.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Yeah.\n\n<b>                     DRIVER/ERICA\n</b>          I knew it!  You're a legend!  Mr.\n          Robinson Crusoe.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Well --\n\n<b>                     ERICA\n</b>          I knew I recognized you.  My name's\n          Erica.\n\nThey smile at each other.  Then she smiles a little more.\n\n<b>                     ERICA\n</b>          Did you really steal a crippled kid's\n          bicycle to make your deliveries, or is\n          that just some bullshit story?\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I didn't steal it, and he wasn't\n          crippled.\n\nErica laughs.\n\n<b>                     ERICA\n</b>          Otherwise it's completely true.\n\nAnd that makes Chuck laugh, really laugh, for the first time.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Yeah, completely.\n\nShe looks over at him with a grin.\n\n<b>                     ERICA\n</b>          What brings you out to the sticks?\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          Had a package to deliver.\n\n<b>                     ERICA\n</b>          You?  Personally?\n\n<b>                     CHUCK\n</b>          I had it on the island with me.\n\n<b>                     ERICA\n</b>          Must be a story there.\n\nThere's a connection building here, effortlessly.\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nWe are wide on the beach, watching the truck move along the\nwater, kicking up wisps of sand.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          Yeah, a long one.\n\n<b>                     ERICA (V.O.)\n</b>          I've got lots of time.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          So do I.\n\nThe truck goes down the beach and then turns inland, away\nfrom the ocean.  Away from all that.\n\n<b>                     CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          So do I.\n\nAnd we pull back, taking in the sweep of the beach, the\nestuaries, and the green forest stretching back into America.\n\nThe end is the beginning.\n\n<b>FADE OUT.\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Cast Away</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=William Broyles Jr.\" title=\"Scripts by William Broyles Jr.\">William Broyles Jr.</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Cast Away Script.html#comments\" title=\"Cast Away comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:01:47.123744"}
