To \n               Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind \n               switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to \n               switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A \n               waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the \n               switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it \n               again from the city room which stretches on beyond \n               switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an \n               office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big \n               clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY\n\n               as he bends over paper.

The \n               door closes, as elevator goes down. The near elevator comes \n               up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin. Bruce \n               carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat.\n\n               MED.

I heard \n                         it, but I just wanted to hear it \n                         again. I can stand being spoiled a \n                         little. The gentleman I'm going to \n                         have a chat with did very little \n                         spoiling.\n\n                                     BRUCE\n                              (grimly)\n                         I'd like to spoil him just once. \n                         Sure you don't want me to go in with \n                         you?\n\n                                     HILDY\n                         My job, Bruce.

Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it \n               for her. Hildy smiles.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                         Thanks, Bruce.\n\n               She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her. \n               The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares \n               after Hildy.\n\n               MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM\n\n               Hildy starts to walk through City Room.\n\n               TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY\n\n               as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, \n               because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. \n               The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts \n               down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: \n               \"Hildy!\" \"Hello, Hildy\", etc., from the men as Hildy goes \n               straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own \n               greetings: \"Jim!\" \"Hi, good-looking!\" \"Laura\" \"Hullo, Pop\" \n               \"Nan!\" \"Eddie!\" \"Hello, Mac\" \"Pete!\" \"Frank\" \"Oscar!\", and \n               gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his \n               desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him \n               as she goes by. He turns around: \"Say, who did that?\" As he \n               sees Hildy: \"Hello, Hildy!\" Hildy: \"Hi, Jake.\" She passes a \n               middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at \n               a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy \n               comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                         Hello, Beatrice.

CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the \n               room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition \n               which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the \n               City Room.\n\n               INT.

Now I want to ask you fellows \n                         a couple of questions.

If you ask the \n                         state alienists, the answer is yes.\n\n                                     MCCUE\n                         It's a simple story. Earl Williams \n                         works for the E.J. McClosky \n                         Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper \n                         for fourteen years.

Only he \n                         makes his speeches, usually, on a \n                         very busy street and neglects to get \n                         a license for it. Well, the cops let \n                         him alone as much as they can because \n                         he's harmless and they're kinda sorry \n                         for him. But one day he decides to \n                         hold a meeting right in the middle \n                         of a Veteran's Parade and the cops \n                         chase him. He gets scared and goes \n                         into hiding.\n                              (gesturing toward \n                              Schwartz)\n                         Come in, Dave Schwartz.\n\n                                     SCHWARTZ\n                         His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out \n                         with a statement that Earl Williams \n                         is a dangerous character in the employ \n                         of two or three foreign governments \n                         and the police are going to get him \n                         dead or alive.

And this colored \n                         policeman, Daniels, goes over to \n                         pick Williams up. Williams has read \n                         the papers, thinks the cop is going \n                         to kill him and shoots first.

By that \n                         time, you'll probably have made enough \n                         so that the money won't mean anything. \n                         But suppose you haven't made good -- \n                         don't you think Hildy's entitled to \n                         a quiet old age without any worries?\n\n                                     BRUCE\n                         Well, of course, if you put it that \n                         way.\n\n                                     BURNS\n                              (everything he has on \n                              the ball)\n                         And remember this, Bruce!

COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               at the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at \n               the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits \n               at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of \n               roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of \n               Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is \n               only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals \n               himself.\n\n                                     WILLIAMS\n                         I couldn't plead insanity, because \n                         you see I'm just as sane as anybody \n                         else.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                              (puzzled and worried)\n                         You didn't mean to kill that \n                         policeman?\n\n                                     WILLIAMS\n                         Of course not.

They're not hanging me for \n                         that -- they're hanging me for my \n                         beliefs.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                         What are your beliefs, Earl?\n\n                                     WILLIAMS\n                         They're very simple.

But if \n                         they would only listen to it -- we \n                         could have a fine, decent world \n                         instead of this mass of hate that \n                         makes man do such cruel things.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                         How would you go about applying the \n                         Golden Rule, Earl?\n\n                                     WILLIAMS\n                         I'd do away with the profit system \n                         and have production for use only. \n                         There's enough food and clothing and \n                         shelter for everybody if we'd use \n                         some sense.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                              (writing)\n                         \"Production for use only.\" Well, \n                         maybe that's the answer.\n\n                                     WILLIAMS\n                         It's the only answer.

He \n               carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been \n               playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.\n\n                                     WILLIAMS\n                              (pointing gun at her)\n                         Drop that phone --\n\n               Hildy drops the phone back on the hook.\n\n                                     WILLIAMS\n                              (supporting himself \n                              by holding on to \n                              edge of desk)\n                         You're not going to phone anybody \n                         where I am.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                              (bracing herself)\n                         Put down that gun, Earl.\n\n               He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her.\n\n                                     HILDY\n                         You're not going to shoot me, Earl. \n                         I'm your friend, remember?
