It's a long walk, \n               because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. \n               The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts \n               down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: \n               \"Hildy!\" \"Hello, Hildy\", etc., from the men as Hildy goes \n               straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own \n               greetings: \"Jim!\" \"Hi, good-looking!\" \"Laura\" \"Hullo, Pop\" \n               \"Nan!\" \"Eddie!\" \"Hello, Mac\" \"Pete!\" \"Frank\" \"Oscar!\", and \n               gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his \n               desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him \n               as she goes by. He turns around: \"Say, who did that?\" As he \n               sees Hildy: \"Hello, Hildy!\" Hildy: \"Hi, Jake.\" She passes a \n               middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at \n               a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy \n               comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.\n\n<b>                                     HILDY\n</b>                         Hello, Beatrice.
