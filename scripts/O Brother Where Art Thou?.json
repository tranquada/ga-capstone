A \n\ttitle burns in:\n\n\tO muse! \n\tSing in me, and through me tell the story \n\tOf that man skilled in all the ways of contending... \n\tA wanderer, harried for years on end...\n\n\tOn the sound of an impact we cut to:\n\n<b>\tA PICK\n</b>\n\tsplitting a rock.\n\n\tAs the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at \n\twork. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, \n\tchained together, working under a brutal midday sun.\n\n\tIt is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road \n\tstretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily \n\tpatrol the line.\n\n\tThe chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless.\n\n\tWe slowly fade out, returning to\n\n<b>\tBLACK\n</b>\n\tThe last of the voices fades.\n\n\tAfter a long beat we hear the guitar introduction to Harry \n\tMcClintock's 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain.'\n\n<b>\tA WHEAT FIELD\n</b>\n\tA road cuts across the middle background. Noonday sun beats \n\tdown.\n\n\tWe hear the distant picks and shovels of men at work and \n\tsee, rising above ground level, the occasional upraised pick \n\tand spade heaving dirt. Men are digging a ditch alongside \n\tthe road.\n\n\tAfter a long beat, three men pop up in the wheat field in \n\tthe middle foreground. They wear faded stripes and grey duck-\n\tbilled caps. They scurry abreast toward the camera, throwing \n\tan occasional glance back at the ditch-diggers. A clanking \n\tsound accompanies their run. Oddly, the wheat between them \n\tsweeps down as they run. After a brief sprint they drop back \n\tdown into the wheat.\n\n\tIn the background a man enters frame left, strolling along \n\tthe road, wearing a khaki uniform and sunglasses, a shotgun \n\tresting against one shoulder. He glances idly down into the \n\tditch and strolls on out of frame right.\n\n\tThe three men rise back up from the wheat and, clanking, \n\tresume their sprint.\n\n<b>\tTHREE PAIRS OF EYES\n</b>\n\tThey are topped by three cap bills, and peer out from behind \n\ta blind of greenery. We hear distant whistling.\n\n\tThe men are looking at a weathered barn. A young boy, \n\twhistling, is heading down the road that leads away from the \n\tbarn, jiggling the traces of the old plough horse that leads \n\thim. He turns a corner and is gone.\n\n<b>\tBARNYARD\n</b>\n\tThe three clanking men (we can now see their leg irons) are \n\tawkwardly chasing a chicken around the yard. The squawking \n\tyardbird doesn't need to move much to elude the three bunched \n\tmen.\n\n<b>\tCOUNTRY LANE\n</b>\n\tIt curves in a gentle S into the background. It is sun-\n\tdappled, pretty.\n\n\tWe hear clanking footsteps approaching at a trot.\n\n\tThe three men enter in the foreground and trot on down the \n\tlane. The leftmost has a flapping chicken tucked under one \n\tarm.\n\n<b>\tAFTERNOON CAMPFIRE\n</b>\n\tThe three men sit in a side-by-side arc around a dying fire, \n\tone of them contentedly picking his teeth with a small chicken \n\tbone, another wiping grease off his chin with a sleeve, the \n\tthird idly poking at the fire with a spit.\n\n\tEach of them, still bound by chains, clinks as he moves.\n\n\tOne of them abruptly cocks his head, listening.\n\n\tThe others notice his attitude and also freeze, listening.\n\n\tWe hear the distant baying of hounds.\n\n<b>\tROLLING HILLS\n</b>\n\tFrom high on a ridge we see the three chained men running \n\ttoward us.\n\n\tIn addition to their clanks we hear a distant chugging sound.\n\n<b>\tTRACKING\n</b>\n\tLaterally with the clanking, running feet.\n\n\tThe chugging sound is very loud.\n\n<b>\tRUNNING\n</b>\n\tNext to a freight train. A boxcar door is open.\n\n<b>\tINSIDE THE BOXCAR\n</b>\n\tThe lead convict hooks an elbow in and starts hauling himself \n\tup, his two clanking friends keeping pace outside.\n\n\tSix hobos sit in the boxcar, lounging against sacks of \n\tO'Daniel's Flour. They impassively watch the convict clamber \n\tin as his two confederates run to keep up.\n\n\tThe convict hauls himself to his feet. In spite of his stubble \n\the has carefully tended hair and a pencil mustache. He is \n\tEverett.\n\n\tAs he dusts himself off:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tSay, uh, any a you boys smithies?\n\n\tThe hobos stare.\n\n\tEverett gives an ingratiating smile as, behind him, the second \n\tconvict starts to haul himself into the boxcar, the third \n\tconvict still keeping pace outside.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tOr, if not smithies per se, were you \n\t\totherwise trained in the metallurgic \n\t\tarts before straitened circumstances \n\t\tforced you into a life of aimless \n\t\twanderin'?\n\n\tThe convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and \n\tdisappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately \n\tafter. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward in \n\tturn, smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the \n\topen doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves \n\ton the boxcar floorboards.\n\n\tThe hobos impassively watch.\n\n<b>\tOUTSIDE\n</b>\n\tThe three men tumble, clanking, down the track embankment.\n\n\tSquush - they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom.\n\n\tThey shake their heads clear, then rise to their feet in the \n\tmuck and watch the train recede.\n\n\tIts fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tJesus - can't I count on you people?\n\n\tThe second con is Delmar.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tSorry, Everett.\n\n\tEverett looks desperately about.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tAll right - if we take off through \n\t\tthat bayou-\n\n\tThe third con, Pete, bald but also with beard stubble, angrily \n\tcuts in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tWait a minute! Who elected you leader \n\t\ta this outfit?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWell, Pete, I just figured it should \n\t\tbe the one with capacity for abstract \n\t\tthought. But if that ain't the \n\t\tconsensus view, hell, let's put her \n\t\tto a vote!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tSuits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWell I'm votin' for yours truly too!\n\n\tBoth men look interrogatively to Delmar.\n\n\tHe looks from Pete to Everett, and nods agreeably.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tOkay - I'm with you fellas.\n\n\tEverett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen.\n\n\tThe baying of hounds is louder now, but through it we hear a \n\tdistant scrape of metal against metal, like the workings of \n\ta rusty pump. The men turn in unison to look up the track.\n\n\tA small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward \n\tthem.\n\n\tAs it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. \n\tAn ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw \n\thandle.\n\n\tThe three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to \n\tshow movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs.\n\n\tThe flatcar draws even and slows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tMind if we join you, ol' timer?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\t\tJoin me, my sons.\n\n\tThe three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping.\n\n\tThe three men exchange glances; Delmar waves a clanking hand \n\tbefore the old man's milky eyes. No reaction.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tYou work for the railroad, grandpa?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\t\tI work for no man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tGot a name, do ya?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\t\tI have no name.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWell, that right there may be why \n\t\tyou've had difficulty finding gainful \n\t\temployment. Ya see, in the mart of \n\t\tcompetitive commerce, the-\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\t\tYou seek a great fortune, you three \n\t\twho are now in chains...\n\n\tThe men fall silent.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\t\tAnd you will find a fortune - though \n\t\tit will not be the fortune you seek...\n\n\tThe three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the \n\tblind prophet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\t\t...But first, first you must travel \n\t\ta long and difficult road - a road \n\t\tfraught with peril, uh-huh, and \n\t\tpregnant with adventure. You shall \n\t\tsee things wonderful to tell. You \n\t\tshall see a cow on the roof of a \n\t\tcottonhouse, uh-huh, and oh, so many \n\t\tstartlements...\n\n\tThe cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the \n\ttrack as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\t\t...I cannot say how long this road \n\t\tshall be. But fear not the obstacles \n\t\tin your path, for Fate has vouchsafed \n\t\tyour reward.  And though the road \n\t\tmay wind, and yea, your hearts grow \n\t\tweary, still shall ye foller the \n\t\tway, even unto your salvation.\n\n\tThe old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate \n\this words.\n\n\tLoud and sudden:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b><b>\t\tIZZAT CLEAR?\n</b>\n\tThe men start, then mumble polite acknowledgement.\n\n\tThe railroad tracks wind to the setting sun. Reek-a reek-a \n\treek-a - the flatcar rolls, in wide shot, toward the golden \n\thorizon.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n</b>\n<b>\tDAY\n</b>\n\tA hot dusty road leading up to a lone farmhouse.\n\n\tThe three men walk, clanking and abreast.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tHow'd he know about the treasure?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tDon't know, Delmar-though the blind \n\t\tare reputed to possess sensitivities \n\t\tcompensatin' for their lack of sight, \n\t\teven to the point of developing para-\n\t\tnormal psychic powers. Now clearly, \n\t\tseein' the future would fall neatly \n\t\tinto that ka-taggery. It's not so \n\t\tsurprising, then, if an organism \n\t\tdeprived of earthly vision-\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tHe said we wouldn't get it! He said \n\t\twe wouldn't get the treasure we seek!\n\n\tEverett grows testy:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWell what does he know - he's an \n\t\tignorant old man! Jesus, Pete, I'm \n\t\ttelling you I buried it myself, and \n\t\tif your cousin still runs this-here \n\t\thorse farm and has a forge and some \n\t\tshoein' impediments to restore our \n\t\tliberty of movement-\n\n\tBang! A rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHILD'S VOICE\n</b>\t\tHold it rah chair!\n\n\tThe front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front \n\tporch and a dark screen door.\n\n\tThe screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the \n\tporch and steps down into the sunlight, holding a gun almost \n\tbigger than he is. The grimy-faced boy, about eight years \n\told, wears tattered overalls.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHILD\n</b>\t\tYou men from the bank?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tYou Wash's boy?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHILD\n</b>\t\tYassir!

Is your daddy \n\t\tabout?\n\n<b>\tTHE BACK OF THE HOUSE\n</b>\n\tWash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted \n\tbathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm \n\timplements overgrown with weeds. He is whittling artlessly \n\tat a stick.\n\n\tHe glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, \n\tthen returns to his whittling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWASH\n</b>\t\t'Lo, Pete. Hooor yer friends?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tPleased to make your acquaintance, \n\t\tMister Hogwallop.

A Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair \n\tbrings him to table height. The cons are now rid of their \n\tchains and are dressed in ill-fitting farmer's wear.\n\n<b>\tWASH\n</b>\n\tThey foreclosed on Cousin Vester. He hanged himself a year \n\tcome May.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tAnd Uncle Ratliff?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWASH\n</b>\t\tThe anthrax took most of his cows. \n\t\tThe rest don't milk, and he lost a \n\t\tboy to mumps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tWhere's Cora, Cousin Wash?\n\n\tWash glances at the little boy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWASH\n</b>\t\tCouldn't say.

The four men sit about listening to a big box radio. \n\tWash is whittling once again; Everett dips his comb into a \n\tpomade jar and carefully works on his hair; Pete is digging \n\taround with a toothpick; Delmar dreamily waves one hand in \n\ttime to the music.\n\n\tThe music ends.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n</b>\t\tWell, that's the last number for \n\t\ttonight's 'Pass the Biscuits Pappy \n\t\tO'Daniel Flour Hour.'

It crashes \n\tback onto all four and, as it speeds along, dollar bills \n\tsnap and flutter out its windows. The car roars up to the \n\tthree men as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb. It screeches to \n\ta halt.\n\n\tThe driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike \n\tface, leans over to call through the passenger window.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\t\tIs this the road to Itta Bena?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tUh...

George Nelson, cackling \n\twildly, fires into the air as his car recedes.\n\n<b>\tSMALL TOWN\n</b>\n\tThe car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through \n\tlight traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means \n\tof clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits.\n\n\tThe car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the \n\tthree convicts emerge to follow him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNELSON\n</b><b>\t\tCOME ON BOYS!

It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the \n\tcandidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed \n\tof the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he \n\tpushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if \n\tconducting the music.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tHe's against the Innarests and for \n\t\tthe little man!\n\n\tThis, the driver's voice, is amplified through a flared \n\tspeaker mounted on the roof of the cab.

You gotta beat that \n\t\tcompetition.\n\n\t'I'll Fly Away' mixes up to play full over the following.\n\n<b>\tMONTAGE\n</b>\n\t- The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun \n\tshimmering off the rough pavement. Their bank loot, wrapped \n\tin a bandanna, is knotted to the end of a stick slung over \n\tDelmar's shoulder.\n\n\t- A different road under a threatening sky. The three men \n\tstand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two \n\tlittle black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of \n\tice. A horse-drawn cart rumbles in from offscreen and Everett \n\twaggles his thumb. Thunder rumbles.\n\n\t- A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black \n\tlabel identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy \n\tBottom Boys.\n\n\t- A high shot looking down through the rain past the dripping \n\teave of a barn, under which Everett, Pete and Delmar have \n\ttaken cover. The three hold their coats pinched shut at the \n\tneck as they look forlornly up at the weather.\n\n\t- The three men walk along a red dirt road elevated through \n\ta bayou.\n\n\t- The three men sit around a campfire. Everett sits on a \n\tstump, expressively telling a ghost story as Pete and Delmar \n\tgaze at him from below, wide-eyed and rapt.\n\n\t- The three men walk past a cotton field dotted with burst \n\tpods.\n\n\t- A Woolworth's interior. A sad-faced woman in a calico dress \n\taddresses the clerk:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSAD-FACED WOMAN\n</b>\t\tDo you have the Soggy Bottom Boys \n\t\tperforming 'Man of Constant Sorrow'?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tNo, ma'am, we had a new shipment in \n\t\tyesterday but we just can't keep it \n\t\ton the shelves.\n\n\tThe sad-faced woman is crestfallen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSAD-FACED WOMAN\n</b>\t\tOh, mercy. Then - just the purple \n\t\ttoilet water.\n\n\t- The three men walk down a road excavated through banks of \n\tclay, from which gnarled tree roots protrude.\n\n\t- A pie rests on a windowsill, steam wafting from it. A hand \n\tenters from below the sill outside and disappears with the \n\tpie. A moment later we see Everett's and Pete's backs as \n\tthey scamper away across the yard. A short beat, and then \n\tDelmar peeks over the sill. He ducks back down and then his \n\thand reaches up to leave a dollar bill. Moments later we see \n\thim scampering away after Pete and Everett.\n\n\t- Another campfire. The three men sit around it laughing as \n\tthey enjoy the pie, each with a slab on a plate improvised \n\tof old newspaper. Everett finishes his piece, licks his thumb \n\tand tosses the newspaper onto the fire.\n\n\tWe jump in to look at the soiled newspaper as flame begins \n\tto curl its edge. A story is headlined 'TVA Finalizing Plans \n\tfor Flooding of Arktabutta Valley'. The flame curls the page \n\taway, briefly revealing the page beneath - with a story \n\theadlined 'Soggy Bottom Boys a Sensation - But Who Are They?' - \n\tbefore it too is consumed.\n\n\t- A little general store. We are very high, looking down at \n\ta foreshortened Everett, Pete, Delmar and store clerk, who \n\tis wielding a long telescoping pole that stretches toward \n\tus. Everett is pointing up, directing the man with the pole. \n\tHe moves it tentatively to and fro until, at a certain point, \n\tEverett nods vigorously.\n\n\tA reverse shows the end of the pole - a long stock-pincher - \n\tas it closes over a tin of Dapper Dan pomade, resting on a \n\thigh shelf.\n\n\tThe exterior of the store shows it to be on a corner of a \n\tlittle crossroads town. The three men are emerging from the \n\tstore just as a car pulls up to one of the two bubble-topped \n\tgas pumps out front. A fancyman in a boater hat gets out of \n\tthe car and heads for the store, passing the three; Everett \n\tglances at him and, as the man disappears inside, he dives \n\tinto his car, waving for Delmar and Pete to follow. Delmar, \n\tinitially reluctant, is hauled into the car by Pete, and the \n\tmen take off.\n\n\t- The spinning 78 recording, as the song enters its last \n\tverse.\n\n\t- A spinning car wheel.\n\n\t- A panoramic boom up as the car toodles away, down a road \n\tthat winds through scrub grass toward a distant sunset.\n\n<b>\tTHE CAR\n</b>\n\tThe three men are driving through the heat of the day. Everett \n\tdrives; Pete is slouched in the front passenger seat; Delmar, \n\tin back, picks out 'I'll Fly Away' on a banjo.\n\n\tPete listens to something, squints, tilts his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\t...Shutup, Delmar.\n\n\tDelmar and Everett exchange glances; Everett shrugs and Delmar \n\tdesists.\n\n\tWe can faintly hear a high, unearthly singing. Barely human, \n\tthe sound seems to agitate Pete. He looks desperately out \n\tthe window.\n\n\tHis hinging point-of-view shows, down the declivity from the \n\troad and half hidden by trees, three women washing clothes \n\tin the river.\n\n\tPete's reaction is enormous. He jams a fist into his mouth, \n\teyes widening. He yanks the fist out and screams:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b><b>\t\tPULL OVER!\n</b>\n\tEverett, startled, does so.\n\n<b>\tEXT.\n</b>\n\tBefore the car has even come to a stop Pete's door flies \n\topen and he is stumbling down the bank to the river.\n\n\tEverett and Delmar follow more casually, Everett chuckling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tI guess o' Pete's got the itch.\n\n<b>\tAT THE RIVER\n</b>\n\tThe unearthly singing, full volume here, comes from the three \n\twomen, beautiful but marked by an otherworldly langor as \n\tthey dunk clothes in the stream and beat them against rocks.\n\n\tPete is all awkward smiles and deep, burning eyes:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tHowdy do, ladies. Name of Pete!\n\n\tStrangely, the three laundresses do not answer, though they \n\tdo smile at him as they continue to sing.\n\n\tPete tries again as he reaches into their laundry basket:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tMaybe I could help you with the, uh-\n\n\tHe realizes he is holding ladies' undergarments.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tAhem.

I seen 'em \n\t\tfirst!\n\n\tEverett laughs lightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tLadies, you'll have to pardon my \n\t\tfriend here; Pete is dirt-ignorant \n\t\tand unschooled in the social arts. \n\t\tMy name on the other hand is Ulysses \n\t\tEverett McGill and you ladies are \n\t\tabout the three prettiest water lilies \n\t\tit's ever been my privilege to admire.\n\n\tNone of the women respond but, as all continue to sing, one \n\tbrings a jug marked with three Xes to Everett.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWhy, thank you dear, that's very, \n\t\tuh...\n\n\tHe takes a swig.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETTE\n</b>\t\tMm.

The stream gurgles. Somewhere, in the \n\tdistance, flies lazily buzz.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tDamn!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FADE IN\n</b>\n<b>\tCLOSE ON DELMAR\n</b>\n\tWe are very tight. Delmar's eyes are closed. We hear loud \n\tsnoring. At length his eyelids flutter open, but the snoring \n\tcontinues.\n\n\tDelmar groggily props himself on one elbow.\n\n\tIt is late afternoon. He is still on the riverbank. Everett \n\tsnores nearby.\n\n\tThe ladies are gone. The hamper of laundry is gone. Pete is \n\tgone.\n\n\tAfter looking blearily about for a moment, Delmar starts and \n\tstaggers to his feet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tHoly Saint Christopher!\n\n\tHe toes Everett urgently in the ribs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWhuhh...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tOh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!\n\n\tPete's clothes are laid out on the ground, not in a heap, \n\tbut mimicking the human shape, as if he had been simply \n\tvaporized fron within them.\n\n\tEverett rouses himself and looks at the clothes: He scans \n\tthe opposite river bank.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tPETE!

They left his \n\t\theart!\n\n\tEverett joins Delmar to look. The rhythmic rising and falling \n\tnow travels up the shirt. A large yellow toad sticks its \n\thead out from under the collar.\n\n\tDelmar keens. Everett is bewildered.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWhat on earth is goin' on here! What's \n\t\tgot into you, Delmar!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tCaintcha see it Everett! Them sigh-\n\t\treens did this to Pete!

Come back!\n\n\tHe slides down the bank after the toad, Everett watching in \n\tperturbation.\n\n\tThe toad plops into the river and Delmar dives in after him. \n\tHe emerges a moment later with the toad wriggling in his \n\thand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tDon't worry, Pete! It's me, Delmar! \n\t\tOh Everett! What're we gonna do?!\n\n<b>\tDRIVING\n</b>\n\tWe hear soft whimpering as Everett drives, sneaking worried \n\tglances over at the passenger seat.\n\n\tDelmar has the toad in his lap. He whimpers as he pets it.\n\n\tEverett hesitantly offers:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\t...I'm not sure that's Pete.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tCourse it's Pete!

Delmar continues to whimper.\n\n\tEverett squints and shakes his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\t...I'm just not sure that's Pete.\n\n<b>\tFINE RESTAURANT\n</b>\n\tThe tables are formally laid with linen. Delmar and Everett \n\tsit at a table, a shoebox between them, deep in conversation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tYou can't display a toad in a fine \n\t\trestaurant like this!

The way I see it he got what \n\t\the deserved - fornicating with some \n\t\twhore a Babylon.  These things-\n\n\tHe points a knife at the shoebox.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\t-don't happen for no reason, Delmar.\n\t\tObviously it's some kind of judgment \n\t\ton Pete's character.\n\n<b>\tANOTHER PATRON\n</b>\n\tWe are looking over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man \n\tin a cream-colored suit and a shirt with powder-blue collar. \n\tHe is digging into a huge plateful of steak and eggs. Sensing \n\tsomething, he looks up, cocks his head, and then slowly turns \n\tto look back.\n\n\tHe thus reveals a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue \n\ttrim; his good eye is looking intently off - at Everett and \n\tDelmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot.\n\n<b>\tBACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR\n</b>\n\tStill heatedly discussing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tThe two of us was fixing to fornicate!\n\n\tThe waitress has just arrived for their order. Everett gives \n\ther an ingratiating laugh:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tHeh-heh. You'll have to excuse my \n\t\trusticated friend here, unaccustomed \n\t\tas he is to city manners.\n\n\tHe ostentatiously fans some of his money.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWell mamzel I guess we'll have a \n\t\tcouple a steaks and some gratinated \n\t\tpotatoes and wash it down with your \n\t\tfinest bubbly wine-\n\n<b>\tBIG MAN\n</b>\n\tWatching Everett fan his money. The big man stops chewing \n\tand slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty \n\tpat.\n\n<b>\tBACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR\n</b>\n\tAs Everett closes his menu.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\t...And I don't suppose the chef'd \n\t\thave any nits or grubs in the pantry, \n\t\tor - naw, never mind, just bring me \n\t\ta couple leafs a raw cabbage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWAITRESS\n</b>\t\tYes sir.\n\n\tThe big man appears as she leaves.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBIG MAN\n</b>\t\tDon't believe I've seen you boys \n\t\taround here before!

He watches as we hear:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tWhere are they?!\n\n\tThere is the sound of a lash and a scream.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tTalk, you unreconstructed whelp of a \n\t\twhore!

They abruptly stop.\n\n\tPete, lying on top of Everett, looks up, startled by loud \n\tchanting. Everett, lying on his back, tries to see as well, \n\this eyes rolling back in his head.\n\n\tTheir point-of-view shows a great open field where men in \n\tbedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross.\n\n\tPete and Everett hastily crabwalk back into the bushes and \n\tthen push through with Delmar.\n\n\tThe ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, \n\tintersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At \n\tlength they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to \n\tface the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning \n\tcross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold.\n\n\tAn aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the \n\tburning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The \n\tbackmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from \n\tthe bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett.\n\n\tAs the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, \n\twhom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBLACK MAN\n</b>\t\tI ain't never harmed any you \n\t\tgentlemen!\n\n\tEverett hisses:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tIt's Tommy!

He thus reveals that his hood has only one eye-\n\thole.\n\n\tHe slowly draws off his hood. It is, of course, Big Dan \n\tTeague. His one good eye looks about; his other eye, now \n\trevealed, is hideously clouded and stares up and off in fixed \n\tsightlessness.\n\n\tEverett, still crouched behind the bushes, notices something. \n\tHe hisses and points.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tThe color guard.\n\n\tOff to one side is a robed and hooded three-man color guard \n\tdisplaying a Confederate flag.\n\n\tIn front of the crowd the Imperial Wizard raises one satin-\n\tdraped arm, and the chanting stops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWIZARD\n</b>\t\tBrothers!

Everett hisses:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tHey Tommy! It's us!\n\n\tBehind Everett in the deep background someone emerges from \n\tthe ranks into the middle aisle.

Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague.\n\n\tHis arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off \n\treturner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging \n\tdistance and trajectory.\n\n\tFrom somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping.\n\n\tThe flag flutters.\n\n\tThe crowd is silent.\n\n\tBig Dan sets and...\n\n\tWHAP!

A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a \n\tman in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being \n\tescorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their \n\tnightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation.\n\n\tEverett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the \n\tlast couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar \n\tcries out:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tGeorge!\n\n\tIt is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his \n\theavy restraints.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n</b>\t\t'Lo, boys!

We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being \n\tnosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout.\n\n\tAs the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed \n\twith light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets, \n\tseveral neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade.\n\n<b>\tPINEY WOODS\n</b>\n\tEverett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWell, at least you boys'll get to \n\t\tsee the old manse - the home where I \n\t\tspent so many happy days in the bosom \n\t\tof my family - a refugium, if you \n\t\twill - with a mighty oak tree out \n\t\tfront and a happy little tire swing...\n\n\tThey emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them. \n\tIt is indeed a peaceful-looking haven with a mighty oak tree \n\tin front. There is, however, no tire swing; instead, three \n\tnooses hang from one stout limb.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tWhere's the happy little tire swing?\n\n\tTwo shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and \n\tpush them forward.\n\n\tMoving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-\n\tdug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough \n\tpine coffin.\n\n\tThe sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the \n\tporch, the drooling hound at his heels.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOOLEY\n</b>\t\tEnd of the road, boys.

Three \n\tgravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from \n\tthe three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas \n\tround their necks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tWaitaminute -\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOOLEY\n</b>\t\tYou have eluded fate - and eluded me - \n\t\tfor the last time.

They look \n\tto Cooley for guidance.\n\n\tSo too does the drooling hound.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\tFinally:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOOLEY\n</b>\t\t...Too bad we don't have a radio.\n\n\tThe goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy \n\ttask.\n\n\tThe gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their \n\tshovels. They begin to sing a slow and dirgelike 'You've Got \n\tto Walk That Lonesome Valley'. Sweat glistens on them and \n\ttrickles down their faces like tears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETE\n</b>\t\tGod have Mercy!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMMY\n</b>\t\tIt ain't fittin'!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tIt ain't the law!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOOLEY\n</b>\t\tThe law.

Delmar bows his head \n\tto silently pray.\n\n\tEverett bows his head as well. He murmurs:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tOh Lord, please look down and \n\t\trecognize us poor sinners... please \n\t\tLord...\n\n\tThe singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\t...I just want to see my daughters \n\t\tagain.  Oh Lord, I've been separated \n\t\tfrom my family for so long...\n\n\tThe mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more \n\tpalpable than audible - the song, it seems, rising out of \n\tthe earth itself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\t...I know I've been guilty of pride \n\t\tand sharp dealing.

Please help \n\t\tus...\n\n\tThe rumble erupts into a deafening roar.\n\n\tA wall of water is crashing through the hollow.\n\n\tIt engulfs everything and everybody. The cabin itself is \n\tripped away; the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their \n\tfeet and all is noise and confusion.\n\n<b>\tUNDERWATER\n</b>\n\tA silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural \n\tslow motion.\n\n\tSuspended around him are scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade.\n\n\tOther objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family \n\tportraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a \n\tfrying pan, a noose, an old banjo, the wild-eyed frantically \n\tpaddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it.\n\n<b>\tFURTHER DOWNHILL\n</b>\n\tThe churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly \n\tcreated river, fast-moving but no longer violent.\n\n\tAfter a beat of hold on the rippling waters, the surface is \n\tbroken by the up-bob of a pine coffin.\n\n\tThe coffin floats downstream for a beat and then Everett \n\tpops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking \n\this head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish \n\tfreeing himself from the rope round his wrists.\n\n\tPete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air.\n\n\tThe men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream. \n\tDazed, they look around.\n\n\tThe inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or \n\ttreetop poking out of the newly formed river. All is quiet \n\texcept for the gurgle of water.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELMAR\n</b>\t\tA miracle! It was a miracle!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEVERETT\n</b>\t\tAw, don't be ignorant, Delmar.
