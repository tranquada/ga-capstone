But\nit's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so\nmuch.\n\nThere is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives\nat FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the\nstomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a\nbeautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any\nnumber of terrific wrestling moves.\n\nFEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.\nFinally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at\nthe Giant.\n\n                         MAN IN BLACK\n             Look are you just fiddling around\n             with me or what?\n\n                         FEZZIK\n             I just want you to feel you're\n             doing well.

All I have to\n             do is divine from what I know of\n             you. Are you the sort of man who\n             would put the poison into his own\n             goblet, or his enemy's?\n\nHe studies the Man In Black now.\n\n                         VIZZINI\n             Now, a clever man would put the\n             poison into his own goblet,\n             because he would know that only a\n             great fool would reach for what\n             he was given. I'm not a great\n             fool, so I can clearly not choose\n             the wine in front of you. But you\n             must have known I was not a great\n             fool; you would have counted on\n             it, so I can clearly not choose\n             the wine in front of me.\n\n                         MAN IN BLACK\n                  (And now there's a\n                  trace of nervousness beginning)\n             You've made your decision then7\n\n                         VIZZINI\n             Not remotely. Because iocane\n             comes from Australia, as everyone\n             knows. And Australia is entirely\n             peopled with criminals. And\n             criminals are used to having\n             people not trust them, as you are\n             not trusted by me. So I can\n             clearly not choose the wine in\n             front of you.\n\n                         MAN IN BLACK\n             Truly, you have a dizzying\n             intellect.\n\n                         VIZZINI\n             Wait till I get going!

And in\n             studying, you must have learned\n             that man is mortal so you would\n             have put the poison as far from\n             yourself as possible, so I can\n             clearly not choose the wine in\n             front of me.\n\nAs Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man\nIn Black's has been fast disappearing.\n\n                         MAN IN BLACK\n             You're trying to trick me into\n             giving away something -- it won't\n             work --\n\n                         VIZZINI\n                  (triumphant)\n             It has worked -- you've given\n             everything away -- I know where\n             the poison is.\n\n                         MAN IN BLACK\n                  (fool's courage)\n             Then make your choice.\n\n                         VIZZINI\n             I will.

The man I\n             inherited it from was not the\n             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.\n                         (MORE)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.\n\n\n                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)\n             His name was Cummerbund. The real\n             Roberts has been retired fifteen\n             years and living like a king in\n             Patagonia.\" Then he explained the\n             name was the important thing for\n             inspiring the necessary fear. You\n             see, no one would surrender to\n             the Dread Pirate Westley.\n\nThe two of them have by now crossed the pond.\n\n                         WESTLEY\n             So we sailed ashore, took on an\n             entirely new crew and he stayed\n             aboard for awhile as first mate,\n             all the time calling me Roberts.\n             Once the crew believed, he left\n             the ship and I have been Roberts\n             ever since. Except, now that\n             we're together, I shall retire\n             and hand the name over to someone\n             else. Is everything clear to you?\n\nButtercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she\nsteps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch\nof it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she\nsinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is\ngone as we --\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nWESTLEY WHIRLING\n\nslashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still\nconnected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,\nand, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the\nlightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,\nbut it settles quickly.\n\nNow nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning\nsand, lovely and lethal.\n\nHOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --\n\nAn odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is\nsuddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into\nview. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably\nno more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs\naround a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.\n\n\nTHE LIGHTNING SAND\n\nas Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes\nout; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls\nto the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nCLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP\n\nHer face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,\nher ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but\nyou have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues\nto pull them to safety --\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nTHE R.0.U.S.\n\nhigh above them; it watches --\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nBUTTERCUP\n\nplaced against a tree.

One,\n             the flame spurts. No problem.\n             There's a popping sound preceding\n             each, we can avoid that. Two, the\n             Lightning Sand. But you were\n             clever enough to discover what\n             that looks like, so in the future\n             we can avoid that too.\n\n                         BUTTERCUP\n             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?\n\n                         WESTLEY\n             Rodents of Unusual Size?

Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He\nhowls.\n\nWestley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.\nHe reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the\nR.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just\nwhen we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly\nrodent clear.\n\nWestley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,\nchanging its target, heading right for --\n\nButtercup, and she's scared to death and --\n\n                         BUTTERCUP\n             Westley!\n\nWestley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing\nonly a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small\nbranch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the\nthing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her\nhem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.\n\n\nWESTLEY\n\njumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,\nsinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nWESTLEY\n\nwith death close at hand, as a popping sound starts.
