LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY\r\n1                                                                    1\r\n\r\n    The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-\r\n    year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT\r\n    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer\r\n    screens.\r\n\r\n    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come\r\n    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down\r\n    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of\r\n    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into\r\n    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and\r\n    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling\r\n    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy\r\n    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his\r\n    early twenties.\r\n\r\n                        SETH\r\n              Is that them?\r\n\r\n                           PETER\r\n              (nods yes)\r\n\r\n                        SETH\r\n              Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large\r\n    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as\r\n    almost every person on the floor watches.\r\n\r\n                        SETH (cont'd)\r\n              Are they going to do it right there?\r\n\r\n                           PETER\r\n              Yeah.\r\n\r\n                           SETH\r\n              Fuck me.\r\n\r\n    WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.\r\n\r\n                        WILL EMERSON\r\n                  (whispered)\r\n              Have you guys ever seen this before?\r\n\r\n                           SETH\r\n              No.\r\n\r\n                        WILL EMERSON\r\n              Best to just ignore it. Keep your head\r\n              down and get back to work... and don't\r\n              watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                               2.\r\n1   CONTINUED:                                                   1\r\n\r\n    The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a\r\n    piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person\r\n    and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one\r\n    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and\r\n    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS\r\n    then stops a bit down from them.\r\n\r\n                           HEATHER\r\n                 Timothy Singh?\r\n\r\n                              TIMOTHY\r\n                 Yes.\r\n\r\n                           HEATHER\r\n                 I'm afraid we have to speak with you.\r\n\r\n    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with\r\n    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP\r\n    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost\r\n    back into the numbers on his computer screen.\r\n\r\n    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing\r\n    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer\r\n    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until\r\n    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and\r\n    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off\r\n    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.\r\n\r\n                              HEATHER (cont'd)\r\n                 Eric Dale?\r\n\r\n                              PETER\r\n                 Excuse me?\r\n\r\n                              HEATHER\r\n                 Eric Dale?\r\n\r\n                              PETER\r\n                 No.\r\n\r\n                              HEATHER\r\n                 Sorry?\r\n\r\n                           PETER\r\n                 I'm not Eric Dale.\r\n\r\n                           HEATHER\r\n                 Oh.

He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is\r\n     not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.\r\n     He carries himself without much exception.

The problem, which is I guess\r\n               why we are here tonight, is that it takes\r\n               us... the firm... almost a month to layer\r\n               these products correctly thereby posing a\r\n               challenge from a risk management\r\n               standpoint.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n               We have to hold these assets on our books\r\n               longer than we might ideally like to.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                 50.\r\n45   CONTINUED: (3)                                                45\r\n\r\n                          JOHN TULD\r\n               Yes.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n               But the key factor is these are\r\n               essentially just mortgages, so that has\r\n               allowed us to push the leverage\r\n               considerably beyond what you might be\r\n               willing, or allowed to do in any other\r\n               circumstance, thereby pushing the risk\r\n               profile without raising any red flags.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               And how far have we pushed that profile\r\n               tonight Mr. Sullivan?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n               We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion\r\n               dollars... at MBS alone.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               Give or take.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n               Give or take.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and\r\n               give me a little rope here, what I am\r\n               guessing that your report here says is\r\n               that considering the, shall we say bumpy\r\n               road, we've been on the last week or so\r\n               that the numbers that your brilliant co-\r\n               workers up the line ahead of you had come\r\n               up with in the past don't seem to make\r\n               much sense anymore considering what's\r\n               taking place today?\r\n\r\n                          PETER\r\n               Actually not taking place today but\r\n               what's already taken place over the last\r\n               two weeks.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               So what you're saying is it's already\r\n               happened?\r\n\r\n                          PETER\r\n               Sort of.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say\r\n               that means for us here?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                 51.\r\n45   CONTINUED: (4)                                                45\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n               Well, that's where it becomes a\r\n               projection.

JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard.\r\n     He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into\r\n     the city.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is\r\n               that the music appears to be about to\r\n               stop and we are going to be holding the\r\n               biggest bag of stinking shit ever\r\n               assembled in the history of capitalism?\r\n\r\n     Everyone looks back at PETER.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)\r\n               Mr. Sullivan?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n               Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that\r\n               way but let me clarify using your\r\n               analogy, what this model shows is the\r\n               music, so to speak, just slowing, if the\r\n               music were to stop, as you put it, then\r\n               this model would not be even close to\r\n               that scenario.

She\r\n     calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes\r\n     it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass\r\n     wall separating her office from the floor giving herself\r\n     total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She\r\n     reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically\r\n     preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work.\r\n     She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her\r\n     face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give\r\n     way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can't\r\n     believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods\r\n     her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no\r\n     tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it\r\n     isn't real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to\r\n     herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real.\r\n     She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can\r\n     only openly express even to herself... nothing.\r\n\r\n     I/E.

There is going to be\r\n                  considerable turmoil in the markets for\r\n                  the foreseeable future. They believe that\r\n                  it is better to have this turmoil begin\r\n                  with us... as a result the firm has\r\n                  decided to liquidate the majority of its\r\n                  position of fixed income MBS today.\r\n\r\n     An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the\r\n     traders in the room.\r\n\r\n                            SAM ROGERS (cont'd)\r\n                  You should be getting a breakdown right\r\n                  now, you will see the accounts you are\r\n                  responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't\r\n                  taken you long to understand the\r\n                  implications of this sale on your\r\n                  relationships with your counterparties\r\n                  and as a result on your careers. I have\r\n                  expressed this reality to the executive\r\n                  committee and they understand. As a\r\n                  result, if you are able to complete a 93%\r\n                  sale of your assets you will receive a\r\n                  1.4 million dollar one off bonus.\r\n                            (MORE)\r\n\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                  89.\r\n67   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 67\r\n                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)\r\n               If the floor as a whole is able to\r\n               achieve a 93% sale we all get an\r\n               additional 1.3 million a piece. Because\r\n               of this, if you burn through your\r\n               allotment by noon, get moving around the\r\n               floor and start picking up other guys\r\n               leftovers...\r\n\r\n     SAM stops for a second and looks around the room.\r\n\r\n                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)\r\n               For those of you who have never been\r\n               through this before, this is what the\r\n               beginning of a fire sale looks like. I\r\n               don't have to tell any of you that the\r\n               first hour and a half is going to be very\r\n               important.

This is obviously not the way any\r\n               of us would like for this to be going\r\n               down, but the ground is shifting below\r\n               our feet, and there appears to be no\r\n               other way out.\r\n\r\n     SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees\r\n     that they indeed know what needs to be done.\r\n\r\n                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)\r\n               Obviously... this is a very unique\r\n               situation... if we are successful today\r\n               we will have been successful in\r\n               destroying our own jobs...

JOHN\r\n     walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into\r\n     the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He\r\n     looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he\r\n     climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a\r\n     general.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               By the end of today almost everyone else\r\n               in the world, including me, will have\r\n               considerably less money than they began\r\n               the day with..... You, in this room, are\r\n               the exception. You will leave here today\r\n               richer. You will fire the first shot, I\r\n               wish it didn't have to be, but at times\r\n               the market must eat its weak, and you\r\n               all... are not the weak. We must strike\r\n               quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause\r\n               on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is\r\n               going to be in here getting in your\r\n               faces, sniffing around, you let us take\r\n               care of them and you just keep going. We\r\n               own what we are choosing to sell today\r\n               and there is nothing they can do about\r\n               it. 107 years ago this firm was founded,\r\n               today we secure our place for next 107.\r\n               You've got two minutes before we get\r\n               started. Let's finish this, so we can get\r\n               on to the next one...\r\n\r\n     JOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing\r\n     off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then\r\n     heads into his office.\r\n\r\n     INT.

Through the glass you see the trading floor go\r\n     wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares\r\n     into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs\r\n     begin to move. We just see the back of his head.\r\n\r\n     INT.

SAM sits, staring at his computers.\r\n     There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we\r\n     hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up\r\n     and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway.\r\n\r\n                            JARED COHEN\r\n               Well done.\r\n\r\n                         SAM ROGERS\r\n               They did alright.\r\n\r\n                         JARED COHEN\r\n               I wanted to give you a heads up.

I'm out.\r\n\r\n                            TULD\r\n                  You'll get the bonus, the options, and\r\n                  keep your current base, but I need you to\r\n                  stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?\r\n\r\n     They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually\r\n     a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another\r\n     hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.\r\n\r\n                            TULD (cont'd)\r\n                  For God's sake man put a smile on your\r\n                  face, you did some good today, you said\r\n                  so yourself. I'm starting to feel a\r\n                  little better about this whole thing.\r\n                  You're one of the luckiest guys in the\r\n                  world, you could've been digging ditches\r\n                  all these years...\r\n\r\n     SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                 93.\r\n73   CONTINUED: (2)                                                73\r\n\r\n                         SAM ROGERS\r\n               That's true, and if I had been at least\r\n               there'd be some holes in the ground to\r\n               show for it. I'm just not quite sure how\r\n               we fucked this thing up so badly.\r\n\r\n     This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be\r\n     losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.\r\n\r\n                         TULD\r\n               Jesus, when did you start feeling so\r\n               sorry for yourself, it's unbearable...\r\n               What, you think we may have helped put\r\n               some people out of business today? That\r\n               it's all just for naught? Well you've\r\n               been doing that everyday for almost forty\r\n               years Sam. And if all this is for naught\r\n               then so is everything else out there.\r\n               It's just money, it's made up, a piece of\r\n               paper with some pictures on it so we\r\n               don't all kill each other trying to get\r\n               something to eat. But it's not wrong and\r\n               it's certainly not any different today\r\n               than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797,\r\n               1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37,\r\n               `73, and 1987... God damn did that\r\n               motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97,\r\n               2000, and whatever this is gonna be\r\n               called. They're just the same thing over\r\n               and over. We can't help ourselves, and\r\n               you and I can't control it, stop it, slow\r\n               it, or even ever so slightly alter it...\r\n               We just react... and we get paid well for\r\n               it if we're right... and get left by the\r\n               side of the road if we're wrong. There's\r\n               always been and there's always gonna be\r\n               the same percentage of winners and\r\n               losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat\r\n               pigs and starving dogs in this world...\r\n               yes there may be more of us today... but\r\n               the percentages... they always stay\r\n               exactly the same.\r\n\r\n     They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks\r\n     down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.\r\n\r\n                         SAM ROGERS\r\n               I'll do it John, but not because of your\r\n               little speech, but because I need the\r\n               money. I'm not sure how it could possibly\r\n               be after all these years, but I need the\r\n               money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                  94.\r\n73   CONTINUED: (3)                                                 73\r\n\r\n     They both look at each other again, then look over and see\r\n     JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER\r\n     SULLIVAN next to him.\r\n\r\n                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)\r\n               You're keeping the kid?\r\n\r\n                         JOHN TULD\r\n               Keeping him?
