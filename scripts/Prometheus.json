We move with the\r\n          shadow. We cast the shadow.\r\n                         \r\n          Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:\r\n          river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.\r\n          No trace of civilization.\r\n                         \r\n          The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an\r\n          ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a\r\n          VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

Their skin is snow-white.\r\n          Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker\r\n          had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and\r\n          hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.\r\n                         \r\n          Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.\r\n                         \r\n          They are ENGINEERS.\r\n                         \r\n          Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.\r\n                         \r\n          The third is naked.\r\n                         \r\n          One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:\r\n          inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.\r\n                         \r\n          The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.\r\n          It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises\r\n          the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.\r\n                         \r\n          BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his\r\n          lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.\r\n                         \r\n          Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of\r\n          teeth, black blood, dissolving bone.

When they reach\r\n          his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a\r\n          felled tree.

JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many\r\n          disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.\r\n                         \r\n          The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt\r\n          - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.\r\n                         \r\n          Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a\r\n          rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:\r\n          we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.\r\n                         \r\n          The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers.

Steps into it.\r\n                         \r\n          The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting\r\n          him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen\r\n          bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid.\r\n                         \r\n          But this suit is not withered.

A wilderness of lightning, fire, and twisted metal. A\r\n          thunderstorm with dust instead of rain.\r\n                         \r\n          She looks back through the darkness.\r\n                         \r\n          In a strobe-light flicker of lightning, she sees a gray demon\r\n          approaching through the wreckage.\r\n                         \r\n          She scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull\r\n          fragment...running and clambering...\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of\r\n          the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered\r\n          compartments. Jetsam.\r\n                         \r\n          Her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night:\r\n          searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer.\r\n                         \r\n          She stumbles into the remains of the Magellan's laboratory.\r\n                         \r\n          A hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground. Watts climbs\r\n          inside. Pulls the lid shut.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the\r\n          plexiglass, holding her breath.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's\r\n          head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the\r\n          head - GROWING as she watches.\r\n                         \r\n          Her suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING.\r\n          The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat.\r\n                         \r\n          Watts is paralyzed.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With\r\n          sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer\r\n          flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase\r\n          through fragments of burning metal.\r\n                         \r\n          Watts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees\r\n          she's tripped over a HULL SAW - the same diamond-bladed tool\r\n          DAVID used to dismantle the terraforming engine.\r\n                         \r\n          She seizes the saw - straining to manage its weight. Hides in\r\n          the hollow of a massive girder.\r\n<b>           114.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          The Alien passes by. Scenting the air. She freezes. Her arms\r\n          trembling with the weight of the saw. Waiting for it to pass.\r\n                         \r\n          Almost it leaves. But a tiny rattle of metal from the\r\n          quivering saw brings it back.\r\n                         \r\n          Out of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up\r\n          to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment.\r\n                         \r\n          The diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws.\r\n                         \r\n          The monster screams and recoils.\r\n                         \r\n          Its lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground,\r\n          injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury.\r\n                         \r\n          Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She\r\n          rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh\r\n          with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground.\r\n                         \r\n          Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on\r\n          the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her\r\n          faceplate. Its hideous jaws open.\r\n                         \r\n          With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her\r\n          leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt.\r\n          Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw.\r\n                         \r\n          She meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade.\r\n                         \r\n<b>          IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet.\r\n                         \r\n          The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw\r\n          still growling.\r\n                         \r\n          Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast.\r\n                         \r\n          With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off\r\n          as it crumples and melts.\r\n                         \r\n          She stands bare-headed in the toxic air.
