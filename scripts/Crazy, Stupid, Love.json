Once he's settled, Jacob continues:\r\n                         \r\n                          JACOB\r\n           As I said, I've been watching you\r\n           for two days now and I can say, \r\n           without hesitation, that you are\r\n           the sorriest man I've ever seen in\r\n           my life -- don't interrupt, Cal,\r\n           it's the truth, and you need to\r\n           hear it. You're sitting there\r\n           with your Supercut haircut,\r\n           getting drunk on watered down\r\n           vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-\r\n           year-old girl, wearing a 41R\r\n           jacket when you should be wearing\r\n           a 40L -- I don't know if I want to\r\n           help you or euthanize you\r\n           -- stop drinking out of the\r\n           goddamn straw, Cal. \r\n                         \r\n           Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw. \r\n                         \r\n                          JACOB\r\n           You asked me for advice before, \r\n           Cal, so I'm going to help you. I \r\n           don't know why. Maybe I'm just\r\n           bored. Maybe all my friends have\r\n           abandoned me for wives and\r\n           children and labradoodle puppies,\r\n           who cares why? Why doesn't\r\n           matter. The point is, you've got\r\n           a good face, and a good head of\r\n           hair, and I'm bored as hell and\r\n           need a project. So if you want,\r\n           I'm going to help you rediscover\r\n           your manhood.

Cal\r\n           goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches\r\n           himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAL\r\n           Yeah, okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          JACOB\r\n           Mall food court, Thursday, six\r\n           o'clock.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAL\r\n           I'm sorry, what?\r\n                         \r\n           Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby). \r\n                         \r\n                          JACOB\r\n           You ready to go? \r\n                         \r\n           She nods, subservient, and follows him out.\r\n                         \r\n           Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the\r\n           rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.\r\n                         \r\n          19 EXT. THE WEAVER BACKYARD - DAY (ONE WEEK LATER) 19 \r\n                         \r\n           A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes. A \r\n           long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized \r\n           U-HAUL is parked in the driveway. \r\n                         \r\n           Cal EXITS the back door, carrying a BOX.

You can \r\n           tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball \r\n           equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son \r\n           catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house. \r\n                         \r\n           You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this \r\n           backyard.

Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats. \r\n           It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward \r\n           silence. Neither knows what to say. \r\n                         \r\n                          TRACY \r\n           I just wanted to say that... \r\n                         \r\n           Her voice cracks.

Instinct tells \r\n           him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops \r\n           himself. She realizes this.

I used to think that \r\n           growing up meant really growing. \r\n           Like getting taller and bigger. \r\n           But now I think that growing up \r\n           just makes you smaller. Your \r\n           dreams get smaller, and what you \r\n           want gets smaller... \r\n           (beat, then) \r\n           I grew an inch and a half this \r\n           year, but I feel a lot smaller. \r\n                         \r\n           Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned. \r\n                         \r\n                          ROBBIE \r\n           I was in love.
