Convinced he's found \n               something, he quickens his pace.

He moves through this room, \n               into the\n\n<b>               COMPUTER ROOM\n</b>\n               20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed \n               table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no \n               expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital \n               screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour \n               drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). \n               There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of \n               the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).\n\n               Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. \n               Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings \n               are of desks or tables with computers.\n\n               Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a \n               workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant \n               at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. \n               Milo passes it. And comes back to it.\n\n               Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still \n               occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the \n               bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- \n               numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is \n               a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his \n               frustration evident.\n\n               As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the \n               screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve \n               into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in \n               Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now).\n\n               When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK \n               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the \n               screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images.

The stations are of various \n               shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed \n               view of screen &amp; keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are \n               present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A \n               Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there.\n\n<b>               INT.

Among the menus he can choose from are: \n<b>               TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS.\n</b>\n               He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal \n               Tech, etc.).

MILO'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen.\n\n               He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen \n               in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her \n               hair is askew.\n\n<b>                                     ALICE\n</b>                         I'm a mess!
