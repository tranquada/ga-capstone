The sparkling surface\n    turns out to be a lot of   carats. WE SEE the stone, then\n    the ring, then suddenly,   in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS\n    by. REVEAL a mechanical    claw above the ring, hanging\n    from a crane. The ring    sits in a sea of tiny dolls,\n    joke eyeballs, and other   carnival junk.\n    The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes\n    catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it --\n    accompanied by OOHS and AAHS (O.S.) of hope and disap-\n    pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man\n    working the controls. The EYES of a young black woman\n    watching him work. Another guy's HANDS digging in his\n    pocket for change.

QUICK CUTS\n    of their FACES as the   crane rises. A very pretty lady.\n    A beefy Latino with a   two-day beard. Their apprehension.\n    Tommy's confidence.    Then his exceptional smile.

I'll never forget when he\n              said 'Welfare is a drug -- and you\n              gotta kick it cold turkey.' It\n              was... inspirational.\n\n                            VERA JOHNSON\n              Really... well, I'm sure...\n                            TOMMY\n              And I was actually in the audience\n              when he said, 'If you people would\n              just get off your dead asses and\n              look for work, this country might\n              be fit to live in again.'
