Then stops...as\n     a quizzical look spreads across his face.\n\n     After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the\n     pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.\n\n     Then Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in\n     his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like\n     it's... well, not a pie.\n\n<b>     EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n     Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase.\n\n<b>     INT.
