JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     PAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded\n     shirts...pants...socks...and hear\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)\n               Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.\n\n                         JIM (O.S.)\n               Yeah, I'm the best, baby.\n\n     Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear.  Or, more\n     appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in\n     and out.  Bars scroll across it.  And we get occasional\n     glimpses of what looks like --\n\n                         JIM (O.S.)(CONT'D)\n               ...oh -- that was a tit, tits...\n\n     As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is\n     possible to watch the pay channels while they're\n     scrambled.  You just need a decent imagination to fill in\n     the rest of the picture.  We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17,\n     short, horny.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)\n               Give it to me!  Yes!\n\n                         JIM\n               Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.\n\n     Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe.\n     We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next\n     to Jim on his bed.  \"Cosmopolitan\" is open to a sexy\n     model...a yearbook is open to the \"girl's swim team\"\n     section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the\n     \"Vagina\" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)\n               Don't you love my sexy body?!\n\n                         JIM\n               I do, baby, I do.\n\n     He frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off\n     the floor.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)\n               You're so big!\n\n                         JIM\n               Yeah, that's right.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)\n                   (deep macho voice)\n               Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl!\n\n     Jim is thrown off.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(CONT'D)\n               Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad!\n\n                         JIM\n               Man, shut up!\n\n     Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after\n     which JIM'S MOM enters.  Jim scrambles and quickly covers\n     himself and the dictionary with a pillow.  She's\n     oblivious to his doings.\n\n                         JIM'S MOM\n               Hey, Jimmy.

Damn cable.  There's this\n               nature show that I'm trying to watch.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)\n               Fuck me!  Yes!\n\n                         JIM\n               Uh...\n\n     He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE,\n     but instead the VOLUME GOES UP.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)\n               BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!!\n\n     Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked.\n\n                         JIM\n                   (choking)\n               Must...be...broken...\n\n     JIM'S DAD enters.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               What the heck is this?\n\n                         JIM\n               Nothing!\n\n                         JIM'S MOM\n               I think he's trying to watch one of\n               the illegal channels.\n\n                         JIM\n               Jesus, Mom!  They're not illegal!\n               They're pay channels.  How could a\n               television channel be illegal?!  God,\n               get a clue!\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               James, don't speak that way to your\n               mother!\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)\n               Play with my hairy balls!\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               Turn that garbage off!  Give me that!\n\n     Jim's Dad grabs for the remote, which is sitting on the\n     pillow that's been covering Jim.  The pillow gets brushed\n     aside -- revealing the Big Vagina Diagram, Jim with his\n     shorts down, and a very strategically placed tube sock.\n\n                         JIM'S MOM\n               Oh my God!\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               Honey, why don't you let me handle this\n               one.\n\n     He ushers her out.  Jim's Dad is stuck there with his\n     half-naked son.  Horrible, awful embarrassment.  A long,\n     strained beat.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)\n               Jesus Christ.  The dictionary?  Hell,\n               son, I'll buy you some dirty\n               magazines.\n\n     Jim's Dad exits, shaking his head.  Jim sits agape,\n     humiliated.\n\n                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)\n               Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me!\n\n     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS - DAY\n\n     We see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits:\n     \"Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan -- A Great Place\n     To Be\"\n\n     EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - DAY\n\n     The front of the school.  KEVIN drives up in his Accord.\n     He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school\n     senior.  VICKY rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident.\n     She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big\n     \"Vanderbilt\" return address on it.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.\n               You got in.\n\n                         VICKY\n               You think so?\n\n     She tears it open.  Pulls out a course catalog, various\n     forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               \"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but\n               after keeping you on the wait list for\n               the past couple months, we've decided\n               you are now rejected.

Then she LAUGHS, and gives Kevin a big kiss and\n     hug.\n\n                         VICKY\n               I love you!\n\n     She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled,\n     almost perfunctorily returning the hug.\n\n     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - MORNING\n\n     Jim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- \"OZ\" -- a cocky\n     senior with a football-player build.

EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     Jim and Oz, now joined by Kevin, walk down the hall.  Oz\n     bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it\n     again.  Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Then she said -- she loves me.\n\n                         OZ\n               Oh shit dude, the L-word!\n\n                         JIM\n               And you said...\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Nothing, I just hugged her back.\n\n                         JIM\n               You think she was serious?\n\n                         KEVIN\n               I couldn't tell -- She could've meant\n               like, \"I love you grandma\" or \"I love\n               you Vanderbilt.\"\n\n                         OZ\n               Just don't bring it up, hang low,\n               maybe she won't mention it again.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY\n\n     The guys pass by a GROUP OF BAND DORKS, most notable of\n     which is MICHELLE, who proudly polishes her flute.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               And what we should do today, in band?\n               Instead of playing our instruments\n               regularly?  We should play them\n               backwards!  That'll be so funny!\n\n     The Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, \"hilariously\" attempting\n     to play their instruments from the wrong end.

The party is long over.  Plastic beer\n     cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not\n     trashed.\n\n     Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head.  He\n     stumbles over a body.  It's Kevin.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Ow, what the hell?\n\n                         JIM\n               Sorry, I thought you were dead.\n\n     They walk over to the other side of the room.  Finch is\n     sitting on the couch.\n\n                         FINCH\n               Good morning gentleman.\n\n                         JIM\n               Finch!

Takes a seat, sulking.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Feeling better, Oz?\n\n                         OZ\n               I'm such a loser.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               That's the spirit.\n\n     We hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the stairs.  It's the\n     CENTRAL GIRL.  She wears a \"Central\" sweatshirt.  Sherman\n     follows behind her.  The guys watch in disbelief as\n     Sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately.\n\n                         SHERMAN\n                   (snippets of conversation)\n               ...I'll never forget...thank you.\n\n     The Central Girl smiles.  Notices the other guys\n     watching.  Just gives Sherman a kiss on the cheek.\n\n                         CENTRAL GIRL\n               Bye.\n\n     She exits.  The guys are dumbfounded.  Jaws hang.\n     Sherman looks triumphant.  Strides over to the guys.\n\n                         JIM\n               You did it.\n\n                         SHERMAN\n               Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman,\n               the boy.

Best of luck to you,\n               boys.\n\n     Sherman exits.  Silence.  The guys look like they just\n     lost the World Series on errors.  They slowly take seats,\n     ruined.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               I put in months of quality time with\n               Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one\n               night and scores?

We\n               make an agreement -- no wait, more\n               than an agreement.\n\n                         JIM\n               Like a bet?\n\n                         KEVIN\n               No, a pact.  No money involved.  This\n               is more important than any bet.  Now\n               here's the deal: We all get laid\n               before we graduate.\n\n     A beat\n\n                         OZ\n               Dude, it's not like I haven't been\n               trying to get laid.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               This is different.

Someone to keep you motivated.\n\n     Oz nods, getting into it.  Kevin smiles and continues,\n     arms outspread.\n\n                         KEVIN (CONT'D)\n               That's what we are, we keep each other\n               on track.

No funny stuff.  And\n               no prostitutes, if you were thinking\n               about that, Finch.\n\n     Finch gives a wistful \"Who, me?\"\n\n                         KEVIN (CONT'D)\n               So, I'm thinking prom is basically our\n               last big chance.\n\n                         OZ\n               Dude, prom sucks.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               I know, but think about it -- At the\n               parties that night.

And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING\n     FOR SEX MONTAGE:\n\n     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Jim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow\n     pages.  Finds a \"Floral Delivery\" listing.  Kevin dials.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY\n\n     Kevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together,\n     which Kevin takes.  They part ways.\n\n     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Oz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in\n     confusion.  A Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain\n     pottery with little sponges.  Oz looks dubious.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY\n\n     Finch is unpacking his lunch.  He carefully unfolds a\n     napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed.  Other than\n     that, he's doing absolutely nothing.\n\n     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera\n     attached to his computer.  The computer screen reads, \"E-\n     DATE:  We Make Love Happen.\"  As Jim fiddles with the\n     camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image.\n     He clicks an onscreen-button labeled \"FREEZE IMAGE\" --\n     the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace.\n     The screen reads, \"IMAGE SENT.\"\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGHS - LIBRARY - DAY\n\n     Kevin holds a copy of the HOLY BIBLE.  We see he's in the\n     \"Religion\" section.  Surrounded by piles of different\n     bibles.  No luck.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY\n\n     Finch pulls out a small mustard packet.  He neatly snips\n     the end with scissors.  Then rolls the packet, like a\n     tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last\n     bit of mustard.\n\n     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jim is on his computer.  The screen reads \"YOU HAVE 00\n     REPLIES.\"  Jim is nonplussed.\n\n     INT.

Kevin holds a big\n     shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms\n     falls out.  He hands it over to Jim...and we see that the\n     guys' packs are full of various condom boxes.\n\n     INT.

Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of\n     PERFECT 10.\n\n                         JIM\n               Uh...dad...\n\n     Jim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               Go ahead son, there's more.\n\n     Beyond embarrassed, Jim reaches into the bag.  Cringes.\n     Pulls out a PENTHOUSE.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)\n               Now, that one's a little more...a\n               little more...graphic.\n\n                         JIM\n               I know, Dad.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               Oh, okay.

EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BACK OF LIBRARY - DAY\n\n     Kevin is walking through the \"Religion\" Section.  He\n     carefully looks about, making sure nobody's watching.\n\n                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)\n               It originally started as a sex manual,\n               this book that some guys brought back\n               from Amsterdam in the early eighties.\n               What to do with your tongue, things\n               like that.  And each year, it got\n               passed on to one East student who was\n               worthy of it.\n\n     Kevin kneels down on the floor, near a section of various\n     bibles on the bottom shelf.\n\n                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)\n               After a couple years, guys started\n               adding their own techniques.  Things\n               they figured out themselves.\n\n     Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom\n     shelf.  Pulls out a pocket knife.  Flips up the bottom of\n     the shelf.  Slides it out.\n\n                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)\n               You have to keep it a secret, and\n               return it at the end of the year.  So,\n               now you know.  Good luck.\n\n     There, a bit dusty, is an old book.  Many extra pages of\n     notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking\n     the binding.  The original title is now obscured -- over\n     it, someone has written \"The Bible.\"\n\n     Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's\n     like that right now.\n\n     Kevin carefully pulls it out.  Reverently flips through\n     it.  Full of details.  Explicit diagrams.  Anecdotes.\n     And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the\n     date it was added.\n\n     Kevin reaches the last page.  It's blank.  He lightly\n     runs his hand down the empty page.\n\n     INT.

I'm home!\n\n     No response.  Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a\n     fresh-baked pie on the counter.  Next to it is a note:\n     \"Jimmy - Apple, your favorite.  I'll be home late.\n     Enjoy!  Love Mom.\"\n\n     Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  Then stops...as\n     a quizzical look spreads across his face.\n\n     After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the\n     pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.\n\n     Then Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in\n     his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like\n     it's... well, not a pie.\n\n     EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase.\n\n     INT.

You've never seen such disappointment...\n     but he's trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake.\n\n     In the middle of the table is the pie.  It's decimated.\n     Mushed up, ruined...violated.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n                   (fighting back tears)\n               I guess...we'll just tell your\n               mother...that we ate it all.\n\n     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Late.  Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the\n     Bible.\n\n     If all students studied the way Kevin's studying this\n     book, we'd have a nation of geniuses.  He's scrutinizing\n     it.  Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to\n     decipher cave paintings.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\n     The Vocal Jazz Group is doing a song.  Oz is singing\n     along, really making it look like he's into it.  He\n     closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm.  As\n     the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his\n     shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal \"scat\" to tag the\n     number.

Looks at Kevin.\n\n     EXT. VICKY'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Vicky's perfect suburban home...as we hear VICKY MOANING\n     IN ECSTASY.\n\n                         VICKY (V.O.)\n               Oh...ungghhhhh!\n\n                         KEVIN (V.O.)\n               Shhhh.

Vicky's legs\n     are to both sides of him -- he's ducking down, consulting\n     the bible, which is hidden beneath the bed.  It's open to\n     a page titled \"The Tongue Tornado.\"\n\n     Kevin resumes, out of frame.  Vicky goes nuts.\n\n                         VICKY (cont'd)\n                   (a little too loudly)\n               Oh, God!\n\n     Vicky reaches blindly for a pillow.

Fmmkkkk!\n\n     Noticing that Vicky now can't see him, Kevin cautiously\n     pulls out The Bible from under the bed.  Sets it next to\n     her.  He constantly refers from the book to Vicky, and\n     back again.\n\n     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     VICKY'S MOM is straining some pasta.  On the fridge, we\n     see a collage in tribute to Vicky -- her senior portrait,\n     National Honor Society certificate, a report card.\n\n                         VICKY'S MOM\n                   (yells to Vicky's Dad)\n               Hon?

JIM'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Jim's door opens...he winces...REVERSE to see Jim's dad\n     looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the\n     hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's\n     door.\n\n                         JIM\n               Hey, dad.  Did you knock?\n\n     Jim's dad continues to study the picture.  A beat.  Then\n     he turns around, like he just realized the door was open.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol'\n               family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a\n               good one.\n\n     Jim can only shrugs in response.  He goes into the hall\n     and looks at the portrait.  A beat.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)\n               Son, I wanted to talk to you about\n               what I think you were trying to do the\n               other day.\n\n     Jim's face drops, seeing his death unfold.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)\n                   (continuing with his prepared\n                    speech)\n               Now, you may have tried it in the\n               shower, or maybe in bed at night, and\n               not even known what you were doing.\n               Or perhaps you've heard your friends\n               talking about it in the locker room.\n\n     Jim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide.\n\n                         JIM\n               Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I\n               know what you're talking about.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               Sure you know, son, but I think you've\n               been having a little problem with it.\n               It's okay, though.  What you're doing\n               is perfectly normal.  It's like\n               practice.  Like when you play tennis\n               against a wall.  Some day, there'll be\n               a partner returning the ball.\n                   (a beat)\n               You do want a partner, don't you son?\n\n                         JIM\n                   (through clenched teeth)\n               Yes.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD\n               That's great.  Now remember, it's okay\n               to play with yourself.  Or, as I\n               always called it --\n                   (elbows Jim)\n               \"Stroke the salami!\"\n                   (chuckles)\n               Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be\n               ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and\n               I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle\n               Mort masturbates.  We all masturbate.\n\n     Nauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble\n     back into his room.  He SMACKS the doorframe.  Keeps\n     going, slamming the door behind him.  A beat.\n\n                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)\n               Poor guy thought he was the only one.\n\n     EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY\n\n     The football field also doubles as the lacrosse field.\n     East Great Falls is battling Central.  It's a rough game,\n     muddy, brutal.  We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing\n     very tough.\n\n     On the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up.  She's\n     watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's\n     agility and domination.  Oz runs up the field, cradling\n     the ball in his stick.  A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to\n     check him.  Heather cringes with each impact, and is then\n     excited to see Oz dodge his opponents.\n\n     Finally, Oz scores with a triumphant YELL.  Heather\n     CHEERS with the crowd as the EGF players congratulate\n     each other.\n\n     EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY\n\n     After the game.  Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the\n     sidelines.  He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL\n     snags him --\n\n                         COACH MARSHALL\n               Good work, Ostreicher.\n\n                         OZ\n               Thanks coach.\n\n                         COACH MARSHALL\n               You're a killer, Ozzy!\n\n                         OZ\n                   (trying to get away)\n               -- Thanks, coach --\n\n     FOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in\n     mud.\n\n                           OZ\n               Hey, what're you doing here?\n\n                         HEATHER\n               Just enjoying my exhilarating first\n               lacrosse experience.

After a moment, he slowly heads in.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - LATER\n\n     Oz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite\n     ends of the room.  It's a pop, contemporary arrangement\n     of \"HOW SWEET IT IS.\"  It sounds jazzy, cool.\n\n     Oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him.  He\n     sings along, distant.  Heather, almost defiantly, sings\n     clearer and better than ever.  Oz watches her, though she\n     never looks his way.  At the bride of the song, Heather\n     breaks into a solo.  She sings beautifully.  Oz is\n     hooked.\n\n     The Choir Teacher halts the song.\n\n                         CHOIR TEACHER\n               Okay, Heather, that was good, but I\n               want to thicken up that solo.\n               Michigan State is this Saturday, and I\n               want that part to smoke.\n\n                         HEATHER\n               I know, my timing's off.\n\n                         CHOIR TEACHER\n               A little, but I think it'll work\n               better as a duet.

Jim is whimpering.\n\n                         NADIA\n               It is too bad.  I was at first hoping\n               you would ask me to the prom.  But...\n\n     She gathers her things.  Eyes Jim over.\n\n                         NADIA (cont'd)\n               You should change your shorts.\n\n                         JIM\n               ...okay.\n\n     Jim is stunned.  Ruined.  Nadia exits.  CLOSE on Jim's\n     tormented face as we hear...\n\n                         COMPUTER VOICE\n               \"You have lost your internet\n               connection.  Click 'okay' to\n               reconnect.\"\n\n     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY\n\n     Jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed.  A\n     COUPLE GIRLS pass by him, giggling.  He trudges\n     along...noticing a CLIQUE OF GIRLS staring at him as he\n     passes by...and Stoner #1 giving him a peace sign...and\n     the Computer Nerd staring at him like a celebrity......\n     Jim's pace slows.  He hears a SNICKER behind him...he\n     slows even more, taking very careful steps...as he sees a\n     GIRL doing a really strange dance -- and his eyes pop out\n     as he sees that, yes, it's his dance.  He stops.  ALMOST\n     EVERYONE is staring at him.  Jim pulls his coat up over\n     his face and hurries off into the school, like a fugitive\n     avoiding the media.  People APPLAUD and LAUGH.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     Kevin and Oz catch up to Jim.  Here and there, people\n     still give Jim funny looks.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Hey, minuteman.\n\n                         JIM\n               Shut up.

I don't think they liked\n               it.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               How do you know that?\n\n                         JIM\n               She's already on a plane back home.\n\n     Kevin winces.\n\n                         JIM (cont'd)\n               You know, maybe I'm just not good with\n               girls, period.  Like I was born\n               without that part of the brain.  I\n               mean, I can't talk to girls.  And when\n               I do talk to them, I screw it up.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Yeah?  Well come prom night, those\n               excuses aren't going to do you much\n               good.\n\n                         JIM\n               Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.\n\n     A nearby OLD JANITOR starts GUFFAWING at Jim as he walks\n     by.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n     Jim sits, waiting for class to start.  Miserable.  Some\n     students are obviously talking about him in the\n     background.  Others study and chat.\n\n     Next to Jim is Michelle -- the reject, band dork that\n     we've seen earlier.  She's got a flute case on her desk.\n     She's blabbering to Jim.  The kind of blabbering where\n     every other sentence sounds like a question, even though\n     it isn't.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               And so, one time?  I was at band camp?\n               And we weren't supposed to have pillow\n               fights?  But we had a pillow fight!\n               And it was so much fun!\n\n     Jim couldn't care.\n\n                         MICHELLE (cont'd)\n               And one time, we all lost our music?\n               And we were supposed to play this\n               song?  But we didn't know it.  So we\n               just made it up!  And we kept playing\n               and playing but the conductor didn't\n               know what we were doing and it was so\n               funny!\n\n     Jim looks wistfully over at Nadia's empty desk.\n\n                         MICHELLE (cont'd)\n               So you're pissed about something, huh?\n               You know what I do when I'm angry?  I\n               just play some Bach on my flute.  It's\n               so relaxing.  I learned to do that at\n               band camp.\n\n     Jim perks up the slightest bit.\n\n                         JIM\n               Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm\n               angry?\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               Is it because we have a test tomorrow?\n               Sometimes I get cranky when I know I\n               have a big test to study for.\n\n                         JIM\n               Yeah, that's pretty much it.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               I thought so.  Because, one time?  I\n               was at this --\n\n                         JIM\n                   (interrupting)\n               What was your name again?\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               Michelle.\n\n                         JIM\n               Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my\n               date for the prom?\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               Really?  You seriously want to go with\n               me?\n\n                         JIM\n                   (so forced)\n               Yes.  Seriously.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               Are we going to Steve Stifler's party\n               afterwards?  That would be so cool.\n\n                         JIM\n               Whatever you want.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun!\n               It's like this one time, at band\n               camp...\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - HALLWAY - A LITTLE LATER\n\n     Heather is walking down the hall.  She turns to go into\n     the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the\n     door she sees Oz.  She stops.\n\n     Oz is singing, working through the solo.  Determined to\n     get it right.  He bounces his lacrosse ball off the\n     floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  There's one point that\n     he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  Heather\n     watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually\n     putting his heart into it.  Finally he's frustrated --\n\n                         OZ\n               Dammit!\n\n     He whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  Heather recoils,\n     still watching, unseen by Oz.  After a moment, Oz cools\n     off.  He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again.\n     Heather is impressed.\n\n     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Vicky is doing calculus homework, as Kevin looks on,\n     rubbing her shoulders.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               You're not doing the extra credit\n               problems.\n\n                         VICKY\n               No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence\n               of random numbers that look like I'm\n               doing the extra credit problems.  Mr.\n               Bender doesn't bother to check\n               homework past April.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               That's my trick!\n\n                         VICKY\n               It's everyone's trick, Kevin.\n                   (she turns to him)\n               But I did pick it up from you.\n\n     She gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with\n     her work.  Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               We've come a long way since\n               Homecoming.\n\n                         VICKY\n                   (playful)\n               Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four-\n               point into a three-nine-five.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Indeed I did.  But, our relationship.\n               It's progressed a lot.  It's time for\n               us to...express ourselves in new ways.\n\n     Vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk,\n     facing him.  Her mood has shifted, more romantic.\n\n                         VICKY\n               Like how?\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Well, I feel that...things are getting\n               to that point in a relationship.\n               When two people share...a special\n               moment between them.\n\n                         VICKY\n               I think you're so right, Kevin.\n\n                         KEVIN\n                   (pause)\n               You want to do it?\n\n                         VICKY\n               Yes --\n\n     She takes his hand.  Readies herself, and declares.\n\n                         VICKY (CONT'D)\n               I love you.\n\n     Kevin falters.  This is definitely not what he was\n     expecting.  He's caught.  Trying to formulate a response.\n\n                         VICKY (CONT'D)\n               Kevin?  Do you not love me?\n\n                         KEVIN\n               No, I don't not love you.  I like, I\n               know that we've definitely got\n               something between us.  Something good.\n               Something special.\n\n                         VICKY\n               But you don't love me.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's\n               like a term that gets thrown around.\n               People say things, they get married,\n               have kids, and then what?  It's like\n               they call it off, going \"I was wrong.\"\n\n     A beat.  Vicky seems to know where he's coming from.\n\n                         VICKY\n               Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two\n               of us, we're not your parents.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet,\n               okay?\n\n                         VICKY\n               Okay.\n\n     INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Oz is closing up the store.  He looks up to see Heather\n     at the door.  Oz goes and opens it, surprised,\n     embarrassed.  The air is awkward between them.\n\n                         HEATHER\n               Hi...\n\n                         OZ\n               How did you know I was here?\n\n                         HEATHER\n               Stifler told me.\n\n                         OZ\n               You talked to Stifler?\n\n                         HEATHER\n               Well...I needed to find you.

For you\n               seniors, this marks the culmination of\n               your past four years.  Think of what\n               that means to you.  Are you guys gonna\n               look back on your days at East and\n               know that you made the most of the\n               time you had?\n\n     A wave of realization washes over Oz.

He and Heather sound great, backed by the vocal\n     jazz group.  They sail through their duet, join hands,\n     and finish perfectly.  The audience APPLAUDS with\n     enthusiasm -- and we Kevin and Jim, WHOOPING AND\n     CLAPPING, loving it, like they're at a rock concert.\n\n                         JIM\n               Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!\n\n                         KEVIN\n                   (gives that \"You rock!\" hand\n                    sign)\n               You fuckin' rule!\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n     Class has just ended, students are filing out of the\n     classroom.  A teacher grades papers in the back of the\n     room, routinely writing \"A, A-, A, A-\" on each paper.\n     Vicky is studying a pull-down map hanging over the\n     chalkboard.  Kevin comes up next to her.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Hey...\n\n                         VICKY\n               Did you know that it's...450 miles\n               from Ann Arbor to Nashville?\n\n                         KEVIN\n               It's like a six or seven hour drive.\n               That's easy, I don't mind driving.\n\n     A beat.  Kevin looks back over his shoulder to the\n     inattentive teacher.  Moves closer to Vicky.\n\n                         KEVIN (CONT'D)\n               About the other day...I've been\n               thinking.\n\n                         VICKY\n               So have I.  And I know you want to\n               make things perfect for me.

She steps\n     closer.  Kevin, somewhat nervous, takes the bottom of the\n     map, fidgeting with it a little.\n\n                         VICKY (CONT'D)\n               And I want to make things perfect for\n               you.

TUXEDO LAND - DAY\n\n     Jim is trying on a tux.  he shrugs, like it fits well\n     enough.\n\n     He turns to see Oz trying on his -- Oz is fidgeting,\n     trying on different ties, vests, shoes, very sincere and\n     focused.\n\n     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Vicky is trying on a rather elegant dress, looking to\n     Jessica for support, showing it off.  Jessica jokingly\n     does the same, showing off her shorts and T-shirt, as if\n     she could care.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY\n\n     Finch sits alone.  Not like alone.  More like Forrest\n     Gump.\n\n     INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY\n\n     Jim is paying for his tux.  We see Oz trying to decide on\n     a cumberbund.  There are about ten of them scattered\n     around him that he's already tried.  In the background,\n     an ATTENDANT looks impatient.\n\n     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY\n\n     Finch still sits.  His head is cocked at a different\n     angle.\n\n     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     Jim's dad fixes Jim's bow tie.\n\n     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (END MONTAGE)\n\n     Kevin is in his tux.  He's staring at himself in the\n     mirror.\n\n     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT\n\n     The parking lot is full.  VARIOUS FORMALLY DRESSED\n     STUDENTS make their way into the school.  One group piles\n     out of a stretch limo.  We see a STEALTHY STUDENT slip a\n     bottle of liquor into his tux.  A FLUSTERED GUY struggles\n     to re-attach his date's corsage.\n\n     This is the prom.\n\n     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT\n\n     The gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner.\n     Like a combination of Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve, and\n     somebody's bar mitzvah.  A CRAPPY BAND plays CRAPPY\n     IMITATION ROCK MUSIC.\n\n     Most students mill about, talking, generally bored.  The\n     only people who are enjoying themselves are the OBVIOUSLY\n     DRUNK STUDENTS, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk\n     Stifler in a corner.  CHAPERONE PARENTS try to calm them\n     down, futilely.\n\n     The band breaks into a CHEESY BALLAD.  Couples lock\n     together and sway back and forth like zombies.\n\n     ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE\n\n     They're dancing at arm's length.  Jim is not enthused.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n               You know, at band camp?  We have\n               dances like this.  Only they're way\n               funner.  Don't you think prom is just\n               highly overrated?\n\n                         JIM\n               Highly, highly overrated.\n\n     ANGLE ON KEVIN AND VICKY\n\n     They dance.  Both looking a little nervous.  Anxious.\n\n     ANGLE ON OZ AND HEATHER\n\n     Dancing much slower than anyone else.  Tight embrace.\n     Heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed.\n\n     ANGLE ON STIFLER\n\n     Dancing with the Girl Holding out For Finch.\n\n     INT.

The\n               Sherman Tank is going back in.\n\n     The guys are impassive.  Sherman indicates the Central\n     Girl nearby.\n\n                         SHERMAN (CONT'D)\n               Locked on target, flying in stealth\n               mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to\n               drop the payload...again.\n\n     Sherman confidently walks off.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well,\n               Finch, I know where you are, but you\n               can't use that as an excuse.

I mean, I've never even had\n               sex and already I can't stand it!  I\n               hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never\n               wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here\n               busting my balls over something that\n               just isn't that damn important!  So\n               fuck this stupid pact, fuck you, and\n               fuck sex!

I\n               never had sex with him.  He's never\n               had sex with anyone -- I know because\n               he told me.  Once, he tried to screw a\n               grapefruit, but that's it.  Oh, and he\n               also told me that sometimes when he\n               gets nervous he wets his pants.

He pissed himself.\n\n     The guys LAUGH as Kevin is puzzled.  THEY are suddenly\n     illuminated by the glare of headlights.  A charter bus\n     pulls in front of the school.\n\n                         JIM\n               There it is.

STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     The party rages in the rest of the cottage, but the\n     basement is empty.  STIFLER'S MOM sits in the corner,\n     smoking a cigarette.  She's as attractive as her photo we\n     once saw, but the divorce has replaced her sexy smile\n     with a bitter smirk.\n\n     Finch stumbles in.\n\n                         FINCH\n               Ah, Stifler's mom!

STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Kevin and Vicky.  Silently doing it.  Curious looks on\n     their faces.  The look you get when your waiter delivers\n     your food in a fancy restaurant, and you look at the\n     creation on the plate, and secretly you're not sure if\n     it's really what you ordered.  But you don't say\n     anything, and you just eat it.\n\n     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT\n\n     Oz and Heather.  Souls entwined.  Making love.\n\n     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     We can hear Jim and Michelle going at it like a couple of\n     HOWLING BANSHEES over a SERIES OF SHOTS:\n\n     -- A piggy bank gets knocked over and shatters.\n\n     -- An x-wing fighter flies across the room.\n\n     -- A pillow explodes in a cloud of feathers.\n\n     -- One of the legs on the bed breaks.\n\n     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - OUTSIDE BASEMENT DOOR - NIGHT\n\n     The Basement door is closed.

STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jim and Michelle going at it.  Again, we HEAR but can't\n     see them.  The room is more trashed than before.  And as\n     we PAN across the disaster area they've created --\n\n                         JIM (O.S.)\n               Are you gonna do what I think you're\n               gonna do?\n\n                         MICHELLE (O.S.)\n               Don't you want me to?\n\n                         JIM (O.S.)\n               Oh yeah!

And\n     then we see her raise a children's plastic recorder to\n     her lips -- and she whistles THE MICHIGAN FIGHT SONG.  On\n     cue, Jim chimes in --\n\n                         JIM\n               Hail, hail, to Michigan, the leaders\n               and best!\n\n     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT\n\n     Oz could be coming.  Heather could be coming.  But it's\n     all so darn passionate that the whole thing looks like\n     one big orgasm anyway.\n\n     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jim and Michelle lay on the floor, tangled in sheets and\n     each others' clothing.  Exhausted, gasping.\n\n     And then we see the closet door is open, just a crack.\n     It swings open.  Standing there is Stifler's Little\n     Brother.  Jaw hanging.\n\n                         STIFLER'S BROTHER\n               That was awesome!\n\n     Jim and Michelle are stunned.\n\n     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Finch and Stifler's Mom are just off-camera.  We can't\n     see it, but we can tell Finch's status from his ORGASMIC\n     MOANING.\n\n     What we do see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The\n     chair falling out of place.  And the door opening as\n     Stifler walks in.  He stops, horrified.\n\n                         STIFLER\n               Ugh...oh no...\n\n     He looks like he's going to barf.  Instead, he passes\n     out.\n\n     EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - SUNRISE - ESTABLISHING\n\n     The sun rises over Lake Michigan.  A brand new day.\n     Various students are passed out here and there.\n\n     EXT. BEACH - DAY\n\n     Oz holds Heather in his arms.  Completely peaceful.\n     SEAGULLS CALL to each other.  WAVES BREAK on the shore.\n\n     Oz has lost all pretense.  Smiling to himself, or maybe\n     to the world.\n\n     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Jim wakes up in bed, alone.  He looks around.\n\n                         JIM\n               She's gone.\n\n     He considers this.\n\n                         JIM (cont'd)\n               Oh my God.

STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Kevin and Vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at\n     the ceiling.  Though they're trying to conceal it, we can\n     see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking\n     through.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               That was a great night.\n\n                         VICKY\n               Yeah.\n\n     A beat.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               I can't believe we just had our senior\n               prom.\n\n                         VICKY\n               Yeah, the time went by so fast.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               It did.\n\n     Another beat.\n\n                         VICKY\n               Kevin, next year...with you in Ann\n               Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not\n               gonna work, is it.\n\n                         KEVIN\n               Don't say that, we can do it somehow.\n               It might not be perfect, but --\n\n                         VICKY\n                   (interrupting)\n               No, Kevin --\n                   (she sits up)\n               That's the whole thing, that's what\n               I've been realizing.
