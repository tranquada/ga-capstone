Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the \n               shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming \n               side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering \n               the cool New England waters: \"Farmer John\" wetsuits with cut-\n               off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an \n               expensive camera with a flash attachment.\n\n               One motions \"Down there,\" the other signals \"OK, I see it,\" \n               and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts \n               of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and \n               floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of \n               illumination.\n\n<b>               SEA BOTTOM - DAY\n</b>\n               The wreck of the working fisherman's boat \"ORCA,\" formerly \n               under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these \n               four years.\n\n               Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands \n               of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering \n               with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow \n               from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly \n               tangled.\n\n               The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by \n               the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. \n               The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor \n               drive camera.\n\n<b>               ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW\n</b>\n               Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.\n\n<b>               SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA\n</b>\n               Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, \n               moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.\n\n               An occasional \"Flash!\" lights up the bottom as Bert continues \n               snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.\n\n<b>               BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)\n</b>\n               Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes \n               a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, \n               f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.\n\n               He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling \n               his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash.\n\n               Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.\n\n               Something's out there, moving towards us.\n\n               Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.\n\n               Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash!

It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity.\n\n               The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs \n               leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet \n               solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a \n               door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a \n               hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of \n               a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in \n               progress. A banner announces: \"Grand Opening Ball -- Amity \n               Scholarship Fund Benefit.\" Brody crosses under a High School \n               band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet \n               player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd \n               applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some \n               dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity \n               Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHN\n</b>                         Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that \n                         eloquent solo.

The Kids are finding the same general direction, \n               pointing out of the harbor.\n\n<b>               QUICK CUTS\n</b>\n               -- Sails being trimmed.\n\n               --  Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he \n               sets a course straight for the lighthouse.\n\n               --  Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, \n               misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow \n               Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, \n               losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and \n               meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:\n\n<b>               BELOW HIM THE SHARK\n</b>\n               The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, \n               it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it \n               turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red \n               and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, \n               eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring \n               face.\n\n               Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes \n               wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards, \n               he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on \n               his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging \n               towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away \n               from his lips.\n\n               Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding \n               his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.\n\n<b>               THE DIVERS\n</b>\n               look over at the rocketing ascent.

The great jaws close, fastening \n               onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a \n               moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack \n               open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- \n               then the live copper core is reached.
