Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the \n               shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming \n               side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering \n               the cool New England waters: \"Farmer John\" wetsuits with cut-\n               off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an \n               expensive camera with a flash attachment.\n\n               One motions \"Down there,\" the other signals \"OK, I see it,\" \n               and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts \n               of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and \n               floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of \n               illumination.\n\n               SEA BOTTOM - DAY\n\n               The wreck of the working fisherman's boat \"ORCA,\" formerly \n               under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these \n               four years.\n\n               Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands \n               of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering \n               with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow \n               from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly \n               tangled.\n\n               The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by \n               the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. \n               The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor \n               drive camera.\n\n               ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW\n\n               Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.\n\n               SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA\n\n               Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, \n               moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.\n\n               An occasional \"Flash!\" lights up the bottom as Bert continues \n               snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.\n\n               BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)\n\n               Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes \n               a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, \n               f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.\n\n               He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling \n               his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash.\n\n               Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.\n\n               Something's out there, moving towards us.\n\n               Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.\n\n               Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, \n               Death.\n\n               OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT\n\n               The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A \n               dark red mist eddies by.

An expensive cabin cruiser, the \"Diver Working\" flag \n               fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor.\n\n               Flash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat \n               rocks in the ceaseless swell.\n\n               On the stern, \"Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I.\" A long way from \n               home...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY\n\n               A blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A \n               figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent \n               mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity.\n\n               The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs \n               leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet \n               solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a \n               door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a \n               hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of \n               a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in \n               progress. A banner announces: \"Grand Opening Ball -- Amity \n               Scholarship Fund Benefit.\" Brody crosses under a High School \n               band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet \n               player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd \n               applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some \n               dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity \n               Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that \n                         eloquent solo.

OCEAN - DAY\n\n               Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing \n               in the water, the engine idling.

Okay, go.\n\n               Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, \n               starting forward. Terry waves \"okay,\" Diane opens up the \n               throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright.\n\n               A wake boils out from under her skis.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE BEACH\n\n               Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter \n               of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some \n               beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above \n               the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski \n               boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and \n               sits up, brushing sand out of her hair.\n\n                                     TINA\n                         Take a break for a minute, okay?\n\n                                     ED\n                         Huh?\n\n               Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is \n               towing Terry on the water.\n\n                                     TINA\n                         Eddie, can we do that?\n                              (no reaction)\n                         Can we go skiing?

I \n                         want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?\n\n               Ed grunts non-comittally. Tina takes a beer from the cooler, \n               and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane. She waves \n               to them, and to someone down the beach.\n\n               EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY\n\n               An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, \n               also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves. \n               She acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention \n               back to the skiers.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE SKIERS\n\n               having a wonderful time.

Too late to maneuver, Terry \n               hits the looming gray back of the Shark. The skis bump, leave \n               the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill. The rope around \n               her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her, \n               preventing her from shouting. She flounders as Diane slows \n               the boat to see what's happened.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE BOAT\n\n               turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or \n               hurt herself.\n\n                                     DIANE\n                         Terry!

AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)\n\n               Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home \n               and family. He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered \n               with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn. The \n               sign reads: \"WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN.\"\n\n               Plastered across it is an added streamer: \"NOW OPEN.\" Barely \n               visible underneath are older notices: \"UNDER CONSTRUCTION,\" \n               and \"OPENING IN JUNE.\"\n\n               As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main \n               road and heads down towards the beach.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - DUSK\n\n               Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he \n               continues on home. As he drives along, he sees: a clambake; \n               some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few \n               solitary surfcasters and fishermen.\n\n               The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his \n               jeep have the sand to themselves. It's then that he sees \n               something:\n\n               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n               A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the \n               surf just off the beach ahead. It's a piece of the \n               waterskiers' boat; Brody heads towards it.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE SURF\n\n               As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets \n               out to look at the flotsam. His shoes get wet. He backs up \n               onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this \n               object.\n\n               It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes \"Get in here\" \n               motions. The junk resists.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Come on, give a guy a break.\n\n               No response. He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up \n               his trouser legs. A silly sight. He wades into the water \n               after it.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...\n\n               It eludes him, and he flounders after it. A big wave breaks \n               across his crotch.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Hoo!

Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, \n               misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow \n               Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, \n               losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and \n               meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:\n\n               BELOW HIM THE SHARK\n\n               The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, \n               it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it \n               turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red \n               and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, \n               eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring \n               face.\n\n               Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes \n               wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards, \n               he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on \n               his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging \n               towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away \n               from his lips.\n\n               Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding \n               his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.\n\n               THE DIVERS\n\n               look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky \n               signals \"up,\" and they begin to carefully follow him towards \n               the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY\n\n               Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips.

Then, impossibly fast, the entire \n               Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as \n               the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror.\n\n               Ed is knocked over the side, into the water.\n\n               ANGLE ON ED\n\n               as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, \n               trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to \n               swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard.\n\n               ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED\n\n               He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes \n               him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through \n               the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he \n               is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood \n               smears his nose and lip.\n\n               His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip.\n\n               REVERSE\n\n               Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's \n               arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with \n               desperate hands.\n\n               INSERT\n\n               Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With \n               awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters \n               and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by \n               the awful force.\n\n               TINA\n\n               her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down \n               at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy \n               under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing \n               swell.\n\n               EXT.

Ellen is on the dock, watching \n               him.\n\n                                     ELLEN\n                         What're you doing?\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Going out.\n\n                                     HENDRICKS\n                         Uh, Chief -- look.

The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a \n               halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Untie that rope.\n\n                                     HENDRICKS\n                         Please.

Jackie is hysterical, some of the other Kids \n               are screaming. The Shark's fin catches the taut line, it \n               slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled \n               into the water.

The Kids, screaming, \n               fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure \n               into pieces.

Hang on!\n\n               He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency \n               inflatable in its case. He wrestles it off its brackets, and \n               breaks the seals urgently. He hits the auto-inflate.\n\n               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN\n\n               Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the \n               other Kids flailing in the water. The huge bulk of the Shark, \n               fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion.\n\n               IN THE WATER\n\n               While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the \n               water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives.  \n               Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         Get on the rocks!\n\n                                     DOUG\n                         Swim for it!\n\n               Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on \n               the exposed wooden hull.\n\n                                     PATRICK\n                         Lucy! Look out!\n\n               ANGLE ON LUCY AND BOB\n\n               As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is \n               sliding past her, intent on Bob. The rough hide scrapes her, \n               tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her \n               torso.\n\n                                     LUCY\n                         I'm bleeding!\n\n               Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Help!\n\n               He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at \n               him.\n\n               INSERT - WINCH\n\n               grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- \n               heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from \n               the mainland!\n\n               BRODY IN THE WATER\n\n               paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, \n               heedless of the danger around him.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Hang on! Just hang on!\n\n               He fights to see in the gathering gloom. Suddenly, a strange \n               glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of \n               escalating clicks.\n\n               CABLE JUNCTION\n\n               Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are \n               turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren \n               rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark \n               shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by \n               their contract.\n\n               ANGLE ON BRODY\n\n               straining to see what's going on. Looking for his son.\n\n                                     SEAN (O.S.)\n                         Dad! Help!

Use the lights! The lights!\n\n               ANGLE ON ANDY\n\n               soaked, clinging to the rail of the launch, hearing Brody, \n               fumbling in the cabin, turning on worklights, the boat \n               throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many lamps \n               and searchlights. Andy grabs one and sweeps the water with \n               it, trying to help.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         Where are you? Chief!\n\n               His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom.\n\n               BRODY IN THE WATER\n\n               He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking, \n               as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks. He is blinded by \n               the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken \n               teen-agers screaming. It's the middle of The Inferno.\n\n               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN\n\n               Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting \n               his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what \n               seems to be certain death.\n\n                                     BRODY (O.S.)\n                         Sean!\n\n               ANGLE ON BRODY\n\n               as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even, \n               to distract it.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         You bastard!\n\n               He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding \n               a steel boathook. He screams at the unfeeling Shark...\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!\n\n               The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new \n               irritation. Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a \n               commotion.\n\n               THE SHARK SPEEDS TOWARDS HIM\n\n               THE SHARK\n\n               lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing \n               at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it \n               passes...\n\n               ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT\n\n               Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet \n               cut of the water. He reaches up to it.\n\n               ANGLE ON BRODY\n\n               dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable, seeing \n               it, inspired with a lunatic idea...\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Over here! You bastard! Over here\n\n               THE SHARK\n\n               turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its \n               scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brody.\n\n               BRODY\n\n               Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Come and get me! Come and get me!\n\n               THE SHARK\n\n               Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the \n               way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening \n               onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a \n               moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack \n               open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- \n               then the live copper core is reached. Zap!\n\n               THE SHARK\n\n               dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of \n               volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot \n               white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, \n               sputters, and dies.\n\n               BRODY\n\n               watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when \n               the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights \n               on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut \n               down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's \n               worklights provide light now.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Sean?\n\n               No answer. Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing \n               quietly. Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of \n               the raft, expecting the worst...\n\n               ANGLE ON THE WRECKAGE\n\n               Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean. There's a \n               scrabbling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under \n               the seat where he'd fallen.\n\n                                     SEAN\n                         Dad?\n\n               Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto \n               his raft. They paddle back towards the rocks.\n\n               THE ISLAND\n\n               with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're \n               wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. Sean hugs his daddy as \n               they step onto land.\n\n                                     SEAN\n                         They made me go with them.\n\n                                     BRODY\n                         Sure they did...\n\n               He kisses the damp forehead.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.
