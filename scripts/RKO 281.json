Beyond the cake we can see a bed.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tOn the bed lies a woman in her early forties. She is ashen and sickly. \n\tDying.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles, blows out the \n\tmatch and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                         WOMAN \n</b>\t          Come into the light..

Welles seems rather \n\tuncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his \n\tvast passions and appetites.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tOrson Welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary \n\tenergy. He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly \n\tambitious. He is part artist, part fraud and all showman.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tA sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. The voice is always grand, \n\toccasionally sardonic.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                         NEWSREEL VOICE \n</b>\t          He came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing \n\t          star blazing through the firmament of illusion. And \n\t          he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. He \n\t          was 24 years old and his name was George Orson \n\t          Welles. Sound the trumpets! Unfurl the banners, \n\t          Hollywood! The Boy Wonder has arrived!\n<b>\t\n</b>\tImages of Welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: Welles \n\tin a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed \n\tup for a magic show. As we hear:\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                         NEWSREEL VOICE \n</b>\t          He made his debut on the world stage in Kenosha, \n\t          Wisconsin, on the 6th of May, 1915. And on the 7th \n\t          of May he spoke his first words, and unlike other \n\t          children who say commonplace things like \"momma\" and \n\t          \"poppa\", he proclaimed \"I am a genius!\"\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAt three the genius was reciting Shakespeare and at eight he had taken \n\tup cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the  knee of the \n\tgreat Houdini.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tImages of Welles' early theatrical career: the young man playing \n\timpossibly old parts; vaudeville magic shows; various regional \n\ttheaters; endless tawdry rehearsal rooms\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThen images of Welles and JOHN HOUSEMAN in New York: the great, \n\tbustling city; Welles at work with John Houseman on a script; Welles \n\tdirecting a play.

Unstoppable and resolute, the \n\t          Boy Wonder journeyed into the world of the legit \n\t          theater. After a peripatetic beginning he found \n\t          himself at last in New York where he joined forces \n\t          with theatrical producer John Houseman under the \n\t          august auspices of the WPA Federal Theater.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tA rehearsal room interview with John Houseman, who is in his 30's, \n\tthin-lipped and prim:\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                         HOUSEMAN \n</b>\t          Orson barreled in and took over. Orson's a real \n\t          barreler.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tImages of Welles directing his famous \"Fascist JULIUS CAESAR\" and \n\t\"Voodoo MACBETH\" productions: auditions; rehearsals; perfecting a \n\tsword-fight; rejecting classical costume sketches for JULIUS CAESAR; \n\tsupervising set construction; performing Brutus in the Albert Speer-\n\tlike Nuremberg rally lighting of JULIUS CAESAR. As we hear:\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                         NEWSREEL VOICE \n</b>\t          Like Hannibal over the Alps, the Boy Genius invaded \n\t          the Great White Way. He stunned the sedate elite of \n\t          New York theatre with production after production. \n\t          From MACBETH with an entirely colored cast to a \n\t          Mussolini-inspired JULIUS CAESAR!\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMore images of New York, Welles, Houseman and radio: Welles directing a \n\tradio play with sweeping energy; supervising the elaborate sound \n\teffects; editing the script; at odds with Houseman.

So, \n\t          after founding the Mercury Players with Houseman, \n\t          young Mr. Welles quickly set his sights on the \n\t          airwaves. He quickly became the sonorous -' voice of \n\t          \"The Shadow.\" ''\n<b>\t\n</b>\tNewsreel footage of Welles at a standing radio microphone;\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                         WELLES \n</b>\t          Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?

Five long tables are placed end to end.

He is a fully commanding figure, towering in \n\tboth height (six foot two) and personality. He is shaped rather like a \n\tpear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless \n\tman. Although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the \n\tpress baron's animus, Hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully \n\tsoft-spoken.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMarion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. In a word \n\tthat might have been coined for her, she has moxie. While the ravages \n\tof alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes \n\tof her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless \n\tgrace.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAround Hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tOn the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit Welles and \n\tMank.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tWe sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and \n\tfinally settle on Marion and Hearst.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMarion is charming CAROLE LOMBARD and CLARK GABLE, who sit beside \nher. \n\tShe tenderly rests one hand on Hearst's arm as she speaks.

Hearst was throwing a birthday party for \n\t          Thomas Ince, the old movie producer. They were all \n\t          on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from \n\t          Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was. \n\t          This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin, \n\t          Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices \n\t          Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing \n\t          everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs \n\t          his revolver and starts shooting.

So now there's this dead guy lying \n\t          on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an \n\t          embarrassment. So the empire goes into action.

NEW YORK NIGHT \n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tIt is the premiere of CITIZEN KANE, at last.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe Palace Theater swarms with tuxedos and dress gowns as the elite of \n\tNew York and Hollywood descend from limousines and slowly parade into \n\tthe packed lobby.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tOn the Palace marquee \"ORSON WELLES\" is spelled out in enormous six \n\tfoot tall electric letters. Below that is \"CITIZEN KANE\" also in \n\telectric letters. Above the marquee is a series of towering, flashing \n\tneon Charles Foster Kanes and the words \"IT'S TERRIFIC.\"\n<b>\t\n</b>\tTitle; MAY l, 1941\n<b>\t\n</b>\tWe float down and enter the crowded lobby with the patrons...\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT PALACE THEATER.
