GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried \n               along like a leaf in a stream.\n\n               Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a \n               trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the\n\n\n               Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's \n               like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets, \n               turns and pushes against the tide of tourists.

Fear sweeps over him. He looks \n               desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his \n               surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. \n               He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.\n\n               A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S \n               legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds \n               himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart \n               plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.\n\n                                     LITTLE GIRL\n                         Mama!\n\n               She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, \n               reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching \n               the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder.\n\n               Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT \n               POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station.\n\n               It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He \n               is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more \n               confident.\n\n               Then, just beyond the COP, MR.

Right.\n\n               GENE digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his \n               business cards. He hurriedly writes on it: \"HELP. VAN KIDNAP \n               CHILD.\" He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the CABBIE'S \n               hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.\n\n               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM\n\n               GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.\n\n               INT.

BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM\n\n               GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm \n               snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what \n               it is. He looks around.\n\n               VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and \n               going. No one pays particular attention to him.\n\n               GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out \n               and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away.\n\n               GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately \n               hanging onto the last glimpse of it.\n\n\n               MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE \n               goes into the hotel.\n\n               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM\n\n               GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air-\n               conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants, \n               waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance.\n\n               HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM\n\n               Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around \n               this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE.

He \n               breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he \n               starts tracking all around him, seeing...something.\n\n                                     GENE\n                         Oh, my God. Oh, no.\n\n               He desperately fumbles in his pocket.\n\n               Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a \n               huge, rolled up banner.\n\n               GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He \n               rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, \n               the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous \n               reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the \n               same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of \n               it in your best red, white, and blue:\n\n                         \"RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR\"\n\n               And an addendum:\n\n                                      \"HERE TODAY!\"\n\n                                     GENE\n                         Oh, shit.\n\n               It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see \n               what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere. \n\n\n               On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several \n               years her junior.

THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM\n\n               GENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room.  He \n               walks that way. MR. SMITH follows.\n\n               INT.

The walkway \n               is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS, \n               POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME \n               TAGS.\n\n               GENE plows on through...\n\n               ...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                              (laughs)\n                         Whoops!\n\n               The two men reel back from each other.

Right past an election poster \n               featuring him and Governor Grant.\n\n               Still stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches \n               the Governor's husband, but keeps walking.\n\n               INT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM\n\n               It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from.

A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting \n               to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing \n               through a combination of relief and agony.\n\n               MR.

LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE \"RED\" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM\n\n               GENE approaches.

She is a \n               handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of \n               KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few \n               assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME \n               TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the \n               elevator.

BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:39PM\n\n               GENE looks at his watch, then checks the itinerary once more.\n\n               ECU - ITINERARY\n\n               12:45 -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Kim Multi-\n               Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor\n\n               ANGLE ON GENE-NEAR BUFFET AREA - 12:39PM\n\n               GENE addresses another Bellboy, HECTOR who is moving luggage \n               out to the street.\n\n                                     GENE\n                         Pool Deck?\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         Fourth Floor.

BONAVENTURE HOTEL - BAR AREA - DAY - 12:39PM\n\n               GENE heads toward the escalators. Ahead of him, he sees \n               ELEANOR GRANT and BRENDAN GRANT surrounded by AIDES and \n               SECURITY MEN facing a crowd of PRESS PEOPLE. The Governor \n               and her husband have an arm around each other. They are \n               smiling, relaxed, quite the\" happy couple. They give each \n               other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment.\n\n               GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a \n               large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he \n               clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference.\n\n\n               ANGLE ON BRENDAN GRANT - 12:3 9PM\n\n               He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding \n               questions from a few remaining REPORTERS.\n\n               Farther on, ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage can be seen taking \n               the escalator up. GENE heads that way, passing BRENDAN GRANT.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         My wife is not interested in negative \n                         campaigning.

The Governor's husband's eyes \n               follow her appreciatively as he says:\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         I'm just a business man.\n\n               ANGLE ON GENE - 12:40PM\n\n               He nears the escalator. It's crowded and GENE is pulled into \n               the midst of NEWS PEOPLE, TV, RADIO, PRESS. He joins the \n               flow and lets it pull him along.\n\n               GENE rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the \n               crowd up two flights of the circular stairs.\n\n               Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck.\n\n               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - POOL, DECK - HIGH ANGLE - 12:41PM\n\n               About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect \n               the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and \n               Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and \n               microphones in front of a podium.\n\n\n               EXT. POOL DECK - CLOSE ANGLE ON GENE - 12:41PM\n\n               GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes \n               adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A \n               SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics, \n               turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along, \n               trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to \n               make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a \n               2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side.\n\n               2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I \n               can take you over here.\n\n               GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He \n               stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of \n               his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward \n               the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm -\n               which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo \n               deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed \n               on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:\n\n               PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the \n               hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through \n               them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances \n               back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular \n               POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts \n               with a quick laugh.\n\n               POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in \n               a crowd like this.\n\n               He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call \n               him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He \n               moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in \n               an easy way.\n\n               GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way \n               after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is \n               the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning \n               the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him. \n               He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he \n               turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:\n\n\n                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)\n                         I know what you're thinking.\n\n               GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him. \n               He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.\n\n                                     GENE\n                         What would you do in my place?\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         Me?\n\n               He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         The bitch would be dead. Course I \n                         ain't sayin' which bitch.\n\n               He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie-\n               talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the \n               sidewalk four stories below.\n\n               MR. SMITH goes ballistic.\n\n               GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.\n\n                                     GENE\n                         There's a plot to kill the Governor. \n                         If you don't believe me, check that \n                         guy right there. He has a gun.\n\n               OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.\n\n                                     OFFICER TRUST\n                         So do you, Mr. Watson.\n\n               And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie-\n               Talkie that he tosses to MR.

SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie-\n               talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him \n               to an isolated corner.\n\n                                     MR.

Brendan, listen to me. Someone \n                         is trying to kill Eleanor.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         What? What are you talking about?\n\n                                     KRISTA\n                         We need people we can \"trust. We \n                         only have a few moments...\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         This is...this is insane. How do you \n                         know this?\n\n                                     GENE\n                         I know it because I'm the one who's \n                         supposed to kill her.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         You are!?\n                              (to KRISTA)\n                         You brought this man here!? You \n                         brought this man to my room!?\n\n                                     KRISTA\n                         I had to. Her Security people may be \n                         involved...\n\n               There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent \n               bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands \n               on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, \n               perhaps wearing glasses.\n \n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         Is there a problem, Brendan?\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         There certainly is. This man says \n                         he's been hired to kill Eleanor.\n\n                                     GENE\n                         Not hired. They're blackmailing me.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         Who is this \"they\"?\n\n                                     GENE\n                         I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. \n                         Grant! They have my daughter. I'm \n                         not some lunatic. Your wife is in \n                         trouble.  Someone is trying to kill \n                         her. Someone is trying to make me \n                         kill her. Please, listen...\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         And on the strength of this story, \n                         you bring this man to Brendan's suite?  \n                         Does that show good judgment, Ms. \n                         Brooks?  I'm just a friend of \n                         Brendan's, but it seems to me...\n\n                                     KRISTA\n                         He brought a gun onto the pool deck.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                              (beat)\n                         What?\n\n                                     KRISTA\n                         He got onto the pool deck with a \n                         gun. How did he get past her Security \n                         carrying a\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         I see. Where is this gun?\n\n                                     KRISTA I\n                         Have it.\n\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         Well, is it real? Do we know anything \n                         about it?\n\n                                     KRISTA\n                         It looks real. I don't know anything \n                         about guns.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         Could I see it?\n\n               KRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands \n               it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it \n               awkwardly, examines it.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         My goodness. It certainly looks real.\n\n               He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         What's your opinion? You're the expert \n                         in these matters, supposedly.\n\n               GENE turns, to see who he is talking to.\n\n               ANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM\n\n               MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak, \n               MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He \n               marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the \n               couch. He takes the gun, shoves\" it- into the pillow and \n               goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder \n               what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock \n               fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand \n               there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         Jesus Christ!\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                              (calmly, staring at \n                              GENE)\n                         Yeah, I'd say it's real.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         Are you out of your fucking mind!?\n\n\n               The door opens. OFFICER TRUST slides in quickly.\n\n                                     OFFICER TRUST\n                         Somebody mind telling me...\n                              (sees KRISTA's body))\n                         What the hell happened!?\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         Help me get her off the rug.\n\n               OFFICER TRUST checks the hall, shuts the door. They begin to \n               drag her body to the bathroom. The MYSTERY MAN watches.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         What have you done to me!? Christ \n                         almighty!\n\n               GENE's eyes follow them. As if rousing from a sleep he comes \n               to life.\n\n                                     GENE\n                         No!\n\n               He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there, \n               gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching \n               the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs \n               GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's \n               cutting off his air.\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         You fucked up.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)\n                         That's enough.\n\n               The MYSTERY MAN grabs MR. SMITH'S arm, tries to pry him loose. \n               MR. SMITH is beyond reason.\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         You want me to kill your kid!? You \n                         want me to kill you!?\n\n               GENE's eyes begin to roll back in his head. Everything begins \n               fading to black.\n\n               The blackness retreats in a rush and GENE finds himself \n               staring at the butt of MR. SMITH'S gun, visible under his \n               coat. He reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank \n               into\n \n\n               MR. SMITH, again, again. MR. SMITH'S shocked face falls away. \n               GENE heads for the door.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         Don't let him go!\n\n               OFFICER TRUST steps between GENE and the door. GENE shoots \n               him down and is out the door.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               GENE stumbles out in the hall, gun in hand. He hurries down \n               the hall, looking back to see the MYSTERY MAN and a wounded \n               OFFICER TRUST spill out of Room 2503. The HALL OFFICER pulls \n               his weapon MYSTERY MAN Get him!\n\n               GENE fires at the HALL OFFICER who goes down. GENE rushes \n               down the hall. One of the guest room door's opens and a MAN \n               staggers out. It is a bloody, wounded MR. SMITH! GENE stops \n               in shock.\n\n                                     GENE\n                         I killed you.\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         You fucked up.\n\n               And MR. SMITH grabs him by the collar and throws him over a \n               railing.\n\n               INT. THE LOBBY - MID-AIR - DAY\n\n               GENE is falling, falling. He passes the ascending elevator \n               and gets a glimpse of MS. JONES and LYNN, pressed against \n               the glass, her face a mask of terror. The floor rushes up to \n               meet GENE and...\n\n               INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:5 6PM\n\n               ...he hits the floor, thrown there by MR. SMITH. His escape \n               has been a dream. A wrist-watch fills the frame.\n\n               12:56.\n\n\n               It is GENE's. We are seeing his P.O.V. He's laying on the \n               floor, his watch-hand in front of his face.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)\n                         You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!\n\n                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)\n                         Nearly doesn't count.\n\n               Lose the P.O.V.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         I'm on record. I never wanted this. \n                         I wanted simplicity; a telescopic \n                         sight, a powerful rifle, but no. \n                         What was good enough for Oswald wasn't \n                         good enough for you two. You had to \n                         get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off \n                         the street, stick a gun in his hand.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         It's academic now. She had to be \n                         killed.\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         What were you going to do, Brendan? \n                         Lock her in a closet?  You're in the \n                         fucking kitchen now. Get used to the \n                         heat. He's been seen all over the \n                         hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes. \n                         We even got him on video. It'll work. \n                         Don't worry about it.\n\n               GENE stirs on the floor.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         (about GENE) Is he awake?\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         Yeah.\n\n               He yanks GENE to his feet.\n\n                                     BRENDAN GRANT\n                         Oh Great. Why don't we just give him \n                         our home phone numbers while we're \n                         at it?\n\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         It doesn't matter what he hears.\n\n               He pulls GENE over to the bathroom door. Throws it open. \n               GENE reacts to what he sees within.\n\n                                     MR. SMITH\n                         That's what it looks like. She was \n                         alive a minute ago. Now she's dead. \n                         Because you wouldn't do what I told \n                         you to do.\n\n                                     MYSTERY MAN\n                         Get going. You've only got a few \n                         minutes to pull it together.\n\n               MR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall.  The \n               door closes.

She looks \n               back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or \n               another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie, \n               puts it on the seat beside her.

MR. \n               SMITH leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above \n               the sink, GENE sees the stall door swings open. GUSTINO Is \n               huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. MR. SMITH \n               doesn't notice.\n\n                                     MR.

The gun fires \n               wildly, hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing \n               a chain reaction of COLLISIONS on the street.\n\n               INT.

She goes over the seat as he FIRES...\n\n               The back window SHATTERS.\n\n               MR SMITH steps inside the van a step and aims over the seat. \n               This time he won't miss.\n\n               LYNN has nowhere to hide.\n\n               BAM! BAM!\n\n               But it isn't his gun firing. He stands, staring surprised, \n               wide-eyed. He pivots...\n\n\n               EXT.

She raises her gun and aims at GENE and LYNN inside \n               the van.\n\n               HUEY reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered \n               artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the \n               side of her head.
