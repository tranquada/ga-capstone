A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE. He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the tin cup between the entrance bar.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a small desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and continues writing. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks business. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and looking around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly framed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and hydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts up the receiver and dials. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one has ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then back at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him. Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El Moco.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO (V.O.)\n<br/></b>Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this is?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>Moco... What the hell do you want after all these years?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>MOCO is sitting on his porch drinking tequila.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a few town away with a whole new gang. I heard you were nearby so I thought I'd give you a call, amigo.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL (V.O)\n<br/></b>That's sweet of you, asshole. I don't suppose you could get me out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of money.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my friend. That is why I have called you. I heard you were getting out soon, and figured I should deal with our situation. But do you really need me to help you get out? From what I hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself sometime.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL (V.O.)\n<br/></b>I could stay in here and earn peanuts compared to what you owe me if I were to get out. So, yes, I want you to help me... my friend.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>Soon my friend, soon. I'm sending you some people in a few days to get you.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL (V.O.)\n<br/></b>Really? Well, that's more like it. Just like the Moco I used to know.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck racing in.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>Just hang in there my friend. I won't forget that you have been a big part of our success. What's wrong. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. JAIL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A large truck drives up to the jail, parking beside the police car. Two tall, well-dressed MEN step out. They reach into the cab and pull out machine guns. They walk briskly towards the jail.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his barred window.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>There's something going on outside. Is this a double surprise? Are you getting me out today, Moco?\n<br/>\n<br/>There is no response from Moco.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Guard reading the magazine stands when he sees someone approaching the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. JAIL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Close tracking shot of guns as Tall Men open the door and enter the jail.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously. Peering down the hall, he sees the guys with the guns. He hides behind the wall, peering out to see what happens next.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Tall Men walk right up to the guard, and hand him a huge wad of money. The Guard tosses the money to his partner (still eating), then turns to unlock the block entrance bars.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul puts the receiver back up to his mouth.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>There are two men here with guns. Did you send them?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Moco, glancing at his watch, hangs up.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a corner.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. TALL MEN IN HALL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter Azul's block and scope out the cells.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the sink. He stands ready to fight.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his buddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them. The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty cell, closing and locking the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number is automatically redialed. \n<br/>\n<br/>Moco answers.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>I'm still here, Moco. And so are your little friends. But not for long. They have something they want to scream to you. Listen close, because you're going to repeat it to me when I come to visit you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell. Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is holding the phone at arm's length into the cell.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming, they smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing. As Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the magazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a wad of money and the guard sits back down to count it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. JAIL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A blue truck races towards the jail.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get inside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits patiently for his blue truck.\n<br/>\n<br/>As the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses it onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away. Azul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of weaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.\n<br/>\n<br/>Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of money, as if complaining.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts later Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his bloody hand.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>CREDIT SEQUENCE\n<br/></b>\n<br/><b>EXT. AZUL / MARIACHI ON HIGHWAY - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing in the sun with a thumb in the air. The truck passes him up so he continues walking. Mariachi is carrying a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the other. He is wearing a white T-shirt, black pants. The camera pans to a sign that reads \"ACU\u00d1A 18 miles\".\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mariachi is walking around downtown Acu\u00f1a. He notices a bar across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on his jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on the building that says \"MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY\". He prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS as ge makes his way to the bar. No one seems to greet him back. He sits on a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying his guitar case down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks around the place, as if sizing it up.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>What do you want to drink?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARIACHI\n<br/></b>Refresco.\n<br/>\n<br/>The other drinkers stare at him.\n<br/>\n<br/>Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.\n<br/>\n<br/>Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes. Mariachi is served his drink.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARIACHI\n<br/></b>No hay musica?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>(cleaning a glass)\n<br/>Why?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARIACHI\n<br/></b>I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>So what?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARIACHI\n<br/></b>I could add a little class to this place. I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly off tips. But I need steady work, and I can guarantee bringing in more customers.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>(nodding)\n<br/>Tell me, why would I need one little guitar player when I've already got a full band?\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi gives him a silent \"what\" look.\n<br/>\n<br/>The BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small draped table.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big show). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...\n<br/>\n<br/>... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns accents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender who seems to enjoy it.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>(nodding with satisfaction)\n<br/>There you see? Either I can pay one guy to sound like a full mariachi band...\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink. He looks disappointed.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>... or I could spend the same money only get one little guitar player... Understand?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARIACHI\n<br/></b>(walking away)\n<br/>Thank you, sir.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>You want to earn a living? Get a real musical instrument.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left behind and offers it to the other men on the table. They say no, pay, and leave. The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES at the table.\n<br/>\n<br/>They all shake their heads no.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender shrugs and dumps it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. CORONA CLUB - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He decides to walk south.\n<br/>\n<br/>As he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP of another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona Club. The camera falls back a little revealing the backside of Azul, dressed also in black. Azul walks into the bar.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul enters the bar, notices to his left the table with the four mean-looking Dudes, drinking and eating chips and salsa.\n<br/>\n<br/>The oldest one, with his back to Azul, takes a sip from his mixed drink, then stands and excuses himself to the restroom.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. BATHROOM - OLD MEAN DUDE - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Old Mean Dude walks into the first stall and sits down.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The three remaining Dudes notice Azul's guitar case. So does the Bartender. They all look at each other and laugh.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>(laughing and rolling his eyes)\n<br/>What the hell is this, mariachi day? There is no work for you here!\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul walks the mean Dude's table. Their laughing quiets down a bit as Azul stands before them. The Bartender stops smiling.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>Bartender... one beer.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass. He begins to fill up at the tap.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>(without looking at him)\n<br/>In a bottle, wey.\n<br/>\n<br/>Bartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half-full glass for a moment, then drinks the beer.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul is staring at the three Mean Dudes. They stare back.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>Ready.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul doesn't pay attention to him.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>I'm looking for an old friend of mine. His name is... Moco. Do you know where I can find him.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAIN MEAN DUDE\n<br/></b>You can sometimes find him here. He owns this place.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>So you know him?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MAIN MEAN DUDE\n<br/></b>We work for him.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>That's too bad.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places the guitar in his hands. The Mean Dude is confused.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>Hold it please.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender ducks beneath the counter.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode, causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere. The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes die a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is smoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case. Azul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. BATHROOM - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll across the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring out. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door slowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the toilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He takes a deep breath and rushes out the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender rises up from behind the counter.\n<br/>\n<br/>The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding the guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it with a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul, standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder.\n<br/>\n<br/>Shot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and runs back inside the bathroom.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the bathroom.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.\n<br/>\n<br/>Without warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves.\n<br/>\n<br/>A few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and furiously dials.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>BARTENDER\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>Get me Moco!!!\n<br/>\n<br/>The door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the phone.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul walks right up to the Bartender.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty guzzling. The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul.\n<br/>\n<br/>CLOSEUP of the empty bottle slamming to the counter.\n<br/>\n<br/>The Bartender glances down at the bottle.\n<br/>\n<br/>CLOSEUP of Azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as payment. Azul leaves.\n<br/>\n<br/>A few seconds pass as the Bartender is standing there. You hear Moco yelling into the receiver asking what's going on.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. MOCO'S RANCH - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Moco is on the porch trying to get the Bartender to answer him.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/><b>WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE, ANSWER ME!!!\n<br/></b>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. CORONA CLUB - BARTENDER - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>You hear Moco's voice through the phone. The camera dollies into the Bartender as he screams into the receiver.\n<br/>\n<br/>The camera dollies in to the corpses...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>... and finally a low outdoor frontal tracking shot of Azul walking away smiling as the image fades out.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT.

He pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then slowly crosses their names out.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MEAN DUDE #5\n<br/></b>(into phone)\n<br/>Dead?\n<br/>\n<br/>The Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper.

She walks over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one hand while grabbing his hair with the other. He opens his eyes wide.

Mariachi settles back, smiling triumphantly. Suddenly she darts around and slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on her face. He bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look of complete shock. She loosens up and laughs.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DOMINO\n<br/></b>You're going to need a better sense of humor than that, if you're gonna work for me, kid.\n<br/>\n<br/>She flings her knife aside. It sticks into a wall. She shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs. Mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes. The knife slips out of the wall and clangs to the ground.

I'm not saying go by the best one, just a temporary one so you can play again tonight.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi stops and thinks... He looks up at her questioningly, then he shrugs an \"OK\" and grabs the money and jogs out excitedly. Domino is smiling.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. STREET - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mariachi walks down the sidewalk, passing curioso shops. The camera is low and zoomed in all the way. Mariachi stops by one of the window that has a guitar in the glass. He pulls his money and counts it. He stops after he notices someone's reflection in the window. He turns around and sees it is Mean Dude #5 right across the street. He meets up with another Mean Dude. They are standing right behind Mariachi. Mariachi is pretending to still look at the window. The Mean Dudes walk past Mariachi so Mariachi walks in the opposite direction. Mean Dude #5 stops and then turns around slowly. Far zoomed shot of Mariachi walking down the street with guys behind him. They start after him.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MEAN DUDE #5\n<br/></b>That's him...\n<br/>\n<br/>Tracking shot following Mariachi.\n<br/>\n<br/>Tracking shot in front of Mean Dudes walking at Mariachi.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mean Dude #5 pulls out a small walkie-talkie and calls his buddy in the truck a block away.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MEAN DUDE #5\n<br/></b>(into walkie-talkie)\n<br/>Loco, he's headed your way... black pants, white shirt.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>IN A TRUCK DOWN THE STREET\n<br/></b>\n<br/>LOCO starts the truck and starts driving slowly across the street.

Mean Dude #5 turns the corner when whispers into walkie-talkie.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MEAN DUDE #5\n<br/></b>(into walkie-talkie)\n<br/>Where did he go, Loco?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>LOCO\n<br/></b>(laughs, into walkie-talkie)\n<br/>He got in my truck.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mean Dude #5 laughs.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MEAN DUDE #5\n<br/></b>(into walkie-talkie)\n<br/>Take him around the block.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mean Dude #5 taps his buddy and they start running down the block.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi is in back the truck searching for a weapon. The truck stops. Mariachi rolls to the side and gently lifts his head.\n<br/>\n<br/>POV Mariachi sees the two Mean Dudes walking at him. Mariachi turns and Loco is there to knock him in the face with the rifle butt. Mariachi falls into truck, blood trickling from his dizzying head. He tries to get up a bit, but Loco is in the truck now, and slams the rifle down into his face hard... Blackout.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DUSTY ROAD TO MOCO'S\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mariachi is unconcious in the back of Loco's truck.

ROAD TO MOCO'S - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The above scene intercuts back and forth with the arrival of Loco. Loco arrives at the gate, Mean Dude #5 opens the gate, they drive through. The truck is facing Moco so he can't see Mariachi yet. Mean Dude #5 closes the gate and walks over to the truck, opens the back door, and calls Moco over. Moco walks over to the truck and looks inside.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. TRUCK - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mariachi is laying there unconcious, Moco puts his arm around Mean Dude #5, who is looking very proud, and Moco pulls out a cigarette and a match.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>That's not him.\n<br/>\n<br/>Moco strikes the match behind Mean Dude #5's head. Mean Dude #5 stops smiling.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. AMADEUS - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Domino is waiting on customers. She glances at her watch. A few seconds later she glances at it again. She looks very worried.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Azul's Rats burst into the hideout. FOUR GIRLS pop up over the partition with guns. The Rats stop in their tracks. The girls sigh a \"oh, it's them\" sigh and slink back to bed. Top shot of them trying to wake Azul. Azul wakes up and looks over the partition.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>Where's my case?\n<br/>\n<br/><b>RAT #1\n<br/></b>We couldn't find it.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>RAT #2\n<br/></b>We heard they caught you and were taking you to Moco's ranch.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>RAT #1\n<br/></b>... so we came to see if it was true.\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul thinks a moment.

MOCO'S RANCH - DAY\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mariachi is in a holding cell at the ranch. He twitches, finally waking up.\n<br/>\n<br/>He sees a GUARD outside and finds a way to escape.\n<br/>\n<br/>He grabs the guard's assault rifle and turns a corner. Two men grab him. He slams the butt of the rifle, knocking the wind and teeth out of BAD GUY #1, then he kicks down and breaks the shin bone of BAD GUY #2 who screams out in agony. Mariachi silences him by karate punching his throat. The Bad Guy gurgles and hits the ground.\n<br/>\n<br/>Angle from the ground as Mariachi smashes the guy with is gun.\n<br/>\n<br/>He crawls up a wall, trying to escape as quietly as he can. He sees TWO MORE MEN running towards him since they heard some noise. Mariachi aims his assault rifle at the blue Chevy parked behind him. He fires and it explodes.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi jumps Loco, gets him to drive him to the saloon. He also takes Loco's money.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT.

The Assistant tends to the bar.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>ROAD TO MOCO'S\n<br/></b>\n<br/>They drive out to Moco's ranch in Azul's truck. Little do they know, they passed Loco's truck with Mariachi crouched in the passenger seat. He gets up after the truck passes. Mariachi didn't know it was Domino in Azul's truck or he could have turned around and kept her from going to Moco's ranch.\n<br/>\n<br/>They arrive at the gate and het out of the truck.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>DOMINO\n<br/></b>(over the gate)\n<br/>Mauricio!!\n<br/>\n<br/>Azul grabs Domino and points a gun to her head.

I will.\n<br/>\n<br/>Moco pulls out his gun and shoots her in the heart. She falls limp in Azul's arms. Azul tries hold her up, but she's dead. Azul rests her on the ground, looking down at her, wondering why it's all come to this.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>AZUL\n<br/></b>All I wanted was my rightful share. But you've got to kill everybody.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>You feel sorry for her, don't you?

Azul had his hands to his side, and now he falls to his knees. Moco shoots him again, and Azul dies next to Domino.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mean Dude #5 is exchanging glances with the others. No one seems to be on Moco's side.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT.

He dismounts the bike and holds Domino.\n<br/>\n<br/>He has the gun in the back of his pants. You can see it while his back is to the camera and men are approaching him. Moco comes for the show.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>(good shot)\n<br/>So you're the little mariachi that came to town, killed my men, and stole my girl...\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to Moco.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>You are very talented.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi stands, hands up.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>I bet you play the guitarra real well, huh?\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi says nothing.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>(raising gun)\n<br/>Not anymore.\n<br/>\n<br/>Moco fires into Mariachi's left hand. Mariachi grimaces, crumbling to the floor. He keeps a tight grip on his hand. When he opens his hand to see the damage, the camera can see right through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through the hole.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MOCO\n<br/></b>Now get the hell off my property and take your hand with you!!!\n<br/>\n<br/>Moco is laughing and looking at his men for support, but no one else laughs. Mariachi tries to stand, but he falls back. When he rises again he has the gun in his hand. He shoots Moco in the chest. Moco falls back and hits the ground hard. He gasps for air...\n<br/>\n<br/>Moco's men gather around him. Mean Dude #5 crouches down to check Moco's throat pulse. Moco's dead. Mean Dude #5 strikes a match across Moco's face and lights up a cigarette. He turns and walks away. The others follow.\n<br/>\n<br/>Mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm, kisses Domino, opens Azul's case, sees the weapons, and rides off with it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>MARIACHI ON THE ROAD\n<br/></b>\n<br/>He looks back at the town behind him, then places his hand on the motorcycle to drive off.
