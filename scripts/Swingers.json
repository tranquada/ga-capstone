HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT                                          1\n\n        The soundtrack opens with Frank Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the\n        Moon\".\n\n        A HELICOPTER SHOT OF THE L.A. basin.\n\n        The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of\n        points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the\n        city.\n\n        We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we\n        approach Hollywood Boulevard.  Below is neon and the icy\n        thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood\n        and Vine.\n\n        We continue west, then quickly north.\n\n        There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD\n        sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital\n        Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the\n        101.\n\n        Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up.  We are\n        heading east at treetop level.  A warm glow in the distance\n        quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes\n        cafes, bookstores, and a theater.\n\n        We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass\n        showcase window of the \"Bourgeois Pig\" coffeehouse, which\n        holds the translucent reflection of the full moon.\n\n        A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders.  MIKE takes\n        the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out.  He\n        sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that\n        once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.\n\n                                                         MATCH CUT TO:\n\n   2    EXT.  \"BOURGEOIS PIG\" COFFEEHOUSE - COUCHES AND TABLE IN FRONT   2\n        WINDOW - NIGHT\n\n        ROB sits down next to Mike, pouring himself some tea.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   And what if I don't want to give up on\n                   her?\n\n                             ROB\n                   You don't call.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   But you said I shouldn't call if I\n                   wanted to give up on her.\n\n                             ROB\n                   Right.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   So I don't call either way.\n\n                             ROB\n                   Right.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   So what's the difference?\n\n                             ROB\n                   The only difference between giving up and\n                   not giving up is if you take her back\n                   when she wants to come back.  See, you\n                   can't do anything to make her want to\n                   come back.  You can only do things to\n                   make her not want to come back.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   So the only difference is if I forget\n                   about her or pretend to forget about her.\n\n                             ROB\n                   Right.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Well that sucks.\n\n                             ROB\n                   It sucks.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   So it's almost a retroactive decision.\n                   So I could, like, let's say, forget about\n                   her and when she comes back make like I\n                   just pretended to forget about her.\n\n                             ROB\n                   Right...or more likely the opposite.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Right...  Wait, what do you mean?\n\n                             ROB\n                   I mean first you'll pretend not to care,\n                   not call - whatever, and then,\n                   eventually, you really won't care.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Unless she comes back first.\n\n                             ROB\n                   Ah, see, that's the thing.  Somehow they\n                   don't come back until you really don't\n                   care anymore.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   There's the rub.\n\n                             ROB\n                   There's the rub.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Thanks, man.  Sorry we always talk about\n                   the same thing all the time...\n\n                             ROB\n                   Hey man, don't sweat it.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   ...It's just that you've been there.\n                   Your advice really helps.\n\n                             ROB\n                   No problem.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Rob, I just want you to know, you're the\n                   only one I can talk to about her.\n\n                             ROB\n                   Thanks.

They're pulling it off\n        with only slightly noticeable effort.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   I don't know, I guess I'll start with\n                   three hundred in, uh, blacks.\n\n        Mike tries to hand the DEALER a handful of twenties after\n        counting them twice.\n\n                             DEALER\n                   On the table.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Sorry?\n\n                             DEALER\n                   You have to lay it on the table.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Uh, I don't want to bet it all.\n\n        The other players grow impatient.\n\n                             DEALER\n                   You're not allowed to hand me money, sir.\n                   You'll have to lay it on the table if you\n                   want me to change it.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (hastily laying down the bills)\n                   Oh... right.\n\n        The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible\n        to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead.\n        Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the\n        rain.\n\n                             DEALER\n                   Blacks?\n\n        Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent\n        continues trying to peer through the smoked glass.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Huh?\n\n                             DEALER\n                   You want this in black chips.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Sure, that'll be fine.\n\n        The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT\n        BOSS chirps the response.  Trent's focus whips away from the\n        camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet\n        away.\n\n        The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent\n        Mike's entire cash reserve.  Not quite the effect he had\n        hoped for.\n\n        The swingers stare at the chips.  The players stare at the\n        swingers.  The dealer stares at the pit boss.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Do you have anything smaller?\n\n                             DEALER\n                   Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a\n                   hundred-dollar-minimum bet.  Perhaps\n                   you'd be more comfortable at one of our\n                   lower stakes tables.\n\n        The dealer indicates a FIVE-DOLLAR TABLE across the room\n        where an Hispanic woman deals to a BLUEHAIR, a BIKER, and a\n        COUPLE in matching Siegfried and Roy T-shirts.\n\n        The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by\n        the pit boss.\n\n        The tense silence is broken by...\n\n                             WAITRESS\n                   Drinks?\n                        (then to Trent)\n                   How about you, Cap'n?\n\n        Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who\n        flashed him a smile earlier.  At first he begins to smile,\n        then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle\n        of wills, subtly shakes her off.  She smirks and starts to\n        leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger.\n        It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching.  The kid's going\n        for broke.\n                             MIKE\n                        (to the waitress, but never\n                        breaking eye contact with the\n                        dealer)\n                   I'll have a vodka martini, straight up,\n                   shaken not stirred, very dry.\n\n        Smooth.  Trent is impressed, but masks his pride.\n\n                             WAITRESS\n                        (under her breath cynically as\n                        she writes it down)\n                   One \"James Bond\".\n\n        Ow.  She exits.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (regaining composure)\n                   No.  Blacks will be fine.\n\n        Mike throws a chip in the circle.  Trent is shocked.  That's\n        a hundred bucks.  Mike and Trent share a look.  The dealer\n        and the pit boss exchange glances.  Bets are all down and the\n        cards are meticulously dealt.\n\n        The dealer has a two showing.  Mike has been dealt a five and\n        a six- eleven.\n\n                             TRENT\n                        (hushed tones)\n                   Double down.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (even husheder)\n                   What?!?\n\n                             TRENT\n                   Double down, baby.  You gotta double down\n                   on an eleven.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   I know, but...\n\n                             TRENT\n                   You gotta do it.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   ...but that's two hundred dollars.\n                   This is blood money...\n\n                             TRENT\n                   If we don't look like we know what we're\n                   doing, then we may as well...\n\n        Everyone's waiting for them.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   I know.\n\n        The dealer, the pit boss, and all the players look on as Mike\n        drops ANOTHER BLACK CHIP in the circle with a barely audible,\n        yet deafening, thud.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (with all the nonchalance he\n                        can muster)\n                   Double down.\n\n        A bead of sweat.\n\n        The sharp snap of a dealt card.\n\n        It's a seven.  Eighteen.\n\n        Disappointment twists their faces.\n\n        Finally the dealer flips over his card.\n\n        It's a king!  Twelve.  Here comes the bust...\n\n        Flick - four.  Sixteen!  Here comes the bust...\n\n        Flick - five.  Twenty one.  Groans all around, except for the\n        swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence.\n\n        Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his\n        stomach.\n                             MIKE\n                        (to the pit boss)\n                   Sure could use some dinner about now.\n\n                                                         SMASH CUT TO:\n\n        Trent and Mike are wedged between the BLUEHAIR and the BIKER\n        At the FIVE DOLLAR TABLE.  They share a pile of red chips.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   I'm telling you, baby, you always double\n                   down on an eleven.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Yeah?  Well obviously not always!\n\n                             TRENT\n                   Always, baby.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   I'm just saying, not in this particular\n                   case.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   Always.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   But I lost!  How can you say always?!?\n\n        In the meantime, the Bluehair has been dealt an eleven.\n        This captures the swinger's attention.\n\n                             BLUEHAIR\n                   Hit.\n\n        Four.  Fifteen all together.\n\n                             BLUEHAIR\n                   Oh...  I don't know...  Hit.\n\n        Two.  Seventeen.  Dealer has a seven showing.\n\n                             BLUEHAIR\n                   What the hell- hit.\n\n        Four!  Twenty one.\n\n                             DEALER\n                        (with a warm smile)\n                   Twenty one.\n\n        Polite applause from around the table which the Bluehair\n        humbly waves off.  Mike looks at Trent.  Daggers.  Trent\n        shrugs.\n\n        A different PIT BOSS approaches.\n\n                             PIT BOSS\n                   Would you care for some breakfast, ma'am?\n\n                             BLUEHAIR\n                   Well...?  No, I shouldn't.  Maybe later.\n                   Thank you, though.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (to Trent, under his breath)\n                   I'm gonna fuckinkillyou.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n   14   INT.  TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - CASHIER'S WINDOW - NIGHT          14\n\n        Mike is presented a stack of twenties by the CASHIER, who\n        counts them out.

Trent\n        struggles to cheer him up.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   What's that?  One twenty?  You're up\n                   twenty bucks, baby.\n\n        Mike throws him a disgusted glare.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   ... Well, you know, not counting the\n                   first table.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Thanks for clarifying that.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Yea, how much?\n\n                             TRENT\n                   I don't know, what?

This is turning into quite a\n                   rivalry.\n\n        Rob points to the far-off crowd of a dozen IRATE GOLFERS\n        Waiting to tee off.\n\n                             ROB\n                   You better replace the pin, Chi-Chi.  The\n                   natives look restless.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n   30   INT.  SUE'S APARTMENT - HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EVENING            30\n\n        First of all, SUE is a guy, and a tough guy at that.  He is\n        wearing an L.A. Kings home jersey.  His sweater bears the\n        sacred number \"99\".  Sue is lounging in front of the TV in\n        army surplus khaki cutoffs and untied Doc Martin boots.\n\n        Sue brushes back a shock of straight, greasy, dirty blonde\n        hair as not to obscure his view of the screen.  His face\n        glows with the reflection of the SEGA HOCKEY game on the set.\n        Sue and TRENT are locked in a heavily contested battle of\n        motor reflexes.  Nothing moves but their eyes, thumbs, and\n        mouths...\n\n                             SUE\n                   Bitch...

He is more captivated with the simulated\n        sporting event than the Clippers game on the TV across the\n        room.\n\n        Electric guitars blaze over the stereo.\n\n        The room, like the guys, could use a spring cleaning.  Pizza\n        boxes, beer bottles, and full, full ashtrays.  You can taste\n        the smoke.\n\n                             SUE\n                   You little bitch!\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Hey Sue.

Buzz him in - hit nine.\n\n        Mike picks up the phone off the matted shag carpet.  He\n        pushes \"9\", listens, then hangs up.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   I wish the game still had fights so I\n                   could bitch-slap Wayne.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   This version doesn't have fighting?\n\n                             TRENT\n                   No.  Doesn't that suck?\n\n                             MIKE\n                   What?

If you hit them hard their heads\n                   bleed all over the ice and their legs\n                   convulse.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   No.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   Yeah.\n\n                             SUE\n                   It's kinda money, actually.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Make someone bleed.\n\n                             SUE\n                   No, man, we're in the play-offs.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   I'll make Gretsky bleed, the little\n                   bitch.\n\n        The DELIVERY MAN knocks on the door.\n\n                             SUE\n                   Pause it.\n                        (Trent pauses the game)\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Give me the money.  I'll get it.\n\n        While Sue gives Mike the money, Trent UNPAUSES the game and\n        checks Gretsky into the boards, leaving him writhing in a\n        pool of red pixels.\n\n                             SUE\n                   You bitch!\n\n        Sue dives onto Trent.  They wrestle a little too\n        rambunctiously for indoors.  Trent pulls the hockey sweater\n        over Sue's head and starts wailing on his back.\n\n        Mike crosses.  The CAMERA follows him down a shallow hallway\n        to the door.  He unlocks it.\n\n        A delivery man of eastern-hemispheric decent is out of breath\n        from four flights of stairs.  He hands Mike a twelve-pack of\n        Bud cans and three packs of Marlboro reds.\n\n        He can HEAR, but NOT SEE, the chaos ensuing in the living\n        room.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n   31   INT.  SUE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             31\n\n        Trent and Sue are flushed.  They pause long enough to torment\n        Mike.\n\n                             TRENT\n                        (feigning homosexuality)\n                   Is he cute?

The\n        delivery man doesn't seem to understand any of this.\n\n        Mike, out of guilt, hands him a four dollar tip.  This he\n        seems to understand.  He smiles and leaves.\n\n        Mike crosses back to the main room.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   You guys are such assholes.\n\n                             TRENT\n                        (continuing the gag)\n                   Aww...

DARK ALLEY - OFF OF HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - SEEDY - NIGHT        33\n\n        MIKE and ROB walk down the dirty deserted alleyway.  Mike is\n        wearing baggy slacks, Doc Martin shoes, and an oversized\n        Eisenhower-cut jacket with a vertical stripe inset.  The\n        collar is large and pointy, but definitely not seventies.\n        His ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe.\n\n        Rob hasn't been at it quite as long.  He's wearing worn-in\n        Levies over worn-in boots and, the nineties standby, an\n        untucked flannel.\n\n        Mike walks with purpose.  He intermittently tries to pull\n        open locked steel doors along the alley.  Rob looks confused.\n\n                             ROB\n                   So, if the party starts at eight, why are\n                   we first going to a bar at ten?\n\n                             MIKE\n                   To get a drink before we meet the guys\n                   for a bite at eleven.\n\n                             ROB\n                   Oh.\n                        (beat)\n                   Where is this place?\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (pulling handle)\n                   It's one of these.  For some reason, cool\n                   bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find\n                   and have no signs out front.\n\n                             ROB\n                   That doesn't sound too good for business.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (pull)\n                   It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of\n                   thing.  It's kinda cool.  It's like\n                   you're in on some kind of secret.  You\n                   tell a chick you've been some place, it's\n                   like bragging that you know how to find\n                   it.  The only way you could know where a\n                   place is is if someone who knows brought\n                   you there.  You have to have someone come\n                   before.  There is a direct line\n                   connecting you back to the original,\n                   unequivocally cool, club patrons.  It's\n                   kinda like Judaism...\n\n                             ROB\n                   Sounds more like Aids...\n\n                             MIKE\n                   ... That's probably a more appropriate\n                   analogy.\n\n        At this point they come upon an unmarked BLACK METAL DOOR,\n        which Mike successfully pulls open to reveal...\n\n   34   INT.  \"THE ROOM\" - HOLLYWOOD BAR - SAME                          34\n\n        A smoke-filled, windowless, black-walled room.  There are\n        several round padded booths lining the walls.  The place is\n        packed, and the funk standard \"Brick House\" throbs over the\n        P.A..\n\n        A HANDHELD SHOT as the two guys serpentine to the mirrored\n        bar at the far end of the room.

And then one day\n                   you wake up and you don't think of it at\n                   all, and you almost miss that feeling.\n                   It's kinda weird.  You miss the pain\n                   because it was part of your life for so\n                   long.  And the, boom, something reminds\n                   you of her, and you just smile that\n                   bittersweet smile.\n\n        We see that Mike has been GNAWING AWAY at Rob's pepperoni and\n        semolina as he listens intently.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   You miss the pain?\n\n                             ROB\n                   ... for the same reason you miss her.\n                   You lived with it so long.\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Wow.\n                        (finishing the loaf)\n                   You wanna grab a bite?\n\n                             ROB\n                        (smiling)\n                   Sure.\n\n        He helps Mike up.\n\n                             ROB\n                   By the way, the guys back home said she\n                   put on some weight.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (smiling)\n                   You always know the right thing to say.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n   64   INT.

I mean, no.  I mean, maybe he would\n                   find her, I mean you attractive.  Maybe\n                   he doesn't like to dance.  Maybe all he\n                   likes to do is just stand around and\n                   drink and smoke and look cool with his\n                   buddies who don't dance either...\n\n                             BRUNETTE\n                   Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good\n                   dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's\n                   what he's afraid of.\n\n                             MIKE\n                        (smirk)\n                   No... Maybe that's not the case.  Maybe\n                   she shouldn't be such a smug little shit\n                   because she'd be surprised at what a good\n                   dancer he really is, but it's been a long\n                   time and he doesn't know if he's ready\n                   to...\n\n                             BRUNETTE\n                   Mike...\n\n        She gets up.  She's beautiful.  She is beautiful.\n\n                             BRUNETTE\n                   ... Will you dance with me?\n\n        She's in great shape,  and look how classy her vintage dress\n        looks.  A vision from the forties.  She's too good for this\n        place.  She belongs on the nose of a B-52.  What can he say,\n        but...\n\n                             MIKE\n                   Sure I will.\n\n        He awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor.\n        They START TO DANCE.  It's a slow song and they boringly rock\n        back and forth.  Mike is self-conscious, but her touch.  Oh\n        her touch.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n        Trent and Sue watching in disbelief.\n\n                             SUE\n                   It is on.\n\n                             TRENT\n                   ... it is so on.\n\n                                                              BACK TO:\n\n        The couple's dance is cut short as there were only a few bars\n        left of the slow ballad.  Mike smiles politely in relief and\n        begins to lead Lorraine off the floor.\n\n        She pulls him back.  He's not getting off that easy.  She\n        wants a whole song.  He politely holds her, poised for\n        another slow number.  They're alone on the floor.\n\n        Much to Mike's dismay, the song begins with a DRIVING TOM TOM\n        SOLO.  This cues every hep cat in the Derby that the big\n        one's coming.  They all flood the floor for the last dance of\n        the night.\n\n        Mike pleadingly shakes his head at Lorraine.  It's too fast.\n        Her eyes narrow as her grip tightens.  No sympathy here.\n\n        The band breaks into the full-tilt swing number and the dance\n        floor writhes around them.\n\n        They stand motionless for what seems like an eternity.\n\n        Gut check.  Fuck it.  Sink or swim.\n\n        Mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman.  It's just a simple\n        six-count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony.\n\n        Mike and Lorraine look into each others eyes.  It's on, baby.\n\n        As Mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow.  A spin at\n        first.  Then a double twirl.  It's not long before he's\n        throwing her through combinations that stand out even among\n        the pros.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n        Trent and Sue, mouths agape.\n\n                                                              BACK TO:\n\n        Mike is whipping her smoothly through violent-looking\n        combinations without a trace of hesitation, and, boy, can she\n        follow.\n\n        The set ends with a flourishing crescendo.  They're frozen in\n        a final dip, panting through a glaze of clean sweat.\n\n        Mike and Lorraine smile and look into each other's eyes.  The\n        smile slowly disappears.  Will they kiss?\n\n        They're close.\n\n        Really close.\n\n        Lips almost touching.\n\n        Mike tries to muster-up the courage, but it's been so long.\n\n        He can't do it.  He lets her up.\n\n        The floor clears.  Exhausted dancers push past them.  Forget\n        it.  The moment's gone.\n\n        What the hell.  They had a great time.  What's the hurry?\n\n                                                          SOFT CUT TO:\n\n   70   EXT.
