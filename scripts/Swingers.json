HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT                                          1\n</b>\n        The soundtrack opens with Frank Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the\n        Moon\".\n\n        A HELICOPTER SHOT OF THE L.A. basin.\n\n        The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of\n        points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the\n        city.\n\n        We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we\n        approach Hollywood Boulevard.  Below is neon and the icy\n        thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood\n        and Vine.\n\n        We continue west, then quickly north.\n\n        There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD\n        sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital\n        Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the\n<b>        101.\n</b>\n        Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up.  We are\n        heading east at treetop level.  A warm glow in the distance\n        quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes\n        cafes, bookstores, and a theater.\n\n        We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass\n        showcase window of the \"Bourgeois Pig\" coffeehouse, which\n        holds the translucent reflection of the full moon.\n\n        A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders.  MIKE takes\n        the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out.  He\n        sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that\n        once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.\n\n<b>                                                         MATCH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>   2    EXT.  \"BOURGEOIS PIG\" COFFEEHOUSE - COUCHES AND TABLE IN FRONT   2\n</b><b>        WINDOW - NIGHT\n</b>\n        ROB sits down next to Mike, pouring himself some tea.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   And what if I don't want to give up on\n                   her?\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   You don't call.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   But you said I shouldn't call if I\n                   <b>wanted</b> to give up on her.\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   Right.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   So I don't call either way.\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   Right.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   So what's the difference?\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   The only difference between giving up and\n                   not giving up is if you take her back\n                   when she wants to come back.  See, you\n                   can't do anything to make her want to\n                   come back.  You can only do things to\n                   make her not want to come back.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   So the only difference is if I forget\n                   about her or pretend to forget about her.\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   Right.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Well that sucks.\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   It sucks.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   So it's almost a retroactive decision.\n                   So I could, like, let's say, forget about\n                   her and when she comes back make like I\n                   just pretended to forget about her.\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   Right...or more likely the opposite.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Right...  Wait, what do you mean?\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   I mean first you'll pretend not to care,\n                   not call - whatever, and then,\n                   eventually, you really won't care.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Unless she comes back first.\n\n<b>                             ROB\n</b>                   Ah, see, that's the thing.

They're pulling it off\n        with only slightly noticeable effort.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   I don't know, I guess I'll start with\n                   three hundred in, uh, blacks.\n\n        Mike tries to hand the DEALER a handful of twenties after\n        counting them twice.\n\n<b>                             DEALER\n</b>                   On the table.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Sorry?\n\n<b>                             DEALER\n</b>                   You have to lay it on the table.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Uh, I don't want to bet it all.\n\n        The other players grow impatient.\n\n<b>                             DEALER\n</b>                   You're not allowed to hand me money, sir.\n                   You'll have to lay it on the table if you\n                   want me to change it.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                        (hastily laying down the bills)\n                   Oh... right.\n\n        The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible\n        to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead.\n        Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the\n        rain.\n\n<b>                             DEALER\n</b>                   Blacks?\n\n        Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent\n        continues trying to peer through the smoked glass.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Huh?\n\n<b>                             DEALER\n</b>                   You want this in black chips.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Sure, that'll be fine.\n\n        The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT\n        BOSS chirps the response.  Trent's focus whips away from the\n        camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet\n        away.\n\n        The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent\n        Mike's entire cash reserve.  Not quite the effect he had\n        hoped for.\n\n        The swingers stare at the chips.  The players stare at the\n        swingers.  The dealer stares at the pit boss.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                   Do you have anything smaller?\n\n<b>                             DEALER\n</b>                   Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a\n                   hundred-dollar-minimum bet.  Perhaps\n                   you'd be more comfortable at one of our\n                   lower stakes tables.\n\n        The dealer indicates a FIVE-DOLLAR TABLE across the room\n        where an Hispanic woman deals to a BLUEHAIR, a BIKER, and a\n        COUPLE in matching Siegfried and Roy T-shirts.\n\n        The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by\n        the pit boss.\n\n        The tense silence is broken by...\n\n<b>                             WAITRESS\n</b>                   Drinks?\n                        (then to Trent)\n                   How about you, <b>Cap'n</b>?\n\n        Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who\n        flashed him a smile earlier.  At first he begins to smile,\n        then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle\n        of wills, subtly shakes her off.  She smirks and starts to\n        leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger.\n        It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching.  The kid's going\n        for broke.\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                        (to the waitress, but never\n                        breaking eye contact with the\n                        dealer)\n                   I'll have a vodka martini, straight up,\n                   shaken not stirred, very dry.\n\n        Smooth.  Trent is impressed, but masks his pride.\n\n<b>                             WAITRESS\n</b>                        (under her breath cynically as\n                        she writes it down)\n                   One \"James Bond\".\n\n        Ow.

Trent is shocked.  That's\n        a hundred bucks.  Mike and Trent share a look.  The dealer\n        and the pit boss exchange glances.  Bets are all down and the\n        cards are meticulously dealt.\n\n        The dealer has a two showing.  Mike has been dealt a five and\n        a six- <b>eleven</b>.\n\n<b>                             TRENT\n</b>                        (hushed tones)\n                   Double down.\n\n<b>                             MIKE\n</b>                        (even husheder)\n                   What?!?\n\n<b>                             TRENT\n</b>                   Double down, baby.

He politely holds her, poised for\n        another slow number.  They're alone on the floor.\n\n        Much to Mike's dismay, the song begins with a DRIVING TOM TOM\n        SOLO.  This cues every hep cat in the Derby that the big\n        one's coming.  They all flood the floor for the last dance of\n        the night.\n\n        Mike pleadingly shakes his head at Lorraine.  It's too fast.\n        Her eyes narrow as her grip tightens.  No sympathy here.\n\n        The band breaks into the full-tilt swing number and the dance\n        floor writhes around them.\n\n        They stand motionless for what seems like an eternity.\n\n        Gut check.  Fuck it.  Sink or swim.\n\n        Mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman.  It's just a simple\n        six-count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony.\n\n        Mike and Lorraine look into each others eyes.  It's on, baby.\n\n        As Mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow.  A spin at\n        first.  Then a double twirl.  It's not long before he's\n        throwing her through combinations that stand out even among\n        the pros.\n\n<b>                                                               CUT TO:\n</b>\n        Trent and Sue, mouths agape.\n\n<b>                                                              BACK TO:\n</b>\n        Mike is whipping her smoothly through violent-looking\n        combinations without a trace of hesitation, and, boy, can she\n        follow.\n\n        The set ends with a flourishing crescendo.  They're frozen in\n        a final dip, panting through a glaze of clean sweat.\n\n        Mike and Lorraine smile and look into each other's eyes.  The\n        smile slowly disappears.  Will they kiss?\n\n        They're close.\n\n        Really close.\n\n        Lips almost touching.\n\n        Mike tries to muster-up the courage, but it's been so long.\n\n        He can't do it.  He lets her up.\n\n        The floor clears.  Exhausted dancers push past them.  Forget\n        it.  The moment's gone.\n\n        What the hell.  They had a great time.

Thanks for holding on.\n\n<b>                             LORRAINE\n</b>                   Listen, Mike.  You really didn't have to\n                   get off the line.  I just wanted to ask\n                   you one thing.  I know I shouldn't have\n                   called, I mean, my friends said I should\n                   wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound\n                   like such a schoolgirl... It's just that\n                   it's tonight only... I mean, it's\n                   Sinatra's birthday and they have this\n                   thing every year at \"The Room\".  Do you\n                   know where that is?  It's impossible to\n                   find if you've never been there.  I don't\n                   understand why none of the clubs in\n                   Hollywood have signs.  Anyway, I'm so bad\n                   at this, if you're not busy I thought you\n                   might...\n\n        Mike smiles as the CAMERA PULLS BACK from the window and\n        backwards down Franklin Avenue in a reverse of the first shot\n        of the movie.  The soundtrack kicks in with Sinatra's \"Here's\n        To The Losers\"....\n\n<b>                             FRANK\n</b>                   Here's to those who love not too wisely,\n                   no, not too wisely, but too well...\n                   To the girl who sighs with envy when she\n                   hears that wedding bell...\n                   To the guy who'd throw a party if he knew\n                   someone to call...\n                   Here's to the losers... Bless them all...\n\n\n        ...We rise and pass the glowing Hollywood sign.

Up and over Hollywood Boulevard.
