Stepping to the\n          rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:\n\n          PRINCE\n          Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can\n          you recognize a traitor? She's here to\n          betray her own!\n          He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.\n\n          PRINCE\n          I'm here to recruit all of you against\n          the humans. Make your decision now. Those\n          who join me will be rewarded. The rest...\n          will be killed.\n          A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of\n          CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is\n          unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.\n          He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap\n          down to block his path.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          I'm gonna put this as delicately as I\n          can.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 53\n\n          84\n\n          84 INT. BOWLING ALLEY - SAME\n\n          A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players\n          in colorful shirts and shoes.\n          Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds\n          right at the pins...\n\n          BOWLER\n          Look out, Manny! Strike city..!\n          CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting\n          the clawing monsters right behind him!\n          As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out\n          into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way\n          free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.\n          Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the\n          water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries\n          the blows, leaping like Nureyev.\n          Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at\n          the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their\n          feet.\n          As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as\n          clubs. The screaming PATRONS rush for the doors.\n\n          85\n\n          85 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS\n\n          Outside, the civilians flee, but the news crews come\n          is back.

A pair of crab-like THINGS shrivel and burn.\n          Johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster, until only his\n          legs are visible beneath it. Bending at the waist - SPLAT -\n          he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature!\n          WINK and HB duke it out for a few beats and then HB finally\n          vanquishes the Troll, Ripping his Iron Mace off and throwing\n          it away.\n          As the other monsters retreat...\n          .the PRINCE appears: in his hand a complex mechanical\n          GRENADE. Immediately worried, Abe hustles the Princess over\n          to the BPRD truck.\n          The Prince twists a timer. His bloodied trolls disperse,\n          screaming, renewing the panic.\n\n          PRINCE\n          (to Hellboy)\n          I will find you, young daemon -\n          (to Nuala)\n          - and you, too, my sister.

WHAMMMM!\n          A HUGE TREE punches up through the pavement, overturning\n          cars, knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping\n          up through the Bridge overpass!!\n          Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into\n          the moonlit clouds.\n          Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in\n          fascination. Birds and creatures emerge from the inside and\n          flutter around, grass overtakes pavement- and for a moment\n          Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.\n\n          HELLBOY (CONT'D)\n          Whoa. Just like the story books.\n          Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING\n          climbs on Liz's shoulder and a couple of IRIDESCENT\n          HUMMINGBIRDS fly around her \"ala\" SNOW WHITE. A small crowd\n          starts wandering into this idyllic scenario.\n\n          LIZ\n          This is so beautiful-\n\n          MANNING\n          So- perfect- so peaceful-\n\n          HELLBOY\n          Hey!!!\n          He spots. the prince, at the base of the tree.

What is he doing-?\n\n          LIZ\n          He's knocking on wood- summoning an\n\n          ELEMENTAL-\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 57\n\n          MANNING\n          An elem-\n\n          LIZ\n          A forest spirit that lives in that tree.\n          He's releasing it-\n\n          MANNING\n          Oh, and is it that bad??\n          KKKRRRRCHTCH!!!!! The tree trunk rumbles and shakes under\n          some enormous force. Huge LEAVES tumble to the street. Even\n          the ever-present NEWS CREWS back away as a huge shape\n          descends.\n          BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant\n\n          ELEMENTAL.\n          Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out\n          of the tree and stares at Hellboy.\n          Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm\n          and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!\n          WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,\n          turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks\n          back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a\n          single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          Good dog.\n          (to Elemental)\n          Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,\n          you fight with me.\n          Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.\n          The Elemental hops forward, New branches sprout from his\n          limbs, shaking the Yrdrig off.\n\n          ABE\n          (to the Princess)\n          This may not be the best place for you,\n          your majesty. With your permission...\n          He offers the Princess his arm. She takes it and allows Abe\n          to lead her away. A moment later, the Elemental smashes the\n          ground where they had been standing!\n          Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and\n          branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to\n          the original tree trunk, like an umbilical cord.\n          Johann sees this-\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 58\n\n          JOHANN\n          I have a plan-\n          He looks at Abe-\n\n          87 STANDING AT THE GARBAGE TRUCK 87\n          -as the fishman helps the Princess up into the rear of the\n          BPRD garbage truck.\n          Up front, behind the wheel, Liz starts the engine.\n\n          88 ABANDONED BUILDING\n\n          88\n          Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches\n          extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his\n          feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the\n          Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing\n          and discarding branches and roots.\n\n          89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89\n\n          Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.\n          Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes\n          through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a\n          corridor littered with debris.\n          Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section\n          of the corridor as Hellboy runs.\n\n          90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90\n\n          Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of\n          reach of the Elemental.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          (to the Elemental)\n          What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?\n          The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,\n          barking in frustration.\n          Hellboy's RADIO crackles:\n\n          ABE\n          (on the radio)\n          HB? This is Blue. The Princess is fine.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 59\n\n          HELLBOY\n          So what?\n\n          JOHANN\n          So, lead him to the bridge.\n          Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn\n          Bridge in the distance.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!\n\n          ABE\n          You'll figure it out.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?\n          Hello???\n          No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing\n          neon sign reading \"Hotel\".\n          The Elemental smashes the letters \"tel\"... so Hellboy climbs\n          the \"0\" to the roof.\n\n          91 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME 91\n\n          Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.\n          Johann is sitting next to her.\n\n          92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92\n\n          Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He\n          sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...\n          and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.\n          Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent\n          roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental\n          pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward\n          Hellboy, like an ocean wave!\n          Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over\n          the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.\n\n          93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93\n\n          Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using\n          binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy\n          bringing the Elemental closer.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 60\n\n          ABE\n          Johann - they're almost here.\n          Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops\n          at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.\n          Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.\n\n          ABE\n          Yes. I had the very same idea...\n          He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine\n          which holds a half mile of steel cable.\n\n          ABE\n          (gazing at the controls)\n          .but how do you operate this??\n\n          JOHANN\n          If you'll permit me...\n          Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into\n          the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.\n\n          JOHANN\n          (to Abe)\n          Stand back, Abe.\n          A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through\n          the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down\n          near the far shore of the East River.\n\n          JOHANN\n          Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the\n          other side.\n          (seeing Hellboy coming)\n          Quickly, Abe!\n\n          94 IN THE WATER 94\n          Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.\n          Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan\n          shore.\n\n          95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95\n          Hellboy makes it to the bridge... as, behind him, the\n          Elemental wades into the river, pushing aside boats and\n          barges.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 61\n\n          96\n\n          96 IN THE RIVER\n          Abe makes it to the other side, surfacing with the cable,\n          towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.\n\n          JOHANN (CONT'D)\n          (on the radio)\n          Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!\n          The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on\n\n          IT-\n\n          ABE\n          I need more!\n\n          JOHANN\n          No more available!\n          The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as\n          he encounters the submerged cable.\n\n          97\n\n          97 UNDERWATER\n          Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...\n          past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting\n          CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!\n          Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him\n          unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.\n\n          98\n\n          98 AT THE BRIDGE\n          As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone\n          calling out from above:\n\n          PRINCE\n          (to Hellboy)\n          Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,\n          who were so eager for a fight?\n          The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at\n          Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.\n\n          PRINCE\n          (to the Elemental)\n          Over here, dear friend...\n          SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy\n          wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 62\n          The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel\n          spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.\n\n          PRINCE\n          This might be a good chance for you to\n          come to your senses. Help us.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          I've been all through this! The answer's\n          still no!\n          Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,\n          bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a\n          steel snake!\n          The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the\n          Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable\n\n          TENSES-\n\n          JOHANN\n          (to Liz)\n          Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i\n          He points at the roots trailing into the river.

If we survive this, we\n          need to talk.\n          The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four\n          friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.\n\n          ABE\n          He - he's a cad!

Hellboy brings out\n          his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and\n          swings it like a club.\n          A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop\n          back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.\n\n          LIZ\n          Let me -\n          Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each\n          hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the\n          oncoming fighters.\n          The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening\n          scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains\n          hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,\n          marching on and over their scorched comrades.\n          Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it\n          his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.\n          He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against\n          his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy\n          groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.\n          At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the\n          wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.\n\n          JOHANN\n          Invincibility!? So - the only one thing\n          may stop them -\n          Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self\n          flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 108\n          Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts\n          chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as\n          Johann rips into the enemy!!\n          But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As\n          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell\n          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically\n          dismember it like marauding insects!\n          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,\n          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.\n\n          JOHANN\n          Ach. They are too many. Anyone have\n          another idea?\n          Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his\n          feet.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          (a bellow)\n          Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to\n          command this army!\n          With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All\n          the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a\n          ledge with his sister.\n\n          ABE\n          (follows HB)\n          No= please- no-\n          Hellboy moves away from him.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          A challenge must be answered!

His muscles can no longer respond.\n          The Prince is ready to kill him.\n\n          LIZ\n          (witness to a nightmare)\n          No!! NO! !\n          A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps\n          forward and...\n          Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right\n          arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.\n          Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away\n          red with blood. He looks over at his sister.\n          They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and\n          hatred.\n          Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly\n          raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has\n          the advantage.\n          He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the\n          Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.\n\n          HELLBOY\n          I- have- won-\n\n          PRINCE\n          No. You have not-\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          HELLBOY 2 110\n          He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes\n          through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy\n          pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the\n          Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.\n\n          ABE\n\n          (GASPS)\n\n          NO-\n          Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,\n          blinking in despair.\n          The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts\n          her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.\n\n          PRINCESS\n          We'll find each other again, somewhere.\n          And she dies in his arms.\n          In the center of the arena:\n\n          PRINCE\n          (to Hellboy)\n          You... think you're any different from\n          me?

May you\n          make a better choice.\n          Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to\n          fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from\n          Abe's hands...\n          Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.\n          Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.\n          Suddenly, he rips it into pieces.
