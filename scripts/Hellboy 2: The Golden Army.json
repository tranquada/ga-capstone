As\n          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell\n          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically\n          dismember it like marauding insects!\n          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,\n          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.\n\n<b>          JOHANN\n</b>          Ach.
