He has a readout screen\n     that perpetually spews data.

Once\n     safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in\n     the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.\n\n     Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to\n     indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.\n\n     Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of\n     Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a\n     special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.\n\n     A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.\n\n     Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses\n     out of the Harvester carefully.\n\n\n<b>25   I/E.

Ed's guest is a very\n     young Goldie Hawn.\n\n     Note: Whenever any TV is watched in the film, it is always\n     a show from 1970's America. (Mash, Six Million Dollar Man,\n     Laugh-In, etc.) No explanation is given for this.\n\n     Sam is half-watching the TV, but his focus is chiefly on\n     the SMALL HOUSE he is carving. And carving beautifully.\n\n     After a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a\n     remote. He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room\n     to make some tea.

The\n     tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor.\n\n     Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream\n     of cold water.

He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam\n     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and\n     turns the unconscious man onto his back.\n\n     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans\n     down even closer.\n\n\n<b>     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN\n</b>\n     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM.

The VP shaking in his hands. He\n      is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         \n      so he is only sending audio.                                       \n\n      A moment of silence.

It's the same Girl from his\n      hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles\n      dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.\n\n      The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --\n      that he's imagining things again.
