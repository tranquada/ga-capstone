It is essentially\n    a tiny room with a coffin like, sealed bed in the middle of\n    it: a cryogenic POD with an array of complicated controls\n    surrounding it.\n\n                        SAM (V.O.)\n              And blast home.\n\n\n7   INT.

We PICK OUT a television set, an armchair, a\n    Ping-Pong table, the treadmill.\n\n                        SAM (V.O.)\n              I never dreamed I'd make it this\n              far.\n\n                                                                           4.\n\n\n\n\n     DETAIL: A WOODEN MODEL\n\n     On a table, we also PICK OUT a LARGE MODEL carved out of\n     BOLSER WOOD.

A dark         \n     storage area Sam has repurposed to grow a handful of                \n     plants.

A              \n     single bed dominates.                                               \n\n                         SAM (V.O.)\n               In many ways, this place is all\n               about contradictions.\n\n\n10   EXT.

She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave\n     behind.\n\n     Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.\n\n                            SAM (V.O.)

And tell\n               her daddy will only be away a\n               little longer -- seventeen days\n               longer, approximately. I love you\n               both dearly.

The base is small.\n     Confined. Claustrophobic. It is easy to imagine how someone\n     could crack up here.\n\n     Sam leaves the Comms Room and heads down the corridor.\n\n\n15   INT. REC ROOM                                                 15\n\n     A state of the art robot, a GERTY 3000 -- known simply as\n     \"GERTY\" -- is preparing Sam's breakfast.\n\n     Gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal\n     rail that runs throughout the base. He has a readout screen\n     that perpetually spews data. His hands resemble pincers,\n     but are perfectly nimble.\n\n     For the purposes of helping run the base and looking after\n     Sam, Gerty is as good as human, if not better.\n\n     Sam enters.\n\n                         SAM\n               Morning, Gerty.\n\n                         GERTY\n               Morning, Sam.

Whether\n     this is down to Gerty's intelligence or Sam's desperation\n     for company isn't clear just yet.\n\n     Note: Gerty talks like a well-educated older man. His\n     language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e.\n     Monotone) but he is friendly enough.\n\n     Sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static -\n     - he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks.\n     We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it\n     before he allows it to play on, on some random American\n     station -- an old weather report:\n\n                           VOICE ON RADIO\n                 ...it's a hot one on the East\n                 Coast, temperatures soaring to a\n                 high of ninety three degrees in\n                 New York City --\n\n     They zip around the tiny kitchen, together preparing Sam's\n     breakfast, working as a team.\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\n16   EXT.

The Harvester resembles a tank\n     and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.\n\n     Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back\n     of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and\n     dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.\n\n\n24   INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS                           24\n\n     Sam is in an area   of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --\n     not dissimilar to   a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once\n     safely inside Sam   closes the door. He is able to breathe in\n     the Belly without   his helmet, which he duly removes.\n\n     Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to\n     indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.\n\n     Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of\n     Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a\n     special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.\n\n     A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.\n\n     Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses\n     out of the Harvester carefully.\n\n\n25   I/E.

The Cargo\n     Container is about the size of a fridge and can take a\n     maximum of five pods. There are four pods already inside,\n     Sam's new pod taking up the fifth and final slot.\n\n                                                                       10.\n\n\n\n\n27   INT.

He works with a sense of routine, far away,\n     preoccupied.\n\n     All of a sudden Sam STOPS. He has the feeling someone is\n     standing behind him. He slowly turns.\n\n     A GIRL is standing in the doorway watching him. She is\n     perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. A yellow dress. Long,\n     wheat-colored hair. Freckles. At once beautiful and\n     haunting.\n\n     Sam gets the FRIGHT of his life. He FLIES against the wall.\n\n     WIDEN to reveal Sam and the Girl facing off. Sam POP-EYED\n     and SHAKING. The Girl IMMOBILE, arms at her sides, head\n     tilted ever so slightly to one side.\n\n     The Cargo Container is sent hurtling through space. A              \n     TERRIFIC BLAST.

Ed's guest is a very\n     young Goldie Hawn.\n\n     Note: Whenever any TV is watched in the film, it is always\n     a show from 1970's America. (Mash, Six Million Dollar Man,\n     Laugh-In, etc.) No explanation is given for this.\n\n     Sam is half-watching the TV, but his focus is chiefly on\n     the SMALL HOUSE he is carving. And carving beautifully.\n\n     After a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a\n     remote. He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room\n     to make some tea. The water has just boiled.\n\n     As Sam is about to pour the boiling water, tea kettle in\n     hand, he glances across the Rec Room and sees:\n\n                                                                       21.\n\n\n\n     The Girl.

The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and\n     BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand.\n\n     Simultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The\n     tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor.\n\n     Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream\n     of cold water.

She appears to be staring directly at\n     Sam's rover.\n\n\n     SAM\n\n     His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. An\n     intense, yearning, curiosity.\n\n                                                                       25.\n\n\n\n     He drives closer.\n\n     But like in a dream, Sam can't seem to make up any distance\n     between the Rover and the Girl. He CRUSHES the accelerator\n     peddle.\n\n     For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester,\n     clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the\n     side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester,\n     focussed on the Girl.\n\n     ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly\n     veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing\n     Sam to lose control.\n\n     The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately\n     tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split\n     second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN\n     into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of\n     MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the\n     Harvester, DEVOURED.\n\n     The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE,\n     resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG,\n     BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL.\n\n     WIDE SHOT: Silence. The Harvester stationary. The Rover\n     caught beneath it.\n\n     No sign of the Girl.\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\n     BLACK.\n\n     Silence.

An ALARM sounds.\n\n     Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:\n\n                          SAM\n                Gerty! Get over here!

Either way there might be\n                damage to the exterior shell.

Maybe you better let me\n                take a look, just in case, huh?\n\n                          GERTY\n                Sam, I'm not supposed to let you\n                go outside.\n\n                          SAM\n                Then let's keep it between you\n                and me then.

The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects\n     at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily\n     repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:\n\n                              GERTY\n                 Okay, Sam.\n\n     The \"Exit Doors\" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam\n     this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he\n     immediately takes off down the corridor --\n\n\n74   INT. CHANGING AREA                                            74\n\n     Sam finds his space suit is gone, so grabs the spare suit\n     and scrambles into it.\n\n\n75   INT. DOCK                                                     75\n\n     Two Rovers parked side by side. One of the parking bays is\n     EMPTY. Sam stands before the empty bay for a moment -- why\n     is one of the Rovers missing?\n\n     If Sam suspected something was wrong before, he is certain\n     of it now. He climbs into one of the two remaining Rovers.\n\n\n76   I/E. ROVER/MOON SURFACE                                       76\n\n     Sam speeding along in the Rover. He has Matthew's\n     coordinates plugged into his Navigation System and is\n     following a MAP on a small monitor.\n\n\n77   EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS                                       77\n\n     Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes\n     apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of\n     the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what\n     that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.\n\n     Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with\n     CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens\n     the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.\n\n     ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam\n     takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the\n     Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep\n     FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.\n\n                                                                       36.\n\n\n\n\n     THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER\n\n     The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the\n     accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles\n     of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is\n     an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped\n     inside.\n\n     Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his\n     body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching\n     for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.\n\n     With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door\n     open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --\n     Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.\n\n     Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover,\n     his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam\n     takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and\n     turns the unconscious man onto his back.\n\n     He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans\n     down even closer.\n\n\n     CLOSE UP -- THE MAN\n\n     Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as\n     we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of\n     the film.\n\n     Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the\n     REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has\n     just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.\n\n\n     WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER\n\n     Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious\n     Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him\n     to the parked Rover.\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\n78   INT.

Sam 1 loping\ntowards the Jammer, seemingly in slow motion.\n\nThe JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating, stark pole\nstabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest\ncaber. Next to it Sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as\ninsignificant as a pin prick.\n\nSam 1 and Sam 2\n\nWe cut back and forth between the two Sams as they both\ninvestigate the separate but identical-looking Jammers.\n\n                      SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n           I can just make out the top. Must\n           be a hundred feet tall at least.\n           It's huge!\n\n                     SAM 1\n           Whoever built these things meant\n           business. They weren't fucking\n           around.\n\nTheir voices ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made\nthis discovery -- they aren't dealing with the negatives\nyet.\n\n                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)\n           What do you think?\n\n                     SAM 2\n           Its not an antennae, dude.

These things must be\n           blocking our signal.\n\nSuddenly Sam 1 doubles over. He vomits thick, viscous\nblood and sick into his helmet. Revolting.\n\nThe noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone.\n\n                                                                         62.\n\n\n\n                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n                  You okay?\n\n      No answer from Sam 1. He COLLAPSES backwards onto the\n      ground. His chest LURCHES like he's been punched at from\n      the inside -- he spins over onto his front --\n\n                              SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n                  Sam?\n\n      Sam 1 manages to climb to his feet -- heads slowly back to\n      the Rover -- he dips in, closes the door.\n\n                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n                  Sam, can you hear me?\n\n                             SAM 1\n                  Yeah, I hear you.\n                      (then)\n                  I'm going to head back to base.\n                  I'm not feeling too good.\n\n                            SAM 2\n                  I'll stay out here a little\n                  longer.

With great\n      effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the\n      floor next to him. He stares into the toilet.\n\n      For a moment all is calm. The gentle \"ping-ping-ping\" of a\n      computer somewhere inside the base. Sam breathing steadily.\n      Spots of sweat on his upper lip.\n\n      And then he VOMITS.

RETURN VEHICLE                                         112\n\n      Sam 1 heads into the Return Vehicle. Its dominated by the\n      cryo pod, used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic\n      sleep on their way back to Earth. Sam 1 pops open the lid\n      and starts frantically searching the chamber for TRACES of\n      the previous Sams, eventually finding particles of DUST in\n      the cracks --\n\n                                                                        66.\n\n\n\n      He closes the lid. A video showing a TECHNICIAN in a white\n      lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid\n      of the pod. It's mute, but we can hear a tinny version of\n      the audio coming from the cryo pod. Sam 1 pushes a button\n      on the monitor and we hear the audio properly.\n\n                            TECHNICIAN\n                  ...relax and breathe deeply.

As you\n                  begin to get sleepy, think about\n                  the magnificent job you've done,\n                  and how proud your family are of\n                  what you've accomplished.\n\n      Relaxing music begins to play. After a moment the music\n      stops. There is a pause. Then an almighty pulse of light\n      from the cryo pod. This is how Sams past have met their\n      end. Nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod.\n\n      Sam 1 inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it\n      really is a vehicle -- in the process of his search he\n      finds himself down on his knees checking out the wiring.\n\n      Suddenly Sam 1's attention is on the floor BENEATH HIM. He\n      appears to be kneeling on some kind of PANEL -- like a\n      tablet in the return vehicle's floor -- he presses his ear\n      against the panel -- KNOCKS --\n\n      The panel sounds HOLLOW.\n\n\n      CUBBY\n\n      Sam 1 opens a cubby, swipes something similar to a CROW\n      BAR, heads out of the frame --\n\n\n      RETURN VEHICLE\n\n      Back in the Return Vehicle, Sam 1 stands over the panel in\n      the floor. He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open --\n      this takes an extraordinary effort -- the panel eventually\n      LIFTING like a manhole cover.\n\n      Sam 1 can't believe his eyes. At the top of the OPEN PANEL,\n      leading down into darkness...there's A LADDER.\n\n\n113   INT.

MONITORING STATION -- MOMENTS LATER                      117\n\n      Sam 1 is digging in drawers, removes some equipment, some\n      wires; a radio, a small machine called a VIDEO PHONE,\n      referred to as a VP.\n\n      He is watched by Gerty.\n\n                            GERTY\n                 Sam, can I help you with\n                 something?\n\n                           SAM 1\n                 Not now, Gerty, okay?\n\n      Gerty begins to slide out of the room.   Sam calls after             \n      him.                                                                 \n\n                            SAM 1 (CONT'D)                                 \n                 Gerty?

DOCK                                                   118\n\n      Sam 1 marches up to his Rover, tosses in the backpack and\n      dips inside without his helmet, closes the door and backs\n      out into the black day.\n\n\n119   I/E. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE                             119\n\n      Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks\n      possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --\n\n\n      WIDE SHOT\n\n      Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now\n      know circle the perimeter of the base.\n\n      Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer.\n      Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might\n      be able to get a signal through to Earth.\n\n      ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and\n      starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto\n      the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP\n      resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but\n      nonetheless high-quality screen.\n\n      Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters\n      some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He\n      is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end,         \n      so he is only sending audio.                                       \n\n      A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.\n\n                            SAM 1\n                  Come on...come on...\n\n      Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems\n      to have gone through.\n\n      And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.\n\n      Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his\n      hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles\n      dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.\n\n      The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --\n      that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:\n\n                            GIRL\n                  Hello?\n\n                                                                     71.\n\n\n\nThat's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to\nrespond:\n\n                     SAM 1\n           Uh, Bell residence?\n\nThe conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or\ntwo, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We\nassume that these minor technical glitches are the same on\nthe Girl's end.\n\nThe Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting,\nghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.\n\n                     GIRL\n           This is the Bell Residence.\n\n                     SAM 1\n           I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.\n\nThe girl's expression shifts -- now somewhere between\nmelancholy and curiosity --\n\n                      GIRL\n           I'm sorry, she passed away some\n           years ago.\n\nSam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged\na paring knife into his belly.\n\n                     SAM 1\n           No...no way.\n\nThe girl just stares.\n\n                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)\n           Tess Bell? Are you sure?\n\n                      GIRL\n           Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her\n           daughter.\n               (then)\n           Can I help you?\n\nAnd astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes\na back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new\nrevelation.\n\nThe girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.\n\nSam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.\n\n                     SAM 1\n           Eve?\n\nSam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.\n\n                                                                   72.\n\n\n\n                     EVE BELL\n           Yes?\n\nA moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam\n1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.\n\n                      SAM 1\n                (overwhelmed)\n           Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you\n           now?\n\nFor a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --\nbut is still pulled in, intrigued.\n\n                      EVE BELL\n           I'm fifteen.\n               (then)\n           Do I know you?\n\n                     SAM 1\n           How did mom die, sweetheart?\n\n                     EVE BELL\n           Uh...\n\nNow Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from\nthe screen and calls to someone in another room:\n\n                     EVE BELL (CONT'D)\n           Dad!\n\nAnd then we hear a voice. Sam's voice.\n\n                     SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)\n           What!\n\n                     EVE BELL\n           Dad, there's someone asking about\n           mom...\n\n Sam's voice sounds CLOSER, more SUCCINCT, as he comes into\n the room -- but we don't see him yet -- he sounds, OLDER.     \n\n                     SAM'S VOICE\n           Who's asking about mom?\n\n\nSam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.\n\nHe sits there in the Rover, on the Moon, the middle of\nnowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --\nSam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now.\n\n                                                                        73.\n\n\n\n\n120   EXT.

Just\n      the endless and unrelenting MOON SILENCE.\n\n      Inside the Rover we are able to make out Sam 1, quivering\n      at the wheel as he sobs.\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n\n121   INT.

Now he is attempting\n      to fix some of the demolished pieces. At this moment he's\n      gluing the spire back on the church.\n\n      Sam 2 hears a sound from the corridor. Moments later Sam 1\n      appears in the doorway wearing the backpack.\n\n      Sam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL. His depleting\n      health has been evident throughout the film, but now it\n      seems to have jumped to a new level.\n\n      He watches Sam 2 for a little while.\n\n                           SAM 1\n                 Want me to help?\n\n      Sam 2 shifts over to give Sam 1 the adjacent chair. Sam 1\n      walks over, sits down. Together they work on gluing the\n      church back together.\n\n                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)\n                 Remember that crazy drunk guy who\n                 used to hang out by the church?\n\n                           SAM 2\n                 Barbara Streisand?\n\n                                                                  74.\n\n\n\n                     SAM 1\n               (with a smile)\n           He looked like Barbara Streisand.\n           We used to hide his Bible when he\n           passed out. Drove the guy nuts.\n\nSam 2 nods, remembering. A pause.\n\n                     SAM 2\n           How do you carve these things?\n\n                     SAM 1\n           Want me to show you?\n\nSam 2 nods. Sam 1 picks up a block of wood, grabs an exacto\nblade. Demonstrates.\n\n                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)\n           You need to hold the wood away\n           from you. Like this.\n\n                     SAM 2\n           You're shaking.\n\nSam 2 isn't kidding. Though he is carving the block of\nwood, Sam 1 can't keep it steady.\n\n                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n           Why are you shaking?\n\n                      SAM 1\n           Watch what I'm doing.\n               (then)\n           You watching?\n\n                     SAM 2\n           Yeah.\n\n                     SAM 1\n           Now you try.\n\nSam 1 hands the wood and exacto blade to Sam 2.\n\nSam 2 attempts to whittle. He smiles, a little embarrassed.\n\n                     SAM 2\n           I suck.\n\n                     SAM 1\n           You'll get the hang of it.\n               (a beat)\n           You see, that's a little better\n           already.\n\n                                                                  75.\n\n\n\nSuddenly Sam 1 turns around and has a vicious coughing fit.\nIt actually seems to propel Sam 1 out of his chair and up\nonto his feet.

Eventually the\ncoughing subsides.\n\n                     SAM 2\n           What's happening to you?\n\nSam 1 averts his gaze.\n\n                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n           Listen, I realize I've been less\n           than cooperative. But I want to\n           change that. You and me, we need\n           to work together. And that starts\n           with not keeping secrets from\n           each other.\n               (a beat)\n           Now what's going on?\n\nSam 1 tells the truth.\n\n                     SAM 1\n           I think I'm dying.\n\nSam 2 stares back at him.\n\n                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)\n           There's blood in everything.

I saw it when I\n           hacked into the Old Man. After\n           three years they all started to\n           get sick. Now it's happening to\n           me.

Sam 1 is instantly\n      asleep. Sam 2 pulls the comforter over him.\n\n      Sam 2 begins to leave the room, sees Sam 1's backpack on\n      the floor, the VP sticking out of it. Curious, Sam 2 grabs\n      the VP.\n\n      FLASHING on the VP's SCREEN: \"Last Transmission: 15:14pm.\"\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n\n124   INT.

I never\n                 thought I'd say this, but I want\n                 to get out there, I want to work.\n                 I feel like a kid who's been\n                 grounded. Looking forward to\n                 Eliza straightening everything\n                 out and things getting back to\n                 normal around here. Well...that's\n                 it. I'll let you know how it\n                 goes. Over and out, gentlemen.\n\n      Sam 2 sends the message, his SMILE instantly COLLAPSING.

Although Sam 2\nshould in some ways be relieved by Sam 1's decision, he\nlooks closer to distraught.\n\n                     SAM 2\n           This is wrong. What are we\n           supposed to do? Sit around here\n           and wait to die?

I'll go! ...And I'm\n           going to find this asshole, Sam\n           Bell, and ask him why the hell he\n           put us through this shit!\n\nSam 1 looks concerned.   Sam 2 reads his mind.\n\n                     SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n           I'll be careful. I'll keep Eve\n           out of it. She wont even know I\n           exist.\n\nSam 1 smiles wearily, watching his old self.\n\n                     SAM 1\n           You're a good guy, Sam.\n\n                      SAM 2\n           I might stop shaving; It suits\n           us.\n               (beat)\n           If all our memories are implants,\n           no disrespect, but I think its\n           about time I got some of my own,\n           as well.\n\n                                                                         87.\n\n\n\n                           SAM 1\n                 Yeah.

Both men staring ahead in silence.\n\n\n      MATTHEW\n\n      Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled\n      Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it.\n      The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater\n      shipwreck.\n\n      The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it\n      approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a\n      standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester.\n\n\n144   I/E.

The two Sams sitting side by\n      side, staring across the bleak landscape. Neither of them\n      wants to say good-bye particularly.\n\n                           SAM 1\n                 Tess came in for the interview,\n                 remember?\n\n      Sam 2 is nodding away. Of course he remembers.\n\n                           SAM 1 (CONT'D)\n                 She was so beautiful. Even   if she\n                 wasn't the best candidate,   I just\n                 knew I had to give her the   job. I\n                 thought she was so sweet.\n                     (a beat)\n                 And then it was the end of   the\n                 summer.\n\n                            SAM 2\n                 She was going back to San\n                 Francisco.\n                            (MORE)\n\n                                                                        88.\n\n                            SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n                 You knew you had to take a\n                 chance. So you called her.\n                 You were terrified and wrote that\n                 whole speech for her answer\n                 machine --\n                     (a beat)\n                 But I didn't need it because Tess\n                 answered the phone. And I could\n                 tell in her voice as we talked,\n                 she was thinking...\n                 \"Why has Sam called me?\"\n                 \"The internship's over, why's he\n                 called me at home?\"\n                 And then I asked her if she was\n                 going to Adrian Fiddle's barbecue\n                 and...\n\n      Sam 1 has dropped off to sleep. The back and forth exchange\n      is now essentially Sam 2's monologue.\n\n                           SAM 2 (CONT'D)\n                 That's when I knew she liked me.\n                 Because she didn't want to talk\n                 to anyone else! She'd get up, get\n                 some potato salad, go to the\n                 bathroom, but she'd always come\n                 back. And then we kissed. On the\n                 steps in front of her apartment\n                 building.\n\n      Sam 2 finally turns and looks at Sam 1. Sam 1's head cocked\n      to one side, eyes closed.\n\n      Sam 2 lifts the helmet off Sam 1's lap -- carefully lowers\n      the helmet onto Sam 1's head.\n\n\n145   I/E.

He places Sam 1 on the ground and PRIZES\n      open the rover door -- he slowly slides Sam 1 inside.\n\n      Inside the Rover Sam 1 lies with his head jammed awkwardly\n      against the passenger side door. At once he looks peaceful\n      and wretchedly uncomfortable.\n\n      Sam 2 can barely bring himself to look at Sam 1. With both\n      hands he FORCES the door CLOSED, pivots around and slowly\n      BOBS back to his rover.\n\n\n146   I/E.
