MANHATTAN BRIDGE - PREDAWN - 1969\n\n            Darkness.  Headlights bounce off thick sheets of RAIN.  6,500\n            gallon Esso OIL TRUCK barrels over wet studded pavement,\n            heading towards Manhattan.  It's going fast.  Too fast.\n\n            Up ahead...at the BASE OF THE BRIDGE:\n\n            A large reflective sign - lit up by arc lights: MEN AT WORK.\n\n            There are TWO WORK CREWS, several hundred feet apart.\n\n            THE FIRST CREW is CON ED.  A corrugated vacuum tube feeds\n            into an open MANHOLE.  A WORKER drops into the hole.\n\n            THE SECOND CREW is CONSTRUCTION.  They're at the apron of the\n            bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed.\n\n            It's late and the men are tired.  A mistake is made.  A FORK\n            LIFT loaded with LUMBER fails to negotiate a turn...whacks\n            into an abutment... spilling its load onto the roadway.\n\n            Bad timing, because right now that Esso OIL TRUCK hits the\n            OFF RAMP.  Not a lot of time for the driver to react to a\n            roadway spewed with lumber.\n\n            He does his best.  Slams the brakes, spins the wheel, hits\n            the horn, but it doesn't matter: 18 wheels skid across the\n            blacktop - spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber, lifting off\n            the slick pavement...twisting...flipping...hemorrhaging oil\n            from its ruptured tanks...grinding its way towards...\n\n            MEN AT WORK.  Seconds to react as an 80,000 pound juggernaut\n            of death plows through parked cars like paper...crushing the\n            Con Ed equipment...lurching to a halt on top of the MANHOLE.\n\n            EXT.

But it's too late.  Frank is\n            gone...slogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the\n            tanker.  He kneels over the three-quarters covered manhole,\n            using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below.

A hairy beat, then...\n\n            Frank jackknifes out of the water, ramming the halaghan into\n            the ceiling.  It worked.  The teeth on the \"claw-end\" and the\n            spike on the \"adz-end\" are embedded into the concrete --\n            STAPLING THE CABLES TO THE CEILING.

And then they all tear away from the\n            manhole...around a corner... collapsing on the pavement\n            against a building.\n\n            K-A-B-O-O-M -- A MUFFLED EXPLOSION\n\n            The vault ignites, the tunnel \"FLASHBACKS\" -- a towering\n            geyser of FLAMES AND DIRT ERUPTING out of the manhole from\n            which Frank has just escaped.\n\n            In the distance, FLAMES erupt out of the other\n            manhole...engulfing the OIL TRUCK...blowing it into a million\n            pieces.\n\n            Through the INFERNO at the base of the Manhattan Bridge,\n            Frank can see that no one is hurt.  His eyes glistening with\n            adrenaline and relief, he sits back against the building and\n            throws an arm around Gibson.\n\n                                FRANK\n                      You did good, Gib.

Hey, Bud.  I'm off\n            to work. Johnny's at school.  Elvis is fed.  I luvs you.\n\n            Setting a grapefruit and a slice of toast on the table, Frank\n            glances at the Daily News.

Two\n            others, JOHNNY SULLIVAN and GORDO HERSCH, both 6, stand\n            frozen in place.  Elvis tears in circles around them.  All is\n            very quiet.

SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1969\n\n            ANOTHER FINGER PRESSING DOWN ON THE RED SQUAWK BAR... FRANK\n            SULLIVAN.  Seated at the polished wooden desk.\n\n                                FRANK\n                      Hello, Queens.  You there?\n\n            Silence.  The signal is gone.  Frank leans forward, jiggles\n            the frequency dial, trying to regain the signal.  No luck.\n\n            Slightly frustrated, he stands and opens the glass doors to\n            the family room where Julia is watching TV - a very young\n            STEPHEN HAWKING is being interviewed by WALTER CRONKITE, 52.\n\n                                JULIA\n                      Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.\n\n                                FRANK\n                          (a little distracted)\n                      Sure.\n\n            He starts to take a step into the room, and stumbles over\n            Elvis, sleeping by the door...KNOCKING INTO and CRACKING a\n            GLASS PANE in one door.\n\n            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - 1998\n\n            John, dog tired and more than a little wasted, gets up from\n            the desk, inadvertently leaving the Ham Radio ON, and\n            shuffles for the family room through the glass doors.\n\n            CAMERA HOLDS, CLOSE on the GLASS PANE...CRACKED in the exact\n            same spot where Frank knocked into it 29-YEARS AGO.\n\n            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1969\n\n            Frank unpins the police badge from Johnny's shirt, takes the\n            whistle from around his neck.  He pulls up the covers and\n            softly kisses Johnny's forehead.  You can tell he loves this\n            kid more than anything in the world.\n\n                                FRANK\n                          (lullaby-like)\n                      Take me out to the ballgame, take me out\n                      with the crowd.

A SOFTBALL soars into view.  It drops down and\n            into a WILLIE MAYS' style basket catch by Frank Sullivan.\n\n            EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - DAY - 1969\n\n            The same Little League field that Frank circled on his Harley\n            yesterday, October 10, 1969.  And the same field at which\n            John sat in the stands drinking last night, October 10, 1998.\n\n            We are in the 9th inning of a friendly SOFTBALL GAME between\n            the local COPS and FIREMEN.  A lot of NYPD and FDNY T-shirts,\n            sweats and caps.  Plenty of Mets stuff, too.\n\n            Having made the catch, Frank coolly pulls the ball from his\n            mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond.\n            Tagging up at 3rd, sorely tempted to try for home is SATCH\n            DELEON, 30, NYPD Detective.  Satch feints for the plate,\n            Frank feints the throw.  For a maddening, gleeful moment,\n            Frank has Satch caught between 3rd and home.\n\n            In the STANDS, Johnny Sullivan, Marge Hersch and the FAMILIES\n            of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win\n            this game of chicken.\n\n            On the SIDELINES, Johnny, Gordo and the other KIDS serving as\n            BATBOYS and WATERBOYS, jump around in anticipation.\n\n            At HOME, Butch Foster stations himself to take the throw.\n\n            Suddenly, Satch fakes to 3rd, then bolts for home.  Frank\n            pegs it to Butch, who tags the sliding Satch.  Game over.\n\n                                SATCH\n                      Lucky throw, fire boy.\n\n                                FRANK\n                          (jogging in)\n                      Luck, my ass.\n\n            They square off.  Pretending to fight.  Julia steps between\n            them.  And they all descend into laughter.\n\n            Frank and Satch each wrap an arm around Julia and start off.\n            Within a step, Johnny slips in under Frank's other arm.\n\n                                FRANK (CONT'D)\n                          (to Johnny)\n                      See that, kid.

BUTCH'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER\n\n            Close on a TV: PRESIDENT NIXON tosses the first ball to open\n            the 1969 WORLD SERIES.\n\n            REVERSE to see many of the PLAYERS and FAMILIES from teh\n            softball game are parked around a couple of TVs watching the\n            game.  BEER flows from a keg.  SOFT DRINKS are passed around.\n            HAMBURGERS and HOT DOGS are cooking on the BBQ.\n\n            Satch sits with Johnny and Gordo and some other kids.\n\n            Frank and Julia tend the BBQ.  Butch brings out some beers.\n            A fun day.\n\n            EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - 1998\n\n            A DETECTIVE'S CAR pulls up next to a couple of BLUE & WHITES\n            at West 155th St.  The Northern tip of Manhattan Island.\n\n            Across construction barricades is a half-torn down GREEK\n            RESTAURANT.  Several UNIFORMS can be seen beyond it, looking\n            at something on the ground.\n\n            As John exits the car, the passenger door swings open and we\n            MEET a guy we haven't seen in 29 YEARS - SATCHEL DELEON, 59.\n            Shaved head, square jaw.  A ram-rod straight, craggy warrior.\n            Thirty-plus years on the force now endow him with a rare\n            combination of smarts, guts and sense of humor.\n\n                                SATCH\n                          (as they walk)\n                      Don't choke on your pride, Sull.

They\n            keep on walking.\n\n                                JOHN\n                      What's the story?\n\n                                UNIFORM\n                      Survey crew found a body.  Actually a\n                      skeleton.  Over here.\n\n            The uniform leads John and Satch around some overgrown weeds\n            to SEE a patch of freshly unearthed dirt...out of which\n            sticks a HUMAN SKULL and COLLAR BONE.\n\n            In the B.G., a CRIME SCENE unit can be seen arriving by van.\n\n                                SATCH\n                      Be real careful when pulling it out.  And\n                      get the dirt around it.\n\n            As Satch turns to talk to a second UNIFORM and a couple of\n            SURVEYORS, John notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far\n            away.  As he starts to him, to Satch:\n\n                                JOHN\n                      I think I'll visit the neighbor.\n\n            INT.

Satch\n            oversees the operation.\n\n            MRS.

Next to it a faded black and white picture of\n            Mrs. Shepard, 35.  A few pictures of the Shepards and their\n            YOUNG SON.  And at the end, a color photograph of the same\n            son, about 20, in DRESS BLUES, graduating from the Police\n            Academy - CLASS OF '64.\n\n                                JOHN\n                      Your son on the job?\n\n                                MR.

A couple\n            of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones.\n\n            John stands looking down at the skeleton.  A long beat.  And\n            then he turns to Satch and they start for the car.  Behind\n            them, the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground.\n            WE SEE its wrists are BOUND with GLASS TAPE.\n\n            INT.

Johnny, sleepy faced, wrapped in his blankie,\n            stands just outside the room - he looks a little scared.\n\n                                FRANK\n                      It's okay, Chief.\n                          (beat)\n                      C'mere.\n\n            Johnny shuffles over, Frank lifts him up on his knee -\n            brushes the hair out of his face...and gets an idea.\n\n            EXT.

SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998\n\n            John walks in the front door, takes off his coat...\n\n            The house looks different.  Cleaner, furnishings less ragged.\n            John moves through his home, taking in the subtle changes.\n            He reaches the study.  And there, beside the desk, is\n            something that makes him stop:\n\n            A PHOTOGRAPH on the wall beside the desk -- FRANK, JULIA &\n            FOURTEEN YEAR-OLD JOHNNY SULLIVAN.\n\n                                JOHN\n                      Oh my God...\n\n            The picture changed.  John aged from 6 to 14.  Julia's\n            hairstyle and clothes changed from 60's to 70's.  Frank's\n            hair receded and grayed.  Jon is staring at evidence of a\n            history that didn't exist before.\n\n            John grabs the old family scrapbook he found in Frank's\n            trunk.  Opens it, unfolds \"FIREMAN KILLED\" CLIPPING.\n\n            The main headline still reads: \"OCTOBER 13, 1969.  AMAZIN'S\n            TAKE GAME 2.  2-1 LEAD.

He starts to\n            sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front\n            edge of it.  WORDS CARVED INTO THE WOOD, 29 YEARS AGO by fire\n            fighter Frank Sullivan.  The day John saved his father's\n            life: I'M STILL HERE CHIEF\n\n            The last letter is missing.  But then a patch of wood starts\n            to morph - as if it were being carved by an invisible knife.\n\n            A BURST OF STATIC.

Reaches out for the phone.\n\n            CLOSE ON PHONE'S THREE SPEED DIAL BUTTONS.\n\n            John HITS #3.\n\n                                JULIA'S VOICE\n                          (through answering machine)\n                      Hi, this is Julia.

Gazing at his\n            wife.\n\n            Julia holds on him for a split second, concern and surprise\n            etching across her face.  She turns back to her work, then\n            says something to another ER nurse, who nods okay.

John\n            looks different too: like a guy on the tail end of a lifetime\n            bender.  He cracks open a Bushmills.  Pours a couple of shots\n            into his instant coffee.  Several sips to settle his nerves.\n            He reaches for the cordless phone and HITS SPEED DIAL #3.\n\n                                CASHIER (V.O.)\n                      Noah's Deli.

It opens to reveal a Jamaican woman\n            clutching a crying infant, a toddler hanging off her leg.\n            Behind them we half recognize Julia's apartment.  We know\n            it's her apartment because of the BAY WINDOW and the view of\n            THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.  But everything else is\n            different.  Different furniture.  Different pain job.\n\n            John stands speechless.

Liquor on his breath, fear in his eyes, he is a\n            scary sight.  Jamaican woman does the smart thing - she slams\n            the door.\n\n            INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DETECTIVE SQUAD - COFFEE ROOM - LATER\n\n            ON SATCH, scavenging the fridge while absorbed in some\n            papers.\n\n            Through the open door he SPOTS JOHN across the squad room.\n            Even at that distance, Satch can see John's unsteady walk and\n            fucked up demeanor.

He barely reacts to the SOUND of the door.  He does\n            react to the silence that follows.  Satch stands in the\n            doorway...looking him over.\n\n                                JOHN\n                      What?\n\n            A long silence.\n\n                                SATCH\n                      Another rough night, huh?

Startled, John freezes.\n\n                                SATCH\n                      Do not disrespect me.  Disrespect\n                      yourself all you want.  But not me.

Satch slides\n            an 8X10 PHOTO off the top of an OLD YELLOWED POLICE FILE and\n            hands it to John.  It is a picture of the skeleton discovered\n            behind the Greek Diner.  But what catches John's attention,\n            what picks at his subconscious, is the decaying GLASS TAPE\n            binding the wrists.\n\n                                SATCH\n                      Bad memories...\n                          (re: photo)\n                      You imagine the odds...us diggin' up a\n                      Nightingale Murder?\n\n            John looks from the photo to the file on Satch's desk.  It\n            reads: NIGHTINGALE MURDERS.

It's\n            filled with police and forensics reports.  And PHOTOS.  Crime\n            scene shots of 9 DEAD WOMEN.  Linked by TWO gruesome details -\n            they were all GARROTED, wrists bound with GLASS TAPE.\n\n            John turns over the last PHOTO and his heart stops...his\n            universe crashing down on him.\n\n            CLOSE ON THAT PHOTOGRAPH: A MURDER VICTIM.

But mostly, it's like there's this\n                      logic problem.

Just a\n                      glimmer.  But somewhere they know.

Embarrassed, Frank looks\n            away as he rights himself.\n\n            Frank edges out of the grocery store as Karen steps into the\n            street and dodges traffic towards a corner BAR/RESTAURANT at\n            the end of the block, past a heavily overgrown VACANT LOT.\n\n            Frank follows Karen across the street and finds himself, just\n            as Karen enters the bar, at a point near the murder site\n            described by John.  He pauses to stare at it.\n\n            INT. COZY'S BAR & RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER\n\n            Frank enters the place.  Sort of a singles atmosphere, but a\n            comfortable one.  It's HAPPY HOUR.  On the TV, the Mets' Gil\n            Hodges offers his analysis of Game 3.\n\n            Frank looks about, down the bar and into an area with booths\n            and tables.  A few folks at the bar.  A group of YOUNG WOMEN\n            laughing in a booth.  But NO KAREN REYNOLDS.  Frank's blood\n            runs cold in a spasm of panic when...\n\n                                WOMAN'S VOICE\n                      Hey, Chuck.\n\n                                BARTENDER\n                      Hey, Karen.\n\n            Frank wheels around just as Karen passes him from teh LADIES\n            ROOM.  There is the trace of a bump, enough for Karen to take\n            note of Frank.  Ad lib EXCUSE ME.  She then starts moving\n            down teh bar towards the booth of young women.\n\n            Frank checks out everyone in the bar, not knowing quite what\n            he's looking for.\n\n            Karen slips into the booth with her friends.  Ad lib HELLOS.\n\n            Frank orders a beer, but his eyes are fixed on the booth.\n            Karen and a friend take note of Frank staring at them.\n            Embarrassed, he turns away, checking his watch: 6:40PM.  And\n            at just that moment a SCRAGGLY MAN passes by, taking a seat\n            at the end of the bar.  We have seen this man before.\n\n            INT. 23RD PRECINCT - DET.

A mother knows\n                      what's in her son's heart.\n\n            Little Gordo reaches for the microphone.\n\n                                JULIA (CONT'D)\n                      I better go.

A\n            thousand childhood memories playing in his head.  And then he\n            lights up...realizing the opportunity.\n\n                                JOHN\n                      Hey, Gordo.

Frank nods, smiling.\n\n                                GORDO\n                      I better give you my address then.\n\n                                JOHN\n                      Oh don't worry kid, I know where you\n                      live.

I mean Santa.\n\n            The sound of Julia's voice calling Gordo to bed.  Gordo\n            scampers out.  Static filters through both radios, then...\n\n                                FRANK\n                      John, you still there?\n\n                                JOHN\n                      I'm right here, Dad.\n\n                                FRANK\n                      You all right?\n\n                                JOHN\n                      Yeah, I think so...\n\n                                FRANK\n                      Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let\n                      anything happen to her...no matter what.\n\n            BZZZZ-SHHH.  A burst of loud static.  The band goes dead.\n\n            John takes a beat to come down.  He gets up, making his way\n            into the KITCHEN.  There's a half-full bottle of BUSHMILLS on\n            the counter.  John reaches out to grab but the bottle.  But\n            then he stops.  It is time to stop.  John turns on the faucet\n            and dumps the booze down the drain.\n\n            The LEGEND reads:\n\n            OCTOBER 15th - FOURTH GAME OF THE WORLD SERIES\n\n            INT.

Visible among them is a \"Candy Striper\"\n            uniform... a perfect match with the patch John holds.\n\n                                FINELLI\n                      Mary volunteered over at St. Vincents'\n                      after school.

He looks around the room at\n            Mary's possessions.  Faded pictures.  Mary and her family.\n            Mary and her friends.\n\n                                FINELLI (CONT'D)\n                      Her room...I just couldn't...it should\n                      only be her room...you know?\n\n            John does know.\n\n                                FINELLI (CONT'D)\n                      I'm happy you found her, Detective.

Bends over to wash his hands, and suddenly.\n\n            His face is smashed on the edge of the sink.  He twists to\n            the floor, fighting to maintain consciousness.\n\n            A black Frye boot explodes into Frank's gut.  He rolls over,\n            looks up at the LONG HAIRED GUY from the bar.  Frank seems to\n            recognize him.  We know him too - SCRAGGLY MAN.  But we don't\n            know his name yet.

Killer goes down like a stone, but Frank is\n            too battered to take advantage.\n\n            He collapses on top of Killer, who pushes him off, scrambles\n            up, and delivers a massive kick to his head.  Frank is out\n            cold.\n\n            Quickly, Killer rolls Frank over and rifles his pockets\n            finding his WALLET.  He grabs something from it, then tosses\n            it aside.  He then takes something out of his pocket, a thin\n            leather garrote.  He coils it around his hands and snaps it\n            taut.  He bends down to start the job when suddenly, the\n            bathroom door opens and...\n\n            TWO very stoned MEN stumble in.\n\n                                STONED MAN #1\n                      Whoa, dude.

He closes the door, quickly leaving.\n\n            In the stall, Frank spills onto the floor, his legs sticking\n            out into the bathroom.  His face flush to the tile, his eyes\n            trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall...\n\n            His WALLET.\n\n            EXT. 23RD PRECINCT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - 1998\n\n            John gets in his car.

His look shifts back to the photo of\n            Carl Shepard.\n\n            Mr. Shepard reaches to open an album.  There are several\n            photographs of the young Mrs. Shepard.  A couple where she is\n            dressed in a NURSE'S UNIFORM.\n\n            John is stunned.

It is a\n            crime scene photo of Shepard's murdered mother.  He reels\n            back, totally losing his veil of composure.  He is freaked.\n\n                                SHEPARD\n                      Who are you?\n\n                                JOHN\n                      I'm the train wreck you didn't see\n                      coming.

All his senses go on alert.  And\n            instinct kicks...he hits the squawk bar.\n\n                                FRANK (CONT'D)\n                      Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is\n                      here John.

In the kitchen, we can see Julia moving\n            around putting away the groceries.\n\n                                JOHN (O.S.)\n                          (over the HAM)\n                      Dad, what the hell is going on?\n\n                                FRANK\n                          (into mic)\n                      Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go\n                      away.\n\n            Julia now becomes aware of the tension in the voices in the\n            other room.  She looks outside and sees Phil and the\n            uniforms.  She looks at Frank and Satch with confusion.\n\n            Frank hits the squawk bar again.  He wants John to hear this.\n\n                                FRANK (CONT'D)\n                      What is going on here, Satch?

Do us both a favor.\n\n            A long beat.  Frank sees Julia staring at them.  She is now a\n            bundle of growing anxiety.  Frank stands up.\n\n                                FRANK\n                      Okay.\n                          (to Julia)\n                      It's okay, Bud.

Forget the radio.\n\n            Frank nods.  Takes stock of the cops by the cars and heads\n            back into the house.\n\n            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Julia, who has been watching through a front room window with\n            Johnny, moves to meet Frank.

He slips through\n            the madness, heading down the hall and towards the stairs.\n\n            EXT. 17TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Satch races down the crowded block...dodging celebrating\n            Mets' fans...bolting up the precinct steps into the house.\n\n            INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Phil runs in.

APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY - 1998\n\n            John stalks down an apartment building hallway, gun drawn. He\n            reaches a door.  Two locks and a bell.  Fuck 'em.  John\n            smashes his bulk into the door...one...two...three times.  It\n            bursts off its hinges.  John charges in.\n\n            Place is empty.  Like somebody got the hell out in a hurry.\n            A few odds and ends left behind in the haste...including a\n            pile of unpaid bills.  CARL SHEPARD.\n\n            John's eyes glaze over in rage and fury.  But then he sees\n            something that makes him stop and think.  There is a\n            telephone on the floor, in a corner.  John stares at the\n            phone, wheels spinning.  He reaches in his coat and takes out\n            his notebook.  Flipping through pages.  Notes on Shepard:\n            social security, address, DMV registration, and a series of\n            phone numbers...home, office, cellular.\n\n            John runs to the phone.

His '69 apartment is\n            far nicer than the place we just left John in '98.\n\n            Shepard runs to the bathroom.  Rips off the toilet's tank\n            lid, reaches down and pulls out a .357 Magnum Colt Python,\n            wrapped in clear plastic.\n\n            He rips off the plastic, shoves the pistol in his waistband,\n            heads into the kitchen.\n\n            He gropes behind the refrigerator, close on an envelope glass\n            taped to back of the fridge.  Shepard's hand finds the\n            envelope...he rips it loose.  And then he opens it -\n            revealing its contents, souvenirs, POLAROID PHOTOS OF THE\n            NIGHTINGALE MURDERS, WOMEN'S JEWELRY, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS...\n\n            Shepard takes out a match to burn the photos.  But then...\n\n            The broom closet door bursts off its hinges.  Frank instantly\n            on top of Shepard.  The souvenirs go flying in the air.\n            Frank pummels Shepard's head and back. But Shepard smashes\n            his elbow in Frank's Adam's apple, lands a solid uppercut\n            square on Frank's nose.  Frank's eyes watering up, VISION\n            BLURRING.\n\n            CLOSE ON\n\n            Frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop\n            the kitchen counter.\n\n            Shepard reaches for his gun, points the .357 at Frank's head.\n            Shepard's finger squeezing the trigger. It's over.  But...\n\n            FRANK SMASHES THE GLASS PITCHER down on Shepard's skull.\n            Shepard drops.  CRACK, the gun fires, BLASTING AIR.\n\n            FRANK scrambles for the window.  He's outta there, expertly\n            thundering down fire escape.\n\n            EXT. ALLEY BEHIND SHEPARD'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Frank hits the pavement, twisting his ankle.  Hears metal\n            rattling, looks up.  Shepard's clattering down after him.\n\n            Shepard tries to get off a shot through the fire escape grid.\n            BANG!  The shot ricochets wildly.  Frank takes off, limping\n            and staying close to the building out of the line of fire.\n\n            The streets are still empty, the city glued to their TV's.\n            Frank hits CPW.  He glances left, right, straight ahead.\n            Central Park.\n\n            Frank runs into the park.\n\n            INT. SHEPARD'S APARTMENT - W. 74TH ST. - DUSK\n\n            The door is kicked open.  Satch and Phil enter, guns drawn.\n            They take in the damage from the fight.  Following the trail\n            of blood back to the kitchen. And there, strewn across the\n            floor are Shepard's photos of his victims, the newspaper\n            clippings, the jewelry, and the envelope with the glass tape\n            still on it.\n\n            Satch knows.\n\n            EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Frank hears pounding footsteps - Shepard is catching up.\n\n            Frank's adrenaline kicking in, sprints around a bend in the\n            path, reaches long wooden bridge spanning Central Park Lake.\n\n            The bridge is being restored.  Barricades across the\n            entrance.\n\n            Frank hurdles over the barricades, runs onto the bridge.\n\n            Shepard trips in the dirt.  Gets back up, reaches the bridge,\n            knocks over a barricade, runs to the middle of the bridge.\n\n            FRANK'S DISAPPEARED.  Shepard stops, listens - nothing.\n\n            EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDERNEATH - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Frank dangles below the bridge, holding onto the steel girder\n            of substructure - 8 ft. above water.  Not moving a muscle,\n            not making a sound, barely even breathing.\n\n            CLOSE ON SEWER RAT\n\n            Crawling on Frank's arm.  Caught off guard, Frank flinches,\n            sending the rat tumbling.\n\n            EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - TOP OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Bridge side railings have been removed for construction.\n\n            Shepard hears something hit the water.  Rushes to the side of\n            the bridge, points his gun at the water.  BANG!\n\n            Shepard leans out further aiming the gun at the water.\n            Shepard's outstretched arm only a few feet from Frank's head.\n            Frank silently swings his body forward reaching out...\n\n            Snags Shepard's arm, pulling him hard, over the side.\n\n            SHEPARD FALLS, grabs for something, anything.  Wraps his arms\n            around Frank's leg, hangs on tight.\n\n            Frank struggles, kicks wildly, trying to shake Shepard off.\n            Shepard hangs on with his left arm.  Pulls out the gun with\n            his right.  He aims it at Frank's head.  Cocks back the\n            hammer.\n\n            FRANK LETS GO.  KERPLUNK.  They plunge into:\n\n            EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Murky water, thick with dirt and slime, 5' deep.\n\n            Frank's hanging on to Shepard's arm, trying to wrestle the\n            gun free.  But Shepard's using his free hand to gouge Frank's\n            eyes.  Frank bites down hard on Shepard's wrist.\n\n            The gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom.\n\n            But Shepard gets both hands on Frank's throat.  Shoving his\n            head into the shallow water.  Shepard's grip is like a vise,\n            Frank futilely tries to pry Shepard's fingers open.\n\n            Frank is blinded by polluted water.  Starting to lose\n            consciousness.  Desperately, he searches the muddy lake\n            bottom for the gun.  But he's getting weaker, fading out...\n\n            Then he feels something.  A BRICK, fallen off the bridge,\n            half buried in the mud.  Frank struggles to dig it up.\n            Summons his last ounces of strength, yanking it back and\n            forth, it's getting loose.\n\n            But Shepard's hands are squeezing tighter.  Frank finally\n            goes limp.  A few last bubbles float to the surface.  Shepard\n            smiles.  Catching his breath, slightly loosens grip on\n            Frank's lifeless neck.\n\n            Frank springs off the lake bottom, rises out of the water\n            like a jack-in-the-box.  Holding the brick with both hands,\n            he swings.  CONTACT.\n\n            The brick smashes against Shepard's head.  Knocking him to\n            yesterday.  He drops like a rock.\n\n            Frank waits for Shepard to come up for air.  Nothing.\n\n            Frank crawls out of the water, collapsing onto the\n            embankment.  He just lies there, heart pounding, chest\n            heaving.\n\n            And suddenly, Frank is startled by a MASSIVE ROAR - the sound\n            of eight million New Yorkers screaming in unison.  The Mets\n            have just won the World Series.\n\n            Frank laughs, slowly getting to his feet.\n\n            EXT.

CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - NIGHT\n\n            The area cordoned off.  Detectives and uniforms.  EMS wagon.\n            An inflatable boat is being placed in the lake.  Two police\n            frog men are climbing into their gear.\n\n            Pan over the scene to find Frank and Satch.  Frank's got a\n            blanket wrapped around him.

They hold each\n            other's grip for some moments.  Frank starts to say \"thank\n            you\", but Satch silently cuts him off.\n\n            Frank climbs in the car.  Satch closes the door, taps on the\n            roof, Frank is on his way home.\n\n            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - JOHNNY'S ROOM - LATER\n\n            JOHNNY is asleep in bed.  Elvis sleeps at the foot of it.  In\n            the shadows next to them, Julia sits very still in a rocking\n            chair, half-asleep, half-awake.  Staring out the window.  Her\n            eyes are bloodshot.  She has been through hell.\n\n            A faint STAIRWAY CREAK.  Elvis stirs.  He looks up to SEE:\n\n            FRANK standing in the doorway.

Julia comes in\n            and sets down a cup of coffee.  She kisses him on the top of\n            his head, casts a wondering eye on the radio, and leaves.\n\n            EXT.

And then something catches his attention.\n            A SOUND.  Coming from inside the house.  The HAM RADIO?\n\n            He bolts from the car, runs to the door, scrambles to get the\n            backdoor key into the lock, as --\n\n                                FRANK (O.S.)\n                          (over the HAM)\n                      John, John?

Holding the .45\n            to John's head, Shepard pops the clip out of the 9mm and\n            tosses it aside.

He uncoils the\n            garrote, snaps it taut, and starts around her neck.\n\n            And then a SOUND.  Instantly recognizable.  Beyond adequate\n            description.  But once you've heard it, you don't forget\n            it...\n\n            CHUUT, CHUUT, CHUUT: THE SOUND OF A 12-GUAGE PUMP-ACTION\n            SHOTGUN RATCHETING AROUND THE CORNER.\n\n            Shepard's head spins about.\n\n            FRANK STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, SHOTGUN AIMED AT SHEPARD'S FACE.\n\n                                FRANK\n                      Get your fucking hands off my wife.\n\n                                SHEPARD\n                      Don't.

BUCKSHOT RIPS THROUGH THE AIR.\n            SHEPARD'S RIGHT HAND EXPLODES...blood spattering everywhere.\n\n            Like a wounded animal, Shepard bolts, blowing past Frank.\n\n            Frank gently wraps Julia in a towel.  The fading sound of\n            Shepard thundering down the stairs.  Out the door.\n\n            And then softer footsteps.  Coming closer.  Johnny appears in\n            the doorway.  Safe and sound.\n\n            INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1998\n\n            SHEPARD RIGHT HAND GOES LIMP AROUND JOHN'S NECK.

Pounding blows to Shepard's head.\n\n            John is on top of Shepard, hands on his neck.

Float down to the field...\n\n            The first taste of Spring and Softball.  Picnic baskets.\n            Flowers.  Kites flying.  Children running.\n\n            The bleachers filled with families and loved ones.\n\n            Among them sits SAMANTHA.  She's smiling, she's\n            glowing...she's pregnant.  PULL BACK to reveal SATCH, GORDO,\n            ELLEN & GORDY JR.

Frank's foul ball comes down hard.  As the Mercedes'\n            windshield spiderwebs we hear an off-camera scream...\n\n            It is Gordo, jumping up, running across the field.  From the\n            parking lot his eyes meet Frank's.

Frank jogs to first.  An easy single.\n\n            From first, Frank glances over at the third base coach:\n            JULIA.  Her hair pinned up under a Mets cap, Julia puts two\n            fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as...\n\n            The next batter steps out of the dugout.

A double high-five from\n            Julia and they jog home together.  The game is over.\n\n            Frank puts his arm around John.  Heading for the bleachers.\n\n            A little boy totters up to them.  Jumping into John's arms.\n            His name is Frank Jr.\n\n                                JOHN\n                      Hey there, Chief.\n\n            John gives his son a kiss, glances up at Samantha in the\n            bleachers.   They share a smile.
