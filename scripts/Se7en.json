COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY\n\n     The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.\n     The church bell rings, resonating.\n\n     Mass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt\n     road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on\n     foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story\n     house sits across the road.  Lone.\n\n     INT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than\n     bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty\n     second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn\n     wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.\n\n     Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled\n     away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger\n     across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper.\n     He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.\n\n     He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a\n     roughly squared section with the rose at its center.\n\n     He studies it in his hand.\n\n     EXT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY\n\n     Birds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.\n\n                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                   Is something wrong?\n\n     Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real\n     estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford\n     Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.\n\n                                 MAN (CONT)\n                   Is something the matter?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   No... no.  There's nothing wrong.\n\n     Somerset still seems distant.\n\n                                 MAN\n                           (writes receipt)\n                   Not that it's any of my business... but,\n                   are you figuring on moving out here\n                   eventually?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Soon.\n\n                                 MAN\n                   I just never seen a man mortgaging an\n                   empty house before.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Everything here still seems... seems so\n                   strange to me.  All this.\n\n                                 MAN\n                   I don't know.  I'd say this place is\n                   about as normal as places get.\n\n     The man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the\n     receipt, folds it.  Somerset smiles.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   That is exactly what I mean.  Strange.\n\n     Somerset looks back at the house.  The man does not understand.\n\n\n     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)\n\n     Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out\n     the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from\n     the few other passengers.\n\n     Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama\n     is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.\n\n     The light flickers across Somerset's placid face.\n\n     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY\n\n     The train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the\n     aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his\n     lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has\n     soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field.\n\n     A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little\n     further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their\n     coats matted with blood.\n\n     Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.\n\n     Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.\n\n     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING\n\n     Passing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People\n     stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps.\n\n     Somerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the\n     aisle seat, reading his book.\n\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)\n\n     Curtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will\n     be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's\n     life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a\n     closet and hundreds of books on shelves.\n\n     Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed.\n     He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical\n     metronome.\n\n     He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and\n     forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK.\n     Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.\n\n     Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's\n     ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's\n     face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.\n\n     His eyes close tighter.\n\n     Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's\n     breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER.\n\n     Tick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration.\n\n     The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes\n     slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick...\n\n\n     EXT.  CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT\n\n     DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is\n     a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always\n     smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated\n     storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway\n     tracks.  A train roars overhead.\n\n     Mills watches it as he walks on.\n\n     Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,\n     throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.\n\n     EXT.  URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT\n\n     This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat\n     skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and\n     pieces of junk in the gutter.\n\n     Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to\n     break into the trunk of a parked car.\n\n     Mills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will\n     be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Is that your car, man?\n\n                                 FIRST THUG\n                   What the fuck do you care?\n\n     Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Does that car belong to you?\n\n     The thugs look at each other, gauging.  They face Mills.\n\n                                 FIRST THUG\n                   Yeah, it's my car, alright?  Fuck off.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You're telling me that's your car?\n\n     The second thug starts the long way round the car.\n\n                                 SECOND THUG\n                   Well, for some strange reason, I don't\n                   believe you.\n\n     Mills gives a \"isn't that silly\" laugh, shifts his gaze --\n\n     Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.\n\n                                 FIRST THUG\n                           (steps forward)\n                   You can fucking suck my...\n\n     Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle\n     against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly.\n\n     The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.\n\n     Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the\n     second thug's face -- CRACK.  Broken nose.\n\n     The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose\n     squirting blood.\n\n     Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.\n\n     The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one\n     step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away.\n\n     Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when\n     the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.\n\n     Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold.\n     They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning.\n\n     Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one\n     knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.\n\n     Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair\n     and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills'\n     free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's\n     the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold.\n\n     Mills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at\n     the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure.\n\n     He takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the\n     car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to\n     collect the other thug off the street.\n\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING\n\n     Somerset picks items off a moving box:  keys, wallet, homicide\n     badge.  Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train.\n\n     From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose.\n\n\n     INT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n     A wall is stained by a starburst of blood.  Somerset stands,\n     melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a\n     sawed-off shotgun.  The apartment is gloomy.  DETECTIVE TAYLOR,\n     52, looks through a notepad.\n\n                                  TAYLOR\n                   Neighbors heard them screaming at each\n                   other.  It was nothing new or unusual.\n                   But, then they heard the gun go off.\n                   Boom, boom... both barrels.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   Did his wife confess?  Did she actually\n                   speak the words?\n\n                                  TAYLOR\n                   When the patrolman got here she was\n                   trying to put his head back together.\n                   She was crying too hard to say anything.\n                           (shuts notebook)\n                   Crime of passion.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered\n                   up on the wall here.\n\n     Taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed.\n\n                                  TAYLOR\n                   This is a done deal.  All but the\n                   paperwork.\n\n     Somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table.\n     There are crayons beside it.  Somerset picks the book up.\n\n     He flips through: crudely colored pictures.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   Did their son see it happen?\n\n                                  TAYLOR\n                   What kind of question is that?  Huh?\n                           (pointing)\n                   He's dead.  His wife killed him.  There\n                   it is.  That's all.  Anything else has\n                   nothing to do with nothing.\n\n     Somerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket.\n\n                                  TAYLOR (CONT)\n                   You and your fucking questions,\n                   Somerset.  I'm glad I'm getting rid of\n                   you today.  You know that, you fuck?\n\n     David Mills enters, dressed in a suit.  He looks a bit lost.\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   Uh... Lieutenant Somerset?\n\n     Somerset lights his cigarette, looks to Mills.\n\n                                  MILLS (CONT)\n                   I'm David Mills... your new partner.\n\n\n     EXT.  TENEMENT/CITY STREET -- DAY\n\n     A body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement\n     doors.  Somerset follows.  Mills follows Somerset.  They walk\n     towards the end of the filthy block.\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   I'm a little thrown.  I just finished\n                   orientation at central, and they dumped\n                   me off down here.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   I heard you brought in two small-timers\n                   last night.\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   Yeah.  Two real idiots.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   Since we are just starting out, I\n                   thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and\n                   talk for awhile.  That way we can...\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing\n                   for a case, if it's all the same to you.\n                   Seeing how we only have a week for this\n                   whole transition thing.\n                           (waits)\n                   I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,\n                   know what I mean?\n\n     Somerset walks, no reply.  Mills searches to get a read on him.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   I meant to ask you something... when we\n                   spoke on the phone.  I can't help\n                   wondering...\n                           (pause)\n                   Why are you here?\n\n                                  MILLS\n                           (wary)\n                   I... I don't follow.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   All this effort you've gone through, to\n                   be transferred from Philadelphia to\n                   here.  It's the first question that pops\n                   into my head.\n\n     Mills formulates his response.\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   I'm here for the same reasons as you, I\n                   guess.  Or... at least the same reasons\n                   you used to have for being here...\n                           (cutting)\n                   ...before you decided to give up.\n\n     Somerset stops and faces Mills.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   You think you know me?  You just met me\n                   two minutes ago.\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   Maybe I don't understand the question.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   It's very simple.  You've come from the\n                   \"City of Brotherly Love\" to the \"City of\n                   Brotherly Hate,\" detective.

Maybe I thought I could\n                   do more good here than there.\n                           (pause)\n                   You know, it'd be great by me if we\n                   didn't start right out kicking each\n                   other in the balls.  But, you're calling\n                   the shots, lieutenant, so however you\n                   want it to go.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   Let me tell you how I want this to go.\n                   I want you to look, and I want you to\n                   listen.\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   I wasn't standing around Philly guarding\n                   the fucking Liberty Bell.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   But, you've never worked homicide in\n                   this city.\n\n                                  MILLS\n                   I realize that.\n\n                                  SOMERSET\n                   Well, please do me the favor of\n                   remembering it.\n\n     Mills just stares back at Somerset.  Somerset walks.  Mills\n     rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, \"what'd I do to deserve\n     this?\"  He follows Somerset.\n\n\n     INSERT -- TITLE CARD\n\n     MONDAY\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING\n\n     Somerset lies asleep on the bed.  It is still dark outside.\n     Relatively quiet.  The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS\n     HARSHLY.  Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled.\n\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING\n\n     It is barely becoming light outside.  Mills can't sleep.\n\n     Alone in a double bed.  He sits up, frustrated.  Sits on the\n     edge of the bed and looks around.  The room is a shambles,\n     filled with moving boxes.\n\n     The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy\n     on one box.  Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen\n     motion at the trophy's pinnacle.\n\n     Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.\n     The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another\n     room.  Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING\n\n     Across a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful\n     woman, stands in her bathrobe.  She's upset about something,\n     takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter.\n\n     She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea\n     from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans\n     back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.\n\n     The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on\n     the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS.  Startled, she releases\n     the mug too close to the edge.  It falls --\n\n     Crashes to the floor, shatters.\n\n\n     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING\n\n     A dark hall.  Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a\n     beefy, uniformed cop.  Light from a camera's flash spills in\n     from the nearby kitchen.  Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   At what time did you confirm the death?\n\n                                 DAVIS\n                   Like I said, we didn't touch anything,\n                   but we were on scene at like o-five-\n                   hundred, so he's had his face in a plate\n                   of spaghetti for about half an hour.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him?\n                   You didn't check vital signs?\n\n                                 DAVIS\n                   Believe me, he's gone.  Unless he's\n                   breathing spaghetti sauce now.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   No.  The point is, when you're first man\n                   in, you check vital signs.\n\n                                 DAVIS\n                   This guy's sitting in a pile of his own\n                   shit and piss.  If he ain't dead he\n                   would have stood up by now.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (getting angry)\n                   Listen, Godzilla...\n\n     Somerset steps in, heads Mills off.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you\n                   again after we've had a look.\n\n                                 DAVIS\n                   Yes, sir.\n\n     Davis leaves, eyeing Mills.  Mills watches him.  Somerset hands\n     Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I wonder what exactly was the point of\n                   the conversation you were about to get\n                   into?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   And, I wonder how many times Officer\n                   Davis there has found a supposedly dead\n                   man who didn't really die until Davis\n                   was back in the patrol car calling the\n                   morgue and eating a powdered donut.\n\n     Somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Drop it.  We have more important\n                   concerns just now, don't we?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Fine... for now.\n\n     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     The POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and\n     equipment bag.  Somerset and Mills enter.  Mills puts on his own\n     pair of rubber gloves.  The grubby kitchen is small; barely room\n     for four people to move around in.  The photographer exits:\n\n                                 PHOTOGRAPHER\n                   Bon appetit.\n\n     The only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling.\n\n     The light bathes an OBESE MAN who is slumped forward in a\n     kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti.\n\n     The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with\n     soiled paper plates.  The plates hold bits of half-eaten\n     sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants.\n\n     Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights.  Mills points his\n     at the green bulb above.  Aluminum foil has been wrapped around\n     the bulb to focus the light on the corpse.\n\n     Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight.  He goes to the\n     body and kneels beside it.  There's a rope tied around the\n     man's wide gut.  Mills comes to stand beside Somerset.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I guess that makes it homicide.\n\n     Somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead\n     man's pants cuffs.  Rope is tied around the purplish ankle.\n\n     Mills examines the knots behind the chair's back.  Shines his\n     flashlight on the man's belly.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Still, he could have tied himself in.\n                   To make it look like murder.\n\n     Somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse.  He studies the\n     man's head and neck without touching.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   I don't see any blood or bruises yet.\n                   No wounds.  You see anything?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (irritated)\n                   Not yet.\n\n     Somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff\n     hands are clutching utensils.  A knife in the left hand, a fork\n     sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging\n     skewered.  Cockroaches swarm.\n\n     Mills turns to the sink and stove.  Each burner of the stove has\n     a used pot or pan on it.  There's food slopped everywhere.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I saw a guy once... committed suicide,\n                   but he wanted to make sure his family\n                   could collect insurance money, right?\n\n     Somerset walks to the room's only window.  The window has been\n     painted over with black paint.  he touches the window with his\n     pinkie finger.  The paint is still wet.\n\n     Mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator.  The trash can is\n     full to the brim with empty food containers.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   So, this guy took this big knife... and\n                   he held it behind him, put the tip of it\n                   in his back, and he ran backwards into\n                   the wall.  Cause, he thought it was\n                   going to look like someone stabbed him\n                   in the back.\n\n     Mills opens the refrigerator.  It's nearly empty.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Except, he poked a big fucking hole in\n                   the dry wall when he did it.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   If you could... spare me the anecdotes\n                   for now.  Leave the refrigerator open\n                   for the light.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (sarcastic)\n                   Oh, forgive me.  I thought we had this\n                   male-bonding thing going.  My mistake.\n\n     Somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought.  His flashlight\n     beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food\n     running from the stove to the table.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   What do you smell?  Other than him, and\n                   all the food.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (sniffs)\n                   I don't know... there's something.\n\n     Somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   A bucket.\n\n     Somerset points the flashlight and Mills crouches, pulls up the\n     tablecloth on his side of the table.  Two large dead rats lay on\n     the floor beside a metal bucket.\n\n     Mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the\n     rats.  He looks in the bucket.  He leans back, baffled.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It's vomit.\n\n     He looks at Somerset under the table.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   It's a bucket of vomit.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Is there any blood in it?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Can't tell by looking.\n\n     Somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man.  There is a\n     knock at the door.  The detectives look to DOCTOR THOMAS\n     O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner.  O'Neill is a frumpy man,\n     seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb.\n\n                                 O'NEILL\n                   Mood lighting.  Very sixties.\n\n     He drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (to Somerset)\n                   You think he was poisoned?\n\n     Mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   And, those rats there somehow ate the\n                   poison off the floor?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Guessing this early is useless.\n\n                                 O'NEILL\n                   You girls have got the forensics guys\n                   out there chompin' at the bit.  Don't\n                   know if we'll all fit in here though.\n\n     Mills continues searching the garbage.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   There's room.  Light's the problem.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Well, three is certainly a crowd in\n                   here.  And, with four, someone's bound\n                   to be stepping on evidence.\n                           (pause)\n                   Detective Mills, go help the officers\n                   question the neighbors.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (not pleased)\n                   Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll stay on\n                   this.\n\n     Somerset watches O'Neill at the corpse.  O'Neill points a thin\n     flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (not looking up)\n                   Send one forensic in on your way out.\n\n     Mills is pissed.  He lifts his flashlight to shine it on the\n     side of Somerset's face.\n\n     A moment passes.  Somerset looks at Mills, light shining\n     directly in Somerset's eyes.  A longer moment.  Mills switches\n     the light off.  He leaves.\n\n     O'Neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's\n     head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.\n\n                                 O'NEILL\n                   He is dead.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BASEMENT GYM -- DAY\n\n     THWACK, THWACK... THWACK.  Mills punches the heavy bag with\n     hard, quick punches.  Sweat drips off his face.  He's in work-\n     out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves.\n\n     The walls are covered in mirrors.  Other cops watch Mills as\n     they pass, checking out the new kid.  Mills keeps punching,\n     skillfully.\n\n     He stops when he sees Somerset reflected in one of the mirrors.\n     Somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on\n     top.  He sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   We need to chat.\n\n     INT.  BASEMENT GYM, BOXING RING -- DAY\n\n     Mills opens a door and enters with Somerset behind.  They are\n     alone.  Chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring.  Practice\n     pads hang from pegs on a wall.  Mills clasps a pair in his\n     gloves, offers them to Somerset.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   No.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You just hold them up.  I do all the\n                   work.\n\n     Somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on.  He still has\n     the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth.  Mills climbs into\n     the ring.  He holds the ropes open for Somerset, waits.\n\n     Somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   You've seen my files... seen the things\n                   I've done?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Yes.  Impressive work.\n\n     Mills motions to Somerset and Somerset holds up the practice\n     pads.  Mills starts working them, lightly, warming up.\n     THWACK... THWACK...\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   So, what's your problem?  I've done my\n                   time on door-to-doors, and walking a\n                   beat.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I know it.  That doesn't mean...\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I did all that shit a long time ago.\n\n     THWACK... THWACK... Somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I made a decision, because I have to\n                   worry about the integrity of the scene.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   That's bullshit.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   When I'm on scene, I'm not going to\n                   worry whether you think you're getting\n                   enough time on the playing field.  I'm\n                   there to do the work.\n\n     Mills punches a little more aggressively.  Somerset's backing,\n     flinching, keeping the pads high.  THWACK... THWACK... THWACK...\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   The badge in my pocket says \"detective,\"\n                   just like yours.  I've been Homicide for\n                   four and a half years.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You've worked Homicide for four years,\n                   or for five years...\n                   Don't count the half-years, unless you\n                   want to sound like a rookie.\n\n     Mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into\n     Somerset's face, knocks Somerset on his ass.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Oops.  My hand slipped.\n\n     Mills walks, climbs out of the ring.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   You fucked me over today, and you know\n                   it.  You know it.\n\n     Somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth.  He\n     contains his anger.  He seems to realize Mills has a point.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Just don't jerk me off.  That's all I\n                   ask.  It's not much.  Don't jerk me off.\n                           (pause)\n                   Please, do me the favor of remembering\n                   that.\n\n     Mills exits.  Somerset spits out the broken cigarette.\n\n\n     INT.  URBAN SCHOOL, OFFICE -- DAY\n\n     Tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars.\n\n     Below her, young children play in a playground.  They're playing\n     hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other.  The swing sets\n     are broken.  The handball wall is graffitied.\n\n                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                   I'm sorry, Mrs. Mills.  We don't have\n                   anything right now.\n\n     Tracy looks away from the window to the haggard WOMAN.  The\n     school's office is ill-equipped, busy, disorganized.\n\n                                 WOMAN (CONT)\n                   We'll try to give you a call if we need\n                   substitutes next month.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Thank you.\n\n     Tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a\n     chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the\n     ramp of a freezer truck.  he carries a big, whole, slaughtered\n     pig on his shoulder.\n\n     The pig's head flops as the butcher walks.  Some children stop\n     their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.\n\n\n     INT.  UNDERGROUND SUBWAY TRAIN -- DAY\n\n     The train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, WHEELS\n     SCREECHING.  The lights go on and off.  Passengers read\n     tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the\n     walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others.\n\n     All races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings.\n     Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail.\n\n     A bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through\n     the crowd.  A man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the\n     bag-lady pass.  Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways\n     to make room.  She looks down.\n\n     On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno\n     magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand.  His other hand is in his\n     pocket.  He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants.  No\n     one else notices or seems to care.\n\n     Tracy looks away, disgusted.  She closes her eyes.  The train's\n     wheels SCREECH LOUDER as the train takes a curve.\n\n\n     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT\n\n     The front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy\n     sidewalk and street.  A transparent plastic canopy frames the\n     entrance.  A STRANGE MAN, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy.\n     He wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious.\n\n     Tracy and Mills look together over the piles of fruits and\n     vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It was okay.  I mean... it was certainly\n                   better than yesterday.  I think Somerset\n                   and I came to a small understanding...\n\n     Mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch\n     apart to illustrate.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   ...about this big.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   He sounds interesting.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   He is that, if nothing else.\n\n     Mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from Tracy's\n     arm.  He goes to check out the carrots.  Tracy looks up from\n     heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance.\n\n     The strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes\n     glassy.  Customers come and go, paying him no mind.\n\n     Mills notices Tracy's interest.  He keeps comparing carrots.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   We started a big homicide case today.\n                   I'll spare you the grisly details.\n\n     The strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store\n     with a crooked grin.\n\n                                 STRANGE MAN\n                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?\n                   Name that tune...\n\n     The man keeps repeating this, over and over, still ignored.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   It's... it's like they emptied all the\n                   insane asylums into the streets.\n\n     She looks back to the heads of lettuce.\n\n                                 TRACY (CONT)\n                   That's what it's like.  Like they just\n                   gave up, and let everyone out.\n\n     Mills nods, his back to Tracy.\n\n                                 TRACY (CONT)\n                   There are a lot of frightening people in\n                   this city.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   There are a lot of frightening people in\n                   the world.\n\n     Tracy looks again to the strange man.\n\n                                 STRANGE MAN\n                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   It seems worse than Philadelphia,\n                   because everything is pushed right up\n                   against you.  In your face.\n\n     Mills edges past Tracy towards the front of the store, tries to\n     be pleasant.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Listen, honey.  I don't want to fight\n                   tonight.  Okay?  Can we just go one\n                   night without fighting about something?\n\n     He looks over apples, thinks that's the end of that.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   I'm not trying to start a fight.\n                           (pause)\n                   How am I trying to start a fight?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   We're here now.  Okay.  Are we supposed\n                   to pack it all in and go back?  How are\n                   we going to do that?\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Do I have to act like I love this place?\n                   Is that what a \"good wife\" would do?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (doleful)\n                   There's a lot of pressure on me... I...\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   And, there's a lot of pressure on me.\n                   I'm here with you.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I know.  I know...\n\n     Mills steps towards the open air entrance.  He's watching\n     something.  The strange man is still heard offscreen.\n\n     Tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf, trying to reach a bag of\n     rice, her back to Mills.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   I'm not going to close my eyes and block\n                   everything out, David.  I'm not going to\n                   act like you delivered us to some sort\n                   of paradise.  I can't...\n\n     She gets the rice and turns.  Mills is not there.  She sighs,\n     angry, looks around.  She walks towards the entrance and sees\n     him --\n\n     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET\n\n     In front of the stand, Mills has run to the corner of the\n     sidewalk to help a very old woman with a cane.  The elderly\n     woman smiles up at Mills, takes his arm as he helps her off the\n     curb and across the street.  He talks to her as they go.\n\n     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT\n\n     Tracy's anger fades.  She shakes her head, touched, amazed by\n     the plain boy scoutishness of her husband.\n\n     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET\n\n     Mills deposits the old woman on the other side.  She thanks him,\n     patting him on the cheek.  Mills starts back towards the fruit\n     stand, proud of himself.  A car screeches to a halt, just\n     missing him.  The driver leans out the window, yelling at Mills.\n     Mills kicks the side of the car.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Fuck you.\n                           (as car leaves)\n                   Fuck you, you son of a bitch!  I'm\n                   walking here.\n\n     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT\n\n     Tracy rolls her eyes in amused disappointment.  She sighs again.\n\n     Mills passes the babbling strange man, comes up to Tracy.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I'm sorry... I couldn't pass it up.  I\n                   never had a chance to actually do that.\n                   But, we can start the argument right\n                   back up where we left off, right?\n\n     Tracy looks at him, charmed, no longer willing to fight.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (playing dumb)\n                   What?\n\n     Tracy wraps an arm around Mills and kisses him.  He holds her.\n\n                                 STRANGE MAN\n                   That was the theme from tv's Mod Squad.\n                   I'm surprised nobody got that one.\n\n     The strange man starts humming a new tune.  An old man tries to\n     get through the aisle where Mills and Tracy are kissing.\n\n                                 OLD MAN\n                           (infuriated)\n                   Excuse me.  Excuse me!\n\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     A small transistor RADIO PLAYS on the bedside table.\n\n     Mills and Tracy are in bed, making love under the sheets.  They\n     move rhythmically, kissing, sweating hard.\n\n     Mills holds Tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as\n     she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers.\n\n     Mills' hair is soaked.  He is anything but mellow as a lover,\n     quickening while Tracy twists underneath him.  Tracy holds tight\n     to the back of his neck with one hand.\n\n     Finally, Mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head\n     down against Tracy's chest.  Holds for a long moment, till he is\n     spent and lowers himself against her, into her arms.  He rests a\n     long time.  She kisses his forehead, keeping her eyes closed.\n\n     Finally, Mills rolls off her, gets behind her and wraps the both\n     of them in the sheets.  He folds himself against her, and they\n     stay that way.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Goodnight.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Goodnight.\n\n     After a long moment, Mills shifts back, sits up.  Tracy looks\n     over her shoulder at him as he takes a towel off a chair and\n     stands.  Mills wraps the towel around his waist.\n\n     He leans over to give Tracy a last kiss.  She watches him leave\n     the room.  She is about to say something, but does not.  A light\n     comes on in the other room, leaking through the door.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills sits down at his desk.  He starts looking through police\n     paperwork.  The RADIO in the other room goes OFF in mid song.\n\n\n     INSERT -- TITLE CARD\n\n     TUESDAY\n\n     INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING\n\n     The room is cold, clean.  Stainless steel.  White tile.  Many\n     pathologists work at slabs.  Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR\n     SANTIAGO, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse.\n\n                                 SANTIAGO\n                   If you take a look here, buddies...\n                   I can tell you, it was not a poison.\n                   If you can see...\n                   I have emptied all of everything out of\n                   the stomach.  But, look at it, now that\n                   I took away the liver.\n\n     Santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse.  Mills\n     moves closer beside Somerset, but not too close, trying to hide\n     his disgust.  We hear squashy sounds as Santiago works, but we\n     don't see in.\n\n                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)\n                   I move the lungs over.  First, see how\n                   big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is.\n                   Now... here is the strange thing, on the\n                   stomach.  Stretches.\n                           (pointing)\n                   And, here is it distended.  Look at the\n                   size of that, because of the foods.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I can see what you're pointing at...\n\n                                 SANTIAGO\n                   On the stomach.  The lines of\n                   distention.\n\n     Somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Doctor, are you saying this man... ate\n                   till he burst?\n\n                                 SANTIAGO\n                   Yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  He\n                   was bleeding, inside of himself.\n                   And, there's a hemotoma on the\n                   outside... on the belly.\n\n     Somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   He died by eating?\n\n                                 SANTIAGO\n                   Someone punched him, or kicked him.\n\n     Somerset notices something on the partially shaved head.\n\n     He leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back\n     of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than\n     others, all about the same diameter as a dime.\n\n                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)\n                   Oh, and there is this here... something\n                   else you have to look at and see.\n\n     Somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises.\n\n                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)\n                   Most of his stomach contents are in the\n                   lab now... but, this.  I found these in\n                   the fat man's stomach.\n\n     Santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid.  He\n     picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills.  In the jar: many\n     little bits of blue plastic.  Like scrapings.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Plastic?\n\n     Mills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar.  Somerset\n     looks at it a long time.\n\n                                 SANTIAGO\n                   Why these were in a fat man's stomach, I\n                   don't know.\n\n\n     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING\n\n     Outside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut\n     through the RESTRICTED AREA/CRIME SCENE seal.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Those bruises on the back of the\n                   victim's head were caused by the muzzle\n                   of a gun.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and\n                   gave him a choice: eat, or get your head\n                   blown off.\n\n     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- MORNING\n\n     Somerset and Mills enter.  Somerset takes out the jar of plastic\n     scrapings, turns on the now normal light.  They begin to search.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   He was force-fed... till his body\n                   started rejecting the food.  He\n                   literally couldn't eat another bite.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   So, the killer held a bucket under him.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   His throat was swollen from the effort.\n                   He was bleeding internally.\n                   He must have blacked out... and, if\n                   you're the killer, you're not going to\n                   want to wait around for him to die.\n\n     Somerset examines the counter tops and wall.  Mills gets down on\n     his knees, examines the linoleum floor.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You kick him, pop him like a fucking\n                   balloon.\n                           (touches floor)\n                   Somerset, look here.\n\n     Somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Same color and texture.\n\n     They both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   If this is what that is... it doesn't\n                   make sense.  It doesn't figure.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Always look for one thing to focus on.\n                   There's always one singular thing, and\n                   it might be as small as a speck of dust,\n                   but find it and focus... till it's an\n                   exhausted possibility.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   How are pieces of the floor going to get\n                   in the guy's stomach?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be\n                   inside his stomach unless they were\n                   placed there intentionally?\n\n     Somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the\n     grooves.  He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to\n     the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in.  He looks up to see,\n     these scratches are in front of the refrigerator.  It looks like\n     they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away\n     from the wall and pushed back at some time.\n\n     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- LATER MORNING\n\n     We are BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR as it is rocked back and forth.\n     It's pulled away from the wall.  Somerset and Mills strain, pull\n     a few more feet, then release.  They lean to look --\n\n     The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust\n     has been cleared.  In that space: a circle, smeared in grease,\n     and a note taped in the center of the circle.\n\n     Somerset's BEEPER starts BEEPING.  Mills leans to read:\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   \"Dear Detectives.

Milton's\n                   Paradise Lost.\n\n     Somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the LED window.  He\n     looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news.\n\n\n     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENTS, HALLWAY -- MORNING\n\n     A marble hallway.  A DETECTIVE, 50, nervously chewing his nails,\n     quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics.\n\n                                 DETECTIVE\n                   I said to myself, I'm not going to screw\n                   around with this.  Nope.  Fuck that.\n                   It's still pretty fresh meat.  I called\n                   the medical examiner... he's coming.\n                           (stops at door)\n                   When I got to it, I knew.  As soon as I\n                   laid eyes on it, I knew...\n\n     The detective opens the door.  FOLLOW Somerset and Mills --\n\n     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING\n\n     Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its\n     blinds up.  The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead.\n\n                                 DETECTIVE (O.S.)\n                   ...this is your guy who did this.\n\n     The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were\n     kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor.  His eyes\n     are open, his arms outstretched before him.  Mills and Somerset\n     walk to either side of the man.\n\n     The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail.  The\n     apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet.\n\n     Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow\n     gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light.\n\n     Mills examines the corpse.  There's a chair one foot behind the\n     nude man.  It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood.\n     There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge\n     stain of blood under the chair.  Mills looks at pieces of cut\n     rope on the floor behind the chair.  The rope is knotted.\n\n     Somerset crouches beside the body.  There's a big piece of flesh\n     missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been\n     lopped off.  Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around\n     the man.  The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around\n     more pennies.\n\n     Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the\n     corpse and the doorway.  It's an old-fashioned counter-balance\n     scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm.  In the high\n     dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side.  In the low\n     dish: a one pound counterweight.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (to Somerset)\n                   A pound of flesh.\n\n     Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene\n     from near the door.\n\n     He looks worried, vaguely frightened.  He turns his head, looks\n     to a far wall.  Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting,\n     there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING\n\n     An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is\n     meticulously well kept.  The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk.\n     He's dressed conservatively.  Mills and Somerset sit before him.\n     Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (reading)\n                   \"One pound of flesh, no more no less.

There's a\n                   gun to your head... but, what part or\n                   parts of your body are expendable?\n\n     Mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious,\n     doesn't know why they're here.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at\n                   once, his love handle.  But, he went\n                   into shock.  Bled to death.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   What is the point, Somerset?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Look at both killings together.  This\n                   murderer is an artist.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   An artist?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   He uses colors and symbols.  He\n                   positions the bodies after death, so\n                   he's working with composition.  It's\n                   been premeditated so meticulously... and\n                   this is just the beginning.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   Wrong.

CITY STREET -- MORNING\n\n     A vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy\n     newsstand.  The headline: SECOND BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge print.\n\n     The vendor lays out another tabloid pile.  Headline: \"GIVE ME MY\n     POUND OF FLESH,\" SAYS BLOODTHRISTY KILLER, in big, red letters.\n     The vendor places a third pile beside the others:  SICKENING\n     MURDERS - EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!!!\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING\n\n     Old office.  Moving boxes on the floor.  The single window faces\n     a billboard.  Somerset works on a manual typewriter.  He types\n     hunt-and-peck, slowly.  His paperwork is on the desk in two\n     sloppy piles.  A jarring SOUND is HEARD OFFSCREEN, like fingers\n     on a blackboard.  Somerset looks up, irritated.\n\n     A WORKMAN is working at the open door, holding the source of the\n     sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words DETECTIVE\n     SOMERSET off the door's window.\n\n                                 WORKMAN\n                   Sorry.\n\n     Somerset turns back to typing.  The captain steps in, looks at\n     the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk.\n\n     As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.  He\n     looks around.  Two of boxes on the floor have DETECTIVE MILLS\n     written across them.  The captain picks one up, puts it on top\n     of the other.  He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening\n     the forms on the desk.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   What are you going to do with yourself\n                   out there, Somerset?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I'll get a job.

And, his wallet\n                   was taken, and his watch.  Then, while\n                   he was still lying unconscious, his\n                   attacker stabbed him with a knife in\n                   both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not\n                   far from here.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   I heard.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I have no understanding of this place.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   It's always been like this.\n\n     Somerset saddles up to the typewriter.  Hunt-and-peck.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Yes.  You're absolutely right.\n\n     The captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   You were made for this work, Somerset.\n                   I can't believe you're going to trade it\n                   all in for a tool belt and a fishing\n                   rod.  But, I guess I'm wrong.\n\n     The captain leaves.  Somerset looks up now that the captain's\n     gone.  He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their\n     disheveled state.  He looks at the workman.\n\n     The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to\n     remove the last remnants of Somerset's name.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (angrily)\n                   Put a little elbow grease into it!\n\n     The workman is startled, continues his work.\n\n\n     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY\n\n     The grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took\n     place has been dusted for prints and searched.\n\n     Two female forensics are at work.\n\n     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY\n\n     Mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many\n     drawers.  All the drawers are open.  Mills looks through letters\n     and stationary.  Nothing of use.  He tosses the pile back.\n\n     He sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks\n     around the room.  Books have been taken off their shelves, the\n     bed has been stripped.  The room has been given the once over.\n\n     The victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one\n     wall.  There are at least thirty photos of various sizes:\n     ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends.  An\n     over-weight forensic, CHRIS, 35, leans in through the doorway.\n\n     Mills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   He must have left us another puzzle to\n                   solve... somewhere.\n\n                                 CHRIS\n                   We'll keep looking, but we're running\n                   out of possibilities.\n\n     Chris leaves and Mills stands to stretch.  Something catches\n     Mills' eye.  He walks over to the door, curious.  At the base of\n     the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a\n     doorjamb.  Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out.\n\n     He uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut.  The\n     page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its\n     edges.  There is a single eye in the center of the sun.\n\n     An arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing\n     door.  Mills notices this and pushes the door closed.\n\n     The blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing\n     to the photo gallery wall.  Mills goes to examine the photos.\n\n     His eyes search each photo... one by one... till he sees it:\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Christ...\n\n     A framed photo of a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman smiling\n     and wearing pearls.  Under the glass, on the photo itself,\n     circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT\n\n     An assault on the senses.  Crowded streets and sidewalks.  On\n     every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks,\n     junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls.  A few\n     tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them.\n     Buildings border narrowly.\n\n     Somerset walks against the stream.  He carries a file.\n\n     CAR HORNS HOWL.  MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs.\n     REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second\n     story window.  TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor.\n\n     Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain.  He\n     walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground.  The men are\n     pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.\n\n     Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he\n     crosses through the traffic jam in the street.  A VAGRANT steps\n     up with his hand out.\n\n                                 VAGRANT\n                   Spare me a cigarette, money-grip?  Spare\n                   me a cigarette?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Sorry.  Last one.\n\n     He walks on.  We BEGIN to HEAR JAZZ MUSIC.\n\n     INT.  JAZZ CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n     A club at capacity.  The JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES like a slow, cool\n     breeze from a JAZZ TRIO on a platform.\n\n     The air is thick with smoke.  Yuppies sit elbow to elbow with\n     the last members of the beat generation.  Everyone's drinking\n     beer, smoking pot.\n\n     Somerset crosses the club, looking for someone.  He takes a\n     tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in\n     his ears.  At the back of the club, a major-league bouncer\n     stands in front of a closed door.  Somerset shows his badge and\n     the bouncer steps aside with reservation.\n\n     INT.  NARROW STAIRWELL -- NIGHT\n\n     The walls are black.  Somerset opens the door, enters, walks\n     down the long flight of stairs.  As Somerset descends, the JAZZ\n     MUSIC FADES and is ENGULFED by the sound of SPEED METAL.\n     DEAFENING.\n\n     At the bottom, Somerset opens another door.  He enters --\n\n     INT.  UNDERGROUND ART GALLERY -- NIGHT\n\n     A narrow room.  SPEED METAL is even LOUDER.  This is a private\n     art party.  The people are lizard-like, pale.  Men and women\n     priding themselves on their gauntness.\n\n     Somerset passes canvases on the walls.  Pointlessly abstract\n     paintings.  Splatters, smears and blobs of color.\n\n     Party-people stand in front of these \"works,\" engrossed.\n     Somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the\n     tissue further in his ears.  He spots his objective.\n\n     WILLIAM McCRACKEN, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers.  He is\n     dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many\n     colors of paint.  He wears dark sunglasses, bored by the\n     bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear.\n\n     Somerset worms his way to stand in front of William.  The party-\n     goers turn their attention to this intrusion.\n\n     William looks up, pushes the girl away.  He takes off his\n     sunglasses.  His eyes are badly bloodshot and listless.\n\n     He looks Somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.\n\n\n     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the\n     woman with her eyes circled in blood.  He looks overworked,\n     drinks coffee.  His desk is swamped with files.\n\n                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                   I have voiced the same concerns to our\n                   law enforcement officials, and they\n                   assure me he is of the highest caliber.\n\n     Mills looks to a t.v. on a table, picks up a remote, increases\n     the volume.  On the screen, MARTIN TALBOT, 47, source of the\n     voice, stands before reporters.  He's a powerful presence, with\n     a gold tooth in the front of his mouth.\n\n                                 A REPORTER (V.O.)\n                           (from t.v.)\n                   As District Attorney, don't you feel\n                   some responsibility?  Detective David\n                   Mills lacks the experience...\n\n                                 TALBOT (V.O.)\n                           (from t.v.)\n                   I've always said... I've always said,\n                   don't send a boy to do a man's job.\n\n     Mills is hanging on every word.\n\n                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)\n                   But, David Mills has a sterling record\n                   with the Philadelphia force.  I stand\n                   behind him one hundred percent.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (relieved)\n                   You tell 'em boss.  Detective David\n                   Mills is a wonderful human being...\n\n                                 TALBOT (V.O.)\n                   However... however... let me say this...\n\n     Mills looks back at the television.\n\n                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)\n                   If Detective Mills, at any point in this\n                   investigation... if he is not pulling\n                   his weight, I will be the first in line\n                   to pull his plug.\n\n     Mills points the remote, turns the t.v. off as reporters crowd\n     Talbot.  Mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited.\n\n     Across the room, Tracy stands in the doorway.  Mills does not\n     see her.  He looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk.\n\n     Tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes.\n\n\n     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted\n     warehouse space filled with canvases.  It's clear the works at\n     the underground art gallery were William's.  William climbs a\n     ladder to a loft storage space.  He moves cautiously, like he's\n     not quite up to the task.\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                   I always figured that's the only reason\n                   you and I used to be friends.  Because I\n                   was a friend of hers.\n\n     William yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper, climbs down.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   Speaking of which...\n\n     William hands the painting to Somerset, walks to a director's\n     chair facing a paint-splashed canvas on an easel.  He is a used-\n     up man, bound in an apathy-induced haze.  He sits, picks up a\n     squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   I painted that about five years ago.  I\n                   always told myself I'd give it to you\n                   next time I saw you.\n\n     Somerset starts unwrapping the painting.\n\n     William \"paints,\" using the squeeze bottles and by flicking\n     saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas.\n     Most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's\n     using.  He looks over his shoulder at Somerset.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   Things are different these days, pal.\n                   You wouldn't believe it...\n\n     Somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell\n     of memories.  Horribly sad memories.  It's a portrait in oils of\n     a pretty, red-headed woman.\n\n     William shoots red paint with one hand, concentrates on\n     lighting a filterless cigarette with the other.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   People buy my paintings now... they\n                   drive down in their BMWs and Rolls\n                   Royces.  It's the new money generation.\n                   I guess they think they're touching the\n                   avant-garde...\n\n     William looks at his creation, then calmly kicks the easel over.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   There's another thousand dollar William\n                   McCracken expression of anarchy.\n\n     William gets up, walks across the wet canvas, leaving\n     footprints.  He looks down at what he's done.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   Make that two thousand.\n\n     He laughs.  Somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   How is she?  Have you seen her recently?\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                   Huh... oh.  No.  She moved out of the\n                   city.  Last winter.  She married some\n                   businessman, or something like that.\n\n     Somerset fights the anguish this causes, puts the painting down.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Good for her.\n                           (pause)\n                   I'm leaving soon myself.  I'm finally\n                   getting out.\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                   Yeah?  What happened to the idealistic\n                   super-cop I used to know?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   He became a realist.\n\n     William grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of\n     pills.  He palms a few, notices the judgment in Somerset's eyes.\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                   Oh... sorry.\n\n     William turns his back to Somerset, pops the pills.  Out of\n     sight, out of mind.  Somerset is disappointed, disgusted.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (sarcastic)\n                   Not that I don't appreciate your recent\n                   artistic endeavors... but, what happened\n                   to the painter I used to know?\n\n     William smiles like a dolt, laughs a little.\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                   I can't remember.\n\n     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT\n\n     Color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing\n     table.  The top photos are like establishing shots, each taking\n     in the entire display the murderer created.\n\n     William examines with Somerset looking over his shoulder.\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                   Man... can I buy these from you?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   They're not for sale.\n\n     Somerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle:\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   What is it?  What's the murderer trying\n                   to say?\n\n     William narrows his eyes.  Does not know.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   What picture is he painting?\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                           (figuring)\n                   Wait a minute...\n\n     William has an idea.  He ambles over to a row of cabinets where\n     oversized art books are stacked.  He hunts through a pile,\n     shoves some books aside.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   I... I've seen things like that...\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Where?\n\n     William keeps digging, finds one book, finds another.  He opens\n     one as he walks back to the drawing table.\n\n                                 WILLIAM\n                   It's church stuff.  Christianity.\n\n     William lays a book down, finds a page.  He opens it to\n     Somerset.  There is a circle to the side of the text.  It says\n     GLUTTONY under the circle.\n\n     Somerset creases his brow, turns the page.  William opens\n     another book.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (CONT)\n                   When it first started... Christian\n                   artwork was all from Bible stories.  It\n                   was like... nobody had any imagination.\n                   It was all... standardized.\n\n     William pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre,\n     worlds of Hieronymus Bosch.  Horrifying religious visions.\n\n                                 WILLIAM (O.S.,CONT)\n                   But, later, everyone started painting to\n                   tell their own stories... to teach\n                   lessons.

CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT\n\n     A bright, tawdry intersection.  Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on\n     porno theatres provide the flash.  Cars, taxies, and barkers\n     urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise.\n\n     The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly\n     men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards:\n     FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc.  The usual\n     contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for\n     someone to hurt.\n\n     MOVE through the crowds.  Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man,\n     wearing thick glasses.  There is not a single thing strange or\n     unusual about his appearance.  FOLLOW him as he walks.  He's\n     nervous, looking at the porno palaces.\n\n     His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest.  He\n     doesn't feel comfortable being here.\n\n     John walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross.  A\n     grotesque STREET PREACHER approaches waving his own Bible.\n     People walk away from him, so he confronts John.\n\n                                 PREACHER\n                   ...are you, Sir?  Is Jesus Christ your\n                   Lord and Master?  Do you believe in Him?\n\n     John tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape.\n\n                                 PREACHER (CONT)\n                           (pleading)\n                   Don't ignore me.  Listen to what I have\n                   to say.  Christ can be your savior!\n\n                                 JOHN\n                           (quiet anger)\n                   Leave me alone.\n\n                                 PREACHER\n                   Think about God, sir.  I can help you\n                   let Him into your life.\n\n     Finally the light changes.  John turns and spits in the\n     preacher's face.  The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly.\n\n     John hurries between cars in the crosswalk.  The preacher curses\n     from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic.\n\n     EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT\n\n     People pass on the sidewalk.  John is amongst them, but he\n     stops, looking up at something offscreen.\n\n     He's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon:\n     THE HOT HOUSE.  Massage parlor.  The Hot House's BARKER notices\n     John's interest.\n\n                                 BARKER\n                   Interesting isn't it, friend?  You like\n                   that, you like girls, then come on in.\n\n     John doesn't hear the barker.  Steps up to study fading pictures\n     of naked women massaging happy men.  Nudity.\n\n                                 BARKER (CONT)\n                   You'll see a lot more inside.  You'll\n                   see a lot more than that.\n\n     John's just looking, his face bathed in bright red light, the\n     neon reflected in his thick glasses.\n\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset, holding more than an armful of art books and novels,\n     pounds on the apartment door.  Tracy opens it with the chain on.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Can I help you?\n\n     She takes a second to drink Somerset in.  Somerset is surprised,\n     having expected Mills.  Tracy is so exquisite that he falters.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Uh... I was looking for Mills.

MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT\n\n     Tracy leads Somerset into the disarray of the apartment.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   David went for a walk.  To clear his\n                   head.  Oh, you can put those here.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Thank you.\n\n     Tracy motions and Somerset puts the books on Mills' desk.\n     He starts looking through one book, checking paperclipped pages.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   Could you tell him... tell him this is\n                   his reading assignment.  It's urgent.\n                   I've marked the most important pages.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Would you like some coffee, or a drink.\n                   David should be back any minute.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I do have to get going.\n\n     Somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens\n     and pencils.  He picks it up: it's a medal for valor from the\n     Philadelphia Police Department.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   At least I got to meet you.  David has\n                   told me a lot about you.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Really?

He goes\n     through his pocket, pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I'm going to leave him a list of\n                   specifics.  It all relates to the case\n                   he's on.\n\n     He lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk, sits\n     to start writing on the notepad.  Tracy goes to the kitchenette\n     to get a chair.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   You two aren't working together anymore.\n                   Isn't that so?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills...\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Tracy.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Tracy.

Somerset\n     looks up from his writing.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I doubt your husband shares that\n                   opinion.\n\n     Tracy nods, leaning forward, semi-conspiratorially.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   You know, Somerset, David is very...\n                   determined.  I'm sure you've seen, it's\n                   not likely he'll ever be compared to\n                   Gandhi.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   He's a good cop.  He just...\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   He sees policework as a crusade.  That's\n                   what he wants it to be, and, that might\n                   sound naive, but he's made a conscious\n                   choice to be naive.\n                           (pause)\n                   Believe me, his heart's in the right\n                   place.\n\n     Somerset pauses, enchanted by her.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I hear you and he were high school\n                   sweethearts.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Yeah.  Pretty hokey, huh?  But, what\n                   girl wouldn't want the captain of the\n                   football team as their lifelong mate?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   It's rare these days... that kind of\n                   commitment.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   I guess so.\n\n     Tracy's smile falters a bit.  Somerset notices this.  He breaks\n     from her spell, turns to continue writing.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Well... this will only take a minute.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Take your time.\n\n     Somerset writes.  Tracy looks over the stack of books:\n\n     Titles on the spines: BOSCH, A HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN ART, BREGEL\n     THE ELDER, etc.  Hardcover novels: DANTE'S PURGATORY and THE\n     CANTERBURY TALES.\n\n     Tracy stands to look at the novels on top, then sees the pile of\n     paper scraps from Somerset's pocket.  She picks up the piece of\n     wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center.\n\n                                 TRACY (CONT)\n                   What is this?\n\n     Somerset looks up.  Sees her holding the paper rose.  He takes\n     it, slightly self-conscious, looks at it.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   My future.\n\n     Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   You have a strange way about you,\n                   Somerset... I mean in a good way...\n                   unusual.\n\n     Somerset doesn't know what to say.  He pockets the paper rose.\n\n                                 TRACY (CONT)\n                   I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair.\n\n     Tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette.\n\n                                 TRACY (CONT)\n                   It's just... it's nice to hear a man who\n                   talks like that.  If David saw that\n                   paper, he'd say you're acting like a\n                   homosexual.  That's how he is.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (mock indignation)\n                   Well!

Tracy sits at the kitchenette\n     table, watches him.\n\n\n     INSERT -- TITLE CARD\n\n     THURSDAY\n\n     EXT.  CITY MORGUE -- MORNING\n\n     It's raining hard.  Mills exits the morgue building with a few\n     art books and a paper cup of coffee.  He holds one art book over\n     his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING\n\n     Mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art\n     books in a box.  He closes the door.  Alone with the sound of\n     the rain.  He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes\n     in the rearview mirror.\n\n     He reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The\n     Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory.  He makes a face, opens\n     Dante's Purgatory:\n\n      -------------------------------------------------------------\n     |                                     THE EARTHLY PARADISE    |\n     |-------------------------------------------------------- /\\  |\n     |                                                        /  \\ |\n     |                               VII The Lustful         /____\\|\n     |                                                      /      |\n     |                                VI The Gluttonous    /_______|\n     |       7 TERRACES OF                                /        |\n     |                                 V The Avaricious  /         |\n     |                                   and Prodigal   /__________|\n     |         PURGATION                               /           |\n     |                                                /            |\n     |                                               /             |\n     |                             IV The Slothful  /______________|\n     |                                             /               |\n     |                                            /                |\n     |                                           /                 |\n     |                     III The Wrathful     /__________________|\n     |                                         /                   |\n     |                      II The Envious    /____________________|\n     |                                       /                     |\n     |                       I The Proud    /______________________|\n     |                                     /                       |\n     |                                    /                        |\n     |                                   /       THE ISLAND        |\n     |                                  /                          |\n     |                                 /        OF PURGATORY       |\n     |                                /                            |\n     |_______________________________/_____________________________|\n\n     Mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel.\n     He reads.

He starts pounding the book against the steering\n     wheel with all his might.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Fucking Dante.

PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\n     It still rains outside.  Somerset enters, stops to notice\n     DETECTIVE MILLS painted on the door where his name used to be.\n     He walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk\n     and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner.\n\n     Somerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files\n     and papers.  Mills enters carrying the box of books.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   How's it coming?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Great.\n\n     Mills puts the box on the large desk.  They both settle in,\n     attending to their work.  Two men, about five feet apart, each\n     trying not to acknowledge the other's presence.\n\n     Mills takes out his Cliff Notes, looks to see Somerset is\n     occupied, hides them in a desk drawer.\n\n     Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up.  There's a\n     chalk board nailed to the wall.\n\n     On the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath\n                            2 greed(x)       6 pride\n                            3 sloth          7 lust\n                            4 envy\n\n     The PHONE RINGS.

The t.v. picture goes fuzzy.  The RUMBLING grows\n     LOUDER, knocks something over in the sink.  Mills continues\n     eating.  Somerset fiddles with his food.

SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     John comes from the stairwell door, looks, walks up the hall.\n     The walls are graffitied.  The soiled floor is wet in spots.\n     ARGUMENTS and LOUD CHILDREN are HEARD from behind closed doors.\n     John comes to apartment 303.  He's winded from the climb.  He\n     takes out keys, lets himself in.  Closes the door.\n\n\n     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of Mrs. Gold.  He\n     puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   It's like he's preaching.\n                           (pause)\n                   The sins were used in medieval sermons.\n                   There were seven cardinal virtues, and\n                   then seven deadly sins, as a learning\n                   tool.  The sins distract man from true\n                   worship.  True faith.\n\n     Mills is seated at the table with art books open.\n\n     A breeze fans the pages of the books.  The flipping pages reveal\n     views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Like in these paintings, and in Dante's\n                   Purgatory, right?  But, in Purgatory,\n                   Dante and his buddy climb that big\n                   mountain...\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Seven Terraces of Purgation.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Anyway... pride comes first, not\n                   gluttony.  And in all the paintings,\n                   the sins are in a different order.  I\n                   can't find a pattern.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Because there's creativity in the mix.\n                   Consider these books as the murderer's\n                   inspiration.

Big score.\n\n\n     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     This is where the greed murder took place.  Somerset and Mills\n     are taking the constructivist painting off the wall.  Nothing on\n     the wall behind the painting.  Blank space.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Nothing.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   This has got to be it.\n\n     Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge.\n     The frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper.  He points\n     to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame, and to\n     where it has been re-screwed.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   It has to be.  He changed the wire to\n                   rehang it.\n\n     Somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the\n     space between it and the canvas.  He tears out the entire sheet.\n     Mills helps pull it away, but there's nothing there.  Empty.\n     Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It's nothing.\n\n     Somerset pays the painting down, face up.  He pokes his finger\n     on the painted surface.  Mills watches as Somerset kneels, takes\n     out a credit card and presses it's edge against the canvas,\n     trying to peel up some of the paint.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Give it up.

There is only a nail.  He stares intently,\n     then turns and walks out of the room.\n\n     Mills holds his hands to his temples, furious.  SOMERSET can be\n     HEARD from the other room, going through drawers, dropping\n     things.  GLASS is HEARD BREAKING.  Mills grabs a lamp and throws\n     it on the floor.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Son of a bitch!\n\n     Somerset comes back in, holding something.  He steps over the\n     lamp and goes to the blank wall space.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   What?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Bear with me.\n\n     Mills watches.  Somerset has a woman's make-up compact in hand.\n     He opens it, uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge\n     powder to the wall around the nail.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (incredulous)\n                   Oh, yeah, sure.

He blows, leans very close\n     to the wall to study the powder.  Leans closer still.  Pause.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   Call the print lab.

MILLS' APARTMENT, FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT\n\n     Through the window, we can see into the bedroom.  Tracy comes\n     back from the living room.  She goes to her side of the bed,\n     kneels.  She reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes\n     out a paperback book she has hidden there.\n\n     She comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire\n     escape.  She sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars.  She\n     opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting\n     her head against the railing.  A WOMAN is HEARD SCREAMING\n     distantly.\n\n     Tracy looks down the empty street, unsettled.  The woman is not\n     heard again.\n\n     Tracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself.  We can now\n     see the title of the book: PREPARING FOR PARENTHOOD.  There is a\n     picture of a baby on the cover.\n\n     Tracy cries, quietly.\n\n\n     INT.

The technician adjusts a knob.\n\n                                 TECHNICIAN\n                   I've seen this baby take three days to\n                   finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross\n                   your fingers somewhere else.\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset and Mills come from the print lab.  A janitor is\n     mopping the hall.  The computer is HEARD WHIRRING AND CLICKING\n     onwards.  Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the\n     door.  Mills flops beside him.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You really meant what you said to Mrs.\n                   Gold.

We\n                   take all the evidence... all the\n                   pictures, statements.  Write everything\n                   down and note what time things happened.\n                   We take it all, make a nice, neat pile\n                   and file it away.  Just in case it's\n                   ever needed in a courtroom.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You're unbelievable.  In my entire life,\n                   you're the oldest man I've ever met.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I've seen even the most promising clues\n                   lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I've seen the same.  I'm not the country\n                   hick-boy you seem to think I am.\n\n     Somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   In this city, if all the skeletons came\n                   out of all the closets... if every un-\n                   revenged corpse were to suddenly rise\n                   and walk again, there would be no more\n                   room for the living.\n\n     Mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Don't try to tell me you didn't get that\n                   rush tonight... that adrenalin.

The computer is\n     heard: whir - click - whir - click...\n\n\n     INSERT -- TITLE CARD\n\n     FRIDAY\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- EARLY MORNING\n\n     Our detectives are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against\n     each other.  People pass and look at them strangely.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   Wake up, Glimmer Twins.  We have a\n                   winner.\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING\n\n     A windowless classroom.  The captain stands in front with a\n     white screen at his side.  The face of a black man, 25, ZERO, is\n     projected on the screen from a slide projector.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   His street name is Zero, as some of you\n                   know.  His prints were found at the\n                   scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.\n\n     FIVE hardened POLICE OFFICERS, four men, one woman, sit in\n     chairs facing the captain.  They all wear bullet-proof vests\n     with \"POLICE\" stencil-painted across them.  Somerset and Mills\n     sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)\n                   Now, Zero has a long, long history of\n                   mental illness.  Serious illness.  He\n                   was all over your television sets two\n                   years ago after he raped and killed a\n                   seventy-three year old woman.  He got\n                   off, as the saying goes, on a\n                   technicality.  So we watched him on the\n                   streets, and he went out of circulation\n                   about a year ago.\n\n                                 FEMALE COP\n                   If he disappeared, what do you want from\n                   us?\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   His last place of residence is still in\n                   his name.  A search warrant is being\n                   pushed through the court as we speak.\n\n     A red-headed cop, CALIFORNIA, 28, raises his meaty hand.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   So, have the housing cops walk up and\n                   ring the doorbell.  Problem solved.\n\n     The cops laugh.  The captain clenches his jaw.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   Listen, California.  When you go in, if\n                   Zero isn't home, some of his buddies\n                   might be house-sitting.  And besides\n                   using, Zero deals, so, you will be very\n                   uninvited guests.\n\n     There is chatter among the cops.  Somerset leans to Mills while\n     the captain continues the briefing.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Does not seem like our killer, does it?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You tell me.  I'm new in town.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Zero does possess the requisite degree\n                   of insanity... but, he doesn't have the\n                   desire somehow.  Our killer seems to\n                   have more purpose.  More purpose than\n                   Zero could ever conceive of.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   We'll tag along.\n\n     Somerset wants no part of that.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Why would we?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Satisfy our curiosity?\n\n\n     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING\n\n     Mills drives, follows a police van.  Somerset rides shotgun.\n     Mills is pumped, ready.  Somerset takes one Rolaids tablet off a\n     fresh roll and chews it.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You ever take one?\n\n     Somerset pulls out his gun, checks the load.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   No.  Never in twenty-four years.  I took\n                   my gun out only five times with the\n                   actual intention of using it.  I never\n                   fired it.  Not once.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I pulled it once, fired it once.  I\n                   never took a bullet.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   And?\n\n     Mills turns a corner, tires screeching.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It was my first one of these.  We were a\n                   secondary unit, in vice.  I was pretty\n                   shaky going in.  When we busted the\n                   door, looking for a junkie, the fucking\n                   guy opened fire.  One cop was hit in the\n                   arm.  He went flying... like in slow\n                   motion.\n                           (pause)\n                   I remember riding in the ambulance.  His\n                   arm was like... a piece of meat.  I\n                   thought, it's just his arm.  But, he\n                   bled to death right there anyway.\n\n     A pause.  Somerset opens the window, feels the air on his face.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   How did the fire-fight end?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Well, I was doing really good in Philly\n                   up till then.  Lots of simple busts.\n                   I've always had this weird luck... but,\n                   this was wild.\n                           (pause)\n                   I got that fuck with one shot... right\n                   between the eyes.  And the next week,\n                   the mayor's pinning a medal on me.\n                   Picture in the paper, the whole nine\n                   yards.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   How was it?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I expected it to be bad, because I heard\n                   about other guys.  You know... I took a\n                   human life.  But, I slept like a baby\n                   that night.\n\n     Somerset eats another antacid.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I\n                   can't remember where, but he wrote that,\n                   in order to live in a city, you have to\n                   have the ability to kill.  I think he\n                   meant you truly must be able to do it,\n                   not just faking it, to survive.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Sounds like he knew what he was talking\n                   about.\n\n\n     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING\n\n     Crack vials and hypodermic needles crunch under heavy boots.\n\n     The five cops from the briefing, fully geared up, rifles and\n     handguns held, move quickly up the stairs, single-file.\n     Somerset and Mills follow, guns out.  Somerset is sweating\n     bullets.  Mills is juiced.\n\n     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- MORNING\n\n     The cops enter the dank hallway, the same hall we saw John in\n     before.  They move cautiously, stepping over a drunken, helpless\n     man.  A door opens and a woman peeks out.  The female cop points\n     her gun and the woman obeys, slamming the door.\n\n     California leads, steps up to apartment 303.  He has a search\n     warrant scotch-taped to the front of his bullet-proof vest.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                           (to black cop)\n                   This is it.  Give it up.\n\n     A black cop hoists a battering ram.  The other cops get on both\n     sides of the door.  Mills moves front.  Somerset hangs back.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)\n                   Police!!  Open the door!\n\n     The black cop brings the ram forward with a splintering thud.\n     The door flies open.  The cops storm in.\n\n     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING\n\n     The cops charge down a short hall into this incredibly dusty\n     room.  A bed sits against a far wall.  Mills and California move\n     up to the bed.  Someone lies under an indigo blanket.  Three\n     other cops move, training their weapons on the bed.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   Good morning, Sweetheart!\n\n     A blond cop goes into another room.  Mills kicks the bed.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Get up now, motherfucker!  Now!\n\n     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM -- MORNING\n\n     The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion.\n\n     The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of\n     colorful, plastic air fresheners.\n\n     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING\n\n     Somerset moves in, looks around.  He notices the area around the\n     bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo,\n     while the rest of the room is its original white.  On a wall, a\n     white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I said get up, Sleepyhead!\n\n     Mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the\n     shriveled, sore-covered form of a black man who is blindfolded\n     and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again\n     around the bed.  Tubes lead from the stained loincloth around\n     the man's waist and snake under the bed.  The victim is\n     partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   Oh, fuck me!\n\n     Somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Holy shit.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Sloth... it's sloth.\n\n     The black cop touches the black spaghetti.  Holds a piece.\n\n                                 BLACK COP\n                   What the hell... those are dead worms.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                           (to Somerset)\n                   Check this out, dick.\n\n     California points with his gun to the end of the black man's\n     right arm.  The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It's him.  It's Zero.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Someone call an ambulance.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   Someone call a hearse, more like.\n\n     The female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned\n     up.  She pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty-two polaroid\n     pictures; all pictures of Zero tied to the bed, with a date\n     written at the bottom of each.  it is a visual history of Zero's\n     physical decay.  The blond cop enters from the other room.\n\n                                 BLOND COP\n                   What the fuck is going on?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Hey, California.  Get your people out.\n\n     Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   You heard him.  Hit the hall, and don't\n                   touch anything.\n\n     The other cops file out as Mills goes to examine the polaroids\n     under the sheet.  Somerset replaces the sheet over Zero's body.\n     California stays by his side.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)\n                   It looks like he's some kind of friggin'\n                   wax sculpture.\n\n     Somerset places his finger along Zero's throat.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Somerset, you... you better look here.\n\n     Mills studies the polaroids.  Somerset walks to join him.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   All pictures of Zero tied to the bed.\n                           (crouches)\n                   The last one's dated three days ago.\n\n     Somerset looks at the first photo.  In it, Zero is bound and\n     gagged, but he is fit, healthy.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (awed)\n                   The first photo... it's dated one year\n                   ago.  Almost to the day.\n\n     California lifts Zero's blanket to peek under, examining with\n     morbid curiosity.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   Mo-ther...\n\n     Mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor,\n     finds an open shoebox.  On the box: TO THE DETECTIVES.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   What's this?\n\n     California leans close to Zero's gaunt, blindfolded face.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   You got what you deserved, Zero.\n\n     Somerset leans down beside Mills.  Mills looks through the\n     shoebox.  Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.  One bag contains\n     small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid...\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   A urine sample... hair sample...\n                   fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at\n                   us.\n\n     California is still close to Zero's face when suddenly Zero's\n     lips twist.  Zero lets out a loud, guttural bark.  California\n     jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair.\n\n     Mills and Somerset reel, standing.  They see California on the\n     ground, scared out of his mind, pointing.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   He's alive!\n\n     Mills and Somerset look towards the bed.\n\n     Zero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   He's still alive!\n\n\n     EXT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING -- MORNING\n\n     A crowd has gathered.  Mills' car, the police van and two\n     ambulances are parked on the sidewalk.\n\n     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, HALLWAY -- MORNING\n\n     The siege cops are in the hall, holding neighbors at bay.\n\n     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING\n\n     Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Zero.  One\n     attendant uses wire-cutters to clip Zero's bonds.\n\n     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING\n\n     Mills and Somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs.\n     They are both highly agitated.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   The way this has gone, I didn't think it\n                   was possible, but we may have\n                   underestimated this guy.  The type of\n                   intestinal fortitude it must take... to\n                   keep a man bound for a full year.  To\n                   sever his hand and use it to plant\n                   fingerprints.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I want him bad.  I don't just want to\n                   catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Listen... we have to divorce ourselves\n                   from our emotions here.  We have to keep\n                   focusing on the small details.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I don't know about you, Somerset, but I\n                   feed off my emotions.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   He'll string us along all the way if\n                   we're not careful.\n\n     Mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger.  Somerset\n     grabs him by the jacket.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   Are you listening to me?!\n\n     Mills pushes Somerset's hand off.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I hear you.\n\n     There is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the SOUND of a\n     CAMERA ADVANCING.  Mills and Somerset look --\n\n     Down the stairs, John is posing as a reporter.  He has his\n     camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives.\n\n                                 JOHN\n                   Say cheese.\n\n     He takes another picture, flashbulb flashing.  Mills charges\n     downwards, grabs John by his wrinkled clothing.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   What the fuck are you doing?\n\n     John squirms, holds up a laminated PRESS identification pass.\n\n                                 JOHN\n                   I have a right, Officer.  I...\n\n     Mills shoves him and John stumbles a few steps, then falls to\n     the landing below with a thud.  His glasses fly off.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   That doesn't mean anything.  This is a\n                   closed crime scene now!\n\n     Somerset steps down and pulls Mills back.  John stands.\n\n                                 JOHN\n                   You can't do this!

You can hate them, but\n                   you better give them something, or\n                   they'll make it all up.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (calming)\n                   I'm sorry...

It's always\n                   impressive to see a man feeding off his\n                   emotions.\n\n\n     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Mills stands with the blase DR. BEARDSLEY, who reviews a medical\n     chart on a clipboard.  Zero lies inside an oxygen tent with\n     tubes running into him.  The room is dark.\n\n                                 BEARDSLEY\n                   A year of immobility seems about right,\n                   judging by the deterioration of the\n                   muscles and spinal cord.  Blood tests\n                   show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his\n                   system.  Heroin... crack... even an\n                   antibiotic which was administered to\n                   keep the bed sores from infecting.\n\n     Mills looks into the oxygen.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   He hasn't said anything, or tried to\n                   express himself in any way?\n\n                                 BEARDSLEY\n                   Even if his brain were not mush, which\n                   it is... he chewed his own tongue off a\n                   long time ago.\n\n     Mills winces, moves away from the bed.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   There's no way he'll survive?\n\n                                 BEARDSLEY\n                   Detective, he'd die right now of shock\n                   if you were to shine a flashlight in his\n                   eyes.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREET, CATHOLIC CHURCH -- AFTERNOON\n\n     A tall church on a bustling street.  Smoggy air has eaten at the\n     stonework.  The homeless are camped out on the stairs.\n\n     INT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH, PRIEST'S QUARTERS -- AFTERNOON\n\n     The priest's accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable.\n     The parish's wealth is evident.  FATHER BLEEKER, 38, stands\n     looking at several 8\" by 10\" glossies.  He's dressed in his\n     \"civilian\" clothing, wears his hair short and proper.  These\n     photos are making him heartsick.\n\n     Bleeker hands them to Somerset who is seated by a fireplace.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   Put them away.  I wish you hadn't\n                   brought them into the church.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I needed for you to see them.\n\n     Father Bleeker shakes his head, as if he were trying to forget\n     the images.  Somerset replaces the murder photos in a file.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   There were five principal phases in the\n                   development of early Christian art.\n                   From Hellenistic through the\n                   Renaissance... each period was affected\n                   by the decrees of religious leaders.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   If this killer belongs to a certain\n                   branch of the church... if he collects\n                   religious art from a certain period, I\n                   want to know.  I have to narrow it down.\n\n     Bleeker walks to an ornate, gold cabinet.  He puts on a pair of\n     cotton gloves.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   The influences on these... things he's\n                   done, couldn't have come before the\n                   Gothic period.  What's in those pictures\n                   is presented far too asymmetrically.\n\n     Bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet.\n     He takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth.\n\n                                 BLEEKER (CONT)\n                   The colors will tell the tale.\n\n     Bleeker takes the book to a table.  Somerset follows.  Bleeker\n     lays the cloth under the book, opens the book, tenderly.\n\n                                 BLEEKER (CONT)\n                   Each sin had a symbolic color.  But the\n                   specific color designations changed\n                   throughout the ages.\n\n     Somerset leans to examine Bleeker's illuminated manuscript:\n\n     Two pages of prayer.  The prose is elaborately formed,\n     surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins.\n     Bleeker's finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a\n     rock, guzzling from a jug.  It's been painted in orange.\n\n                                 BLEEKER (O.S.,CONT)\n                   This is an example.  Gluttony is the\n                   sin, and the color is orange.  This\n                   particular manuscript is preserved from\n                   the 18th century.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)\n                   In the murders, gluttony is green.\n                   Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo.\n\n     Bleeker steps away and Somerset gets closer to the pages.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   So, if this murderer is as precise as\n                   you say, then you need to find out at\n                   what period in history was gluttony\n                   green... and so on.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Where do I look?  If the colors changed\n                   so often?\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                           (contemplates)\n                   There is one man... Father Stone.\n                           (pause)\n                   I haven't heard from him for quite some\n                   time.  This was his passion.  He spent\n                   his life studying the sins... and\n                   preaching against them.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON\n\n     The chalkboard on the wall:  1 gluttony (x)       5 wrath\n                                  2 greed (x)          6 pride\n                                  3 sloth (x)          7 lust\n                                  4 envy\n\n     Mills is behind his paperwork covered desk, listening to a\n     uniformed OFFICER who looks over a report sheet.\n\n                                 OFFICER\n                   Zero's landlord said an envelope of cash\n                   was in the office mailbox each month.\n                   He says, quote, \"I never heard a single\n                   complaint from this guy and nobody ever\n                   complained about him.  He's the best\n                   tenant I ever had.\"\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   There's a landlord's dream tenant.

Mills starts sorting through piles on his\n     desk.  He doesn't know where to begin.\n\n     He sits back in his chair, looks at the collage-like collection\n     of pictures pinned on the walls: photos and diagrams of the\n     murder scenes, the drawing of the sun and eye, color pages and\n     black and white copies of pages from art books.\n\n     He stares, thinking.  He stands, takes a photocopy off the wall.\n     The killer's first note:\n\n              Dear Detectives,\n                   Long is the way, and hard, that out\n                   of hell leads up to the light.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (to himself)\n                   Milton.\n\n\n     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY -- AFTERNOON\n\n     Big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling.  Mahogany chairs and\n     tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three\n     levels of balconies.  People wander like ants in an ant farm.\n\n     Mills walks, taking it all in.  He goes to the circulation desk.\n     Impatient patrons wait in a long line.  He watches the bored\n     HEAD LIBRARIAN, female, 64, help an old man at the desk.\n\n     She opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code\n     sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer.\n\n     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, TOP BALCONY -- LATER AFTERNOON\n\n     Near the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits\n     before a computer card catalog.  He reads the computer screen,\n     unsure.  He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles,\n     begins typing on the keyboard.  The computer gives off a quiet\n     BEEP.  Pleased, Mills reads the screen.  Types.\n\n     On the screen:                 TITLE / PARADISE LOST_\n\n     He hits return.  Reads the screen as information on the book\n     appears.  He copies it on his pad, puts the pencil in his mouth.\n\n     He types.  On the screen:      SUBJECT / JACK THE RIPPER_\n\n     Hits return.  Again, he copies info from the screen.\n\n\n     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER -- AFTERNOON\n\n     A monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting Father Bleeker\n     and Somerset into a garden courtyard.  Bleeker now wears his\n     priestly garb and collar.  The monastery's main building looms\n     at the end of a pathway.  The building is stately, ivy-covered.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   Father Stone had a church and\n                   congregation of his own.  But, he...\n                   there were some problems.  The church is\n                   deserted now.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Problems?\n\n     Bleeker continues walking.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   Father?\n\n     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON\n\n     The walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints.\n     Bleeker whispers to Somerset beside a windowless door.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   There was a small orphanage attached to\n                   the church, overseen by Father Stone.\n                   This was almost thirty years ago.\n                           (hesitant)\n                   He was an excellent priest, devoted in\n                   every way.  Many in his parish demanded\n                   his return.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Tell me what happened.\n\n     Bleeker sees a NUN down the hall, coming towards them.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   Allegations were made... Stone was\n                   accused of abusing the children in his\n                   care.  But, those charges were never\n                   substantiated.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   What abuse?\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   It was claimed... that the children were\n                   beaten.  And, punished severely.\n\n     The nun is too close for Bleeker to speak freely.\n\n     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, STONE'S ROOM -- AFTERNOON\n\n     The door is unlocked and opened by the nun.  Somerset enters and\n     Bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door.  It's dark.\n\n     FATHER STONE, 73, is in a wheelchair.  Feeble and frail, eyes\n     sunken in their sockets.  He looks up at Somerset.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd\n                   like to ask you a few questions, if it's\n                   alright?\n\n     The whites of Stone's eyes have yellowed.  He seems to nod.\n     Somerset sits on a stool, close.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   I want to ask you about the seven deadly\n                   sins.\n\n                                 STONE\n                   The sins.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Yes, father.\n\n     Stone reaches out a hand to touch Somerset's face.  Stone's\n     extremely long fingernails trail against Somerset's cheek and\n     Somerset tries to hide his revulsion.\n\n                                 STONE\n                   Are you one of mine?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I don't...\n\n                                 STONE\n                   Are you saved?  Do you have God?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I... I need to ask about the sins.  Do\n                   you understand what I'm saying?\n\n     Stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry.\n\n                                 STONE\n                   Are you a sinner?\n\n     Stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner.\n\n                                 STONE (CONT)\n                   There are sinners here.  Even here.\n                   And, pain waits for them.  Hell is\n                   hungry for them.\n\n     Stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented.\n\n                                 STONE (CONT)\n                   They don't realize... they don't know.\n                           (pause)\n                   Fuck them all!\n\n     Somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of Stone's jagged\n     voice.  The nun goes to place a comforting hand on Stone's\n     shoulder.  Stone is beginning to cry.\n\n                                 NUN\n                           (to Somerset)\n                   They shouldn't have let you disturb him.\n                   This shouldn't have been allowed.\n\n                                 STONE\n                   Where are the children?\n                           (much louder)\n                   Where are the children?!\n\n\n     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, OUTSIDE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON\n\n     From a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look THROUGH a\n     big WINDOW into the head librarian's office.  The elderly head\n     librarian is at a computer, chain-smoking, working the keyboard.\n     Mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off\n     his pad to the librarian.\n\n     We cannot hear them, but it's clear Mills is excited as he walks\n     back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her\n     computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a\n     dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper\n     onto the floor.  Back and forth goes Mills, carrying the phone.\n     He closes the pad, puts it in his pocket.\n\n     The librarian finishes typing, sits back, done.  Mills hangs up\n     the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord\n     drags, knocks a pile of books off a table.\n\n     The librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books.  Mills is\n     apologizing.  He goes to watch the printer.  He tears the last\n     sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper\n     off the floor.\n\n     Prize in hand, Mills is so grateful he bends to give the old\n     woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even\n     more annoyed.  Mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of\n     books.  Before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the\n     door.  Mills obeys like a scolded child, exits.\n\n     The librarian shakes her head in disgust.\n\n\n     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- AFTERNOON\n\n     A once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected.  Gothic in\n     style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of\n     rubble as neighbors.  Smokestacks spew smoke distantly.  Cars\n     and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here\n     on the street it's a ghost town.\n\n     There's a building attached to the rear of the church.\n     Somerset's car is parked beside it.\n\n     INT.  ABANDONED ORPHANAGE, CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON\n\n     The windows are covered over.  Somerset and Father Bleeker move\n     through.  Somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam.  The room\n     is empty except for broken, cob-web covered school desks and a\n     few file cabinets.  There are cracked blackboards on the walls.\n     Rats skitter away from the light.\n\n     Somerset opens a file cabinet drawer.  It's empty.  He walks to\n     a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   What are you looking for?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I'm just looking.\n\n     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- AFTERNOON\n\n     Somerset pushes the door.  He and Bleeker enter from the\n     classroom into the far back corner of the church.  Big church.\n     Shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces\n     of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows.\n\n     Somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews.\n     rats run.  Pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings.\n\n     Somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren\n     altar.  To the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a\n     stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming.\n\n     The life-size saint is covered in spider-webs.  Tiny spiders\n     crawl across his eyes, which look down on Somerset.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   Saint Jerome Emiliani.  The patron saint\n                   of orphans.\n\n     Somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall,\n     revealing a wooden carving of Christ crucified.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Is this still the Lord's house?\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   Of course it is.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   And, even if Father Stone was guilty of\n                   everything... if he was hurting children\n                   here?  It's still the Lord's house?\n\n     Father Bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive.\n\n                                 BLEEKER\n                   You have no faith, Somerset?  Have you\n                   given up on the church entirely?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   No.\n                           (pause)\n                   That's not what I've given up on.\n\n     Somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the\n     ceiling above the center of the altar.  He looks up, following\n     the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else.\n     His mouth drops.  Bleeker looks, and is equally horrified.\n\n     Above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on\n     panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the\n     altar.  Seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins.\n\n     The beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a\n     painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around\n     him.  The man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder.\n     The chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow.\n\n     The third in the series is sloth.  The painting, in indigo,\n     shows a man at rest in a pliant bed.  The skeletal man's eyes\n     are rolled up in their sockets.  He is covered in slimy worms.\n\n\n     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     The streets are full of patrol cars.  Cops and forensics enter\n     and exit the church from various doorways.  Saw-horses are\n     loaded off a flat-bed truck as a police barricade is erected.\n\n     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Much activity, as forensics with flashlights go about their\n     business, checking every nook and cranny of the church, looking\n     for any sign that someone's been here recently.  Small temporary\n     floodlights are hoisted on tripods.\n\n     Two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders.  Flash-\n     photo after flash-photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau.\n\n     Near the open church doors, Mills speaks with great animation,\n     holding his ream of computer paper.  Somerset looks at the altar\n     and the tableau, preoccupied.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Our guy's a bookworm, right?  And, I\n                   know it's a long shot, but you have to\n                   give a picture id and current phone bill\n                   to get a library card.  Hey...\n\n     Mills snaps his fingers in Somerset's face, gets his attention.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   I made two separate lists of books.  One\n                   relating to the sins... Dante's\n                   Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... The\n                   Dictionary of Catholicism... all the\n                   religious stuff.  The second list was\n                   books about torture methods, mass\n                   murderers... sadomasochism.  Whatever\n                   our killer might study to do the things\n                   he's done.  Whatever his other interests\n                   are.\n\n     Somerset takes the computer list.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   So, what is this?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Alright.  Everything at the library goes\n                   into a computer.  So, you can get in the\n                   system and cross-reference...\n\n     Mills fumbles in his pocket, takes out his pad and reads.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory,\n                   call number eight-five-one-D, and... The\n                   Biography of the Marquis de Sade,\n                   ninety-two S-A-D-E.  Put those books in\n                   the system, and the computer can give\n                   you the name of anyone who's ever taken\n                   out both those books.  And, it doesn't\n                   just give you their name and address, it\n                   gives you a complete history of their\n                   library reading habits.\n\n     Mills slaps the list in Somerset's hand.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                           (psyched up)\n                   If somebody's out there reading Paradise\n                   Lost and studying The Life and Times of\n                   Charlie Manson, I want to talk to them.\n\n     Somerset looks up from the list, warming to it.  He starts\n     looking around, searching for someone.\n\n     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs.  Somerset's still\n     searching, holding the list.  He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Dario!  Come here.\n\n     Dario runs up.  Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes\n     him walk with him.  Mills continues on to his car.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   According to the Father, this orphanage\n                   wasn't around for more than five or six\n                   years in the late fifties.  So, I want\n                   someone to go to the Department of Child\n                   Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the\n                   records on this place.  Understand?\n\n                                 DARIO\n                   I got it.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Get a list of every child who attended\n                   this orphanage before it shut down.  Get\n                   it on my desk within the hour.\n\n     Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey.  Somerset goes to his\n     own car.  Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine.\n     Somerset hands the computer list through the window.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   You thought of this all by yourself?\n                   This was your brainstorm?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to\n                   believe?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   It's a pleasant surprise.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I'm not as stupid as I look.\n\n     Mills peels away.  Somerset heads to his own car.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (to himself)\n                   I guess not.\n\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING\n\n     Seven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall:\n\n     The seven tableau paintings.  Gluttony, greed and sloth,\n     followed by vanity.  Vanity shows a woman standing in front of a\n     mirror, staring at her image.  The floor around her is scattered\n     with flowers.  The primary color is violet, and as in all the\n     paintings, there is a quality of ugliness in the character.\n\n                                 MILLS (O.S.)\n                   Ramirez.  Manuel Ramirez.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)\n                   No... I don't see any Ramirez.\n\n     The lust painting is next.  It shows a man standing over a\n     woman.  The woman is nude, under a sheet, and the man's features\n     are bizarre, lecherous.  He wants that woman.  There are apples\n     on the floor and on the bed.  The color is red.\n\n                                 MILLS (O.S.)\n                   Elinski.  Dennis Elinski.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)\n                   No.\n\n     Envy is particularly gruesome.  The Devil is seen hovering in\n     the air, wearing a crown, his body orange and slick, wrapped in\n     a cloak of flames.  His arms held high, his right hand grips a\n     sword, a bolt of lightning, arrows, wheat, thistles, etc.  His\n     left hand, holds a plain globe around which a serpent has\n     wrapped itself.  He looks down at several pitiful mortals in a\n     pit of fire.  The mortals reach for him, yearn for him, the skin\n     on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones.\n\n                                 MILLS (O.S.)\n                   Atwater?  Paul Atwater.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)\n                   No.\n\n     Wrath shows a man surrounded by vaporous, satanic demons.  He\n     stands in a puddle of blood, looking at his hands stained with\n     and dripping blood.  Other than the rich red, the color is blue.\n\n     Mills is at his desk, a good portion of the print-out list\n     draped to the floor.  He rubs his eyes, sighing, gets back to\n     it.  Somerset, at the temporary desk, studies his orphan list.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Okay, here we go.

Let me have it.\n\n     Mills looks at the page... searching...\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Fuck... he used a false name.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   How do you know?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   His library card lists him as Jonathan\n                   Doe.  John Doe.\n\n     Mills sits back, angry.  Something strikes Somerset as odd.\n     Familiar.  He starts leafing quickly through the orphanage list.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   What?\n\n     Somerset finds what he's looking for.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Christ... it's like a sick joke.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   What are you talking about?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   There is one boy here.  He was\n                   abandoned... no one knew who his\n                   parents were, so he was named at the\n                   orphanage...\n                           (looks at Mills)\n                   John Doe.  It's his legal name.\n\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- EARLY EVENING\n\n     Somerset and Mills climb stairs, turn a corner into this hall.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It's impossible odds that this is him.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   We're focusing.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I know, I know.  On one little thing.\n                   I'm not complaining.  I'll follow\n                   anything we get and I'll take it any way\n                   we can get it.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   We'll look at him.  Ask a few questions.\n                   Try to get a feeling whether we should\n                   keep tabs on him.\n\n     They reach a door, apartment 3A.  Somerset knocks.  Mills takes\n     out his gun and looks at Somerset to ask \"what do you think?\"\n     Somerset nods that he should have the gun ready.  Mills steps to\n     the side of the door, knocks hard.  Waits.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (quietly)\n                   I'll do the talking, right?  Let me\n                   practice here... um, excuse me Mr. Doe,\n                   but, are you by any chance a serial\n                   killer?  Oh... oh, you are?  Well, come\n                   with us then, if you don't mind.\n\n     Mills smiles at his own wit.  A STAIR is HEARD CREAKING\n     offscreen.  Mills turns to look towards the stairs.\n\n     A MALE FIGURE stands at the top of the stairs, wearing a hat,\n     standing in shadows.  The man looks at them, lets out a scream\n     of horror and reaches into his coat.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Somerset!\n\n     GUNFIRE SOUNDS and a bullet slams into door 3A behind Mills.  He\n     and Somerset recoil in shock, going to the floor as another\n     bullet explodes, blasting plaster off the wall.  The man is\n     HEARD RUNNING back down the stairs.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   It's him!  Jesus Christ, we can get this\n                   fucker!\n\n     Mills jumps up.  He moves towards the railing.  Somerset sits up\n     and takes out his own gun.  The stairwell is silent.\n\n     Mills peers over the railing into the stairwell's center, gun\n     pointed.  A HEAVY METALLIC CLICK is HEARD.  Echoes.  Mills leaps\n     backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by\n     the SOUND of an UZI SUB-MACHINE GUN FIRING.\n\n     Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing,\n     which is being shredded along with the floor around it.  Bullets\n     soar unceasingly.  Mills and Somerset hold their hands over\n     their ears.  Pieces of wood and plaster fly everywhere.  The uzi\n     stops and the man can be HEARD RUNNING again.\n\n     Mills gets up, covered in debris.  He runs down into the smoky\n     stairwell.  Somerset rolls over, gets up more slowly.\n\n     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, REAR -- EARLY EVENING\n\n     Mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard.  He sees\n     a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks\n     all directions.  His eyes are wild.  His gun hand is shaking.\n\n     The courtyard is surrounded by alleyways.  The shooter could\n     have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight.  Somerset comes out,\n     face wet with sweat.  Mills holsters his gun.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Are you alright?  Are you okay?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Yeah.  I think so.\n\n     They look at each other for a long time.  Both realizing they\n     came very close to dying.\n\n     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, FRONT -- NIGHT\n\n     Police cars on scene.  Curious civilians have gathered.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT\n\n     UP THE STAIRWELL, several forensics are collecting shell\n     casings, putting them in bags.  The casings are scattered all\n     the way up the stairs.  ONE FORENSIC walks up beside a COP.\n\n                                 ONE FORENSIC\n                   I hear he's running around with an uzi\n                   in one hand and a book of poetry in the\n                   other.\n\n                                 COP\n                   A real, modern-day renaissance man, huh?\n\n     AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, two forensics, SARAH and BILLY, wait\n     behind Mills and Somerset.  Surgical gloves on all hands.  Mills\n     kicks at the door to apartment 3A with all his might.  Again.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOMONE -- NIGHT\n\n     BOOM -- door flies open.  Mills enters with Somerset.  Darkness.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (to forensics)\n                   Give us first crack at it.\n\n     Sarah and Billy wait in the hall.  Somerset hits a switch on the\n     wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk.  The desk is in the\n     center of the room, facing them.  The walls, floor to ceiling,\n     are covered with visual stimuli; pictures, paintings, newspaper\n     articles, sketches, writings on napkins and notebook sheets,\n     etc.  Mostly religious images.\n\n     The far wall is made of shelves full of books.  Mills goes to\n     the desk while Somerset goes to the books.  Books: An Overview\n     of Theology, Handbook of Firearms, A History of the World, Summa\n     Theologica, U.S. Criminal Law Review, etc.\n\n     Mills looks at the desktop.  The surface is marked by dried oil\n     colors.  There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water\n     colors and pastels.  Mills looks at one corner of the desk.  An\n     orange candle has been allowed to burn down.  The wax trail goes\n     all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor.\n\n     Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups.  There are\n     articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books,\n     pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven\n     paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders.  Somerset\n     lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so\n     tightly and completely that they cover the window.\n\n     At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer.  It's empty\n     except for The Holy Bible.  he opens another drawer, which is\n     filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles.\n\n     Somerset looks at a door which is papered over by all the\n     newspaper articles and photographs about the seven deadly sin\n     murders.  He opens the door --\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset enters.  The ceiling light is on.  There are\n     bookshelves on each wall, filled with thousands of notebooks.\n\n     Somerset takes one notebook down.  It is a thick composition\n     book with a marbled black and white cover.  Inside, the pages\n     are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings.\n\n     Somerset takes down another notebook and opens it.  Same as the\n     first; scribbled sentences and sketches.\n\n     He walks to another wall, pulls another notebook.  Same deal.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Jesus Christ.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills opens a final drawer to find a rosary and a revolver.\n\n     He looks around, nervous and excited, being in the murderer's\n     lair.  He goes to a closed door across the room, notices John\n     Doe's bed in the corner.  Sees Doe has a cross nailed to the\n     ceiling directly above the bed's pillow.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills enters the bathroom.  It has been converted into a\n     darkroom, lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the\n     ceiling.  WATER is HEARD DRIPPING.\n\n     Mills opens the shower curtain.  Prints hang drying, clipped to\n     wires over the tub.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, THE PAINTROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset enters from the room of notebooks.  This is John Doe's\n     art studio.  Windowless, with several easels holding paintings\n     in various states of completion.  The walls are covered with\n     photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank\n     white.  Somerset turns the lights off.\n\n     There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank\n     wall.  Somerset turns the projector on.  It clatters to life,\n     running a piece of film.\n\n     The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the\n     wall, light strobing across him.\n\n     The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange,\n     superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily.  It's\n     like an old, Hollywood version of heaven.\n\n     The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring\n     around a pit of molten goo.  Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece\n     of film from Hollywood's early days.\n\n     Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel.  The\n     painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled\n     brush strokes.  It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark.\n     The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts.\n     Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging.  Buildings\n     are burning, blood is being spilled.  It's dense with detail.\n\n     Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop\n     cloth.  He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas.  We do not\n     see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim.\n\n                                 MILLS (O.S.)\n                   Somerset!\n\n     Mills enters, tormented, weary.  He stands in the projector's\n     bright beam, holds an 8\" by 10\" print.\n\n                                 MILLS (O.S.)\n                   Somerset, we had him.  Goddamn it.\n\n     He hands a press pass and the photo to Somerset.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   The pass is a fake... we had him.\n\n     Somerset looks at the photo, a picture of Mills and Somerset on\n     the stairwell of the slum apartment building; the picture John\n     took when he posed as a reporter.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   We were that close to him.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I know.\n\n     Somerset motions to the huge canvas.  Mills looks:\n\n     The painting is frightening collage, thick with paint.  The\n     photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and\n     pieces.  Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces.  The\n     faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated.  Grainy eyes with\n     holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken\n     arms.  Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa.  It's\n     like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT\n\n     A block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses.  Stray, wild dogs\n     roam in a pack.  A car turns down this street.  It's John Doe's\n     car, moving fast.  Its headlights go out and it cruises,\n     avoiding garbage cans in the street.\n\n     FOLLOW the dark car.  Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the\n     only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and\n     blues of police activity.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT\n\n     John Doe brings the car to a stop.  He watches the police at\n     work around the abandoned church.  He gives no discernable\n     reaction, puts the car in reverse.  He looks behind as he drives\n     back the way he came.\n\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n     The refrigerator door is open.  A male forensic uses tongs to\n     remove Zero's severed hand from behind soda cans and mayonnaise.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT\n\n     The forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag,\n     past a FEMALE SKETCH ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on a\n     fairly accurate drawing of the balding John Doe.\n\n                                 SKETCH ARTIST\n                   This is the guy?\n\n     Mills stands over the artist.  Sarah, Billy and two deputy\n     detectives are at work in the room, photographing, searching.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Make sure it gets around.\n\n                                 SKETCH ARTIST\n                   You got it.  Tomorrow morning, this\n                   city's good citizens will be on the\n                   lookout for Elmer Fudd.\n\n                                 SARAH\n                           (to Mills)\n                   We can't find anything to hang onto.  No\n                   pay-stubs, no appointment books or\n                   calendars.  Not even a book of phone\n                   numbers.  And, you're not going to\n                   believe this...\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Keep looking.\n\n                                 SARA\n                   It's just... we haven't found any\n                   fingerprints yet.  Not one.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You know, you're right.  I don't believe\n                   it.  Keep looking.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset reads one of Doe's notebooks.  Three cops are looking\n     through other notebooks from the shelves.  Mills enters.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   We need to put more men on this.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I'm working on it, alright.  What have\n                   we got.\n\n     Somerset bristles slightly at Mills' abrupt demeanor.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   We've got about five thousand notebooks\n                   in this room.  And, as near as I can\n                   tell, each notebook contains two hundred\n                   and fifty pages.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Then, he must write about the murders.\n\n     Somerset looks at the notebook, reads.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   \"What sick, silly puppets we are, and\n                   what a gross stage we dance on.  What\n                   fun we have, dancing around, not a care\n                   in the world.  Not knowing that we are\n                   nothing.  We are not what God intended.\"\n                           (turns pages)\n                   \"On the subway today, a man came up to\n                   start a conversation.  He was making\n                   small talk, this lonely man, talking\n                   about the weather and other things.  I\n                   tried to be accommodating, but my head\n                   began to hurt from his banality.  I\n                   almost didn't notice it had happened,\n                   but I threw up all over him.  And I\n                   couldn't stop myself from laughing.\"\n                           (closes book)\n                   No dates indicated.  They're placed on\n                   the shelves in no discernible order.  He\n                   describes a scab on his arm for five\n                   pages, then writes about existential\n                   philosophy on the next.\n\n     Mills walks.  He looks into the adjoining paint room.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   It's just his mind poured out on paper.\n\n     Mills leans in the doorway, looking at Doe's strange artworks.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You were right.  He is preaching.\n\n     The PHONE RINGS in the other room.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     All attention is focused on the phone on Doe's desk.  A tape\n     recorder is rigged to the receiver.  Mills and Somerset enter.\n     Mills walks over, pushes a button on the recorder, picks up.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (into phone)\n                   Hello... hello?\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)\n                           (from recorder)\n                   I admire you, David.  Imagine my\n                   surprise on finding you at my doorstep.\n                   I admire you more and more every day.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (into phone)\n                   Okay, John.  Let's...\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)\n                           (from recorder)\n                   No, no, no!  You listen and don't talk.\n                   I suppose you found the painting and the\n                   photos.  This is just as well.  Now we\n                   all know we've all seen each other.\n                           (pause)\n                   I mean what I say.  I do admire you.\n\n     Long pause.  Mills waits.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.,CONT)\n                   Oh, there is one other thing.  Fourteen\n                   hundred thirty.  West Eighty-sixth\n                   street.  Apartment six-o-four.\n\n     John Doe hangs up.\n\n\n     INT.  APARTMENT 604, BATHROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom.\n\n     In the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a\n     hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle\n     of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor.\n\n     Somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub.  The tub and\n     shower walls are splattered with blood.  The tub has a few\n     inches of water in it.  The water is cloudy red and bits of\n     gauze float in it.  Somerset jiggles the drain's knob.\n\n     Some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.\n\n     INT.  APARTMENT 604 -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills is in a dark mood.  He and Dr. O'Neill stand by a WOMAN\n     who hangs by a noose from the ceiling.  The woman's head has\n     been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape.  Her eyes have\n     been left uncovered.  The gauze is stained red in small spots.\n\n     The woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where\n     piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay.  There's a\n     chair knocked over behind her.\n\n     O'Neill's going through his black bag.  A violet, velvet curtain\n     has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length\n     mirror.  The mirror reflects the corpse.  A seven-pointed star\n     is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words I\n     DID NOT KILL HER, SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE below.\n\n     Somerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Pride.  Just like in the painting.\n\n     Somerset nods.  He walks to a dresser.  The woman's purse sits\n     open and Somerset extracts her driver's license.  He looks at\n     the photo.  The woman in the picture is beautiful.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You can see what he did.\n\n     O'Neill steps up to the woman.  He brandishes dull scissors.\n     The captain enters with two uniform cops.  He looks around,\n     grim, clenching his jaw.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Cut her up... dressed the wounds.  He\n                   put the noose around her neck and stood\n                   her on the chair.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   She had the telephone.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Call for help, and you'll live.  But,\n                   you'll be mutilated.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Or, kick out the chair, and spare\n                   yourself a lifetime of hideousness.\n\n     O'Neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face.  He pulls\n     them away in front.  Mills looks, disgusted by the sight.\n\n     Somerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair.\n\n                                 O'NEILL\n                   He cut off her nose to spite her face.\n                   And he did it very recently.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   Alright, boys, you're running on empty.\n                   Go home.  Just make sure you sleep with\n                   the phone between your knees.\n\n\n     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- NIGHT\n\n     The bookstore is a labyrinth.  Tables and shelves, mountains and\n     valleys of books.  Books, new and used, hard and soft, in\n     disorganized groups.  CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS.  A few customers\n     search for titles.\n\n     Somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another.\n     he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the\n     books as he goes.  He pulls one book, The Merchant of Venice,\n     looks at it, replaces it.  He looks down the aisle and is\n     surprised to see Tracy.\n\n     Tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines.  Somerset approaches.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Tracy?\n\n     Tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Somerset.

I almost should have\n                   expected to run into you here, knowing\n                   that you teach English.\n\n     Tracy looks up and around.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   It's so huge.  It's amazing.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   This is why I moved into this\n                   neighborhood.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Don't you love the smell of all the old\n                   books.  It smells like... like... I\n                   guess just old books, but, I love it.\n\n     Somerset notices Tracy noticing his gun.\n\n                                 TRACY (CONT)\n                   Forgive me.  No matter how often I see\n                   guns, I can't get used to them.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Same here.\n\n     Tracy laughs.  She looks at her watch.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   If David's going to be back home soon, I\n                   should get back.\n\n     She starts down the aisle and Somerset walks with her.\n\n                                 TRACY (CONT)\n                   I hope you'll come to dinner another\n                   night.  Before you leave.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You can stay and browse a little longer,\n                   can't you?  I mean...\n\n     Tracy considers this as they enter an open area.\n\n                                  SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   I... I hardly know anyone I can talk\n                   about books with anymore.  I'd\n                   appreciate the company.\n\n     Tracy stops.  Somerset looks hopeful.  Tracy is very tempted.\n\n     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- LATER NIGHT\n\n     Shelves and empty aisles of books.  CLASSICAL MUSIC still PLAYS.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)\n                   The irony is, that after a day of the\n                   type of work he did, he'd come home and\n                   read me these morbid crime stories.

It\n                   traced the history of detection as a\n                   science and it sealed my fate.  Because\n                   it was real, and that a drop of blood or\n                   a piece of hair could solve a crime...\n                   was incredible to me.\n\n     A CLERK looks down the aisle, then walks on.\n\n                                 CLERK (O.S.)\n                   We're closing up, Somerset.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Okay, thanks.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   David's going to wonder where I am.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I'll give you a ride.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   No.  Please, don't bother.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I have to insist.  If your husband found\n                   out I let you ride the subway at this\n                   hour he'd tear my head off.\n\n     They make their way out of the aisle.  Somerset chuckles.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   I mean, literally.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset's car stops at the corner of Mills' street.\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset puts the car in park.

But now...\n                           (pause)\n                   I hate it here.  I feel scared, and I\n                   feel sick and...

But, keep in mind, Tracy,\n                   like tonight, there are small pockets of\n                   sanity.  Some bars and bookstores.\n                   Museums.  Several last vestiges of\n                   civilization.\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT\n\n     In Somerset's car, Tracy and Somerset continue talking.\n\n     On the other side of the street, closer to the middle of the\n     block, John Doe's car is parallel parked at the curb.\n\n     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT\n\n     Behind the wheel, John Doe is slumped low, calmly watching\n     Somerset and Tracy.  He can see them clearly from here.\n\n     INT.

They kiss.  They kiss a\n     long time.  Tracy wraps her arms around Somerset's neck.\n     Somerset runs his fingers through Tracy's hair.  They share\n     their sorrow.  Tracy's tears run down her face.  Finally, they\n     part, opening their eyes.\n\n     They know this is wrong.  Somerset's hands are shaking.

I better go.\n\n     Tracy gets out, neglects to close the door, not looking back.\n\n     Somerset tries to come to his senses.  He doesn't understand\n     either, and his heart is aching.  He adjusts the rearview mirror\n     to watch Tracy go.\n\n     INSERT -- THROUGH REARVIEW MIRROR -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V.\n\n     Tracy walks down the block, straightening her hair.

Rapid eye movement.\n\n     A SOUND is HEARD from the other room.  Mills awakens.  He lays\n     still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun\n     off the bedside table.  He grabs his pants from a chair, slides\n     into them.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up.\n     He moves, crouching.\n\n     In the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form\n     complex, confusing patterns.\n\n     Mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent.\n     He aims the gun from point to point as he advances.\n\n     He gets to a closet.  Staying on one side, he opens the door and\n     points his gun.  He carefully separates the clothing hanging\n     there.  Nothing.  No one.\n\n     He turns to look over the room.  It's the first time we see it\n     in Mills' eyes -- real fear.\n\n     The door to the apartment is wide open.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills moves from his apartment, gun out, into the dark hallway.\n     The coast is clear.  He stays low, moves down the hall.  He\n     stops, looks up.\n\n     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills shoves the rooftop door open.  It creaks as it swings.\n\n     Mills moves out, backwards, looking to top the raised rooftop\n     entrance, covering it with his gun.  He moves around, sees\n     nothing, walks to the edge of the roof and looks over.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up.  He\n     looks at Tracy asleep in the bed.  The room begins to RATTLE a\n     little as a subway train is again passing underground.\n\n     He walks to the window and checks the lock.  He halts.  He opens\n     the window and reaches out.  The rattling is a bit LOUDER.\n\n     From the fire escape, he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles\n     wrapped with a rubber band.  Mills realizes, Doe was here.\n\n\n     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n     The room is plain, like the room Mrs. Gold was kept in.  The\n     door opens and Tracy and Mills enter.  They look sleepy,\n     carrying suitcases.  A uniformed cop closes the door for them.\n\n     Mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while Tracy looks\n     around, depressed, distant.  The lighting is bad.  There are no\n     decorations, no windows.  A wide crack runs down one wall.\n\n     Tracy sits down on the bed.  Mills notices her discontent.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It won't be for long, honey.  I swear.\n                   This is just till this is over.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   I know.\n\n     Mills goes to sit beside her.  He puts his hand on her shoulder.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I'm sorry.\n\n     Tracy nods.  She stands, goes to start turning down the covers.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   I know.  It can't be helped.\n\n     Mills feels useless, powerless.  He goes to the suitcase and\n     starts unpacking the contents.  Tracy continues turning down the\n     sheets.\n\n\n     INSERT -- TITLE CARD\n\n     SATURDAY\n\n     INT.

Mills is behind his own desk.  They both look like\n     they haven't gotten much sleep.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   There's two people in that painting.\n                   So, maybe he's planning to kill two\n                   people this time.  Maybe.\n\n     Mills looks at Somerset, who doesn't seem to be listening.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   What's wrong this morning?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Nothing.  Sorry.\n\n     Somerset looks up, sips from a cup of coffee, looks at the\n     photo.  Mills swings his chair, looks out the window at the\n     morning light on the billboard.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Lust is next.  Lust is sex.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Apples on the floor.

Fucking sex.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Lust is everywhere.  That's the hard\n                   part.  I think lust is the most\n                   prevalent sin, even more than greed.\n\n     Somerset looks at the burning tip of his cigarette.  He gets up\n     to stretch his legs.\n\n     Mills picks up the lust photo, puts his feet up on the desk.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Lust is red.\n\n     Long pause.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Bright red.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Blood red.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Red sky at night, sailor's delight.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Red blooded.

Somerset and Mills look at each other.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   That would make sense.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   It would be fitting.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You're damn right it would.\n\n     Mills picks up the phone.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREETS, PORNO DISTRICTS -- AFTERNOON\n\n     Porno theaters and Adult Bookstores rule these busy sidewalks.\n     Marquees offer SEXY STUFF, PUSSY FEST and movies like MIDNIGHT\n     PLOWBOY and NATIONAL LAM-PORN'S CHRISTMAS INSERTION.  Cops are\n     walking through the pedestrian flow, handing out photocopies.\n     There are many patrol cars on the street.  Definitely a larger\n     than usual police presence.\n\n     Cops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of\n     their shops and theaters.\n\n     Cops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts.  These photocopies\n     are warnings, with the drawing of John Doe's face above a line\n     of information and the words HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?\n\n\n     INT.  WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOPPE -- AFTERNOON\n\n     Somerset's holding up the composite sketch of John Doe.\n\n                                 WILD BILL (O.S.)\n                   Yeah, he was here.  This morning.\n\n     Mills and Somerset are across the sales counter from WILD BILL,\n     37.  Wild Bill is shirtless, covered in tattoos.  A thick scar\n     runs down his forehead to his bent nose.  Leather belts, whips\n     and jackets hang from the walls.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   It was definitely him?  You're positive?\n\n                                 WILD BILL\n                   Yeah.  John Doe.  Easy name to remember.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   What was this job you did for him?\n\n     Wild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it.\n\n                                 WILD BILL\n                   I got a picture of it.  That's what he\n                   came for this morning.  I figured he\n                   must be one of those art guys... like\n                   those guys who piss in a cup and drink\n                   it on stage.  Performance art.\n\n     Wild Bill gives a polaroid to Mills.  We don't see the image.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Oh, fuck...\n\n                                 WILD BILL\n                   I think I undercharged him.  I was up\n                   all night working to finish it.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (looks at photo)\n                   You built this for him?  You built this?\n\n                                 WILD BILL\n                   I've built weirder shit than that.\n\n     A BEEL CHIMES as a POLICEMAN enters the store.\n\n                                 POLICEMAN\n                   Somerset... we have a situation.\n\n     Mills and Somerset follow the policeman out.\n\n                                 WILD BILL\n                   Hey, my picture!\n\n     They're gone.  Wild Bill scratches his scar.\n\n                                 WILD BILL (CONT)\n                   Fucking pigs.\n\n\n     EXT.  THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOR -- AFTERNOON\n\n     It's a madhouse outside The Hot House.  Police action in\n     progress.  Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and\n     creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van.  Cops and\n     detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the\n     large vehicle.  The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society,\n     is angry.  Some spit and throw trash at the cops.\n\n     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA -- AFTERNOON\n\n     An ANGRY COP pounds his nightstick on a glass cage.  Inside the\n     cage sits an oily FAT MAN in front of a wall of sex toys.\n\n                                 FAT MAN\n                   Just wait!\n\n                                 COP\n                   Get out of the fucking booth!\n\n                                 FAT MAN\n                   Just wait!  I'll come out, just wait!\n\n     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS -- AFTERNOON\n\n     All the lights and walls are red.  Mills and Somerset follow a\n     COP through the twisting corridors.  ROCK MUSIC THROBS.  They\n     reach a door.\n\n                                 COP\n                   I don't want to go in there again.\n\n     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RED ROOM -- AFTERNOON\n\n     Mills and Somerset enter.  ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD.  A strobe\n     light flashes from the ceiling onto TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS.\n     The first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse\n     of a WOMAN with long blonde hair.  The second attendant tries to\n     examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who sits naked on the\n     floor, wrapped in a sheet.  A COP holds the crazed man down.\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN\n                   He... he... he made me do it!\n\n                                 SECOND ATTENDANT\n                   I have to look at you.  I have to look\n                   at you.\n\n     An X is scratched into the red paint on the wall.  Mills and\n     Somerset move towards the covered body.\n\n     There are apples on the bed and floor.  The ROCK MUSIC from\n     outside SUDDENLY STOPS.\n\n                                 FIRST ATTENDANT\n                   You're not going to want to see this\n                   more than once.\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN\n                   He had a gun!  He... he made me do it!\n\n     The sheet is lifted for the detectives.  They grimace at what\n     they see.  We do not see.  Somerset closes his eyes and walks to\n     face a wall, shaken.  The first attendant replaces the sheet.\n\n     Mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it.\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN (O.S.,CONT)\n                   He made me do it!\n\n\n     INT.  SANATORIUM, WHITE ROOM -- AFTERNOON\n\n     A polaroid is on a white table.  It is the photo Wild Bill gave\n     to Mills and Somerset.  It is a picture of a belt, made with\n     extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the\n     groin.  It is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic\n     protuberance.  Instead, there is a metal knife.  It is a strap-\n     on butcher's knife.\n\n     Somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room.\n     Mills stands behind him.  The crazed man from the lust murder is\n     in a chair across the room.  The crazed man is crying.\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN\n                   And... and... and he said... he asked if\n                   I was married.  And, I could see he had\n                   a gun in his hand.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Where was the girl?\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN\n                   What?  What?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Where was the prostitute?\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN\n                   She was... she was on the bed.  She was\n                   just sitting on the bed.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Who tied her down?  You or him?\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN\n                   He had a gun.  He had a gun, and he made\n                   it happen.  He made me do it!\n                   He made me put it on... that thing.  Oh,\n                   God... he made me wear it.  He had the\n                   gun in my mouth.\n\n     The man slides off the chair and hides his face in his hands.\n\n                                 CRAZED MAN (CONT)\n                   The gun was in my throat.\n\n     Mills looks at the mirror in the room.\n\n     Somerset stands, picks up the Polaroid as two men in white\n     uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from off the floor.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING\n\n     Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, seated at their desks.\n     Somerset is looking out the window.  Mills stares at the wall.\n\n     Somerset looks to his temporary desk.  He picks up a small pile\n     of mail, sorts through it.  An 8\" by 10\" manila envelope\n     interests him.  It reads DETECTIVE SOMERSET on the outside,\n     handwritten in red marker.  He opens it.\n\n     He takes out a grainy photograph of he and Tracy kissing in his\n     car.  It's obviously been taken with a special night-lens.\n\n     Somerset goes pale, suppressing a gasp.  He holds the photo to\n     hide it from Mills, looks to see Mills has not noticed.  He\n     feels panicky, crumples the photo and envelope in his hand.\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset enters, latches the door.  He takes the crushed photo\n     and envelope from his pocket.  He quickly checks under the\n     stalls to see he is alone.  He opens a window, goes to the sink.\n\n     He takes out his cigarette lighter, lights the envelope and\n     photo, watches them catch.  Once they're burning steady he\n     throws them in the sink.\n\n     He backs away, leans against the wall, watching, feeling sick.\n\n\n     INT.  SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset and Mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them.\n     The JUKEBOX plays QUIETLY for other customers.  The walls of the\n     bar are lined with trophies, ribbons and other victory symbols.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   There's not going to be a happy ending.\n                   It's not possible.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   If we get him, I'll be happy enough.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's\n                   good guys against the bad guys in this\n                   city.\n\n     Mills drinks deep, pours more.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   How can you say that?  Especially after\n                   today?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You tell me... when you walk into an\n                   apartment, and a man has beaten his wife\n                   to death, or, a wife murdered her\n                   husband in cold blood... and you have to\n                   wash the blood off their children.  You\n                   put the killer in jail.

SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills comes quietly into the bedroom.  Tracy is asleep in the\n     bed.  Mills takes off his jacket, puts it down.  He sits on a\n     chair and unties one shoe, takes it off.  He looks at Tracy,\n     looks at her a long time.\n\n     He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed.  He\n     kisses Tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently.  He\n     is touched, saddened.  He kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms\n     under and around her.  He holds tight, kisses her again.

CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT\n\n     John Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes.\n     Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for\n     miles.  We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep.  We're\n     near the water.\n\n     Doe seems to know where he's going.  He passes stacks of\n     industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky.\n\n     He walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed\n     bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.  It's like a\n     stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs.\n\n     At the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow\n     alleyway formed by two warehouses.  Doe enters, looking up at\n     the single lit bulb on the wall above.\n\n     He looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap,\n     walks under the bulb.  He throws the hubcap with all his might.\n     It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind.\n\n     Doe takes aim with the rock.  He throws, grunting.\n\n     The rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley.\n\n     Doe walks back to the mouth of the alley.  He stops and turns to\n     start from there.  He walks, deliberately, looking down at his\n     feet.    FOLLOW as he walks.\n\n     He stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the\n     ground in front of him again.  He takes off his thick glasses.\n\n     He holds the glasses in his hand.\n\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset is in bed.  The metronome is sounding: tick, tick,\n     tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD.\n\n     Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.  Tick,\n     tick, tick... A MAN and a WOMAN are HEARD SCREAMING at each\n     other incoherently from outside.  Somerset rolls over, restless. \n     Tick, tick, tick...\n\n     A THIRD VOICE is HEARD from outside.  This man is screaming at\n     the other two people to shut up.  Somerset opens his eyes, sits\n     up.  He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against\n     the wall.\n\n\n     INSERT -- TITLE CARD\n\n     SUNDAY\n\n     INT.

I don't\n                   know why I called you, except I can't\n                   stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I\n                   had to get it out... and I can't tell\n                   David yet.  Not yet.\n\n     Somerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and\n     puts them away.  He watches Tracy stir her coffee.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I... I had a relationship once, very\n                   much like a marriage.  And, there was a\n                   baby.  A long time ago.  Things were\n                   good.  And I got up one morning, and I\n                   went on a case... a murder, like any\n                   other.  Except it was my first since\n                   hearing about the baby.  And, I felt\n                   this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I\n                   looked around and I thought, how can I\n                   raise a child here?  So, that night, I\n                   told her I didn't want us to have\n                   children,  And, over the next few\n                   weeks...

But,\n                   there's never a day that goes by that I\n                   don't wish I had decided differently.\n\n     Tracy reaches to hold Somerset's hand, but he withdraws it,\n     wipes his tears away.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   If you... if you decide not to have the\n                   baby... if that's what you decide, then\n                   never tell Mills you were pregnant.\n                   I mean that.

Down the sidewalk, from a\n     distance, comes John Doe.  His brown workboots and clothing are\n     splattered with blood.\n\n     He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like\n     he's merely out for a walk on a Sunday afternoon.  People on the\n     sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him.\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, RECEIVING LOBBY/BOOKING -- DAY\n\n     Mills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of\n     handcuffed low-lifes.  The place is swimming with activity.\n\n     The two detectives head to a duty desk at the end of the room.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   As soon as this is over, I'll be gone.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   What a great big surprise that is.\n\n     They pass through a gate and Somerset goes to the staircase\n     leading to the second floor.  Mills stops at the duty desk.\n     Other cops are fighting for the DUTY SERGEANT'S attention.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Mills and Somerset are on the premises.\n\n                                 SERGEANT\n                   Wonder-fucking-ful.\n\n     Mills stops, looks.  Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs.\n\n     John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors.  He holds out\n     his arms as if to say \"presto, here I am.\"\n\n     Near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of\n     John Doe.\n\n     Mills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend.\n\n     One UNIFORMED COP takes out his gun, points it at John Doe.\n\n                                 UNIFORMED COP\n                   It's him!\n\n     Several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons.\n     Mills, still off-balance, walks back through the gate, takes his\n     gun out and points it at Doe.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Get down on the floor.\n\n     Somerset comes back down the stairs.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Be careful!\n\n     Cops move slowly in on Doe from all sides.\n\n                                 ANOTHER COP\n                   You heard him!  Get on the floor!\n\n     John Doe gets on his knees, hands up.  Mills moves close, but\n     not too.  ONE COP comes from behind, nudges Doe with his foot.\n\n                                 ONE COP\n                   Spread your legs and get your hands out\n                   in front of you.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Get down!  Face down!\n\n     John Doe gets on his stomach, obeys.  Mills comes right up to\n     Doe, steps on his neck, puts his gun against Doe's head.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   Don't move.  Don't move a fucking inch.\n\n     Cops frisk and handcuff Doe.  Somerset comes beside Mills.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I don't believe it.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   Hello, Lieutenant Somerset.\n\n                                 COP\n                   What the hell is this?\n\n     The cop putting the handcuffs on Doe holds up Doe's hands.  Doe\n     winces.  Every single one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped\n     around it.  John Doe looks up, his face pressed against the\n     floor, glasses askew, Mills' gun at his temple.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   I want to speak with my lawyer.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY\n\n     Mills, Somerset and the captain stand in darkness.\n\n     On the other side of a two-way mirror, John Doe is seated in a\n     restraining chair in an interrogation room.  His hands and legs\n     are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs.  A\n     strap hold tight around Doe's throat.  This is not some\n     superman/serial killer.  He looks more like an eccentric college\n     professor.  His lawyer MARK SWARR, 43, sits at a table, taking\n     notes.\n\n     Mills holds a fingerprint card.  The black ink prints are just\n     useless blobs with traces of blood in them.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   He cuts off the skin of his fingertips.\n                   That's why we can't find a single usable\n                   print in his apartment.  For a long\n                   time, he's been cutting before the\n                   papillary lines can grow back.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   What about the trace on his bank\n                   account?  The guns?\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   The orphanage is all we have.  His bank\n                   account is only five years old and it\n                   started as cash.  There's no credit\n                   history, no employment history.  We even\n                   tried to trace his furniture.  All we\n                   know for sure is he's wealthy, well\n                   educated and totally insane.  We may\n                   never know how he got that way.\n\n     Somerset stands looking in at Doe.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Because he is John Doe, by choice.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   When do we get to question him?\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   You don't.  This goes to court now.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   This doesn't make sense, captain.  He\n                   wouldn't just turn himself in!\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed\n                   to make sense.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   He's not finished!\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   You're wound way too tight on this,\n                   Mills.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Somerset... help me out here.\n\n     Somerset looks at them.  Says nothing.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   It's over.\n\n     The captain leaves.  Mills is furious.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Damn it, Somerset.  You know Johnny's\n                   fucking with us.  He's pissing in our\n                   faces again!\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Slow up.  You and I are, probably for\n                   the first time ever, in total agreement.\n                   He wouldn't just stop.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Well... what the fuck, man?\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   John Doe's only two murders away from\n                   finishing his masterpiece, right?  But,\n                   can you even conceive of what might\n                   happen next?  I mean, can you tell me\n                   how he's going to go about it?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                           (pause)\n                   No.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I can tell you this; I recognize his\n                   lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's\n                   the one who kept Zero out of prison.\n                           (pause)\n                   We'll wait for John Doe's plea.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\n     Mills is at the desk with his feet up, stares at the chalkboard:\n\n                    1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x)\n                    2 greed (x)          6 wrath\n                    3 sloth (x)          7 envy\n                    4 pride (x)\n\n     Clock on the wall says 4:45.  Somerset packs books into boxes,\n     preparing for his eventual departure.  The captain opens the\n     door and steps into the office.  He clears his throat, looking\n     like there is something very wrong.\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\n     Mills and Somerset stand together.  The captain is behind his\n     desk with the D.A., Martin Talbot, seated in front of him.  Mark\n     Swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control.\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   My client says there are two more\n                   bodies... two more dead, hidden away.\n                   He will take Detective Mills to these\n                   bodies, but only Detective Mills.  Only\n                   at six o'clock, today.\n\n     Swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief.\n\n                                 TALBOT\n                   Oh, Christ.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Why me?\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   He says he admires you.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (to captain)\n                   This is all part of his game plan.\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   Mr. Doe claims that if the detective\n                   does not accept this offer, the bodies\n                   will never be found.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let\n                   them rot.\n\n     Mills walks up into Swarr's face.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   You like what you do for a living?\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   Back off, Mills.\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   I'm required by law to serve my clients\n                   to the best of my ability, and to serve\n                   their interests.\n\n     Mills eases off.  Talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the\n     gold tooth in his mouth.  He looks at Swarr.\n\n                                 TALBOT\n                   We don't make deals like this.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   We're going to have to pass.\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   My client... he also wishes that I\n                   inform you, if you do not accept, he\n                   will plead insanity, across the board.\n\n                                 TALBOT\n                   Let him try.  I'd like to see him try!\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   Come now, Martin.  Even he knows, with\n                   the nature of these crimes, I could get\n                   him off with such a plea.\n\n     Talbot stands, wringing his hands.  Mills and Somerset are\n     looking at each other, thinking it over.\n\n                                 TALBOT\n                   I'm not letting this conviction slide.\n                   I can tell you that, right here and\n                   right now!\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   He says, if you accept, under his\n                   specific conditions, he will sign a full\n                   confession and plead guilty... right\n                   here, and right now.\n\n     Talbot looks at Swarr with hatred.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I'll do it.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Hold on... just a minute.\n\n     Somerset turns to Talbot.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   If he were to plead insanity... this\n                   conversation is admissible.  The fact\n                   that he's blackmailing us with his\n                   plea...\n\n                                 SWARR\n                   And, my client reminds you, two more\n                   people are dead.  The press would have a\n                   field day if they found out the police\n                   didn't seem too concerned about finding\n                   them... giving them proper burial.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I'll do it.  I want to finish it.\n\n     Somerset is thinking it through.  He looks at Mills.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (to captain)\n                   Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out\n                   of the room, and we can talk about how\n                   this whole thing's going to go down.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Mills' hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.  He's\n     shirtless, his chest covered in shaving cream.  He starts\n     shaving in front of a mirror.  Somerset is behind him, smoking.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   If John Doe's head splits open, and a\n                   U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have\n                   expected it.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I will.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I will.\n\n     Somerset flicks ash in the sink.  Mills finishes shaving.  He\n     steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                           (very serious)\n                   Listen, Somerset... we've been through a\n                   lot together.  And, I uh...\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   What is it?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I would like to make sweet love to you.\n\n     Somerset walks away.  Mills laughs.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Please...\n\n     As they leave.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Give me a kiss on the lips.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Give me a break.\n\n\n     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Mills has his shirt off.  A female technician, Josie, tapes a\n     radio transmitter and microphone to his chest.\n\n     Somerset sits nearby at one of the ready room desks.  He wears a\n     bullet-proof vest, is just finishing a check of his gun.  He's\n     putting the bullets back into it.\n\n     Josie finishes prepping Mills.  Mills presses the adhesive,\n     making sure it will hold.  He puts on a shirt and bullet-proof\n     vest, fastens the velcro.\n\n     Somerset stands, puts the gun in his hip holster.\n\n     Mills picks up his own gun, checks it, holsters it.  He watches\n     Somerset take out a roll of antacids.  Somerset pops a few.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Ready?\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Extremely.\n\n     They look at each other.  Mills holds out his hand.  They shake\n     on it.\n\n\n     INT.  CITY STREET, IN FRONT OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low.  On the\n     steps of the precinct house, a throng of reporters shifts\n     anxiously.  A line of policemen holds them back.  The precinct\n     doors open.  Martin Talbot arrives, escorted by cops.  The\n     press swarm lurches forward, flashbulbs explode.\n\n     Talbot holds out his hands, quieting them, about to speak.\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREET, AT BACK OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Mills' car pulls out of the fenced parking lot.  John Doe is\n     seated in the rear.\n\n     The car speeds up on the street, turns onto an avenue, heading\n     into a canyon formed by tall buildings.  At the corner, a car is\n     parked.\n\n     Somerset is at the wheel.  He pulls out, follows Mills' car.\n\n     EXT.  SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     California is dressed in full battle gear.  He looks through\n     binoculars at the city below.  The wind blows hard.\n\n     He turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad,\n     climbs in the side door.  The PILOT leans back from the cockpit\n     to hand him a helmet.  California dons it, starts strapping\n     himself in so he can lean out the open door.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   Is this wind going to hurt us?\n\n     The pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades\n     start to spin, churning the air.\n\n                                 PILOT\n                   Just makes the ride a little more fun.\n\n     California hefts a high-powered automatic rifle as the chopper\n     lifts from the pad and takes off.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Mills drives, looking to the back seat through the rearview\n     mirror.  A steel mesh partition separates front from back.\n\n     John Doe sits with his hands cuffed.  He is dressed in gray\n     pants and a gray shirt.  His feet are cuffed to a metal fastener\n     on the floor of the car.  Rivulets of sweat pour down his face.\n     He seems wired.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   What's your story, Johnny?  Who are you,\n                   really?\n\n     Doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at\n     Mills' eyes in the rearview mirror.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am\n                   means absolutely nothing.\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Somerset adjusts the volume on a radio receiver mounted on the\n     dash.  He watches the road ahead, tailing Mills.\n\n                                 MILLS (V.O.)\n                           (from receiver)\n                   What's your deal?

It's very\n                   important to me, obviously.\n\n     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     The chopper hovers amongst skyscrapers.  California and the\n     pilot are listening, through their helmet headsets.\n\n                                 MILLS (V.O.)\n                           (from headset)\n                   You want this to go well?

Stay in the\n                   left lane.\n\n     California leans out the chopper door, using his binoculars.\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Mills' car weaves through traffic.\n\n     Somerset's car isn't far behind, goes through a red light,\n     barely missing a truck.  Other cars blow their horns.\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     A cellular phone on the passenger side is BEEPING.  Somerset\n     pushes a button on the phone's panel.  He puts on a\n     headset/telephone, speaks into the mouthpiece.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I'm here.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)\n                           (from headset)\n                   Downtown and moving west.

CITY SKY -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     The helicopter dips, flying like a bullet over the city skyline,\n     heading towards the river and the setting sun.\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     FROM HIGH ABOVE, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted\n     river's edge.  Cards and trucks move like blood through veins.\n\n     DOWN CLOSER, we can see Mills' car in the flow.  The car turns\n     into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge.\n\n     Somerset's car is in close pursuit.\n\n     UNDER THE BRIDGE, the police helicopter travels close to the\n     water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out\n     of the sightline of the vehicles above.\n\n     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Traffic is bumper to bumper.  Somerset moves his headset\n     mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette.  He steers onto the bridge,\n     under the massive girders.\n\n                                 MILLS (V.O.)\n                           (from receiver)\n                   For us to go pick up two more dead\n                   bodies, and have that be the end of\n                   it... just seems too boring for you.\n\n     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     Beyond the crest of the bridge, the sunset is crimson.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Wouldn't be sensational enough.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   Wanting people to pay attention, you\n                   can't just tap them on the shoulder.\n\n     John Doe strains to turn, looks out the back window.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   Sometimes you have to hit them in the\n                   head with a sledgehammer... and then you\n                   get their strict attention.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   What are you looking at, Johnny?\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   Looking back... at the city proper...\n\n     Doe situates forward, holds his hands in front of his face,\n     looking at his bandaged fingers.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   And yet, no pillar of salt.\n                           (smiles to himself)\n                   Lost on you, isn't it?

I preferred the\n                   classic comic version myself.\n\n     This is an affront to Doe, angers him.  Mills sees it, likes it.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   I used to have \"Godspell\" on an eight-\n                   track tape.

You really\n                   think what you did was God's good work?\n\n     Doe looks out the window at other cars, refuses to answer.\n\n     He's pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs,\n     causing blood to drip from under the bandages.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   The Lord works in mysterious ways.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT\n\n     It's getting dark.  We've been in this section of factories\n     before, with John Doe.  The police helicopter soars overhead.\n\n     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT\n\n     California's looking down, wearing night-vision goggles.\n\n     INSERT -- CALIFORNIA'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH GOGGLES\n\n     The goggles allow California to see clearly into the maze formed\n     by buildings, yards and worksheds below.

He's battered against the sides of the pipe,\n     holding his breath desperately.\n\n     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT\n\n     FOLLOW Somerset as he charges onwards through the junk-yard,\n     stumbling over pieces of metal.  He runs towards the alleyway.\n\n     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT\n\n     WATER ROARS.  A square pool of water churns.  A moment, then\n     Mills rises, gasping, choking.  He's disoriented, furious,\n     waving his gun, expecting Doe to be right on top of him.\n\n     No one around.  Mills looks.  This is some sort of unmanned\n     water switching station.  the walls are covered in catwalks,\n     drainage pipes and tunnels.  Some tunnels and pipes spew water\n     down into the central pool, others are sealed shut.\n\n     Mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete\n     spillway.  He stands up, searching.  Doe could be anywhere.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Come on, Johnny!  I'm right here!\n\n     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS TUNNEL -- NIGHT\n\n     There is a plastic bag with an automatic pistol and extra clip\n     inside hanging from a protruding shut-off valve.  John Doe's\n     hands tear the bag open, taking the contents.\n\n     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset enters the alley, short of breath.  He points his gun\n     in front of him, fearful.  Moving slowly.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Mills!\n\n     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT\n\n     California is enraged, looks towards the pilot.\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   God damn it!  Let's do something!\n\n                                 PILOT\n                   Somerset said wait!\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   Fuck that!  Let's go!\n\n                                 PILOT\n                   Where?\n\n                                 CALIFORNIA\n                   I don't know!  Just go!\n\n     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT\n\n     Mills climbs onto a catwalk.  He passes tunnels, looking down\n     each, intense, ready to kill.  A waterfall flows and over the\n     other end of the catwalk.\n\n     Mills stands, looking over the railing at the central pool and\n     other tunnels.  He points his gun and fires into a far tunnel.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Come on!  Let's do it!  You and me!\n\n     A figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind Mills.\n\n                                 MILLS (CONT)\n                   I'm not going to let you win this!\n\n     John Doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses.\n\n     He seems calm, unloads his gun into Mills' back... BLAM, BLAM...\n\n     Mills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his\n     bullet-proof vest.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM... he stumbles, trying to\n     turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to\n     the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand.\n\n     CLICK.  Doe's gun is empty.  The gunshots echo.  Mills lays\n     there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in\n     his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them.\n\n     Doe moves quickly, starts searching Mills' pockets.\n\n     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset comes upon the open manhole.  Water rushes by.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Christ.\n\n     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT\n\n     The central pool bubbles, undulating.  Somerset surfaces,\n     inhaling, bringing his gun up.  He looks.  No one in sight.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Mills!  Pull out!\n\n     His voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water.\n     he swims to the edge, climbs out.  He walks, looking...\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                           (pleading)\n                   Pull out now!\n\n     Somerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing --\n\n     -- Doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk\n     above, with Mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them.\n\n\n     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT\n\n     Somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still\n     soaking wet.  He stops for one second, looks.\n\n     Not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground,\n     turning in wide circles.\n\n     Somerset climbs into the car, starts it up.  He drives away,\n     leaving his lights off.  The engine protests loudly, forced to\n     its limit.  The car disappears in darkness.\n\n     The police helicopter circles, useless.\n\n\n     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT\n\n     The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is\n     partially hidden.  Small shafts of light escape from holes in\n     the facade and just into the blackness.\n\n     Somerset is out of his car.  He strides towards the church,\n     checks his gun as he goes.  FOLLOW with him, getting closer to\n     the church.  He climbs the stairs.\n\n     Somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a\n     tremendous blast of light --\n\n     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT\n\n     Flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange\n     candles, now burnt low.  They greet Somerset, in the church's\n     old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out\n     the pews.\n\n     Somerset's eyes try to adjust to the light.  He holds his gun\n     ready, walks down the long center aisle.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)\n                   Hello, Somerset.\n\n     Doe sounds far, his voice echoing from the front of the church.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Where's David?\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)\n                   He's here.  With me.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Tell me what you want.\n\n     Somerset can see through the heat warp.  Doe stands facing him\n     from the altar.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   What do I want?  The same you... I want\n                   an ending.  Stay where you are.  Put\n                   your gun on the floor and slide it all\n                   the way down here.\n\n     Somerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it\n     hits the bottom altar stair.  He keeps walking, slowly.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I want to see him.  Show me Mills.\n\n     On the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills.  Mills\n     is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious.  His bullet-proof\n     vest has been removed.\n\n     Mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to\n     one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling.  Doe holds\n     the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   You're an intelligent man, Somerset.\n                   You understand what you're a part of,\n                   don't you?  When this is finished, it\n                   will seem surreal, but it will be a\n                   whole, crystalline reality.  And, no one\n                   will be able to deny it, no matter how\n                   hard they try.\n\n     Doe's voice is thick with passion.  Somerset is about halfway\n     down the aisle, still moving.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You're a murderer.  That's all.  The\n                   only way you've distinguished yourself\n                   is by your particular brutality.\n\n     Doe walks across the altar.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   You know that's not true.  You know.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You're killing innocent people, and I\n                   should admire you?  You're doing it\n                   because it gives you pleasure.  That's\n                   the only purpose... your sick pleasure.\n\n     Doe picks up a container of gasoline, looks out at Somerset.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   Stay where you are!\n\n     Somerset stops.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   I won't deny my personal desires.  I\n                   won't.\n\n     Doe begins dousing Mills with gasoline, covering Mills' body and\n     clothing.  Mills stirs, coming to.  He coughs, choking on the\n     gas and fumes.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   But, I don't mourn the victims in this\n                   any more than I mourn the thousands who\n                   died in Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n     Somerset looks fearful.  He starts approaching again.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   All you've done is cause more misery and\n                   pain!  You've given people all the more\n                   reason to believe there is no God!\n\n     Somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n     Doe sees Somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his\n     gun.  Doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding\n     his end of the rope.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   Stop!\n\n     Somerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about\n     fifteen feet in front of him.\n\n     Mills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open\n     because of the stinging gasoline.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Somerset?\n\n     Doe takes one step down off the altar.  Somerset is still edging\n     forward, hands out away from his body.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Do you really think I'm just going to\n                   let this happen?!  You think I'm going\n                   to let him die?\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   Yes.\n\n     Doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of\n     Somerset's bullet-proof vest.  Somerset flies back, knocking\n     over a rack of candles on his way to the floor.\n\n     Doe walks quickly back onto the altar.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Motherfucker!\n\n     Mills tries to grab at Doe as he passes, but Doe turns and kicks\n     Mills in the ribs.  Mills cringes in pain.\n\n     Somerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping.  He can't\n     catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   How can you speak of God, Somerset?\n                   When was the last time you spoke His\n                   name?\n\n     Mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands.\n\n     His mind works feverishly.  He looks around to see where he is,\n     then he searches the floor.  We can see, inside his open shirt,\n     the bleeding, upside-down cross Doe has cut into his chest.\n\n     Doe walks back to shout angrily down at Somerset.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   When did you last speak His name?  Was\n                   it in prayer?  Or, did you say the\n                   Lord's name after you stubbed your big\n                   toe?  Or, did you use His name to curse\n                   another man?\n\n     Somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out.\n\n     Mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor.  He\n     picks it up, palms it, still choking on gasoline.\n\n     Doe walks over to the statue of Saint Jerome Emiliani, pulling\n     the rope from above so it goes taut and Mills' arms raise above\n     his head.  Doe wraps the rope around Emiliani's arm.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   I'm going to kill you, Johnny.  I'm\n                   going to see you dead.\n\n     Doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   The irony, David, is that you policemen\n                   and I want the same things.  But, you\n                   are so short sighted.  In this city,\n                   where you can see a deadly sin on every\n                   street corner... and in every home, we\n                   want repentance.\n\n     Mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just\n     above his hands.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   We want good over evil.  We want values\n                   instilled in the children.  We want a\n                   world where a man or woman can lead a\n                   decent life.\n                           (pause)\n                   Wisdom, understanding, counsel,\n                   fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of\n                   the Lord.  Such simple concepts.  Why\n                   are they non-existent?\n\n     Somerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (weakly)\n                   Let him go, God damn you.\n\n     Doe checks to make sure the rope around Saint Emiliani is secure,\n     tightening the knots.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   There were two men once, who had\n                   wonderful gardens.  Two gardens of\n                   flowers that went on as far as the eye\n                   could see.  Beautiful gardens... the\n                   fragrance was inspiration in itself.\n\n     Doe stands behind Emiliani, heaves against the statue.\n\n     Mills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the\n     rope, fingers bleeding.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   But, both gardens were beset by\n                   problems.  Weeds started to take root,\n                   and there were infestations of insects\n                   and diseases.  The gardens started to\n                   turn putrid.  And, one man fought to\n                   save his garden, because he could never\n                   forget how it once was.  Everyday he cut\n                   the weeds, and killed the insects.\n                   Fought the diseases.\n\n     Doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the\n     other end of the rope pulls Mills upwards, screaming in pain.\n     Mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   That man never had a beautiful garden\n                   again.\n\n                                 MILLS\n                   Fuck you!\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   The other man plowed his garden under.\n                           (pause)\n                   He plowed it under the soil.  He started\n                   over.\n\n     Somerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew.\n\n     Doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a\n     thick wick and candle snuffer on the end.  He lights the wick\n     from a near candle.  The flame burns long and thin.  He looks\n     down at Somerset, takes out his gun.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   Stay there, Somerset.  Or, I'll kill him\n                   right now.\n\n     Doe holds the flaming pole up, near Mills.\n\n     Somerset stops.  He looks up at Mills.\n\n     Mills is straining.  He nods to Somerset, and Somerset sees\n     Mills cutting at the rope.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Alright... you don't have to do this,\n                   John.  You've already made your point.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   Do you think I chose this?  Can you even\n                   begin to understand how painful my\n                   existence has been?  It's like... like\n                   having every sense heightened beyond\n                   comprehension.\n\n     Doe lowers the flame, standing below and beside Mills, with his\n     attention focused on Somerset.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   So that the stench of the street coats\n                   your throat like bile.  So, sugar is so\n                   sweet it... it makes your bones ache to\n                   the marrow.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   You're insane.  That's why.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                           (seething)\n                   No!  You're wrong!\n\n     Mills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope.  He\n     begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying.\n\n                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)\n                   I was chosen.  And I've wished a\n                   thousand times I could have been a\n                   normal man.  Like David Mills, a common\n                   man... with a common life.  But, wishing\n                   that is my sin.  I can't have it and I\n                   shouldn't.\n\n     Doe steps towards Mills.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Don't do this!\n\n                                 JOHN DOE\n                   I meant what I said.  I admire David\n                   Mills.  I envy David Mills.\n                           (pause)\n                   Envy is my sin.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   No!\n\n     Just as Doe is to put the flame to Mills, the rope is finally\n     cut through.  Mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing\n     Doe in the face, knocking Doe's glasses off.\n\n     Mills hits the floor with a thud.\n\n     Somerset runs forward.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   David, get out!\n\n     Doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole.  Mills scrambles\n     to his feet and charges at Doe, shouting.\n\n     Doe squints, screaming, raises his gun.  Fires twice!\n\n     The bullets catch Mills in mid-run, and carry him off his feet,\n     backwards.\n\n     Somerset grips his own gun, just as Mills' body falls, tumbles\n     off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   No!\n\n     Somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his\n     throat.  He falls to his knees and halts Mills' body.\n\n     Somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and\n     cradling his head in his arms.  Tears come to his eyes.\n\n                                SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   David... David?  Please...\n\n     On the altar, Doe throws his gun away.  he starts feeling around\n     him, unsteady, looking for his glasses.\n\n     Mills' eyes are closed.  He is still, bloody.  He swallows.\n\n     With one gasp, without a word, he is dead.\n\n     Somerset looks up at Doe, vision blurred by rage and tears.\n\n     Doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces Somerset.\n\n     Somerset lays Mills' body down.  Stands, walks up towards the\n     altar, raises his gun.\n\n                                 SOMERSET (CONT)\n                   You.\n\n     Doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up.  He waits\n     for the bullets, falls to his knees.\n\n     The gun trembles in Somerset's hand as Somerset brings the\n     barrel to Doe's face.  A millisecond's pause.  Somerset changes\n     the angle of fire.  BLAM, he blows John Doe's arm to pieces in a\n     splattering explosion.\n\n     Doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor.\n\n     VIEWED FROM FAR BACK IN THE CHURCH\n\n     The entire church with its candles frames the torture:\n\n     Somerset walks to where Doe flops horribly, bleeding.  Somerset\n     aims, shoots Doe in the leg.  Doe screams, rolling, trying to\n     crawl away, knocking over candle racks.  Somerset follows.  He\n     shoots Doe's other leg.  He shoots Doe in the other arm.  Flames\n     begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews.  Doe\n     continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor.\n     BLAM, BLAM, BLAM.  Somerset steps back from Doe, overturns a\n     rack of candles on top of him.  He steps away.  Watching.\n     Flames begin rising on Doe's clothing.\n\n     CLOSE ON JOHN DOE'S FACE\n\n     Doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames\n     rising.  He continues screaming.\n\n     His glasses crack from the heat.\n\n\n     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT\n\n     Smoke billows from the windows.  The fire is moving quickly,\n     ravenous.  It's just starting to light up the night.\n\n     From the front door, Somerset walks weeping, carrying Mills'\n     body in his arms.\n\n     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT\n\n     The seven deadly sin tableau burns.\n\n     Flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken.  Gluttony, greed\n     and sloth are already halfway gone.\n\n     Flames eat at pride, lust.\n\n     Wrath and envy are being consumed.  Wrath goes last.  A man with\n     bloodied hands, in tones of blue.  Flames devour it.\n\n\n     EXT.  CEMETERY -- DAY\n\n     A field of blue.  Cops in orderly rows.  The funeral of David\n     Mills.  Many police officials and politicians stand in tribute.\n\n     Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform.  He stares forward,\n     still numb, beaten.  Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen.\n     Blanks explode from the barrels.  They reload in unison.\n\n     Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under\n     an American flag.  Tracy is there.\n\n     Tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site.  Her\n     head is lowered.  She cries.  Each blast of the rifle salute\n     causes her to react with a start.\n\n     EXT.  CEMETERY -- LATER DAY\n\n     The funeral is over.  Somerset stands at the edge of the\n     graveyard, looking at the distant city.  Behind him, the\n     mourners are still filing out to their cars.\n\n     The captain approaches.  He comes to stand beside Somerset,\n     similarly solemn.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN\n                   I don't know if I should do this.\n                           (pause)\n                   We found the motel room Doe must have\n                   been staying in after you found his\n                   apartment.\n\n     Somerset hasn't acknowledged the captain, still looking away.\n\n                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)\n                   Anyway... we found this in his\n                   belongings.\n\n     The captain takes out a sealed envelope.  Somerset takes it.\n\n     On the envelope: DETECTIVE SOMERSET, handwritten, in red marker.\n\n\n     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY\n\n     Tracy and Somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the\n     apartment building.  MOVERS carry Tracy's belongings to the\n     truck.  Mills' car is attached to be towed behind.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   I wish I could say something...\n                           (pause)\n                   Something to... I don't know...\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   I'll be okay.\n\n     Somerset nods.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   We'll keep in touch.  I'll come visit.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   I'll write to you when we get there.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Take care of yourself.\n                           (pause)\n                   Take care of the baby.\n\n     Tracy nods.  There's nothing left for them to say.  They're both\n     empty.  It's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug,\n     to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move.\n\n                                 MOVER\n                   That's all, Mrs. Mills.  We got\n                   everything.\n\n     Movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs\n     in and fires up the engine.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                   Goodbye, Tracy.\n\n                                 TRACY\n                   Goodbye, Somerset.\n\n     Somerset walks away.  Tracy walks away, gets in the passenger\n     side of the moving truck.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATER DAY\n\n     Sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying.  Somerset walks in a\n     fog, hands in his pockets.  He stops at a corner, but does not\n     cross.  He stands there, looks up.\n\n     At the city around him.  The buildings towering over him.\n\n     At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing\n     their horns and spouting soot.\n\n     Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope\n     from John Doe.  He studies it in his hand.\n\n                                 SOMERSET\n                           (to himself)\n                   Oh... man...\n\n     He opens it.  He takes out a small note, handwritten.  It reads:\n\n                                          PLOW THEM UNDER.\n\n     Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of\n     his emotions.  He looks around:\n\n     At the miserable people, walking past him.\n\n     At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a\n     cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.\n\n     A father passes by, holding his young son's hand.  Somerset\n     turns to watch them as they pass.  The gather reaches to pick\n     the boy up and carry him.  The boy holds tight.\n\n     For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.\n\n     The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek.  The\n     boy returns the kiss, with great affection.\n\n     Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity.  He\n     looks back at the note in his hand.\n\n     He tears the note up, into little pieces.\n\n\n     INT.  MOVING TRUCK -- DAY\n\n     The truck moves along in steady traffic.  Tracy sits beside the\n     driver.  She looks out at the city across the river.\n\n     She reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope.\n     She opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out\n     into her palm.\n\n     She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the\n     envelope.  She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of\n     paper.  She unfolds it:\n\n     It is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center.\n\n     She smiles very faintly.\n\n\n     EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING\n\n     Cars roll by in the street.  Cops come and go.\n\n     Somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house.\n\n     END\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSe7en\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Andrew Kevin Walker\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:43.682491"}
