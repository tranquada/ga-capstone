With his foot, he\n          picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both\n          to fend off blows. It rattles and pops as he fights with\n          both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow.\n          Shane sees a FARMER JOHN TALKING GAME. He jumps up onto a\n          shelf and grabs it.
