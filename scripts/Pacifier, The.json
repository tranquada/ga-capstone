He's gone.\n          \n          Then Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the\n          Professor up. He cuts the Professor's GAG. Plummer\n          screams. Shane removes his mouth piece.

With his foot, he\n          picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both\n          to fend off blows.

But we're not sure what it is.\n                    Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It\n                    looks like some kind of \"key\". We just\n                    don't know what its for.\n          \n          She holds up the strange, metal two pronged KEY.\n          \n                                 JULIE (CONT'D)\n                    The good news is I'll be home in two\n                    days, as soon as the customs paperwork\n                    clears.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                           (very genuine)\n                    ...So soon?

SCHOOL - MORNING\n          \n          Early morning, students run in to school. The minivan\n          pulls up, and Shane emerges with the five kids.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm\n                    gonna be sticking even closer.\n          \n          INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - DAY\n          \n          The TEACHER shows the children how to dye Easter eggs.\n          \n          ANGLE on Lulu, making a mess of an egg.   She smiles.\n          \n          ANGLE on Shane, squashed at a little desk.   He dips an\n          egg in some purple dye.\n          \n          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY\n          \n          Driver's Ed. An obstacle course with cones. Zoe\n          nervously drives a small sedan, a crazed TEACHER next to\n          her. He is gesticulating, SCREAMING, reacting each time\n          she HITS the gas, then BRAKES, HITS the gas, then BRAKES.\n          \n          Shane stands off to the side, shaking his head.    Peter\n          and Tyler are tight in their Snuggles.\n          \n                                                                60.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. LULU'S CLASSROOM - LATER\n          \n          The TEACHER hangs a series of cute \"Turkey Hand\" drawings\n          above the blackboard (the kind where your fingers make\n          the feathers). She hangs one of a HUGE HAND, and smiles\n          at Shane, who sits in the back, sunglasses on. Shane\n          nods, \"yeah, I know it's good.\" Then...\n          \n                                 VOICE (OVER THE PA:)\n                    Will Shane Wolfe please report to Vice\n                    Principal Murney in the gym.\n          \n          Lulu's classmates all chant, in unison:\n          \n                                 SECOND GRADERS\n                    Ooooooooh! (You're in trouble!)\n          \n          INT. THE GYM - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Shane enters. Zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. She\n          is holding a broken-off SIDE VIEW MIRROR. Murney stands,\n          Principal Claire next to him. They look concerned.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    Don't worry. So, she wrecked a driver's\n                    Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...\n          \n                                 MURNEY\n                    That? Lady drivers, what do you expect.\n                    No, it's not that -- it's the boy...\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    Red two? I mean Todd?\n          \n          Claire nods. Shane gives Zoe a look. Zoe shrugs.\n          \n                                 PRINCIPAL CLAIRE\n                    Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to\n                    return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and\n                    I'm not sure what to do...\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    Has he been skipping class?\n          \n                                PRINCIPAL CLAIRE\n                    Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth\n                    period. But this...\n          \n          Murney calls into the hallway. Todd enters. Shane stops,\n          in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has\n          a bleach blonde BUZZ CUT, giving him a \"skinhead\" look.\n          \n                \n          \n          \n                                                                  61.\n          \n          \n          \n                                 MURNEY\n                    This is how he showed up to practice. And\n                    that's not all. I was doing a little re-\n                    con in his locker... and I found this:\n          \n          Murney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it.\n          It's a book of photographs of NAZI UNIFORMS. Shane\n          scowls.\n          \n                                 MURNEY (CONT'D)\n                    If he'd had Hustler or something, boys\n                    will be boys -- but this is just sick.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    He's not a NAZI.\n          \n                                 PRINCIPAL CLAIRE\n                    It's certainly not normal.\n                           (pulls Shane aside.)\n                    See if you can talk to the boy.   Find out\n                    what's going on.\n          \n          Shane shakes his head: Todd is worse than he thought.\n          Todd and Zoe stand to go, and Shane walks them out.\n          \n          The WRESTLING TEAM is assembled, stretching. They snicker\n          and shake their heads at Todd, as he passes. Shane walks\n          the kids out, and Murney chases after him.\n          \n                                 MURNEY\n                      hope you won't go light on him -- that\n                    whole family's no good, if you ask me.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    I'll talk to him.\n          \n                                 MURNEY\n                    You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a\n                    hell of a fighter on the mats, huh?\n                           (Shane ignores him, and keeps\n                            walking.)\n                    Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll\n                    give these boys a treat.\n          \n          He \"fake-punches\" one of his Boys -- who flinches like\n          Murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. Murney laughs.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    Another time, maybe...\n          \n                                 MURNEY\n                    It's a date then. I'll show you a couple\n                    moves. I promise I won't hurt you.\n          \n                              \n          \n                                                                   62.\n          \n          \n          \n          Shane walks away. Without warning, Murney lets out a Kung\n          Fu SCREAM, and leaps at Shane, kicking him in the BACK,\n          Shane trips forwards to his knees. Murney tells his team:\n          \n                                 MURNEY (CONT'D)\n                    See that? You never know when your\n                    adversary is going to strike!\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    Did you kick me in the back? Is there a\n                    footprint on my jacket?\n          \n          Shane dusts off his back, and leaves.\n          \n                                 MURNEY\n                    Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy!\n          \n          Shane turns back. It looks like Shane might fight, but\n          instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. Murney shakes\n          his head, and snickers to his Team.\n          \n          EXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER\n          \n          The minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers\n          piled in. Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house. Shane\n          holds Todd back by the arm.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...\n          \n           odd yanks his arm away and runs into the house.\n          \n          INT. TODD'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Shane knocks on Todd's door. Nothing. He enters. The\n          window is wide open, Shane checks his window alarm --\n          there's a REFRIGERATOR MAGNET stuck to it, keeping the\n          contact, so the alarm didn't go off.\n          \n                                 SHANE\n                    Smart kid.\n          \n          Shane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can\n          see Todd, running around the corner. Shane hops out the\n          window. He sees Zoe, peering out her window.\n          \n                                 SHANE (CONT'D)\n                    Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets\n                    within forty clicks of the perimeter,\n                    signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your\n                    homework, preheat the oven, and make sure\n                    Lulu brushes her teeth!\n          \n          \n                                                                   63.\n          \n          \n          \n          He starts to shut the window, but the Duck leaps up on\n          the sill.\n          \n                                 SHANE (CONT'D)\n                    You want in or out?\n          \n          The Duck leaps out. Shane screws the window shut. On the\n          corner, Shane sees Todd climbing on to a CITY BUS.\n          \n          Shane picks a GIRL'S BICYCLE up off the front lawn. It's\n          pink, with a flowered basket. It's small for him, but he\n          hops on and pedals furiously after the bus.\n          \n          EXT. CITY STREET NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Shane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus. A few\n          HOMEBOYS watch him pass, curiously. He nods back, tough.\n          \n          EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT - LATER\n          \n          The bus stops in a rundown neighborhood Todd hops off the\n          bus. Shane's arrives a moment later, dripping sweat. He\n          stashes the bike behind a mailbox...\n          \n          Shane'S P.O.V.: At the entrance to the old warehouse,\n          Todd meets up with three other TEENAGE BOYS, they're\n          dressed in brown HITLER YOUTH UNIFORMS, they head inside.\n          \n          Shane follows them, stealthily.\n          \n          INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Shane follows the Hitler Youth into a large room, set up\n          with folding chairs. He hides in a dark corner. Todd and\n          the Hitler Youth enter, and take seats. A CREEPY MAN in\n          a scarf walks out, and stands in front of them. Shane\n          watches as the MAN addresses the Hitler Youth.\n          \n                                 MAN\n                    Alright. All my Nazis are finally here.\n                    Okay, I want all of you at attention.\n          \n          The Nazis stand at attention. Shane is horrified...\n          \n                                 MAN (CONT'D)\n                    And on stage left - (he yells) VON\n                    TRAPPS! I need my Von Trapps!\n          \n           hane watches... as a group of blonde ACTORS, all dressed\n          in lederhosen as the SINGING VON TRAPP family enter, and\n          join the \"Nazis.\" There's also a few NUNS, a CAPTAIN VON\n          TRAPP, and a MARIA. The Creepy Man is, in fact, a good\n          natured, slightly foppish DIRECTOR.\n          \n          \n                                                                64.\n          \n          \n          \n                                 DIRECTOR\n                    Okeydokey.

An\n          ACCOMPANIST begins on piano, Todd sings, remarkably well:\n          \n                                 TODD\n                    You wait little girl, on an empty\n                    stage/for fate to turn the light on/your\n                    life little girl, is an empty page/that\n                    men will want to write on...\n          \n                                 ACTRESS/LIESL\n                    To write on...\n          \n                                 TODD\n                    You are sixteen, going on seventeen...\n          \n          Shane bursts into laughter. His whole face lights up for\n          the first time ever...\n          \n          Todd and Liesl dance. Todd is good, but nervous. He\n          attempts a spinning kick, but he slips, and hits the\n          stage, clutching his ankle. He gets up, and limps to the\n          seats. The Director walks onto the stage, upset. He\n          looks up, to heaven:\n          \n                                 DIRECTOR\n                    Baby Jesus, have I done some unspeakable\n                    evil that I deserve to be saddled with\n                    the world's worst production of Sound of\n                    Music? (he shouts, at the cast:) We open\n                    in a week. The set's not finished... The\n                    cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every\n                    kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig\n                    himself out of the earth, so he could\n                    have a heart attack again.\n          \n                                 TODD\n                    I'm sorry...
