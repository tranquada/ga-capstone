WARSAW (ARCHIVE) - DAY\n\n               Black and white. Street scene. People toing and froing.  A \n               man rattles by.\n\n               SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:\n\n                                      WARSAW 1939\n\n               INT. STUDIO, RADIO STATION, WARSAW - DAY\n\n               WLADYSLAV SZPILMAN plays Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor, \n               Posthumous. He's twenty-eight years old, elegant and \n               handsome. \n\n               In the booth, separated from the studio by a glass screen, \n               an engineer, wearing collar and tie, monitors the broadcast. \n               Behind him, a window to the street with strips of paper \n               taped on it as protection against blast. \n\n               Without warning, a bomb drops nearby, then another and \n               another. The whole building shudders alarmingly and the \n               window in the booth shatters. \n\n               The engineer and Szpilman exchange a look as a man enters \n               the booth and talks urgently to the Engineer, then goes. \n\n               The engineer makes a 'cut-throat' gesture, but Szpilman \n               shakes his head, determined to play on. \n\n               He plays, then glances at the booth. The engineer has gone, \n               but through the shattered window he sees fires raging. \n\n               Very near, a loud, terrifying explosion. The reverberations \n               cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his \n               face. \n\n               And then a bomb explodes even closer. The glass screen \n               separating booth from studio implodes, showering Szpilman \n               with glass. He stops, frozen.\n\n               INT. STAIRS AND LOBBY, RADIO STATION - DAY\n\n               Pandemonium. Chaos. People rushing in all directions, many \n               carrying files, boxes, papers, shouting, calling. Some of \n               the men in military uniform. The bombing continuous. \n               Szpilman fights his way down the stairs. He has a small \n               cut on his forehead and is dabbing it with his handkerchief. \n               He has a dazed look. Halfway down the stairs, A young woman, \n               DOROTA, tugs at his sleeve:\n\n                                     DOROTA\n                         Mr. Szpilman.\n\n               He turns, to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing \n               adoringly at him while they're jostled and shoved. His \n               eyes light up.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Hello.\n\n                                     DOROTA\n                         I came specially to meet you today. \n                         I love your playing, but what a \n                         day to choose.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Who are you?\n\n                                     DOROTA\n                         My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's \n                         sister. oh!

Debris \n               everywhere. Szpilman fights to get to the main door, when \n               another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris, \n               obscuring him and everyone else.\n\n               INT. WARSAW APARTMENT - DUSK\n\n               The Szpilman family in panic: coming and going out of rooms, \n               packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a \n               trunk in a comfortable, tastefully furnished bourgeois \n               apartment, the living room lined with books, paintings and \n               boasting a boudoir grand, silver platters and candlesticks. \n               The family consist of MOTHER, in a state of great anxiety, \n               FATHER, REGINA, twenty-six, HALINA, twenty-two, and HENRYK, \n               twenty-four, the only one not in movement. He sits by the \n               radio set, ear to the speaker, trying to tune to a station. \n               No bombs now, just the distant sound of artillery fire. \n               Father, holding a silver-framed photograph, crosses to \n               Mother.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         What you think, should I take Uncle \n                         Szymon's photograph?\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Take it, don't take it, take what \n                         you like.

She can barely control her tears \n               and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens \n               and Szpilman enters, looks round bemused by the activity.\n\n                                     REGINA\n                         Mama, Wladek's home.\n\n               Mother dashes out of the kitchen.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Thank God - Wladek!

He holds a couple of volumes \n               in his hands, trying to interest passers-by. \n\n               Szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through \n               the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and \n               reaches Henryk.\n\n               Henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle \n               one side of the basket, Szpilman the other. They set off. \n\n               As they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing \n               beggars and children asking for food:\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         You sell anything?\n\n                                     HENRYK\n                         Just one.

They \n                         bribe the guards. The guards turn \n                         a blind eye.

CHLODNA STREET - DAY\n\n               A stream of cars and trams. Jewish policemen and German \n               soldiers much in evidence.\n\n               Szpilman and Henryk join a large crowd of Jews waiting at \n               a barrier to cross the intersection. The crowd is agitated, \n               impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let them \n               through.\n\n               A MAN next to Szpilman and Henryk is becoming more and \n               more distraught, shifting his weight from foot to foot, \n               taking off and putting on his hat.\n\n                                     THE NERVOUS MAN\n                         This is totally insane; why do we \n                         have to have a gentile street \n                         running through our area?

I think \n                         they're totally stupid. I've got a \n                         family to feed and I spend half my \n                         time here waiting for them to let \n                         us through.\n\n               Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. Jewish \n               policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving \n               Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the \n               nervous man. Other soldiers are clearing a space. \n\n               Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull out of the crowd a tall woman and \n               a short man and haul them into the cleared space.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN SOLDIER\n                         Dance!\n\n               The couple dance to the street band's waltz. \n\n               At intervals, German soldiers select even more unlikely \n               couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young \n               boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples. \n\n               The German soldiers are, to various degrees, amused. One \n               of them is almost hysterical with laughter.\n\n                                     SOLDIERS\n                         Faster! Go on, faster! Dance!\n\n               The couples dance as fast as they can. A soldier kicks one \n               of the cripples who can't go on any more.\n\n                                     SOLDIERS\n                         Dance! Dance!\n\n               Then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the \n               barrier swings open and people swarm across in both \n               directions.\n\n               INT.

CAFE NOWACZESNA, GHETTO - DAY\n\n               On a platform, Szpilman plays at a piano, but he can hardly \n               be heard above the noise of chatter and laughter. \n\n               The large cafe is crowded, hot and smoke-filled. Well-heeled \n               customers, pimps, whores, businessmen sit at little tables, \n               eating, talking, laughing, almost drowning the piano music. \n               Some dance.\n\n               A couple of tables back from the piano, a customer is doing \n               business with a friend. The customer has a small stack of \n               coins, some of them twenty-dollar gold pieces. He folds \n               back the tablecloth to reveal a marble surface beneath. He \n               drops a coin on the marble and listens but the noise is \n               too loud. He sees the cafe owner, BENEK, fiftyish, and \n               makes gestures, pointing at Szpilman. Benek pushes his way \n               through to Szpilman.\n\n                                     BENEK\n                              (whispering into \n                              Szpilman's ear)\n                         I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you \n                         to stop.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (continuing to play)\n                         Who wants me to stop?\n\n               Benek points to the customer, who makes an imploring gesture \n               to Szpilman. Szpilman stops playing. \n\n               The friend watches the customer intently as he drops the \n               coins one by one onto the marble. He drops them, puts his \n               ear close and listens.  Two or three he discards, but he \n               smiles when coins make a pure tone, and he keeps them. \n\n               Szpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore, who makes \n               eyes at him. \n\n               Satisfied, the customer beams, nods his thanks to Szpilman, \n               who resumes his piano playing.\n\n               EXT. GHETTO STREET - DUSK\n\n               Szpilman walking. He passes emaciated children and beggars. \n               He steps over the corpses lying on the sidewalk.\n\n               EXT. STREET NEAR WALL - DUSK\n\n               The wall runs the length of the street, dividing it in \n               half and narrowing it. Buildings on one side, the wall on \n               the other.\n\n               Szpilman walks along. A piercing whistle from the Aryan \n               side.  Szpilman stops. \n\n               Two women appear from a doorway, approach the wall and \n               look up.  Two or three packages come flying over from the \n               Aryan side. The women grab them and disappear. \n\n               Szpilman walks on and sees a child appear through a hole \n               at ground level. The child wriggles through then turns, \n               pulls a package after him and runs. \n\n               Szpilman walks on, hears a noise, looks back to see a SECOND \n               CHILD trying to wriggle through the same hole. But he's \n               stuck. Angry German voices from the Aryan side. \n\n                                     2ND CHILD\n                         Help me! help me!\n\n               Szpilman goes to him, pulls him with all his might but the \n               boy is jammed in the hole.\n\n               From the other side of the wall, the sound of an angry \n               German voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy. \n               The boy screams in agony.\n\n               Szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through. \n\n               The sound of the German voice swearing and the dull, \n               crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy \n               continues, and with every thud the boy screams in terrible \n               pain.\n\n               Szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are \n               becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate.\n\n               Szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him \n               through. The boy lies moaning.\n\n               Szpilman takes the boy's face in his hands, tries to comfort \n               him, revive him, but the boy has stopped moaning. His head \n               lolls and his jaw sags. He is dead. Szpilman stands quickly \n               and hurries away.\n\n               EXT. COURTYARD AND HOUSE - EVENING\n\n               Szpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard.\n\n               INT. JEHUDA ZYSKIND'S ROOM - EVENING\n\n               The noise of a mimeograph machine. A huge, CHEERFUL MAN \n               with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth.\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                         I always say look on the bright \n                         side. You're in the small ghetto, \n                         intellectuals, professional people, \n                         you're better off than us. Here, \n                         in the large ghetto, it's a \n                         cesspool. But you, you're living \n                         in Monte Carlo. You could say you're \n                         privileged and that, of course, \n                         goes against my principles.  \n                         Nevertheless...\n\n               He laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers. His \n               room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and \n               stuff. Dark, shabby, run-down.\n\n               One of his sons, SYMCHE, is operating the mimeograph \n               machine. The other, DOLEK, is sorting the sheets as they \n               come off the roller.  MRS. ZYSKIND, holding a toddler, is \n               cooking at a small stove.\n\n               JEHUDA finds what he's been looking for, a newspaper made \n               up of a few sheets.\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                         Ah, here.

I have brothers \n                         everywhere. They bring me news and \n                         food. We care about our fellow \n                         human beings. Workers of the world \n                         unite.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         So, what's the news?\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                              (scanning the paper)\n                         The Germans are advancing on \n                         Kharkhov.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         I don't know why I come here every \n                         evening, it's always such bad news.\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                         Bad news, you crazy?

The moment Hitler invaded \n                         Russia, I knew we'd be all right. \n                         Remember Napoleon. Same business. \n                         The Germans will freeze to death, \n                         please God.\n\n               He beams. Szpilman leans over, takes a sheet from the \n               mimeograph.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Jehuda, give me something to do.\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                         You're an artist, Wladek, you keep \n                         people's spirits up. You do enough.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         But I want to help, I want to.\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                         You're too well known, Wladek. And \n                         you know what? You musicians don't \n                         make good conspirators. You're \n                         too...too musical.\n\n               He loves this, laughs, coughs.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         There are notices going up.

Szpilman tenses but Jehuda \n               beams. To one of his boys: Symche - The boy opens the door \n               to admit a short, neat man, MAJOREK.\n\n                                     MAJOREK\n                         Hello, Symche, Dolek, Mrs Zyskind, \n                         Jehuda. Working hard?\n\n               He stops, seeing Szpilman.\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                         Majorek, this is the greatest \n                         pianist in Poland, maybe in the \n                         whole world. Wladyslaw Szpilman. \n                         Meet Majorek.\n\n                                     MAJOREK\n                              (shakes Szpilman's \n                              hand)\n                         I know your name.

He's got a mind \n                         like a searchlight. The only thing \n                         I've got against him is he's not a \n                         socialist.\n                              (he looks out of \n                              the window.)\n                         You'd better go now, Wladek. It's \n                         nearly curfew.\n                              (he hands over \n                              pamphlets to \n                              Majorek.)\n                         You see these, Wladek?  You know \n                         how many copies we print of our \n                         newspaper?\n\n               Szpilman shrugs.\n\n                                     JEHUDA\n                         Five hundred.

These will start the \n                         uprising. Majorek hides them in \n                         his underpants. And leaves them in \n                         toilets.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Toilets?\n\n                                     MAJOREK\n                         As many toilets as I can find. \n                         Germans never go into Jewish \n                         toilets. They're too clean for \n                         them.\n\n               Jehuda loves this too, but his laugh makes him cough \n               appallingly.\n\n               INT. GHETTO APARTMENT - EVENING\n\n               Summer. The windows are open and the sounds of the ghetto \n               can be heard in the background.

BUILDING OPPOSITE AND GHETTO APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               A Gestapo vehicle has entered the street and screeched to \n               a halt.  Helmeted, jackbooted SS MEN, led by an NCO, pour \n               out of the vehicle. \n\n               The Szpilmans gather at their open window to watch.

Lights go on floor by floor. \n\n               In an apartment directly opposite, a businessman, his wife, \n               three young people and an old man in a wheelchair sit at \n               their dining table. The SS men burst in, machine pistols \n               at the ready. The family is frozen with horror, remain \n               seated.\n\n               The NCO scans their faces.\n\n                                     NCO\n                              (in a towering rage)\n                         Stand up!\n\n               The family rise to their feet fast, except for the old man \n               in the wheelchair. The NCO bears down on him.\n\n                                     NCO\n                         Stand up!\n\n               The old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair \n               and tries desperately to stand. But he can't. Without \n               warning, the SS men seize the chair with the old man in \n               it, carry him out on to the balcony. \n\n               THE SZPILMANS:\n\n               Mother SCREAMS, Father shrinks back, Halina comforts him \n               and Regina comforts Mother. \n\n               Szpilman's and Henryk 's POV - the apartment opposite: \n\n               The SS men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the \n               balcony. He seems to hang in the air for a second then \n               drops out of the chair and out of sight. But there's a \n               terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter \n               as the wheelchair follows him. \n\n               THE SZPILMANS:\n\n               Mother sobbing. The others, still horrified.\n\n                                     REGINA\n                              (softly, to Mother)\n                         Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be \n                         quiet!\n\n               Then sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, shouts.\n\n               Szpilman and Henryk hurry to another window so that they \n               can see what's going on.\n\n               Their POV from second window building opposite and street:\n\n               SS Men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building \n               opposite.\n\n               People watching from the windows but trying not to be seen.\n\n               The headlights of the SS vehicle are switched on and the \n               SS Men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam.\n\n                                     A GERMAN VOICE\n                         Run!  Run!\n\n               The prisoners start to run.\n\n               The SS men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the \n               vehicle. People in the building opposite begin to SCREAM.\n\n               The prisoners are being shot down. They are lifted into \n               the air by the bullets, turn somersaults, fall dead.\n\n               One man escapes by running back in the opposite direction, \n               out of the beam of light and is lost to sight for a moment.\n\n               The escaping man, a silhouette, out of the light, runs \n               with all his strength, putting distance between himself \n               and the SS. He starts to scale a wall. He looks as though \n               he's getting away.\n\n               But there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle. It flares into \n               light, swivels and finds the man. A volley of shots.\n\n               The man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the \n               vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies. \n\n               THE SZPILMANS: \n\n               Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent, shocked. \n               The only sounds, the weeping of the people opposite and, \n               nearer, Mother crying softly.\n\n               INT. CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY\n\n               Szpilman, as if in another world, playing the piano. The \n               cafe is full of customers but the atmosphere is much more \n               subdued than previously, the mood is sombre.\n\n               EXT.  CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY\n\n               A doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the \n               door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the \n               cafe entrance. The doorman lets her in.\n\n               INT. CAFE NOWACZESNA - DAY\n\n               Szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing, across the heads \n               of the customers, Halina, in a state of great anxiety, \n               beckoning urgently. \n\n               Szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps \n               off the platform, threads his way through to Halina.

Then, suddenly, a woman \n               bars his way. She's the Feather Woman, brightly rouged, \n               with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve \n               ostrich feather rising from her straw hat.\n\n                                     THE FEATHER WOMAN\n                         Excuse me, but have you seen my \n                         husband Izaak Szerman?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         I'm afraid not.\n\n               He tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm.\n\n                                     THE FEATHER WOMAN\n                         He's tall, he's handsome.

LABOUR BUREAU BUILDING - DAY\n\n               A mob of men in front of the building being herded this \n               way and that by Jewish policemen. More and more captive \n               men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos).  \n               The mob constantly swelling.\n\n               Szpilman reaches the back of the crowd.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (to an elderly man \n                              nearest him)\n                         What's happening?\n\n                                     THE ELDERLY MAN\n                         They've got my grandson in there. \n                         They pick 'em up, they take 'em \n                         away. What do they do to them? \n                         I've stopped believing in God!\n\n               Szpilman scans the mob. The Jewish policemen using batons \n               and whips to herd the men. No sign of Henryk. Szpilman \n               becomes alert. He's seen someone he recognises. Heller, \n               with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton, \n               driving men into the building. With difficulty, Szpilman \n               pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (yelling)\n                         Yitzchak!\n\n               Heller doesn't hear.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Yitzchak!\n\n               Heller glances round.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Here, please! Wladek Szpilman!\n\n               Heller shoves someone aside so that Szpilman can approach, \n               but he continues to beat and manhandle people.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Henryk's in there.\n\n                                     HELLER\n                         I haven't seen him.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Believe me, they've picked him up.\n\n                                     HELLER\n                         Tough luck.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Can you help?\n\n                                     HELLER\n                         Oh, you need me now, yes, now you \n                         need me!\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Can you help us?\n\n                                     HELLER\n                         It costs.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         I've no money.\n\n                                     HELLER\n                         Then there's nothing I can do.

Szpilman \n               stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY AND LABOUR BUREAU, LATER - MID-AFTERNOON\n\n               Szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches \n               the front of the building. Comings and goings. German \n               Soldiers in evidence. The mob is smaller now.\n\n               Szpilman waits and watches, and then a POOR WOMAN passes, \n               carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a RAGGED \n               OLD MAN, dragging himself along. He's shivering with cold, \n               his shoes with holes show his purple feet.\n\n               The ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to \n               grab the can from the poor woman. They struggle desperately.\n\n                                     POOR WOMAN\n                              (screaming)\n                         A snatcher! Help me, a snatcher!\n\n               The can falls to the pavement and thick, steaming soup \n               pours into the dirty street. \n\n               Szpilman watches, rooted to the spot. The ragged old man \n               stares at the can, lets out a groan, more like a whimper, \n               and throws himself full length in the slush, licking the \n               soup up from the pavement. The poor woman starts to howl, \n               kicking the old man and tearing at her hair in despair. \n\n               Then:\n\n                                     RUBINSTEIN'S VOICE\n                         Boys, keep your peckers up!

ALLEY AND LABOUR BUREAU, LATER - DUSK\n\n               Sun just setting.\n\n               From the shelter of the alleyway, Szpilman continues to \n               watch the entrance of the bureau. No mob any more, but \n               people come and go - jewish policemen, shupos, a few jews. \n\n               Almost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams. \n\n               Then, Heller appears at the entrance, looks this way and \n               that and goes back inside the building. Szpilman alert. \n               Again Heller appears in the entrance. He beckons someone \n               inside. Henryk shuffles out. Heller shoves him into the \n               street.

UMSCHLAGPLATZ - DAY\n\n               Szpilman, Mother, Regina and Father, with others, enter \n               through one of the gates, which closes on them. They pause \n               for a moment to take in their new surroundings. \n\n               The Szpilmans and their POV: \n\n               Their first sight of the large rectangle, walled on two \n               sides and overlooked by buildings. Several hundred people. \n               People walk up and down.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Let's sit over there.\n\n               But he stops again, and so do the others. Something they \n               see causes them to stand stock still, expressionless.\n\n               THE SZPILMANS' POV:\n\n               An unoccupied space at the edge of the compound where \n               bloated, decaying bodies lie near to a wall. The wall itself \n               is spattered with blood. Large flies walk over the dead. \n               Nobody goes near.\n\n               THE SZPILMANS:\n\n               Szpilman turns away and leads the others to another space. \n\n               Later:\n\n               Glaring sun. The Szpilmans have settled down on the kerb \n               of a pavement and are waiting. Szpilman stands, observing \n               the scene.\n\n               Mother sits on a bundle of things, staring vacantly, her \n               hair hanging down in strands. Regina, beside her, has her \n               hands over her face and is weeping, the tears running \n               through her fingers.\n\n               Father walks nervously up and down, hands behind his back, \n               four steps one way, four steps back. Near them, a YOUNG \n               WOMAN begins to wail.\n\n                                     THE YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Why did I do it? Why did I do it?\n\n               A young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not \n               seem to take in what he's saying. Her cries continue at \n               intervals. \n\n                                     THE YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Why did I do it? Why did I do it?\n\n               The sound of trucks. Everyone looks towards the gates. \n\n               More Jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched \n               through the gates. Mothers, children, old people, begging, \n               most of them holding papers. Pandemonium. \n\n               Later: \n\n               The sun high, blazing. Szpilman is wandering around, \n               occasionally greeting people. The place is crowded now, \n               packed. Trucks bring more and more Jews at intervals. \n\n               Old people lying down, exhausted, impossible to tell whether \n               some of them are alive or dead. Women carrying dehydrated \n               children drag themselves from group to group. One WOMAN \n               approaches Szpilman.\n\n                                     WOMAN WITH CHILD\n                         He's dying, don't you have a drop \n                         of water? My child's dying of \n                         thirst, he's dying, he's dying, I \n                         beg you!\n\n               Szpilman shakes his head sadly. The woman with child wanders \n               off to another group.\n\n                                     A MAN'S VOICE\n                         I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.\n\n               Szpilman turns to see a man, DR. EHRLICH, haranguing Father.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         I can hear you.\n\n               Szpilman goes to them.\n\n                                     DR.

At least \n                         we could die honourably, not as a \n                         stain on the face of history!\n\n               Another man, Grun, joins in.\n\n                                     GRUN\n                         Why you so sure they're sending us \n                         to our death?\n\n                                     DR.

Because they didn't tell me. \n                         But I'm telling you they plan to \n                         wipe us all out!\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me \n                         to do?

They're \n                         sending us to a labour camp.\n\n                                     DR. EHRLICH\n                         Oh, sure. Look at that cripple, \n                         look at those old people, the \n                         children, they're going to work? \n                         Look at Mr Szpilman here, he's \n                         going to carry iron girders on his \n                         back?\n\n               A loud cry from Mother. Szpilman and Father spin round.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Henryk!\n\n                                     REGINA\n                              (glancing up, shocked)\n                         Oh my God!\n\n               Near the gates, among a large bunch of new arrivals, Henryk \n               and Halina.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Halina! Henryk!\n\n               Regina and Szpilman also call and wave. Henryk and Halina \n               struggle through to them. Halina falls into Mother's arms \n               and they hug.\n\n                                     HALINA\n                         We heard you were here...we...didn't \n                         want...we...we wanted to be with \n                         you.\n\n               Mother comforts her.

Why did I do it?\n\n               Szpilman stands and stares at her. \n\n               Later: \n\n               The sun lower but the heat still intense.\n\n               The place is now packed to suffocation. People calling out \n               names, trying to find each other. The wailing of women and \n               the cries of children.\n\n               A cordon of Jewish policemen and SS guards are, almost \n               surreptitiously, ringing the compound.\n\n               The Szpilmans sit in the same place, with Henryk sitting a \n               little apart and now reading a small book.\n\n                                     THE YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Why did I do it?

She smothered the \n                         cries with her hands. The baby \n                         died. A policeman heard the death \n                         rattle.

Among the great \n               throng of people, the Szpilmans trudge towards the train. \n\n               Szpilman and Halina walking.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Halina?\n\n                                     HALINA\n                         What?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Funny time to say this.\n\n                                     HALINA\n                         What?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         wish I knew you better.\n\n                                     HALINA\n                              (a smile)\n                         Thanks.\n\n               THE TRAIN:\n\n               The Szpilmans near the train. The first trucks are already \n               full, the people inside pressed close together, SS men \n               pushing them with their rifle butts.\n\n               People in the trucks cry out in desperation. \n\n               The Szpilmans are pushed along by SS men along the cordon \n               of Jewish policemen, past loaded trucks. \n\n               Then, suddenly:\n\n                                     A VOICE\n                         Szpilman! Szpilman!\n\n               A Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls \n               him back out of the police cordon. It's Heller. The rest \n               of the family have reached the next truck to be filled. \n\n               A scuffle as Szpilman tries to resist. Another Jewish \n               policeman shoves him.\n\n               Szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him \n               the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs.\n\n               He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads, \n               shoulders, Mother, Regina, Henryk and Halina clambering \n               into the trucks. Father is looking around, bewildered.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (yelling)\n                         Papa!\n\n               Father sees him, takes a step towards him, but stops, \n               smiling helplessly. He raises his hand and waves, then \n               turns and goes towards the trucks.\n\n               Again, Szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (desperate)\n                         Papa! Mama! Halina!\n\n               Heller turns on him.\n\n                                     HELLER\n                         What do you think you're doing, \n                         Szpilman? I've saved your life! \n                         Now, go on, save yourself!\n\n               Szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified. Then he \n               turns and starts to run.\n\n                                     HELLER\n                         Don't run!\n\n               Szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates. Workers \n               are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay \n               against the wall. Szpilman falls in with them and they \n               pass through the gates.\n\n               EXT. TRAIN - DAY\n\n               The doors of the trucks are closed. The train begins to \n               move. Slow, laborious. From the trucks, the faint cries of \n               the occupants.\n\n               EXT.  STREET BY THE SIDING - DAY\n\n               Szpilman catches his breath by a building. An SS man and \n               Jewish policeman emerge. The Jewish policeman is servile, \n               crawling to the German. He points to the train -\n\n                                     JEWISH POLICEMAN\n                         Well, off they go for meltdown!\n\n               They laugh as they walk away. Szpilman turns and stumbles \n               down the empty street. The cries from the trucks fading. \n               He begins to weep, loud, agonised sobs, and staggers on.\n\n               EXT.  GHETTO STREET - EVENING\n\n               Szpilman, lost, empty, aimless, tries to catch his breath \n               in the aftermath of his tears.\n\n               He wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty \n               buildings with their doors open, windows smashed. Furniture, \n               torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered. Feathers fly. \n               Desolation.\n\n               He turns a corner.\n\n               EXT. COURTYARD, JEHUDA'S STREET - EVENING \n\n               Szpilman comes into the courtyard. He stops, his face blank.\n\n               Lying outside the door, the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs. Zyskind, \n               their two sons and the toddler.  Szpilman steps across the \n               bodies.\n\n               INT. JEHUDA ZYSKIND'S ROOM - EVENING\n\n               Chaos. Papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place. The \n               mimeograph smashed.\n\n               Szpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation. \n\n               Distant sounds of shooting, shouts, cries. \n\n               He gathers up some papers in a pile, takes off his jacket \n               and covers the pile of papers, making a pillow. He lies \n               down on the floor.\n\n               He stares into the darkness, expressionless, empty.\n\n               EXT. STREET NEAR CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY\n\n               Szpilman shuffles along, comes to the cafe. No sign of \n               life, but the door is wide open. He goes inside.\n\n               INT. CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY\n\n               A shambles. Szpilman wanders through the upturned tables, \n               broken chairs. Stops, looks about. Nothing.\n\n               Distant shots, automatic fire.\n\n               He turns and makes for the door. Then he hears an urgent \n               hiss. He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it. \n               He hears the hiss again.\n\n               Now he sees, hiding under the platform, Benek, beckoning \n               to him. Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until \n               he's beside him. Benek replaces a plank and they are hidden \n               from view.\n\n               INT. UNDER THE PLATFORM, GHETTO CAFE - DAY\n\n               Thin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs \n               in the cramped space.\n\n                                     BENEK\n                              (looking at him, \n                              mystified)\n                         Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         It's like this... I...we...all of \n                         them.\n\n               He can't continue. Benek nods.\n\n                                     BENEK\n                         Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker \n                         the better.\n                              (Brief pause.)\n                         It isn't over yet. We'll stay here \n                         for a couple of days. Until things \n                         die down.\n                              (Another pause)\n                         I've bribed a policeman. He'll \n                         come when it's over.\n\n               EXT.  GHETTO STREET - DAY\n\n               In bright sun, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four \n               abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen, guarded \n               by two German policemen. They are being marched out of the \n               ghetto gates.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (to Benek)\n                         My God. I haven't been outside for - \n                         it must be two years.\n\n                                     FELLOW WORKER\n                              (on the other side \n                              of him)\n                         Don't get over-excited.\n\n               EXT. ZELAZNA BRAMA SQUARE - DAY\n\n               Street traders with baskets full of wares, fruit, \n               vegetables, fish, tins of preserves. Women bargain with \n               them, making purchases. Lively, colourful. Dealers in gold \n               and currency calling monotonously.\n\n                                     DEALERS\n                         Gold, buy gold! Dollars! Roubles!\n\n               Later:\n\n               Szpilman, on top of a free-standing scaffold, Benek and \n               the others demolishing a ghetto wall, wielding skdgehammers. \n               They work slowly. \n\n               A smartly dressed young couple are passing, but stop. \n\n               They stare. The young woman is extremely attractive and \n               knows it. The foremen, workers and the German policemen \n               ogle her.\n\n                                     THE YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Look - oh, do look!\n\n               Her young man is puzzled; she points.\n\n                                     THE YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Jews!\n\n                                     THE YOUNG MAN\n                         Can't be the first time you've \n                         ever seen Jews.\n\n               Embarrassed, she giggles and they go. Szpilman, Benek and \n               the others continue to work.\n\n               The foremen sit, sunning themselves, and the German \n               policemen stand, deep in conversation, ignoring the workers. \n\n               Szpilman suddenly stops work. He has seen something in the \n               square that alerts him.\n\n               At the furthest stall, he sees a woman, attractive, chic, \n               in her thirties, buying vegetables at a stall.  Her name \n               is JANINA GODLEWSKA.\n\n               Surreptitiously, Szpilman raises a hand, trying to catch \n               her attention. But he's frightened of alerting the German \n               policemen and the foremen. Benek has noticed.\n\n                                     BENEK\n                         Someone you know?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Yes.\n\n               Again Szpilman tries, but Janina, her profile to him, \n               doesn't see.\n\n                                     BENEK\n                         A beauty. Who is she?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         A singer. Her husband's an actor. \n                         I knew them well. Good people. I'd \n                         like to talk to her.\n\n                                     BENEK\n                              (playful)\n                         Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they \n                         hang them for helping Jews.\n\n               He goes back to work.\n\n               The German policemen wander over to one of the stalls to \n               buy fruit. The moment they do so two Jewish workers scamper \n               across to another stall to buy bread.\n\n               Szpilman glances across the square: Janina is still at the \n               stall.\n\n               He comes to a decision. He jumps down, is about to dash \n               towards Janina, but stops dead.\n\n               Janina is no longer there.\n\n               EXT. GHETTO STREET - DAY\n\n               As before, Szpilman and Benek march towards the ghetto \n               gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the \n               command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German \n               policemen.\n\n               Suddenly:\n\n                                     YOUNG SS MAN\n                         Halt!\n\n               The column halts before a young SS man, wild-eyed, with \n               his sleeves rolled up and wielding a pistol. He talks \n               excitedly to the policemen then turns, walks along the \n               column dividing them up: some men to the right, others, \n               seven of them, to the left. Benek he orders to the left, \n               Szpilman to the right. \n\n               Young SS man turns to those on the left.\n\n                                     YOUNG SS MAN\n                         Lie down!\n\n               Terrified, they obey. He stands over them and, one by one, \n               shoots them. When he comes to Benek, the seventh man, his \n               pistol runs out of ammunition. He changes the clip, shoots \n               Benek and marches off.\n\n               EXT. BUILDING SITE, OUTSIDE GHETTO - DAY\n\n               Szpilman, bent almost double, carries a hod on his back \n               piled with bricks. He is mounting a wooden ramp that runs \n               up beside scaffolding on a small building site where an \n               extra floor is being added to a house. There are Polish \n               workers, too, who don't, of course, wear armbands as the \n               Jews do. There's a wooden hut serving as a store on the \n               site.\n\n               Halfway up the ramp, Szpilman hears someone whistle. He \n               stops, turns to see, at the bottom of the ramp, Majorek, \n               smiling and giving a discreet wave.\n\n               Later: \n\n               Szpilman and Majorek sip gruel out of mugs. They sit apart \n               from the others who are also taking a break.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         How long have you been here?\n\n                                     MAJOREK\n                         Since last night. I was pleased to \n                         see you.\n\n               Brief silence.\n\n                                     MAJOREK\n                         They're going to start the final \n                         resettlement now. We know what it \n                         means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. \n                         A good man. His orders were to \n                         follow the trains out of Warsaw. \n                         He got to Sokolow. A local \n                         railwayman told him the tracks are \n                         divided, one branch leading to \n                         Treblinka.

Szpilman \n               hides his package inside his coat.\n\n               Zick-Zack lashes out at the workers blindly.\n\n                                     ZICK-ZACK\n                         Und-zick!

A moment of \n               danger. Zick-Zack grabs Szpilman by the cottar.\n\n                                     ZICK-ZACK\n                         Know why we beat you?\n\n               No response; shaking him.\n\n                                     ZICK-ZACK\n                         Know why we beat you?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (tentatively, in \n                              German)\n                         No. Why?\n\n                                     ZICK-ZACK\n                         To celebrate New Year's Eve!\n\n               He and his comrade find this hilarious; recovering from \n               his laughter.\n\n                                     ZICK-ZACK\n                         Now, march!

Szpilman joins in. Now, so \n               do the others.\n\n               They march on, singing lustily. \n\n                                     ALL WORKERS\n                              (singing)\n                         Hey, ranks unite \n                         And follow the White Eagle! \n                         Stand up and fight \n                         Our mortal enemy.\n                         Riflemen, hey!\n                         Let's give them fire and brimstone.\n                         We'll blow away \n                         The yoke of slavery.\n                         Punish and rout \n                         The rapists of our nation.\n                         We'll smash the knout \n                         To save our dignity.\n                         Soon we'll be proud\n                         Of our liberation - \n                         \n                         Hey, take your sights! \n                         Aim sharply at the heart. \n                         Hey, load!

So does Majorek.\n\n               INT./EXT. STORES AND BUILDING SITE - EVENING\n\n               The Jewish workers lined up to get their potatoes and bread. \n               Szpilman and two others weigh the potatoes.\n\n                                     GERMAN VOICES\n                         Get on with it and fall in! Fall \n                         in!\n\n               Calmly, Szpilman leaves the table with the scales, walks \n               past Majorek and the others, who, having got their potatoes, \n               are assembling in a column, preparing to march back into \n               the ghetto. The Polish workers have packed up their tools \n               and are talking among themselves, also about to leave the \n               site but in a casual way.\n\n               The SS guards shout orders for the Jewish column to move \n               off. Szpilman seems as if he's going to join them, but at \n               the last moment turns and falls in with the Polish workers, \n               beside Barczak, who just glances at him then moves so that \n               Szpilman is in the middle of the group.\n\n               Szpilman slips off his armband, stuffs it into his pocket. \n\n               The group walk into the darkness.\n\n               EXT. WISNIOWA STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Dimly lit. Empty street. Szpilman walks fast to the corner, \n               stops, looks round anxiously. Nothing. He takes the armband \n               from his pocket and drops it through the grating of a drain \n               in the gutter just as there's movement in a darkened \n               doorway. Szpilman tenses.\n\n               Then, out of the darkness of the doorway, a woman: JANINA \n               GODLEWSKA.\n\n               She turns and starts to walk quickly. Szpilman, putting \n               the collar of his coat up, follows, keeping pace. A \n               pedestrian walks past in the opposite direction but pays \n               them no attention.\n\n               Janina and Szpilman walk on.\n\n               EXT. BOGUCKI BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Janina comes to the front door, opens it with a key, goes \n               in. Szpilman, a little distance behind, catches up and \n               follows her inside.\n\n               INT. HALL, STAIRS AND 3RD FLOOR, BOGUCKI BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Janina waits as Szpilman closes the front door, then starts \n               up the stairs. Szpilman follows. She stops, turns to him, \n               smiles, kisses him on the cheek, then continues up the \n               stairs.\n\n               INT. BOGUCKI APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               ANDRZEJ BOGUCKI, a handsome man, fortyish, tries to conceal \n               his sense of shock at seeing Szpilman He holds out his \n               hand and Szpilman shakes it.\n\n               Szpilman looks around the nicely furnished, large apartment. \n               He looks at Bogucki and Janina. Tears well up in his eyes. \n               He fights it hard, not to cry. So does Janina.\n\n                                     BOGUCKI\n                         We haven't much time.\n\n               INT. SMALL BATHROOM, BOGUCKI APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman lies in a steaming bath, eyes closed, as though \n               he's in a trance.\n\n               A gentle knock on the door and Bogucki slips in with some \n               clothes. He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed.\n\n                                     BOGUCKI\n                         You must hurry.\n\n               Bogucki holds up a towel. Szpilman lifts himself out of \n               the bath and dries himself.\n\n                                     BOGUCKI\n                         We're going to have to keep moving \n                         you. The Germans are hunting down \n                         indiscriminately now.

Janina shoves \n               the strips of clothes into the stove. Szpilman, now wearing \n               Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn \n               while he spoons hot soup into his mouth.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         Thank you, I don't.\n\n                                     BOGUCKI\n                         You'll be looked after by Mr \n                         Gebczynski.

GEBCZYNSKI'S STORE - NIGHT\n\n               The rickshaw comes to a halt outside a store. The moment \n               it stops the shutters of the store are raised and Bogucki \n               escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the \n               rickshaw, which moves off fast.\n\n               INT. GEBCZYNSKI'S STORE - NIGHT\n\n               GEBCZNYSKI shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him in and \n               then pulls down the shutter.\n\n               Gebczynski's store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies: \n               lavatories, basins, baths, taps etc.\n\n                                     GEBCZYNSKI\n                         I'll show you where you're going \n                         to sleep.\n\n               He leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from \n               a chair and a blanket.

Shelves with taps, washers, pipes. Gebczynski \n               leads the may to a particular set of shelves. He puts aside \n               the cushion and blanket, then starts to push at the shelves. \n               Szpilman, although puzzled, helps. Slowly, the shelves \n               move to reveal a secret compartment.\n\n                                     GEBCZYNSKI\n                         It's not going to be very \n                         comfortable.\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                         I'll be fine.\n\n                                     GEBCZYNSKI\n                         You'll have to stay here until \n                         tomorrow afternoon.\n\n               He helps Szpilman into the compartment.\n\n                                     GEBCZYNSKI\n                         We've got a flat for you.

But it's safe.\n\n               He hands over the cushion and the blanket to Szpilman; \n               then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against \n               the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that \n               Szpilman is now hidden.\n\n               INT. SECRET COMPARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               In the cramped space, Szpilman is not quite able to stretch \n               full out. With difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his \n               head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops, \n               seeing something.  \n\n               In niches, neatly stacked: rifles, pistols, grenades, \n               ammunition\n\n               Szpilman stares, expressionless.\n\n               EXT.

Some \n               read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the \n               windows, but never looking at the Poles.\n\n               Szpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible. The \n               tram rumbles on its way.\n\n               INT. 1ST APARTMENT, 4TH FLOOR LANDING AND DOOR - AFTERNOON\n\n               Gebczynski and Szpilman come up the stairs to the landing \n               and to a door.

German soldiers \n               follow behind on the trot, pulling a field gun.\n\n               Unseen marksmen fire down on the Germans from the buildings. \n               As the German soldiers dismount from their vehicles one of \n               them is hit and falls.

He finds a knife and tries to chop a piece \n               off the bread but knocks the bread tin, which falls to the \n               floor with a clatter. \n\n               He continues to try to cut the bread, when there's a loud \n               hammering on the front door.\n\n               Szpilman stiffens.\n\n               THE LIVING ROOM. \n\n               The hammering continues as Szpilman stumbles into the room, \n               looks around, confused, not knowing what to do.\n\n               From the other side of the door female voices, words \n               indistinct, and then:\n\n                                     KITTY'S VOICE\n                         Open this door at once, or we'll \n                         call the police!\n\n               He is galvanised into action, puts on a crumpled jacket, \n               grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects up a few of \n               his things, stuffs them into a paper bag. \n\n               The hammering stops. Szpilman cautiously approaches the \n               door, listens, then opens it quietly and slips out.\n\n               INT.  1ST APARTMENT, LANDING AND DOOR - DUSK\n\n               He slips out of the flat, goes to the stairs and stops \n               dead.

No one about. He \n               stops, almost collapses, but manages to keep hold of \n               himself. He puts on his coat and wraps the scarf round his \n               neck. He leans up against a wall.\n\n               He removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper \n               Gebczynski gave him. He reads it.\n\n               EXT.

He opens \n               the lid. A cloth covers the keys. He removes the cloth. He \n               gazes lovingly at the keyboard.

The sound of rapid firing, which makes the \n               newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel \n               of a machine gun. \n\n               His two companions have also put their packages to their \n               shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the \n               Schutzpolizei building. \n\n               The sentry is hit and falls in front of his box. \n\n               As if these young men have given a signal, now from all \n               over the city comes the sound of gunfire. \n\n               The pedestrians have scattered except for the old man, \n               gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who \n               eventually manages to disappear inside a building. \n\n               Rifle and machine-gun fire from the Schutzpolizei building. \n\n               The firing intense.

More \n               shots. He drops on to the balcony and looks back.\n\n               EXT. ROOFTOP, TWO STREETS AWAY - DAY\n\n               Two German soldiers are firing at Szpilman.\n\n               INT. ROOF, BACK OF BUILDING - DAY\n\n               Szpilman clambers back into the building through the smashed \n               balcony door. A couple of shots dangerously close.\n\n               INT. STAIRCASE - DAY\n\n               Smoke. Szpilman staggers down the stairs, stumbles over a \n               corpse and almost falls headlong.\n\n               EXT. GARDEN AND BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The sun is setting.\n\n               Szpilman crawls into the backyard. He hears German voices \n               shouting commands. He hides behind three garbage bins by \n               the wall.\n\n               He waits. Listens.  Silence\n\n               EXT. STREET - EVENING\n\n               Deserted. Buildings on fire but dying out. Corpses in the \n               street, including the woman who was shot, still in her \n               strange kneeling position.\n\n               EXT. FRONT DOOR AND STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman watches from the doorway. Then, dropping down, he \n               crawls across the road on his stomach, threading his way \n               through the dead bodies, now besieged by flies, and makes \n               for the hospital opposite.\n\n               German soldiers appear from around a corner. Szpilman \n               immediately lies still, pretending to be just another \n               corpse. Flies alight on him. When the Germans pass, he \n               sets off again.\n\n               INT. RUINED HOSPITAL, OPERATING THEATRE - NIGHT\n\n               Dark.  Szpilman crawls into a corner, rests. He's exhausted.\n\n               He tries to take stock of his surroundings. He can make \n               out the operating table. He manages to drag himself on to \n               it.\n\n               He lies there, his eyes grow heavy. He sleeps.\n\n               EXT. RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n               German soldiers dragging the corpses into a pile.\n\n               A sergeant douses the bodies in petrol, then sets them \n               alight.\n\n               The bodies burn.\n\n               INT./EXT. RUINED HOSPITAL - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY\n\n               From a shattered window on the first floor, he looks at \n               the burning bodies.\n\n               Two German soldiers wander into his eyeline. He draws back \n               a little but watches them warily. \n\n               They sit just beneath him, chatting, and take out their \n               food-tins, drink coffee and eat bread.\n\n               INT. PASSAGE AND WARDS, RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n               Szpilman wanders down the passage, sees into the wards, \n               the empty beds, the broken furniture and medical equipment.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN, RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n               Szpilman opens cupboards, drawers, searching, but trying \n               to be as quiet as possible.\n\n               He sees the refrigerator, quickly gets to it, pulls open \n               the door. Empty.\n\n               He looks around and notices a red fire bucket with a spade \n               and a box of sand next to it. The bucket is full of water, \n               covered with an iridescent film and full of dead flies.\n\n               He drinks as much water as he can without swallowing the \n               flies and, while he's doing so, he spots a couple of sacks. \n\n               He opens the first: potatoes. The second contains barley. \n\n               He tries to eat the uncooked barley but can't. \n\n               Later: \n\n               A fire on the floor. Szpilman holds a saucepan over it and \n               is cooking the barley and some potatoes. He manages to \n               scoop out a spoonful, blows to cool it, then eats.\n\n               INT./EXT. RUINED HOSPITAL - SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY\n\n               Szpilman at a window sees autumn leaves thick on the ground. \n               And at the end of the street, a line of Poles, some with \n               their hands in the air, others with hands on heads, being \n               marched away by German soldiers.\n\n               INT. WARD. RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY.\n\n               Szpilman lies in bed under several layers of blankets. Ice \n               on the windows. He hears German voices shouting commands. \n               He sits up.\n\n               INT./EXT. RUINED HOSPITAL, SZPILMAN'S POV - DAY\n\n               Szpilman gets to a window and looks out.\n\n               German soldiers with flame-throwers are burning the \n               buildings opposite.\n\n               One soldier, with a bucket of white paint and a brush, \n               numbers the building.\n\n               Szpilman cranes to see them reach the end of the street, \n               then cross over and start on the buildings on his side, \n               working their way towards the hospital.\n\n               He pulls away and makes for the back of the hospital.\n\n               INT. BACK OF RUINED HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n               Szpilman goes to a window, jumps out. He twists his ankle. \n               He's in pain. He crawls across the back garden and climbs \n               over the wall.\n\n               EXT. RUINED STREETS - DAY\n\n               Devastation, not a human being in sight. \n\n               Nothing. Emptiness. \n\n               He is alone.\n\n               Szpilman hobbles away.\n\n               EXT. RUINED VILLA - EVENING\n\n               Cautiously, Szpilman limps towards the villa, a once grand \n               building, but now partly damaged by shell fire. \n\n               He makes his way in.\n\n               INT. HALL, RUINED VILLA - EVENING\n\n               Szpilman enters the hall, still showing signs of its former \n               opulence. I Silent. Ominous.\n\n               He looks round anxiously, then sees the stairs leading \n               down to the basement. He hurries towards them and descends.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN, RUINED VILLA - EVENING\n\n               Dark, shadowy.\n\n               Szpilman comes down a flight of wooden stairs that had \n               directly into the kitchen.\n\n               Immediately, he begins to search fractically, opening \n               cupboards, drawers. He finds a can with a label illustrating \n               pickled cucumbers. Desperately, he searches for something \n               to open it with.\n\n               He discovers a pair of scales with a variety of weights. \n               He seizes one of the weights when, very close, he hears \n               the sound of a car coming to a halt, then the car door \n               slam, a German voice giving commands.\n\n               He drops the weight but, holding the tin, he scampers up \n               the stairs.\n\n               INT. BACK STAIRS, RUINED VILLA - EVENING\n\n               Szpilman, clutching the unopened tin, makes his way up the \n               narrow, wooden staircase.\n\n               INT. TOP FLOOR, RUINED VILLA - EVENING\n\n               Szpilman, panting heavily, reaches the top floor. He sees \n               a small door, tries it. It opens.\n\n               INT. ATTIC AND LOFT, RUINED VILLA - EVENING\n\n               Szpilman enters, closing the small door behind him. He \n               leans back, resting, recovering.\n\n               And then he hears from down below a piano playing a \n               Beethoven piece.\n\n               After a few bars, the music stops. Szpilman listens \n               anxiously. Silence.\n\n               He looks around, finding himself in an attic space filled \n               with junk, a ladder, rotting material, travelling trunks. \n               Last light of day filtering through a dormer window. \n\n               There's a ladder leading up to a trapdoor. Szpilman climbs \n               the ladder.\n\n               He crawls into a small empty space. With enormous effort \n               he pulls up the ladder and closes the trapdoor.\n\n               Exhausted and trying to catch his breath, he gazes at the \n               unopened tin. He peers through the darkness but sees \n               nothing.\n\n               His eyes begin to droop.\n\n               EXT. WARSAW CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT\n\n               Artillery fire. Fires glow on the horizon.\n\n               INT. LOFT, RUINED VILLA - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman wakes suddenly. He listens. Silence but for the \n               distant gunfire. He sees the unopened tin of pickles, stares \n               at it. He opens the trapdoor.\n\n               INT. BACK STAIRS, RUINED VILLA - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman, a shadow, a spectre, creeps down the stairs.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN, RUINED VILLA - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman has placed the tin and the weight on a shelf and \n               is engrossed in searching again. He finds a pair of chicken \n               scissors. Using the weight, he starts to hammer the point \n               of the scissors into the tin making a perforation round \n               the rim.\n\n               The tin slips off the shelf and rolls across the floor \n               coming to rest at a pair of highly polished jackboots. \n               Szpilman stifles a gasp.\n\n               On the stairs, in silhouette, gazing down at him, the figure \n               of a GERMAN CAPTAIN, the thumb of one hand caught in his \n               belt above his pistol.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                              (stern)\n                         Who the hell are you?\n\n               Szpilman just stares at him.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         Who are you?\n\n               No response.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         What the hell are you doing?\n\n                                     SZPILMAN\n                              (barely audible, in \n                              German)\n                         I was...

I was a pianist.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         A pianist.\n\n               He studies Szpilman for a moment, then with a nod orders \n               him to follow. Szpilman picks up the tin and follows.\n\n               INT. ROOMS, RUINED VILLA - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman follows the German Captain through a double door, \n               hanging off its hinges, into a room with a broken table in \n               the centre, what once was the dining room. And then through \n               another set of doors. The German Captain's boots echo. \n\n               They come into a spacious room. Faint moonlight filters \n               through the large windows. Fallen masonry and broken glass.  \n               A couple of chairs. And a grand piano in the corner.\n\n               The German Captain points at the piano.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         Play.\n\n               Szpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the \n               tin, and opens the lid. He turns and drags one of the chairs \n               over and sits.\n\n               The German Captain stands and watches.\n\n               Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he \n               plays Chopin.\n\n               The German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale \n               moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man. \n\n               Szpilman finishes playing.\n\n               Silence.\n\n               Somewhere, a cat mews. Distant burst of rifle fire.\n\n               The German Captain stares at Szpilman. After a moment:\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         Are you hiding here?\n\n               Szpilman nods.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         Jew?\n\n               Long pause.

ATTIC AND LOFT AREA, RUINED VILLA - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman and the German Captain enter.\n\n               The German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees the ladder \n               in place, leading up to the loft.\n\n               Szpilman climbs the ladder, squeezes into the loft and \n               looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on \n               him.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         Have you anything to eat?\n\n               Szpilman shows him the tin.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN CAPTAIN\n                         I'll bring you something.\n\n               He goes quickly, leaving Szpilman in darkness. Szpilman, \n               overcome by relief, can barely catch his breath.\n\n               EXT. RUINED VILLA - NIGHT\n\n               The German Captain strides out of the villa, down the front \n               steps to a waiting car and a driver. He gets into the car.  \n               The driver starts the engine and the car speeds off into \n               the night.\n\n               INT. LOFT - NIGHT\n\n               Szpilman hears the car's engine growing fainter. He starts \n               to tremble and then begins to cry. He weeps uncontrollably.\n\n               INT. HALL, ROOMS, RUINED VILLA - DAY\n\n               Much activity: officers coming and going, orderlies typing. \n               Officers king on field telephones. Desks, filing cabinets. \n\n               The German Captain, carrying a bulging shoulder bag, marches \n               into a room just off the hall and goes to his desk just as \n               an orderly drops papers in his in-tray. On the desk, there's \n               a framed photograph of him nth a woman and two children. \n\n               German Captain glances at the papers, takes a pen, initials \n               one or two and then goes. \n\n               THE GRAND STAIRCASE:\n\n               The German Captain marches up the stairs purposefully, as \n               if he's on urgent business.\n\n               INT.

LOFT - DAY\n\n               Szpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the \n               eiderdown, hears the strange sound of the music, which he \n               recognises.\n\n               He's astonished, puzzled.
