MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          131\n</b>\n    Moran drives up.  There is an empty police car, the door still\n    ajar.\n\n\n<b>132 INT. MEMORIAL - NIGHT                                          132\n</b>\n    Taupin is badly outclassed.\n\n    He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly\n    with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws\n    him again to the floor.\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                          You bastard!\n\n<b>                                KNIGHT\n</b>                          Be silent.\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                          Leave him alone.\n\n<b>                                KNIGHT\n</b>                          You will be silent!!\n\n    The voice is THUNDERING.\n\n    Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor.  His\n    teeth grind in pain.\n\n    The Knight smiles.\n\n<b>                                KNIGHT\n</b>                          I do hope you're enjoying this\n                          as much as me.\n\n<b>    MORAN\n</b>\n    Stands in the entryway.  The Knight sees him.\n\n<b>                                KNIGHT\n</b>                          Get out.\n\n    Moran draws his pistol.\n    The Knight walks toward him,\n\n<b>                                KNIGHT\n</b>                          This is nothing that concerns you.\n\n    Moran levels his gun.\n    The Knight raises his sword.\n\n<b>                                KNIGHT\n</b>                          You will leave!\n\n    Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES.  The slugs slam into the Knight,\n    blowing him off his feet.\n\n    He lies still.\n\n    Moran looks to Brenna.  To Taupin.  Then he walks closer to the\n    Knight.\n\n<b>                                TAUPIN\n</b>                               (hoarse)\n                          Don't.\n\n    Taupin curls in a spasm of pain.\n    Moran moves closer.\n\n    The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over\n    his heart.  He isn't breathing.\n\n    Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face.\n\n<b>                                TAUPIN\n</b>                          Stop.  You don't understand.\n\n    The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's\n    chest.  The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall.\n\n    Taupin crawls for the Knight.\n\n    Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes.  The Knight, blood\n    pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts\n    quickly.\n\n    Moran slides off the sword dead.\n\n    Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest.  The Knight GAGS\n    in surprise and crumples.  Taupin CUTS again, then puts the\n    blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat.\n\n<b>                                TAUPIN\n</b>                          In mamus tuas Domine commendo\n                          spiritum meum.

He sucks in painful gulps\n    of air.\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                          My God.\n\n    Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                          Conor.\n\n    Taupin is looking past her.\n\n    A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder.  She\n    SCREAMS.  The headless body of the Knight stands beside her.\n\n<b>    THE KNIGHT'S HEAD\n</b>\n    Lies on the floor.\n    The eyes open.  The face pulls into a smile.\n\n<b>                                KNIGHT\n</b>                          And now you know.\n\n    The eyes roll up into the skull.  The face slackens.\n\n    The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses\n    to the ground.\n\n<b>    TAUPIN\n</b>\n    Is CRYING.  Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something\n    else.\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                          What's wrong?\n\n<b>                                TAUPIN\n</b>                          I can't stand it.

He pushes her savagely away.\n\n<b>                                TAUPIN\n</b>                          Get out.\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                          No!\n\n<b>                                TAUPIN\n</b>                          I'll destroy you.

Taupin is alone.\n    Bleeding.  Crying.  In agony.\n\n<b>    FADE OUT\n</b>\n<b>    FADE UP:\n</b>\n\n<b>133 INT.

Taupin is gone forever.\n    As if he never was.\n\n\n<b>135 INT. BRENNA'S APARTMENT                                        135\n</b>\n    A desk.  A single light.  A cup of coffee.\n\n    A typewriter.\n\n    Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface.  CLACK-CLACK.\n    It is at last her journal article.  She types a line, then rips\n    it from the carriage and tears it to pieces.\n\n    The thoughts won't come.\n\n\n<b>136 EXT.

She looks up.\n\n    It is Taupin.\n\n    Something has changed him.  His face is less cynical.  More\n    vulnerable.  More human.\n\n    He sits down on the grass beside her.\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                             (after a moment)\n                          What are we supposed to say?\n\n    The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin.

Nothingness.  Bordered only\n                          by the quest for ultimate nothingness.\n                          Who would have guessed?\n\n<b>                                BRENNA\n</b>                          The inheritance.\n\n<b>                                TAUPIN\n</b>                          Not power.
