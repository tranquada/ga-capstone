The\n   low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There\n   is an erie, smothering silence.\n\n                                VASSAL #1\n                          Is a bad day for this.\n\n                                VASSAL #2\n                          The Duke has been compro-\n                          mised.

HILLTOP - MORNING                                            7\n\n   The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.\n   He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.\n\n8  EXT. PLAIN - MORNING                                              8\n\n   The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan\n   and clashing swords.  The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-\n   citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.\n\n   The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with\n   his opponent.\n\n   THE KNIGHT\n\n   Rides calmly through the fracas.  He strikes and kills those\n   that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.\n\n   He is looking.\n\n   CONOR\n\n   Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.\n   Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.\n   He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.\n\n   Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.\n\n   The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy.  His fear turned\n   to panic, Conor turns and flees.\n\n   The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his\n   horse into persuit.\n\n   Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight\n   brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing\n   open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into\n   the heather.\n\n   As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in\n   time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.\n\n   THE KNIGHT\n\n   Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the\n   boy's.  His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.\n\n                                KNIGHT\n                          There can be but one.\n\n   A CLANSMAN\n\n   Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him\n   nearly in half.  ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.\n\n   The battle is shifting to where they are.\n\n   Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself\n   forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-\n   ants.\n\n   A VASSAL\n\n   Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted\n   Knight.\n\n                                VASSAL #1\n                          Leave him!\n\n   The clansmen obey.\n\n   With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the\n   Knight disappears into the fog.\n\n   The Vassal surveys the carnage before him.  His eyes fall a\n   moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.\n\n   The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.\n\n\n9  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                9\n\n   A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.\n\n   The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his\n   sword into a near-by drain.  He straightens up and waits.\n\n   AN OFFICER\n\n   Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward.  His PARTNER\n   switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley\n   in a harsh glare.\n\n   MAN IN ALLEY\n\n   For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad\n   in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.\n\n   The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively\n   for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the\n   alley.\n\n                                OFFICER #1\n                          Kevin!

We have never seen the knight out of his armor\n    before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill.  Wearing\n    Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive\n    business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone.\n\n    Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a\n    marble wall.\n\n                                KNIGHT\n                          Long time.\n\n                                TAUPIN\n                          Not so long.\n\n    The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.\n\n                                TAUPIN\n                          You've been here from the\n                          start.\n\n                                KNIGHT\n                          My quarry grows clever with\n                          age.

Another soldier's infantry\n    jacket is almost hilariously mis-buttoned, one collar sticking\n    up four inches higher than the other.\n\n    Dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying\n    brass buttons onto the ground.\n\n    He moves on.\n\n                                DUPONT\n                              (to soldier)\n                          Where is your bayonet?\n\n                                SOLIDER #3\n                          Lost it sir.\n\n                                DUPONT\n                          Where?\n\n    The soldier hedges.\n\n                                STAFF SARGEANT\n                          You heard the Major!

Hand it to me.\n\n    The soldier obeys.  Dupont inspects the firing mechanism.\n\n                                DUPONT\n                          The flint is cracked.  No spark\n                          will reach your powder.  You will\n                          die tomorrow.\n\n    He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands.\n\n                                DUPONT\n                          Tomorrow you go to _battle_!

If necessary\n                          you stand here all night!  Sargeant!\n\n    The sargeant leaps to attention.\n\n                                SARGEANT\n                          Yes sir.\n\n                                DUPONT\n                          See to it.\n\n                                SARGEANT\n                          Yes sir.\n\n    Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some-\n    thing.  He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen.\n\n    His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking\n    each face carefully.\n\n    One PRIVATE seizes his attention.  The private is cautious.\n\n                                DUPONT\n                          Your name?\n\n                                MULET\n                          Mulet.\n\n    It is as if Dupont knows him.  The two stare at each other.\n    Dupont turns and leaves.\n\n\n90  INT.

Someone's locked them.\n     She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight\n     walking to her with his stained sword.\n\n     With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and\n     runs down an opposite corridor.\n\n     THE KNIGHT\n\n     Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM\n     of his palm.\n\n     BRENNA\n\n     Has run out of corridor.  She looks back at the Knight closing\n     the distance.  CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for\n     a way out.\n\n     The Knight is nearly upon her.\n\n     In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing\n     its heavy door.\n\n     THE CLOSET\n\n     Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops.  Her BREATHING\n     is at a PANIC.\n\n     THE KNIGHT\n\n     Tries the door handle.\n     Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into\n     the wood.\n\n                                BRENNA\n                                (crying)\n                          Oh God...\n\n     He STRIKES again.

Oh God, go\n                          away!\n\n     CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far\n     wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch.\n\n     THE KNIGHT\n\n     Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing.\n     Brenna SCREAMS.\n     The door collapses.\n\n\n113  EXT.

A cup of coffee.\n\n    A typewriter.\n\n    Brenna tries to force thoughts to the surface.  CLACK-CLACK.\n    It is at last her journal article.  She types a line, then rips\n    it from the carriage and tears it to pieces.\n\n    The thoughts won't come.\n\n\n136 EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     136\n\n    Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group\n    of wild park cats.\n\n    A shadow covers her face.  She looks up.\n\n    It is Taupin.\n\n    Something has changed him.  His face is less cynical.  More\n    vulnerable.  More human.\n\n    He sits down on the grass beside her.\n\n                                BRENNA\n                             (after a moment)\n                          What are we supposed to say?\n\n    The cat's eyes are all fixed in Taupin.

Nothingness.  Bordered only\n                          by the quest for ultimate nothingness.\n                          Who would have guessed?\n\n                                BRENNA\n                          The inheritance.\n\n                                TAUPIN\n                          Not power.
