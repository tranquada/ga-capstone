It reverts to\nnothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve,\nthe warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.

Deepcore, this--\n\nWith a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything\ngoes black.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Well, that's that.\n\n                                BUD\n                Wonderful.\n                          (looking around)\n                There's some light from somewhere...\n\nA faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port.\nLindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Over there.  It's the rig.\n\nA glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the\nhill in the desert.\n\n                                BUD\n                Good hundred yards, I'd say.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                They'll come out after us.\n\n                                BUD\n                Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find\n                us.  We better get this flooding stopped.\n\nHe picks up his helmet and clicks on the light.  Using the thing like a bulky\nflashlight.  The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower...\nalmost two feet deep already.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                You see where it's coming in?\n\n                                BUD\n                Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.\n\nShe takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by\na steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.\n\n                                BUD\n                Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off.\n                You go any tools?\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                I don't know, look around.\n\nBud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water.  It's past his\nknees.\n\n                                BUD\n                Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn\n                crescent wrench.\n\nHe grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench\nit off the wall.  Heaves on it repeatedly.  Finally stops, panting.  He's\nbreathing hard now, and it's not just effort.\n\n                                BUD\n                Son of a bitch!\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Calm down, Bud.\n\nA nervous edge in her voice now.  Bud's turning all around, looking around\nfor anything, trying to think fast.  Water up to their waists.  The sea\nclosing in.\n\n                                BUD\n                Okay... okay.

I know!  But we better come up with\n                something.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!\n\nShe climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling,\nkeeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water.  She's\nshaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water\npouring in.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back\n                with another suit.\n\n                                BUD\n                Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough\n                time.  Look at this...\n                       (the rate of flooding)\n                Time I get back you'll be--\n\nThat stops the conversation for a second.  About two feet of airspace left.\nBud can't believe what this is coming down to.  They both stare at each other\nfor a long moment.\n\nHe makes a decision.  Starts pulling off his backpack.\n\n                                BUD\n                Alright, put this on.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You\n                got it on, keep it on.\n\n                                BUD\n                Don't argue, goddamnit, just--\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.\n\nBud has his pack off uncoupling it.  She keeps fighting his hands, stopping\nhim, hooking it back up.  The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.\n\n                                BUD\n                Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--\n\n                                BUD\n                FUCK LOGIC!!\n\nThey're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests.\nLindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?\n                You're for the suit on and you're a better\n                swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...\n\n                                BUD\n                What's the plan?\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                I drown, you tow me back to the rig--\n\n                                BUD\n                WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??\n\nLindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide.  But she's keeping\nit together.  Thinking it out.  Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her\nand he can barely think.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Look, this water is only a couple degrees above\n                freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia...\n                my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived\n                after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the\n                stuff to do it on the rig.\n\nBud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him.  The water is up\nto their necks.  He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.\n\n                                BUD\n                It is insane.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.\n\nShe takes a deep breath.  Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his\nsuit, rehooking everything.\n\n                                BUD\n                Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.\n\nShe raise his helmet.  Water up to their chins.  They lock eyes, inches\napart.  He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.\n\n                                BUD\n                Oh God, Lins... I--\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Tell me later.\n\nHe grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his.  They lock\ntogether in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked\nrealization of love hanging over the abyss of death.\n\nShe breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet\nover his head.  Seats is down over the neck ring.  Lock the bail-out handle,\nsealing it.  Even with her head press up into the highest point of the\nceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water.  She give a scared little\nlaugh.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?\n\nShe is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.  Puts her face to\nthe glass of his helmet.  Seconds to go.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...\n\nHe can't hear her, but he read her lips.  They clutch each other desperately.\nThe embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose.  She starts\nto choke.  Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes.\nBud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.\n\n                                BUD\n                NOOOOO!!!\n\nThe freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her\nhands float lifelessly.\n\nBud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open\nmouth.  He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of\nthe lockout hatch.\n\n                                                                CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Her arms and legs float\nas gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current.  Bud's voice comes in\nshort rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.\n\n                                BUD\n                Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...\n                de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc\n                syringe... and some... heating blankets.\n                You got all that?\n\n                                HIPPY (V.O.)\n                Got it.

He picks up the CPR cart, meant\nto roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who\nare crowding in to get the rest of the equipment.  They ransack the place in\nabout ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything\nelse.\n\nEXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER THE MOONPOOL                                        194\n\nBud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving\nplatform.  Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,\nlooking down.\n\nINT. SUB-BAY                                                            195\n\nHippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things,\nmaking mistakes.  One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a\nbottle of adrenaline.\n\n                                SONNY\n                Here he comes!\n\nJammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged\ndiving platform.  Bud bursts to the surface.  Together they haul Lindsey\nacross the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck.  Her skin is blue-\nwhite, her chest still.\n\nBud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a\nmission.  The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see\nLindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert.  Water flows from her mouth and\nnose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp.  Hippy peels back one\neyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.\n\nBut when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.\n\n                                BUD\n                Turn her over!\n\nThey flip his wife's body over.  He straddles her, pushing down with both\nhands in the middle of her back.  Seawater gushes from her slack lips.  He\ndoes it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.\n\n                                BUD\n                Come on, hurry!  Gimme the de-fib...\n\nOne Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment.  They've\nall been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a\nfriend they're working on.  They're all thumbs.  Catfish drops the electrodes,\npicks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...\n\n                                CATFISH\n                Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare\n                skin, or it won't...\n\nBud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her\nT-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.\n\n                                BUD\n                Jesus.  Gimme those, come on.  Catfish, move it,\n                man!  Come on... come on!\n\nHe slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on\nthe side of the rib cage.\n\n                                BUD\n                Is that it?

Do it!\n\nOne Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses.  It is a pure muscle\nreflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life.  Hippy pushes him\nback and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth.  He opens the valve\non the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag.  They start packing\nelectronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia\n\n                                BUD\n                Do it again, One Night.  Zap her again!\n\nThe current hits Lindsey again and her back arches.  Bud doesn't wait for a\nresult... he's in his own reality now, driven.  He's doing it all at once,\nsomehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands,\nsqueezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.\n\n                                BUD\n                Aw.  Christ... come on, baby.  Again!  Do it\n                again!\n\nLindsey's back arches.  Her body relaxes, inert.\n\n                                BUD\n                Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?\n\nA hush seems to have fallen over the group.  They know instinctively that it's\nover.  But Bud can't accept it.  He looks at them, beseechingly, like they\nare somehow intentionally holding out on him.  One Night starts to cry,\nquietly.\n\n                                CATFISH\n                                (gently)\n                Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.\n\nThere is a beat of silence.  Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open,\nmotionless eyes.\n\nTIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.\n\nREVERSE, HER POV.  SILENCE.  A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One\nNight, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down.  It is like the circular top of\na dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water.  It is\nas if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing\nsmaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes\na point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a\nturned-off TV.\n\nTIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring.  Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder.\nSuddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman,\nrenewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.\n\n                                BUD\n                No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong,\n                she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come\n                on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do\n                it... DO IT!\n\nThey do.  And Bud works, feverishly.  He lock his lips over hers and starts\nmouth-to-mouth.  It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.\n\n                                BUD\n                Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you\n                never backed down from anything in life... now\n                fight!\n\nHe slaps her face, hard.  Her head lolls.  He smacks her the other way.\n\n                                BUD\n                Fight, Goddamnit!\n\nLINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well.  The circles of faces and\nlight rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit.  We\nsee Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.\n\n                                BUD\n                FIGHT!!\n\nTIGHT ON LINDSEY, still.  Then something incredible happens.  Something they\nwill never forget as long as they live.  Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her\nhands clench in a spasm.\n\nBud see it and his expression becomes beatific.\n\n                                BUD\n                Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your\n                way back, baby...\n\nThe others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.\n\nShe starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air\ninto her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-\nestablish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking\nand howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.\n\nBud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized\nbreath.

We see what's\ndriving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being\nable to prevent this situation.\n\nHe touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling.\nThen he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's\nforearm.

He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.\nHis spasms subside.  He begins to \"breathe\" normally.  He gets a goofy look\nof wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is\nalive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins.\nGives a big thumbs up.  Lindsey picks up a microphone.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Can you hear me okay?\n                          (another thumbs up)\n                Try your keypad.\n\nBud taps out a brief message.

His chest barely moving.\n\nA strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly,\nhe raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.\n\nBUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to\nbe an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an\nextraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body\nand limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A\ndelicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates\ngently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The\nhead is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a\ncold, dispassionate wisdom.\n\nIt is stunningly beautiful.\n\nThe creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.\n\nIts slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from\nthe benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the\nabyss.\n\nAt the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They\nresolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey\nnearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And\nothers, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.\n\nSuddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of\nbrightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below\nthem, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the\ncenter, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing\ntheir home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a\nmajor city.\n\nEXT. N.T.I.

It is a\ncurving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,\nwhere controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional\nspace.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet\nacross, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.\n\nINT.

The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.\nThey move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.\n\nWeakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees.\nDoubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.\nHe lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what\nhe can only hope is air.  It is.\n\nBud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is\nhappening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the\nNTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven\nis gathered watching him.\n\n                                BUD\n                Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?\n\nHis voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.

They bow their heads, just for a moment.  A sign of respect.\n\nCLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.\n\n                                                                CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Withdrawn.\n\nThe others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark.\n\nThe air is looking pretty thick.

BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN                                         243\n\nA depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not\nswirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.\n\nIt gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.\n\nThe ocean is OPENING.\n\nNow the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous\npower boil up from the depths.\n\nMcBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.\n\nThe open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.\n\nThe ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.\n\nSOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly\ncurving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another\nspire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the\nenergy of Niagara.\n\nOff the port bow... another spire.\n\nAnd another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.\n\nSix towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.\n\nOne the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out\nthe sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF\nCREATION.\n\nAnd now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A\nPERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM\nTHE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.\n\nTHE NTI ARK.\n\nIt surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad\nback.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic\nbeing, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat\nhull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.\n\nThe bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of\nthe vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth\nnearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.\n\nON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy\ncontingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.\nTouched by the hand of God.\n\n                                BENDIX\n                Look...\n\nWHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore\nTwo.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the\nglistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.\n\nCLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.\n\nCatfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.\nStands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind\nhim.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into\nthe light of the sun.  A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever\nknow.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                We should be dead.

I think you could say that.\n\nShe blinks.  Seeing something not far away.  She gives a little laugh, or\nsomething between laughing and crying.\n\nREVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like\nenterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS\nhelmet dangles from one hand jauntily.\n\nShe starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.\nWatching him come to her.\n\nHis smile, his eyes illuminating her.\n\nHe stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?\n\nThe look at each other, wonderingly a moment.\n\nThen laugh.  She sniffs loudly.\n\n                                LINDSEY\n                Hello, Brigman.\n\n                                BUD\n                Hello, Mrs. Brigman.\n\nTheir lips meet.\n\n                                                                CUT TO BLACK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbyss, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0James Cameron\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:18:44.328305"}
