I took part\n                     in it.  And I think my words can help shed\n                     light on what happened.  My name is\n                     Abigail.  This is our story.\n\n\n<b>            FADE IN:\n</b>\n\n<b>            EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN\n</b>\n\n            Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of\n            rocky desert.  Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an\n            ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud\n            brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur.\n\n\n<b>            SUPER TITLE:\tSOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE\n</b>\n\n<b>                                    SIX MONTHS AGO\n</b>\n\n<b>            AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER\n</b>\n\n            kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep.  He\n            is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a\n            religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO.\n\n\n            Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS.  The sheepherder looks up --\n\n\n<b>            TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS\n</b>\n\n            approach from the East.  They touch down near the base of the\n            ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.\n\n\n<b>            FOUR FIGURES\n</b>\n\n            disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear.  They\n            wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the\n            teeth.  To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens.\n\n\n            One of the figures turns to the East.  We can see the rising\n            sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of\n            a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He\n            raises a gloved hand, gives the \"finger\" to the new day.\n\n\n            Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward.\n            They mount the central steps of the ziggurat.\n\n\n<b>            INT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY\n</b>\n\n            The shrine is empty.  The woman activates a wearable computing\n            device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat.\n\n\n            She kneels, studying the floor.  In the corner of the room she\n            identifies a particular brick and presses it.  We hear hidden\n            COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up --\n\n\n            -- revealing a stone stairway leading down.\n\n\n<b>            INT.

ZIGGURAT - BURIAL VAULT - DAY\n</b>\n\n            -- an empty room with an earthen floor.  The sunlight from\n            above barely penetrates down here.  One of the figures takes\n            out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating --\n\n\n            -- walls covered with CUNEIFORM WRITING.  The male figure who\n            flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset.\n\n\n<b>                                MALE FIGURE\n</b>                     That's great.

This is DANICA TALOS.  A\n            vampire.  Intense, appearing to be in her 30s.  Possessing a\n            regal air.  She wears a silver crucifix around her neck.\n\n\n<b>                                DANICA\n</b>                     Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood.

All vampires:\n\n\n            GRIMWOOD (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique\n            and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs.\n\n\n            ASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma.\n\n\n            WOLFE (30s), quiet and deliberative.  Right now he's readying\n            a portable ground-penetrating radar unit.\n\n\n            Grimwood studies the writing on the walls.\n\n\n<b>                                GRIMWOOD\n</b>                     What is this chicken-scratch?\n\n\n<b>                                DANICA\n</b>                     Cuneiform.

The image resolves\n            further.  It's definitely a BODY.  Then, we hear the low\n            RUMBLING of more hidden counter-weights and --\n\n\n<b>            A SLAB OF STONE\n</b>\n\n            slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault.\n\n\n<b>                                GRIMWOOD\n</b>                     What the fuck --?!\n\n\n            Grimwood pounds his fist against the stone.  It's solid.  He\n            tries to find a hand-hold, tries to shoulder it open in some\n            way, but the barrier is unmovable.  They're trapped.\n\n\n<b>                                ASHER\n</b>                     Radio back-up.

A tiny depression has formed,\n            with sand funneling into it.\n\n\n            Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole. \n            The grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression\n            gradually widening.  Curious, Wolfe leans closer --\n\n\n<b>            A CLAWED, ARMORED HAND\n</b>\n\n            suddenly EXPLODES upward from the ground.  It latches onto\n            Wolfe's neck.  dragging him down head-first!\n\n\n            Wolfe THRASHES, his head still buried beneath the sand.  He\n            knocks over the lantern, which FLICKERS, shorting out.\n\n\n            Asher rushes to Wolfe's side.  Then Grimwood.  They grab Wolfe\n            by the shoulders, SCREAMING, trying to pull him back.\n\n\n            Asher is KICKED by Wolfe's thrashing legs.  He flies upward,\n            hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned --\n\n\n            Danica joins Grimwood.  Abruptly, they wrest Wolfe free --\n            headless.  BLOOD erupts from the sand.  Then --\n\n\n<b>            A HELLISH CREATURE\n</b>\n\n            unearths itself, ROARING.  It's difficult to make out in the\n            flickering light.  But what we do see is terrifying.  Spiked,\n            demonic armor, clutching a sword.  An elongated, helmeted face\n            with a blood-splattered set of hinged fangs -- hinting at an\n            inhuman physiognomy within.  The hinged jaws open, coming at\n            us.
