BRIDGE - DAY\t\t\t\t     2\n</b>\nAn empty causeway spans a bay somewhere along the south shore\nof Long Island. The sky is overcast. SHEILA, a woman in her\nlate twenties, wearing a full length heliotrope pleather coat\nover a waitress outfit, kneels in the middle of the road. A\nsouped-up Vespa motor scooter stands nearby.\n\n<b>KEN AND BARBIE\n</b>\nSheila holds a Bridal Barbie and Ken doll set. She sets them\ndown on the road, pulls out a can of lighter fluid and soaks\nthe dolls. She pulls out a bowling pin-shaped lighter and\ntorches the nuptial tableau.\n\n<b>3     INT. THEO'S CAR\t\t\t\t       3\n</b>\nTheo drives his ratty old American car along a highway. The\ncar has Ohio plates. He sucks coffee from a 7-Eleven \"Big-\nSwig\" cup and examines a map. A yellow plastic \"Bowler on\nBoard\" sign is stuck to a side window. Theo's music PLAYS.\nHis eyes nod off, then snap awake.\n\n<b>4     NIGHTMARE\t\t\t\t\t\t4\n</b>\nThe screen is black, except for three circles in the middle\nof the screen. The light shining through them is snuffed out\nby three large pink objects.

The RUMBLING\n\tball is heard in the distance like a\n\tfurious hulking steamroller of doom. The\n\tpins begin to tremble, and then transform\n\tinto a Bridal Ken and Barbie. The dolls\n\tburst into flame.\n\n<b>\t\tBALL\n</b>\tThe ball blasts past the camera and\n\tmetamorphoses into Theo's car.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t   RAPID DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>5     EXT.

Theo's car hits the pair and\n\tthey fly into the air in slow-motion. A\n\tdistant SOUND of pins scattering is\n\theard. The two dolls smoke as they spin\n\tinto the sky, then hit the water with\n\tdual HISSES.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t        DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>6     PIN RESET MACHINERY\t\t\t\t   6\n</b>\nAn American Machine and Foundry pin reset machine performs\nits functions like a mechanical ballet as the camera follows\na bowling ball through its journey. The \"Spare Me!\" theme\nMUSIC (similar to \"Balboa Blue\" by the Marketts) swells.\nTITLE: SPARE ME! appears on the bowling ball. Pins tumble\nacross the back plate, are loaded into the pin conveyor,\nlifted up to the crown feeder, distributed into the rotating\ncarousel, and then set down in perfect formation upon the\npolished bowling alley.\n\nBURN-IN PRINCIPAL PLAYER TITLES. Titles appear on the pins.\nThe ball trundles along the return trough straight into the\nlens.\n\n<b>BLACK\n</b>\n<b>7     INT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY\t\t\t\t   7\n</b>\nA muzak cover of 'Broke, Busted, and Disgusted' PLAYS in the\nbackground as Theo gingerly pulls a hot taco out of the\nmicrowave oven. ALFIE, the rickety old man who runs the\nstore, shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping\nit down. Theo pokes at the taco with a spork as steam rises.\nHe pulls a disgusted grimace. Alfie pours himself a cup of\ncoffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half &amp;\nhalf. Because his hands are shaking so much, the cream goes\neverywhere but into the coffee.\n\n<b>\t\tALFIE\n</b>\tI'm an addict. I can't go through a day\n\twithout the stuff.

Theo's temper\nis rising, he breathes deeply. He is obviously making a\nHerculean effort to keep himself in check.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tI said, let go of my bag.\n\nWith lightning speed Theo's hand shoots out and grabs the\nmiddle fingers on Sid's right hand. Sid howls in agony.\n\n<b>\t\tSID\n</b>\tAagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tTell your little pal to let go.\n\n<b>\t\tSID\n</b>\tBreeze, give him his ball back!\n\nBreeze, astonished, drops Theo's ball into the bag.

BUZZ'S HOUSE\t\t\t\t    13\n</b>\nTheo rings the doorbell. The porch light comes on, and\nMILLIE, a fifty-five year-old woman dressed for a night on\nthe town in Reno, but with fuzzy slippers and a hairnet,\nopens the door. A miniscule neurotic poodle leaps at Theo's\nbowling ball bag, YAPPING and snapping at it.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tIs Mr. Fazeli in please?\n\n<b>\t\tMILLIE\n</b>\tWho wants to know?\n\t\t(to dog)\n\tZeus!\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tI'm a bowler.\n\n<b>\t\tMILLIE\n</b>\tI'm sick of you people.

BUZZ'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM\t\t\t 14\n</b>\nMillie and Theo, with Zeus hot on his trail, enter the room.\nBUZZ FAZELI, a sixty-five year-old man shaped a lot like a\ncompressed bowling pin, slouches in a recliner. The room is\ndecorated with trophies of Buzz's bygone pro-bowling halcyon\ndays.\n\n<b>\t\tMILLIE\n</b>\tOh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I\n\tleave the door wide open.

C'mere.\n\nZeus growls at Buzz as he comes nearer, then clamps onto his\nsleeve and hangs from his arm, growling ferociously.

You forced\n\tyourself into this mess, so the mess\n\taccommodated you.\n\tBuzz straightens out and carefully\n\tremolds the bent out of shape halo.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tWhat about bowling?\n\n<b>\t\tBUZZ\n</b>\t\t(takes a practice swing)\n\tBowling died for me years ago. Besides,\n\tI'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tYou're a scumbag.\n\nBuzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head.\n\n<b>\t\tBUZZ\n</b>\tI'm a live scumbag.\n\nTheo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball. He\ntosses it to Buzz.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tNice knowing you, dad.\n\nTheo turns and walks towards his car. Buzz pauses and walks\nafter him.\n\n<b>\t\tBUZZ\n</b>\tSo, eh, you never saw me. Right?\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tI never saw you.\n\n<b>\t\tBUZZ\n</b>\tThanks, kid.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tWhere are you goin' now?\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tI'm goin' straight. No more short cuts.\n\tTheo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the\n\topen window.\n\n<b>\t\tBUZZ\n</b>\tListen, if straight doesn't work out, you\n\tcome work for me.\n\t\t(hands Theo his card)\n\tJust make sure nobody's following you.\n\tBuzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of\n\tthe sunset, his halo bouncing in the\n\tbreeze.\n\n<b>\t\tBUZZ\n</b>\tI didn't mean that stuff I said. I was\n\ttrying to keep you out of this muddle.\n\tI'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh,\n\tand by the way, I made a call for you\n\tbefore I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his\n\tcard and scrawl on the back with a gold\n\tpen.\n\n<b>\t\tBUZZ\n</b>\t\t(hands the card back)\n\tYou give Ed Klein of the American Bowling\n\tCongress a call.\n\t\t(taps the card)\n\tTell him your Maynard's boy. He's\n\texpecting you, and he owes me. He'll\n\tgetcha back in like Flynn.\n\t\t(pats Theo's cheek)\n\tDon't say I never gave you nothing.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\t\t(cracks a half smile)\n\tSee ya 'round Maynard.\n\nBuzz backs away from the car as Theo peels out in reverse.\nBuzz stands and watches as Theo pulls away.\n\n<b>80     EXT. MILES 'O' LANES PARKING LOT - DAY\t\t   80\n</b>\nThe sign has been changed to \"SHEILA'S ALLEY.\" A sparkling\nnew badass super-chromed Vespa is parked in the handicap\nzone. The Barbie and Ken dolls are wired to the headlamp.\nThey look incredibly worse for the wear. A parking ticket is\nnestled between them. Theo's car pulls in nearby.\n\n<b>81     INT. SHEILA'S ALLEY\t\t\t\t  81\n</b>\nTheo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with\nserious bowling types. As he walks towards the back of the\nalley, several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe.\n\n<b>\t\tLUNA\n</b>\tTheo! Howya doin'?\n\nTheo walks on. Others greet the conquering hero.\n\n<b>\t\tBOWLER\n</b>\tTheo! Hey, Theo's back!\n\n<b>\t\tTINA\n</b>\tHello there, stranger.\n\n<b>\t\tLITTLE GIRL\n</b>\t\t(still crying)\n\tWaaaaaaaaaaah!\n\nAt the far end, we see Sheila, dressed in a fitted jogging\nsuit, bowling alone on her lane. Bowlers stop and hold their\nballs at their sides. Sheila notices the whole alley is\nsilent. Theo steps up to the lane, bowling ball bag in hand.\nAs he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and\nsees a seven-ten split; mule ears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>82     BLACKNESS\t\t\t\t\t  82\n</b>\nA loud ZIP and light spills in through three holes. Three\nfingers approach the holes, blocking out the light once more.\nWith a POP, the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the\nlane with a KLUNK.\n\n<b>LANE\n</b>\nThe camera races towards the pins along the maple boards.\n\n<b>PINS\n</b>\nTwo pins loom in the foreground, one at each edge of the\nscreen. The ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow\nmotion with a ROAR. Theo's eyes slowly close. The pin lifts\nand hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting\nfellow pin. Theo's eyes open. With a reverberating EXPLOSION,\nthe pin is taken out.\n\n<b>83     INT. SHEILA'S ALLEY, THEO &amp; SHEILA\t\t       83\n</b>\nTheo turns to Sheila and takes her in his arms.\n\n<b>\t\tSHEILA\n</b>\tVery professional.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tI am a professional man.\n\n<b>\t\tSHEILA\n</b>\t\t(touches his lips)\n\tLips still for sale?\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\t\t(nonchalantly)\n\tYou bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw\n\tin the tongue.\n\n<b>\t\tSHEILA\n</b>\t\t(she pulls away, slightly)\n\tCan you change something this big?\n\nShe pulls out a hundred dollar bill.\n\n<b>\t\tTHEO\n</b>\tI don't know.\n\nSheila stuffs the bill down Theo's pants.\n\n<b>\t\tSHEILA\n</b>\tYou'll owe me.\n\nThey smooch big time. One by one, balls drop to the lanes\nagain and pins start CRASHING.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t        DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>84     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY\t\t\t\t  84\n</b>\nAlfie, hands trembling, lays a tiny wreath on Buzz Fazeli's\ngrave. The headstone reads, \"Maynard 'Buzz' Fazeli 'I Never\nMet A Bowler I Didn't Like.'\" A muffled watch beeper CHIMES\n\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.\" The camera pulls up to\nshow ten headstones laid out in a bowling pin set-up with\nBuzz's at the head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t        DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>85     EXT. MINI-GOLF COURSE\t\t\t\t85\n</b>\nBuzz's silhouette against an orange sunburst sky. He wears\nhis halo hat. He takes a beautiful PGA-perfect slow motion\nfluid golf swing, connecting with a THWAP. As he follows\nthrough, divots of turf dance at his feet. MUSIC swells. He\nholds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball, off into\nthe distance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t  FADE OUT\n</b>\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Spare Me</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Christopher Grimm\" title=\"Scripts by Christopher Grimm\">Christopher Grimm</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Matthew Harrison\" title=\"Scripts by Matthew Harrison\">Matthew Harrison</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Spare Me Script.html#comments\" title=\"Spare Me comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:16:54.781231"}
