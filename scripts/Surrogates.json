CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING\r\n\r\n          A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night.\r\n          This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the\r\n          mirrored surface of a helmet visor.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE\r\n          RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,\r\n          climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.\r\n          He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He\r\n          conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the\r\n          building's entrance.\r\n          A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for\r\n          a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.\r\n          THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what\r\n          looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at\r\n\r\n          TUXEDO.\r\n          SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A\r\n          digital readout: \"SCANNING...\" Then a long SERIAL\r\n          NUMBER reads out and the name, \"LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,\"\r\n          along with other personal information below.\r\n          THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He\r\n          reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious\r\n          DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has\r\n          a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety\r\n          switches and buttons.\r\n          The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can\r\n\r\n                         REACH HIM--\r\n          A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in\r\n          the back. They're gone in an instant.\r\n          The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He\r\n          starts it and pursues the limousine.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

KENNEDY CENTER - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          FORMAL CROWDS, a RED CARPET, signs for an OPERA. The\r\n          LIMOUSINE approaches.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome\r\n          man in a suit named ARMANDO.\r\n\r\n                         TUXEDO\r\n          I'm not really in the mood for\r\n          opera, Armando.\r\n          ARMANDO nods knowingly pulls back into traffic.\r\n\r\n                         ARMANDO\r\n          F Street?\r\n\r\n                         TUXEDO\r\n\r\n                         (UNDOING BOWTIE)\r\n          You read my mind.

WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area,\r\n          pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X.\r\n          TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open.\r\n\r\n                         TUXEDO\r\n          I can find my way back.\r\n          ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the\r\n          entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a\r\n          SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he\r\n          disappears inside.\r\n          THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo\r\n          has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch\r\n          up with him.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          The ASSASSIN takes off his helmet, tries the door. It\r\n          won't move. He buzzes the intercom. The DOOR slides\r\n          open a crack--\r\n          THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED\r\n          EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING\r\n          BEAT of MUSIC within. The BOUNCER narrows his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         BOUNCER\r\n          This is a private club.\r\n\r\n                         ASSASSIN\r\n          I just need to talk to--\r\n          THE STEEL DOOR has already shut in his face.\r\n\r\n          INT. THE PIT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          POUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh\r\n          pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful,\r\n          others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at\r\n          each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the\r\n          edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An\r\n          incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on\r\n          the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them.\r\n          A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The\r\n          MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes,\r\n          with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up.\r\n          IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage,\r\n          numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making\r\n          out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here.\r\n          TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached\r\n          to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE\r\n          on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own\r\n          neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His\r\n          features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he\r\n          lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a\r\n          sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC:\r\n\r\n                         BLONDE\r\n          Mind if I join you?\r\n          A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes\r\n          stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures\r\n          graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the\r\n          cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth,\r\n          SPARKS fly to her tongue and--\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          RAIN pours down as TUXEDO and the BLONDE burst out the\r\n          door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they\r\n          grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting\r\n          drenched in the warm downpour.\r\n          WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,\r\n          as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him,\r\n\r\n                         TURNS--\r\n\r\n                         TUXEDO\r\n          Get lost, meatbag.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S\r\n          SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her\r\n          head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE\r\n          START from the alleyway.\r\n          THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her\r\n          body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night.\r\n          CAMERA PULLS UP to--\r\n\r\n          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          --an AERIAL VIEW of the rain-swept CITY, some futuristic\r\n          HIGH-RISES amongst the recognizeable landmarks. Also, a\r\n          great number of SUPER-CELL TOWERS and DISHES,\r\n          considerably larger than the ones we see today.\r\n          CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part\r\n          of the city, tenements and vacant lots. MOVE DOWN and\r\n          through a third-story window of--\r\n\r\n          INT. ABANDONED PROJECT BUILDING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move\r\n          stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand.\r\n          The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both\r\n          are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life\r\n          in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to\r\n          make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he\r\n          feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer,\r\n          her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          GREER, in the lead, waves PETERS up. They approach a\r\n          door at the end of the hall. We see now that their\r\n          windbreakers read \"FBI.\"\r\n          GREER kicks open the door--\r\n\r\n          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Lit by CANDLES and KEROSENE LANTERNS, SMOKE HANGS in the\r\n          room. We glimpse BODIES hanging from the ceiling in\r\n          CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the\r\n          place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a\r\n          bedroom and a CRASH--\r\n          THE PSYCHO who lives here has kicked over a LANTERN, FIRE\r\n          spills across the floor. We glimpse a surprisingly good-\r\n          looking guy, grinning maniacally. He dashes across the\r\n\r\n                         ROOM--\r\n          GREER squeezes off a couple of SHOTS. The PSYCHO's too\r\n          fast, he LEAPS through a cracked WINDOW.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ABANDONED PROJECTS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          RAIN has let up. The PSYCHO FALLS thirty feet into a\r\n          pile of soft DIRT and TRASH. He rolls to the bottom,\r\n          gets to his feet and runs.\r\n          GREER looks down from the broken window.\r\n\r\n          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          PETERS is beating at the FLAMES with a towel, sees Greer\r\n          is preparing to jump.\r\n\r\n                         PETERS\r\n          Let's call for back-up.\r\n\r\n                         GREER\r\n          Where'.s the sport in that?\r\n\r\n                         PETERS\r\n\r\n                         IT'S PROTOCOL--\r\n          GREER SNORTS and--\r\n\r\n          EXT.

He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through\r\n          the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still\r\n          alive. He tries to get up, but--\r\n          GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast\r\n          against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes,\r\n          points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head.\r\n\r\n                         GREER (CONT'D)\r\n          Stay with me asshole--\r\n\r\n                         PSYCHO\r\n          Why would I do that?\r\n          The PSYCHO grins-- then his head lolls back, eyes empty.\r\n\r\n          INT. PSYCHO'S LAIR - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          PETERS is by a WOMAN'S BODY on the floor, holding a\r\n          pocket SCANNER close to her head. This small device\r\n          resembles an iPhone. There's tape over the woman's eyes\r\n          and mouth, which Peters peels away as she speaks into a\r\n          tiny cellphone earpiece.\r\n\r\n                         PETERS\r\n          Is this Kathy Welles...?

The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore\r\n          and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,\r\n          oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.\r\n          We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated\r\n          synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs).

PORTRAITS of the PROPHET (the man we heard on the\r\n          radio), long-haired and bearded, adorn the fence.\r\n          There's a GATE, with two GUARDS checking those entering,\r\n          one or two people are waiting.\r\n\r\n                         GREER (CONT'D)\r\n          He gets through the gate, we can't\r\n          touch him.\r\n          GREER readies a RIFLE with a SCOPE, loads a TRANQUILIZER\r\n          DART into the chamber.

His stump of an arm SPARKS and leaks\r\n          HYDRAULIC FLUID. He reacts at the sight of--\r\n          A CORPSE on the ground, an older man crushed by a hunk of\r\n          DEBRIS from the chopper. But it's not the corpse that\r\n          interests him-- his DART RIFLE lies nearby, thrown from\r\n          the chopper during the crash.\r\n          GREER grabs it in his right hand.

Greer supports\r\n          the rifle with the stump of his missing arm and FIRES--\r\n          STRICKLAND is hit in the back, the force of the shot\r\n          knocks him off his feet.\r\n          GREER strides over to STRICKLAND, seemingly oblivious to\r\n          the CROWD of Dreads collecting around him, pointing at\r\n          him angrily.\r\n          STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed.

Some begin speaking to\r\n          each other for the first time, in whispers at first,\r\n          others take in the SUNSET which bathes the neighborhood\r\n          in orange light.\r\n\r\n          FADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nSurrogates\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John Brancato\u00a0\u00a0Michael Ferris\u00a0\u00a0Robert Venditti\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:45.116445"}
