FRONT YARD.  DAY.\n\n        Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of\n        unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class\n        residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in\n        shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram\n        to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed\n        Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades\n        point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be\n        ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An\n        attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.\n\n        Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the\n        front door.

COURTROOM.\n\n        The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing\n        argument blandly.

This defendant possesses a\n                    superior intelligence, which he uses to a\n                    destructive and antisocial end. His\n                    computer virus crashed one thousand five\n                    hundred and seven computer systems,\n                    including Wall Street trading systems,\n                    single handedly causing a seven point drop\n                    in the New York Stock Market.\n\n        As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning\n        down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade\n        Murphy.\n\n        Fast forward to the sentencing.\n\n                                JUDGE\n                    Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family\n                    forty-five thousand dollars...\n\n        The court gasps, Dade's father winces\n\n                                JUDGE\n                    ...and sentence you to probation, under\n                    which you are forbidden to own or operate\n                    a computer or touch tone telephone, until\n                    the day of your eighteenth birthday.\n\n        Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.\n\n        Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family\n        and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and\n        photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.\n\n                        SEVEN YEARS LATER.\n\n        Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the\n        window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the\n        aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a\n        direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,\n        which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips\n        and digital signals on a stylised computer board.

He closes his eyes and a flurry\n        of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.\n        He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and\n        then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback\n        System. There is a graphic representation of the\n        station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his\n        TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh\n        type TV show.\n\n                                COMMENTATOR\n                                (on TV)\n                    ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and\n                    Blacks come from a genetically mediocre\n                    stock...\n\n                                DADE\n                    Yak yak yak. Get a job!\n\n        Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer\n        diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm\n        selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of\n        tapes.  The \"America First\" tape slides out of the VTR and\n        is replaced by an episode of \"The Outer Limits\" as Dade\n        watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.\n\n                                TV\n                    You are about to experience the awe and\n                    mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,\n                    to...

Apparently so does Acid Burn. The\n        tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes\n        fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps\n        changing.\n\n        The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:\n\n                        I WILL\n                        SWAT U LIKE\n                        THE FLY U R\n\n        More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.\n        Another message.\n\n                        I WILL\n                        SNAP YOUR BACK\n                        LIKE A TOOTHPICK\n\n        As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:\n\n                        MESS WITH THE BEST\n                        DIE LIKE THE REST\n\n        One last from Acid Burn:\n\n                        YOU ARE\n                        TERMINATED\n\n        Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection\n        is terminated.\n\n                                DADE\n                    Shit on me!\n\n        Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges\n        from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging\n        moving boxes) for the fridge.\n\n                                MRS.

NEW YORK CITY.\n\n        We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun\n        shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day\n        and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment\n        on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.\n\nINT. HIGH SCHOOL.\n\n        At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,\n        head to class.  Dade looks lost among them. He walks up\n        to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle\n        shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.\n\n                                DADE\n                    Excuse me.\n\n                                KID\n                    Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.\n\n                                DADE\n                    Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the\n                    principal's office.\n\n                                KID\n                    Sorry, I can't help you, okay?\n\n        Now Dade really looks lost.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.\n\n        Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a\n        condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it\n        there with gum.\n\nINT. PHREAK'S ROOM.\n\n        Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking\n        career. He knows he's about to be busted.\n\nDREAM SEQUENCE.\n\n        The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He\n        still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically\n        going through everything.

Vamano.\n                    Time for school, come on.\n\n        The secret service bursts in through the window just as\n        Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps\n        to his feet.\n\n                                AGENT\n                    Secret Service, don't move!\n\n                                PHREAK\n                    Deja vu!\n\n                                AGENT BOB\n                    Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the\n                    Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.\n\n        Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping\n        Phreak, cursing in Spanish.\n\n                                PHREAK\n                    What are you waiting for, arrest me already!\n\nINT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.\n\n        The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened\n        thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he\n        is led to his one phone call.\n\n                                COP\n                    You get one call. Uno. Understand?\n\n        The cop locks the dial on the phone.\n\n        Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He\n        starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a\n        ringing tone.\n\n                                OPERATOR\n                    Hello, operator services.\n\n                                PHREAK\n                    Hello, operator?

And there's stuff I didn't even do,\n                    like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and\n                    they keep asking about you guys.\n\n                                KATE\n                    You think they're going to bust us?\n\n                                PHREAK\n                    Yeah! You better figure out what's on that\n                    disc, cause we're being framed.

SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.\n\n        Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the\n        boys look on amusedly.  She finds the disc behind the\n        condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from\n        the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.\n\nINT. DADE'S PLACE.\n\n        Kate knocks.
