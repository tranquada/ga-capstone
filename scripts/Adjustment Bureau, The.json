Rain pours down on\r\n          them.\r\n          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are\r\n          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen\r\n          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;\r\n          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the\r\n          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They\r\n          hang their legs over the edge and jump.\r\n          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --\r\n          except somehow they find themselves running across the same\r\n          roof they were just on.\r\n          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a\r\n          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open\r\n          from inside.\r\n          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the\r\n          building's edge they climb over again and... run...\r\n          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were\r\n          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.\r\n          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as\r\n          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent\r\n          roofs. They're completely surrounded.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ELISE\r\n</b>          Kiss me.\r\n          Tears well in her eyes.

The Silver Suits are gone. And the\r\n          rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them...\r\n          They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing\r\n          there, alone.\r\n\r\n<b>                         THE CHAIRMAN\r\n</b>          Hello, David...
