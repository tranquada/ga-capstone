He seems relaxed and\r\n          confident. Content. Completely in his element.\r\n          In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of\r\n          individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the\r\n          muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:\r\n\r\n          VOICE ON PA SYSTEM\r\n          Thank you so much for coming today--\r\n          A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.\r\n\r\n                         BLUE BLAZER\r\n          Congressman Norris-?\r\n          Now REVEAL that we're \u00c2\u00b1fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building\r\n          at St. Johns University.

He feeds off it.\r\n          --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a\r\n          tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking\r\n          into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice.

Total silence again. It bothers him.\r\n          He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his\r\n          itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and\r\n          meetings across the state.\r\n          He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the\r\n          page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech\r\n          he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open\r\n          Space Initiative.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n\r\n                         (TESTING HIMSELF)\r\n          Karen Woods, founder.

Fifteen strangers around him\r\n          as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's\r\n          clearly losing his voice.

She blows him\r\n           a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips\r\n          a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Harry flips to a bookmarked\r\n          page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:\r\n          Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric\r\n          symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a\r\n          language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.\r\n          And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the\r\n          lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n          Oh...shit...\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Like he's in a wax museum.\r\n          He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver\r\n          protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).\r\n          One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached\r\n          to the left side.of Charlie's skull.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          Jesus!\r\n          Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see\r\n          David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the\r\n          \"security guards\" who chased Elise away on election night.\r\n\r\n          DAVID (,.CONT'D)\r\n          What the hell are you doing?!\r\n          Richardson blinks Clearly surprised.

It's locked.\r\n          He sprints away into an internal hallway.

Jumps the last\r\n          five steps and hits the floor hard.\r\n          As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is\r\n          frozen solid.\r\n          David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find\r\n          Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall.\r\n          Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast--\r\n          David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a\r\n          chloroform rag shoved right at us.

The wind picks\r\n           up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them\r\n           warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a\r\n          ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.\r\n          EXT. CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY\r\n          The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so\r\n          there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands\r\n          looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n          A lot of people just collapse when\r\n          they see what you've s'een. Their\r\n          personal choices suddenly seem\r\n          meaningless to them. Life starts\r\n          to feel pointless.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          I was` raised to believe there's\r\n          something behind the curtain. I\r\n          just never pictured it quite like\r\n          this.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n          Most people don't.\r\n          Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his\r\n          colleagues. He's far from relaxed.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n          How are you feeling?\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          You should know.

Finally:\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n          Richardson was just trying to scare\r\n          you.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          He knew what color I was thinking.\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n          Because he set it up as a choice.\r\n          \"Choose a color. Choose a number\"\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          So?\r\n          Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting\r\n          himself out there:\r\n\r\n                         HARRY\r\n          We can't read your mind or hear\r\n          your thoughts.

MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside\r\n          David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's\r\n           already awake, staring at the ceiling...\r\n           After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it\r\n          off. But then just lies there...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2/12/09 41.\r\n\r\n           INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING\r\n\r\n           It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead\r\n           of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six\r\n          windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to\r\n           his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed.\r\n           No files on the table, like there were the last time we were\r\n          here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.\r\n\r\n           CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)\r\n          How are you feeling about the\r\n          speech?\r\n          David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and\r\n          subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          I'm ready... I changed a few\r\n          things last night.\r\n\r\n          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)\r\n          Tell me at breakfast.\r\n\r\n          THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID\r\n          David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is\r\n          a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a\r\n          moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the\r\n          park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years\r\n          ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.\r\n\r\n          INT. BUS -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the\r\n          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more\r\n          out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.\r\n\r\n          INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with\r\n          a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the\r\n          window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.\r\n          DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2/12/09 42.\r\n          David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back\r\n          now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same\r\n          eclectic style. He slams the red \"next stop\" strip, jumps\r\n          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          Stop the bus.\r\n\r\n                         DRIVER\r\n          The next stop--\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          Now.\r\n\r\n          EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as\r\n          he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He\r\n          catches up to her at University Place.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          Elise!\r\n          The woman turns around.\r\n          And it's her...\r\n\r\n                         ELISE\r\n          David?\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          Hi.\r\n\r\n                         ELISE\r\n          Wow...

But his\r\n          expression is dead serious.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID (CONT'D)\r\n          Can we go somewhere and talk?\r\n          She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at\r\n          herself for that, but it's the truth.\r\n\r\n                         ELISE\r\n          (re: his suit)\r\n          Don't you have to get to work?\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          I just got sick.\r\n\r\n                         ELISE\r\n          \"I haven't seen you in three years -\r\n          - You make me sick\" is not an\r\n          ideal come-on. For the record.\r\n          David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone\r\n          vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          One second.\r\n\r\n                         (PICKING UP)\r\n          CharlieT can't make breakfast.\r\n\r\n          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)\r\n          Why not?\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          And...I might have to push the\r\n          speech.\r\n\r\n          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)\r\n          What?

ROOF -- DAY\r\n\r\n          David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some\r\n          concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on\r\n          them.\r\n          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are\r\n          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen\r\n          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;\r\n          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the\r\n          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They\r\n          hang their legs over the edge and jump.\r\n          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --\r\n          except somehow they find themselves running across the same\r\n          roof they were just on.\r\n          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a\r\n          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open\r\n          from inside.\r\n          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the\r\n          building's edge they climb over again and... run...\r\n          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were\r\n          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.\r\n          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as\r\n          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent\r\n          roofs.

The Silver Suits are gone. And the\r\n          rain has stopped.
