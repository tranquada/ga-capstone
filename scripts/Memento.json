Her little joke because you were such a slob-always\nlate, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident.\n\nRight about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers.\n\nYou were there, you can be sure of that. That's what the picture's\nfor-the one tacked to the wall by the door. It's not customary to take\npictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, I guess, knew you\nwouldn't remember. They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it\nright there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every\ntime you got up to find out where she was.\n\nThe guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? That's you. And what\nare you doing? You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out\nwho's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to\nfigure why someone stuck that picture next to your door. But why\nbother reading something that you won't remember?\n\nShe's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing\nthe news. Believe me, I know how you feel. You're probably a wreck.\nBut give it five minutes, maybe ten. Maybe you can even go a whole\nhalf hour before you forget.\n\nBut you will forget-I guarantee it. A few more minutes and you'll be\nheading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down\nwhen you find the picture. How many times do you have to hear the news\nbefore some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of\nyours, starts to remember?\n\nNever-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless without direction.\nMaybe you can't understand what's happened. Can't say I really\nunderstand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's what the sign says. CRS\ndisease. Your guess is as good as mine.\n\nMaybe you can't understand what happened to you. But you do remember\nwhat happened to HER, don't you? The doctors don't want to talk about\nit. They won't answer my questions. They don't think it's right for a\nman in your condition to hear about those things. But you remember\nenough, don't you? You remember his face.\n\nThis is why I'm writing to you. Futile, maybe. I don't know how many\ntimes you'll have to read this before you listen to me. I don't even\nknow how long you've been locked up in this room already. Neither do\nyou. But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write\nyourself off as a lost cause.\n\nSooner or later you'll want to do something about it. And when you do,\nyou'll just have to trust me, because I'm the only one who can help\nyou.\n\n***\n\nEARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles\ninterrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large\nenough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing\nsomewhere. He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look\nat the room.\n\nIt's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the\ncurtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm\nclock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white\ncurtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top\nof his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and\nslippers.\n\nHe lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says,\nin crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A\nHOSPITAL. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW.\n\nEarl rises and takes a look around. The room is large for a\nhospital-empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three\ndirections. Two doors and a window. The view isn't very helpful,\neither-a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece\nof turf that terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop. The trees,\nexcept for the evergreens, are bare-early spring or late fall, one or\nthe other.\n\nEvery inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes, legal pads,\nneatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On top\nof the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock is\nriding a pile of folded newspapers. Earl slaps the snooze button and\ntakes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing\ngown. He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. He rifles\nthe papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. Eventually\nhe finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the\nwindow. Another sign is taped just above the box. It says in loud\nyellow letters, CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID.\n\nEarl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw.\nTaped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf\npaper headed YOUR SCHEDULE.\n\nIt charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00\na.m. is labeled go BACK TO SLEEP. Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15.\nGiven the light outside, it must be morning. He checks his watch:\n10:30. He presses the watch to his ear and listens. He gives the watch\na wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock.\n\nAccording to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been\nlabeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Earl laughs again and walks over to the\nbathroom.\n\nThe bathroom window is open. As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he\nnotices the ashtray on the windowsill. A cigarette is perched on the\nashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash. He frowns,\nextinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one.\n\nThe toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste.\nThe tap is of the push-button variety-a dose of water with each nudge.\nEarl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth\nwhile he opens the medicine cabinet. The shelves are stocked with\nsingle-serving packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The\nmouthwash is also single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue\nliquid in a sealed plastic bottle. Only the toothpaste is\nregular-sized. Earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it\nwith the mouthwash. As he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste,\nhe notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and\nthe steel backing of the medicine cabinet. He spits the frothy blue\nfluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down.\nHe closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the\nmirror.\n\n\"Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth?\"\n\nThe paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the\nprecision of a sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds it and smooths\nit against the mirror. It reads-\n\nIF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD.\n\nEarl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again. He turns it\nover. On the back it reads-\n\nP.S.: AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN.\n\nEarl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its\noriginal size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste.\n\nMaybe then he notices the scar. It begins just beneath the ear, jagged\nand thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline. Earl turns his\nhead and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's\nprogress. He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the\ncigarette burning in the ashtray. A thought seizes him and he spins\nout of the bathroom.\n\nHe is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob. Two\npictures are taped to the wall by the door. Earl's attention is caught\nfirst by the MRI, a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's\nskull. In marker, the picture is labeled YOUR BRAIN. Earl stares at\nit. Concentric circles in different colors. He can make out the big\norbs of his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain.\nSmooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right there in the middle\nof his head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck\nlike a maggot into an apricot, is something different. Deformed,\nbroken, but unmistakable. A dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right\nthere in the middle of his brain.\n\nHe bends to look at the other picture. It is a photograph of a man\nholding flowers, standing over a fresh grave. The man is bent over,\nreading the headstone. For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors\nor the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over,\nlooking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone. Earl\nlooks at the picture for a long time. Maybe he begins to cry. Maybe he\njust stares silently at the picture. Eventually, he makes his way back\nto the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep.\n\nThe cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom. A circuit in the\nalarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again.\n\nEarl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles,\ninterrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large\nenough for him to read from the bed.\n\n***\n\nYou can't have a normal life anymore. You must know that. How can you\nhave a girlfriend if you can't remember her name? Can't have kids, not\nunless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesn't recognize them.\nSure as hell can't hold down a job. Not too many professions out there\nthat value forgetfulness. Prostitution, maybe. Politics, of course.\n\nNo. Your life is over. You're a dead man.The only thing the doctors\nare hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies.\nAnd they'll probably never let you go home, wherever that would be.\n\nSo the question is not \"to be or not to be,\" because you aren't. The\nquestion is whether you want to do something about it. Whether revenge\nmatters to you.\n\nIt does to most people. For a few weeks, they plot, they scheme, they\ntake measures to get even. But the passage of time is all it takes to\nerode that initial impulse. Time is theft, isn't that what they say?\nAnd time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue.\nConveniently, cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain\ndistance. Time steals your nerve.\n\nIf time and fear aren't enough to dissuade people from their revenge,\nthen there's always authority, softly shaking its head and saying, We\nunderstand, but you're the better man for letting it go. For rising\nabove it. For not sinking to their level. And besides, says authority,\nif you try anything stupid, we'll lock you up in a little room.\n\nBut they already put you in a little room, didn't they? Only they\ndon't really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you're a\ncripple. A corpse. A vegetable who probably wouldn't remember to eat\nor take a shit if someone wasn't there to remind you.\n\nAnd as for the passage of time, well, that doesn't really apply to you\nanymore, does it? Just the same ten minutes, over and over again. So\nhow can you forgive if you can't remember to forget?\n\nYou probably were the type to let it go, weren't you? Before. But\nyou're not the man you used to be. Not even half. You're a fraction;\nyou're the ten-minute man.\n\nOf course, weakness is strong. It's the primary impulse. You'd\nprobably prefer to sit in your little room and cry. Live in your\nfinite collection of memories, carefully polishing each one. Half a\nlife set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of\nexotic insects. You'd like to live behind that glass, wouldn't you?\nPreserved in aspic.\n\nYou'd like to but you can't, can you? You can't because of the last\naddition to your collection. The last thing you remember. His face.\nHis face and your wife, looking to you for help.\n\nAnd maybe this is where you can retire to when it's over. Your little\ncollection. They can lock you back up in another little room and you\ncan live the rest of your life in the past. But only if you've got a\nlittle piece of paper in your hand that says you got him.\n\nYou know I'm right. You know there's a lot of work to do. It may seem\nimpossible, but I'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something\nout. But you don't have much time. You've only got about ten minutes,\nin fact. Then it starts all over again. So do something with the time\nyou've got.\n\n***\n\nEARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness. The alarm clock is\nringing. It says 3:20, and the moonlight streaming through the window\nmeans it must be  he early morning. Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost\nknocking it over in the process. Incandescent light fills the room,\npainting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread,\ntoo. He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles\nabove him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling. He\nreads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around\nhim.\n\nIt is a bare room. Institutional, maybe. There is a desk over by the\nwindow. The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock. Earl\nprobably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed. He even has\nhis shoes on under the sheets. He extracts himself from the bed and\ncrosses to the desk. Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone\nlived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here\nand there to the wall. No pictures, no books, nothing. Through the\nwindow, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass.\n\nEarl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at\nthe two keys taped to the back of his hand. He picks at the tape while\nhe searches through the empty drawers. In the left pocket of his\njacket, he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in\nan envelope. He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom.\nBits of tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else.\n\nEarl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and\nmoves back toward the bed. He lies back down and stares up at the\nceiling and the sign taped to it. The sign reads, GET UP, GET OUT\nRIGHT NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU.\n\nEarl closes his eyes.\n\n***\n\nThey tried to teach you to make lists in grade school, remember? Back\nwhen your day planner was the back of your hand. And if your\nassignments came off in the shower, well, then they didn't get done.\nNo direction, they said. No discipline. So they tried to get you to\nwrite it all down somewhere more permanent.\n\nOf course, your grade-school teachers would be laughing their pants\nwet if they could see you now. Because you've become the exact product\nof their organizational lessons. Because you can't even take a piss\nwithout consulting one of your lists.\n\nThey were right. Lists are the only way out of this mess.\n\nHere's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one\nperson with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at\nthe mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through\nthe brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and\nthen again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one\nman yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks\nclamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The\nangry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the\nsex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob,\na chain gang of idiots.\n\nThis is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day,\nevery man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you\nwant to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little\nline, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or\nhere's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to\neternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the\nsecrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor\ntrick.\n\nBut then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the\nnext guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat\npotato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all\nentrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic.\n\nThe only way out of this mess, of course, is to take steps to ensure\nthat you control the idiots that you become. To take your chain gang,\nhand in hand, and lead them. The best way to do this is with a list.\n\nIt's like a letter you write to yourself. A master plan, drafted by\nthe guy who can see the light, made with steps simple enough for the\nrest of the idiots to understand. Follow steps one through one\nhundred. Repeat as necessary.\n\nYour problem is a little more acute, maybe, but fundamentally the same\nthing.\n\nIt's like that computer thing, the Chinese room. You remember that?\nOne guy sits in a little room, laying down cards with letters written\non them in a language he doesn't understand, laying them down one\nletter at a time in a sequence according to someone else's\ninstructions. The cards are supposed to spell out a joke in Chinese.\nThe guy doesn't speak Chinese, of course. He just follows his\ninstructions.\n\nThere are some obvious differences in your situation, of course: You\nbroke out of the room they had you in, so the whole enterprise has to\nbe portable. And the guy giving the instructions-that's you, too, just\nan earlier version of you. And the joke you're telling, well, it's got\na punch line. I just don't think anyone's going to find it very funny.\n\nSo that's the idea. All you have to do is follow your instructions.\nLike climbing a ladder or descending a staircase. One step at a time.\nRight down the list. Simple.\n\nAnd the secret, of course, to any list is to keep it in a place where\nyou're bound to see it.\n\n***\n\nHE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING through his eyelids. Insistent. He reaches out\nfor the alarm clock, but he can't move his arm.\n\nEarl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him. The man\nlooks up at him, annoyed, then resumes his work. Earl looks around\nhim. Too dark for a doctor's office.\n\nThen the pain floods his brain, blocking out the other questions. He\nsquirms gain, trying to yank his forearm away,  the one that feels\nlike it's burning. The arm doesn't move, but the man shoots him\nanother scowl. Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top\nof the man's head.\n\nThe noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the man's hand-a\ngun with a needle where the barrel should be. The needle is digging\ninto the fleshy underside of Earl's forearm, leaving a trail of puffy\nletters behind it.\n\nEarl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view, to read the\nletters on his arm, but he can't. He lies back and stares at the\nceiling.\n\nEventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise, wipes Earl's forearm\nwith a piece of gauze, and wanders over to the back to dig up a\npamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection. Maybe later\nhe'll tell his wife about this guy and his little note. Maybe his wife\nwill convince him to call the police.\n\nEarl looks down at the arm. The letters are rising up from the skin,\nweeping a little. They run from just behind the strap of Earl's watch\nall the way to the inside of his elbow. Earl blinks at the message and\nreads it again. It says, in careful little capitals, I RAPED AND\nKILLED YOUR WIFE.\n\n***\n\nIt's your birthday today, so I got you a little present. I would have\njust bought you a beer, but who knows where that would have ended?\n\nSo instead, I got you a bell. I think I may have had to pawn your\nwatch to buy it, but what the hell did you need a watch for, anyway?\n\nYou're probably asking yourself, Why a bell? In fact, I'm guessing\nyou're going to be asking yourself that question every time you find\nit in your pocket. Too many of these letters now. Too many for you to\ndig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little\nquestion.\n\nIt's a joke, actually. A practical joke. But think of it this way: I'm\nnot really laughing at you so much as with you.\n\nI'd like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and\nwonder, Why do I have this bell? a little part of you, a little piece\nof your broken brain, will remember and laugh, like I'm laughing now.\n\nBesides, you do know the answer. It was something you learned before.\nSo if you think about it, you'll know.\n\nBack in the old days, people were obsessed with the fear of being\nburied alive. You remember now? Medical science not being quite what\nit is today, it wasn't uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a\ncasket. So rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing\ntubes. Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone\nwoke up when they weren't supposed to, they wouldn't run out of\noxygen. Now, they must have tested this out and realized that you\ncould shout yourself hoarse through the tube, but it was too narrow to\ncarry much noise. Not enough to attract attention, at least. So a\nstring was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone.\nIf a dead person came back to life, all he had to do was ring his\nlittle bell till someone came and dug him up again.\n\nI'm laughing now, picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast-food\nrestaurant, reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and\nwondering to yourself where it came from, why you have it. Maybe\nyou'll even ring it.\n\nHappy birthday, buddy.\n\nI don't know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem, so I\ndon't know whether to congratulate you or me. A bit of a lifestyle\nchange, admittedly, but an elegant solution, nonetheless.\n\nLook to yourself for the answer.\n\nThat sounds like something out of a Hallmark card. I don't know when\nyou thought it up, but my hat's off to you. Not that you know what the\nhell I'm talking about. But, honestly, a real brainstorm. After all,\neverybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are. You're\nno different.\n\n***\n\nTHE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, then repeats itself. It says, \"The\ntime is 8:00 a.m. This is a courtesy call.\" Earl opens his eyes and\nreplaces the receiver. The phone is perched on a cheap veneer\nheadboard that stretches behind the bed, curves to meet the corner,\nand ends at the minibar. The TV is still on, blobs of flesh color\nnattering away at each other. Earl lies back down and is surprised to\nsee himself, older now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head\nlike solar flares. The mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver\nfading increases. Earl continues to stare at himself, astonished by\nwhat he sees. He is fully dressed, but the clothes are old, threadbare\nin places.\n\nEarl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, but it's\ngone. He looks down from the mirror to his arm. It is bare and the\nskin has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the\nfirst place. The skin is even in color except for the solid black\narrow on the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve. He\nstares at the arrow for a moment. Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off\nanymore. He rolls up his sleeve.\n\nThe arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm. Earl\nreads the sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks up at the\nbeginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing\nunder the rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons his shirt.\n\nLooking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring\nthem into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him.\n\nThe arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends\nonto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that\noccupies most of his chest. The face is that of a large man, balding,\nwith a mustache and a goatee. It is a particular face, but like a\npolice sketch it has a certain unreal quality.\n\nThe rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of\ninformation, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl,\nforward in the mirror.\n\nEventuallyEarl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk. He takes out\na pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits, and begins\nto write.\n\n***\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \nI don't know where you'll be when you read this. I'm not even sure if\nyou'll bother to read this. I guess you don't need to.\n\nIt's a shame, really, that you and I will never meet. But, like the\nsong says, \"By the time you read this note, I'll be gone.\"\n\nWe're so close now. That's the way it feels. So many pieces put\ntogether, spelled out. I guess it's just a matter of time until you\nfind him.\n\nWho knows what we've done to get here? Must be a hell of a story, if\nonly you could remember any of it. I guess it's better that you can't.\n\nI had a thought just now. Maybe you'll find it useful.\n\nEverybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already\npassed us by? What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had\nalready come and gone and we were none the wiser? Apocalypse arrives\nquietly; the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the\nones who failed the test,  just keep on going, oblivious. Dead\nalready,  wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping\nscore, still optimistic about the future.\n\nI guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do. No\nexpectations. If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because\nnothing matters. And if you do find him, then you can kill him without\nworrying about the consequences. Because there are no consequences.\n\nThat's what I'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room.\nFramed pictures of ships on the wall. I don't know, obviously, but if\nI had to guess, I'd say we're somewhere up the coast. If you're\nwondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, I\ndon't know what to tell you. I guess we must have been driving for a\nwhile. And, no, I don't know what happened to your watch.\n\nAnd all these keys: I have no idea. Not a one that I recognize. Car\nkeys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks. What have\nwe been up to?\n\nI wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him. Tracked down by the\nten-minute man.  Assassinated by a vegetable.\n\nI'll be gone in a moment. I'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and\nthen you can read this through if you want.\n\nI just wanted you to know that I'm proud of you. No one who matters is\nleft to say it. No one left is going to want to.\n\nEARL'S EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, staring through the window of the car.\nSmiling eyes. Smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across\nthe street. The crowd gathering around the body in the doorway. The\nbody emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain.\n\n***\n\nA stocky guy, facedown, eyes open. Balding head, goatee. In death, as\nin police sketches, faces tend to look the same. This is definitely\nsomebody in particular. But really, it could be anybody.\n\nEarl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb.\nThe car? Who's to say? Maybe it's a police cruiser. Maybe it's just a\ntaxi.\n\nAs the car is swallowed into traffic, Earl's eyes continue to shine\nout into the night, watching the body until it disappears into a\ncircle of concerned pedestrians. He chuckles to himself as the car\ncontinues to make distance between him and the growing crowd.\n\nEarl's smile fades a little. Something has occurred to him. He begins\nto pat down his pockets; leisurely at first, like a man looking for\nhis keys, then a little more desperately. Maybe his progress is\nimpeded by a set of handcuffs. He begins to empty the contents of his\npockets out onto the seat next to him. Some money. A bunch of keys.\nScraps of paper.\n\nA round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl\nseat.  Earl is frantic now. He hammers at the plastic divider between\nhim and the driver, begging the man for a pen. Perhaps the cabbie\ndoesn't speak much English. Perhaps the cop isn't in the habit of\ntalking to suspects. Either way, the divider between the man in front\nand the man behind remains closed. A pen is not forthcoming.\n\nThe car hits a pothole, and Earl blinks at his reflection in the\nrearview mirror. He is calm now. The driver makes another corner, and\nthe metal lump slides back over to rest against Earl's leg with a\nlittle jingle. He picks it up and looks at it,  curious now. It is a\nlittle bell. A little metal bell. Inscribed on it are his name and a\nset of dates. He recognizes the first one: the year in which he was\nborn. But the second date means nothing to him. Nothing at all.\n\nAs he turns the bell over in his hands, he notices the empty space on\nhis wrist where his watch used to sit. There is a little arrow there,\npointing up his arm. Earl looks at the arrow, then begins to roll up\nhis sleeve.\n\n***\n\n\"You'd be late for your own funeral,\" she'd say. Remember? The more I\nthink about it, the more trite that seems. What kind of idiot, after\nall, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story?\n\nAnd how would I know if I were late,  anyway? I don't have a watch\nanymore. I don't know what we did with it.\n\nWhat the hell do you need a watch for,  anyway? It was an antique.\nDeadweight tugging at your wrist. Symbol of the old you. The you that\nbelieved in time.\n\nNo. Scratch that. It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time\nas that time has lost its faith in you. And who needs it,  anyway? Who\nwants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in\nthe safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something\npowerful? Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing.\nCrawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did\nunspeakable things to them. Believing the lie that time will heal all\nwounds-which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us.\n\nBut you're different. You're more perfect.  Time is three things for\nmost people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment.\nThis moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which\nthe hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost\nits ability to affect you. What is it they say? That time is theft?\nBut not for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again.\nConjure up that necessary emotion, fresh as roses.\n\nTime is an absurdity. An abstraction. The only thing that matters is\nthis moment. This moment a million times over. You have to trust me.\nIf this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying-and you have to\nkeep trying-eventually you will come across the next item on your\nlist.\n\nEnd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMemento\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Christopher Nolan\u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Nolan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:31:01.033042"}
