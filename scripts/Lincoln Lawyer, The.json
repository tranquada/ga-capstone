The one the cops have.\r\n          Look at the blood on the blade.\r\n          Look at the initials.\r\n          Louis is stuck for an answer--\r\n\r\n                         MICK (CONT'D)\r\n          That's why Ted Minton didn't care\r\n          when I told him Reggie's a\r\n          prostitute.

The file Raul got us\r\n          was a loaded deck. The cops must\r\n          have been on to him, because they\r\n          used it to set us up. So we'd think\r\n          they had nothing, when in fact they\r\n          had enough to put your Hugo Boss,\r\n          golf-playing ass away for twenty\r\n          years!\r\n          Mick looks back towards the car, parked maybe 20 yards off.\r\n          He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis.\r\n          Mick sees him looking her way...\r\n          Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A\r\n          moment... then Mick resumes.

Now leave it to me.\r\n          (to the court)\r\n          I do share my client's outrage,\r\n          your honor.

Can I\r\n          step into the hallway and make a\r\n          call to an investigator?

Judge turns to Mick-- who's just staring, angrily.\r\n          Then rises. Like he doesn't know what to do. Louis, the\r\n          others, watch anxiously. Mick crosses to the front, steals a\r\n          glance at the rear, SEES KURLEN standing against the wall,\r\n          LANKFORD AND SOBEL seated in front of him. Then...\r\n\r\n                         MICK\r\n          How many times have you been\r\n          arrested, Mr. Corliss?\r\n\r\n                         CORLISS\r\n          About seven in L.A.

Lankford's already on his phone--\r\n\r\n                         LANKFORD\r\n          This is Lankford, we've got a\r\n          shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off\r\n          Laurel, we need paramedics,\r\n          ambulance transport for two--\r\n          During which he's checking Mary Windsor's body, revises--\r\n\r\n                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)\r\n          Transport for one.\r\n          Rings off. Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound--\r\n\r\n                         SOBEL\r\n          Press hard and keep pressing.\r\n          Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell...\r\n          while Lankford makes another call...\r\n\r\n                         LANKFORD\r\n          Yeah, it's Lankford again. Tell\r\n          them it's over, they can grab\r\n          Roulet and bring him in... He what?\r\n\r\n                         (LISTENS-- SURPRISED)\r\n          So, bring him to the Emergency Room\r\n          first, then bring him in!\r\n          (rings off; to Sobel)\r\n          Dig this. The uniforms had some\r\n          help picking up Roulet. Some\r\n          motorcycle gang was already beating\r\n          the shit out of him.\r\n\r\n                         MICK\r\n          (figures it out--)\r\n          The police were tailing him?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          131.\r\n\r\n                         SOBEL\r\n          (She levels.)\r\n          We thought he'd come after you. We\r\n          couldn't tell you. The truth is we\r\n          had plenty on him for killing\r\n          Renteria. Jesus Martinez will be\r\n          released. But we wanted Roulet for\r\n          Levin, too. I told you: We had to\r\n          find out how he beat the trace. Now\r\n          we know.\r\n          (her glance goes to Mary\r\n\r\n                         WINDSOR)\r\n          It was almost perfect. He's still\r\n          wearing the anklet...\r\n\r\n                         MICK\r\n          I know...\r\n\r\n                         SOBEL\r\n          And it puts him half a city away.\r\n          Just like last time.\r\n          They share a look at the cleverness of it. When--\r\n\r\n                         LANKFORD\r\n          Look at this.\r\n          Mick looks, HIS WOOZY POV AGAIN: Lankford, wearing a glove,\r\n          lifts Mary's gun. Pearl-handled: The WOODSMAN. Admiring--\r\n\r\n                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)\r\n          They don't make'm like this\r\n          anymore.\r\n          Mick, makes a shape with his free hand. The \"Longhorns\" sign:\r\n          inner fingers pointing down.

Questioning.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Don't worry, we haven't been living\r\n          here. We did, for a while. When you\r\n          were touch and go.\r\n          Mick.
