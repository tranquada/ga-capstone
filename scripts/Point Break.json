Under their hats strips of Scotch tape stretch\ntaut from the base of their nose to their forehead,\nhideously distorting their features.  Makes them look like\nhuman PIGS.\n\n\nEXT.

An edgy\nhandsomeness to him.\nHe pops a stick of Wrigley's in his mouth, rests a shotgun\non one leg and leans against the wall.  He wears a\nheadset... through which we hear the FBI guy yelling for\nhim.\nThis is JOHNNY UTAH.\n\n                         BINOCULARS (FILTERED)\n          Utah, where the hell are ya!?\n\nUtah takes his headset off...\n\n\nINT.

Lady Pignose slams the thing into DRIVE, cuts the\nwheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement.\n\nUTAH hurtles from the alley.  He leaps, somehow TACKLES\nthe DRIVER'S door handle and is dragged along the street.\nHe pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips\nthe steering wheel hard right.\n\nThe SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota.  Utah bounces\nforward, slamming into the asphalt.  Glass shards and\ncrushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam\nwhistles hot.\n\nPig Nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped.  Can't get his\ncrushed door open.  The DRIVER pushes open her door.\nGropes for her pistol.  Utah springs -- no respect for a\nlady.  He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and\nagain until the gun drops.  Utah kicks it away as the\nwoman collapses in pain.\n\nPig Nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot.

Guys like you will do\n          anything to win!\n\nUtah stares back in defiance.\nThe SURVEILLANCE van pulls up nearby.\nBINOCULARS runs out and pinches two fingers together,\nright in Johnny's face.\n\n                         BINOCULARS\n          This far, Utah!  You're this far\n          from being the most overqualified\n          guy Burger King ever had.  Get me?!\n\n                         UTAH\n          Yes sir.

As he passes he casually raises his\nlaser-shotgun and re-triggers Pig Nose's flak vest.\nLIGHTS AND BUZZERS.\nPig Nose explodes.  More agents restrain him.\nScreams and shoving matches and pissed off guys.\nUtah walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign\nwhich bears the FBI SEAL and reads \"Combat Village,\nQuantico, Virginia.\"\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

OCEAN - DAWN\n\nDeafening BOOM as a monster wave CRASHES below a sky the\ncolor of slate.  A distant Pacific storm has brought the\nswell.  10 foot faces.

He spots a wave.  A fluid gray-green\nhouse rising, forever rising.  Utah turns.  Paddles.  The\nhouse catching him, lifting him high upon its roof.\n\nUtah is committed.  He gets to his feet as his board\nslices along the lip.  He peers over the falls, down the\nface -- holy shit!  -- it looks like Niagara.  He loses\nbalance and spirals airborne, falling bullseye into the\nIMPACT ZONE.  The entire force of the wave crashing upon\nhim, plunging him down into the--\n\nWASHING MACHINE (UNDERWATER)\n\nwhere he SPINS like a whirling dervish, LASHED to a\nslamdancing surfboard at the mercy of God.\nHe is held prisoner in a grey-green churning nightmare,\nlike a six-ton pit bull has him by the neck, shaking him.\nHe looks around.

Gasping for breath.\nThe good news is he's breathing, the bad news is he's\nsurfaced in the impact zone.  Another wave crashes down,\nstuffing him back into the washing machine.  Leaving no\nsign of life in the white froth.  The orangeade surfboard\nlaunches high into the sky, spinning like a misfiring\nTrident missile, trailing its broken leash like a kite\ntail.\n\nIN THE WASHING MACHINE, Utah tumbles in a cold green hell.\nHis chest is convulsing, needing air now.\nSuddenly a FIGURE lunges down INTO FRAME.\nA hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him\ntoward--\n\nTHE SURFACE.

The big waves, just forming up,\nlift them and drop them as they pass.  Muted thunder when\nthe waves hit the beach.  She drags him half onto her\nsurfboard.\nPractically slamming his face into the board.\nHe's coughing out saltwater.\n\nON THE WOMAN, our first good look at her.\nShe is EXQUISITE.  Hair slicked tight to her high-\ncheekboned face, she looks sleek and feral, with eyes that\nburn bright.\nEspecially when she's pissed.\n\n                         WOMAN\n          Look crazy son of a bitch!

You have to feel what\n          the wave is doing, accept its\n          energy, get in sync.  Just feel it\n          all moving in the blackness... you\n          don't need to see.\n\n                         UTAH\n          Yeah, right, vision is highly over-\n          rated.\n\nBodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline.\nWithout looking back, he senses the incoming swell.\n\n                         BODHI\n          This one's got your name on it,\n          Johnny.\n\nUtah looks.

Suddenly he's going like a shot.\nHe moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down.\nMaintains a fragile control.\nOn pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in\nbehind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black\nface.\n\nBodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the\nmoonlight.\nNot wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little\nforward on the board.  The nose dips, picking up speed.\n\nJohnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning\nthat he can make long floating turns up and down the\nglassy face.\n\nFeeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling\nup behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a\nlittle of it.\n\nThe Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the\nnight.\nUtah has a big feral grin plastered on his face.\nBodhi looks back.  Gives him a thumbs up.\nThen he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom,\nslashing back and climbing.\nUtah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the\nspeed.\nHe makes his bottom turn, nearly falling.\nThe grin dropping off his face.\n\nHe falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over them\nlike a great black wing.\n\nTYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her.\nUtah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonzo\nwolf as they go by.\nShe grins to herself, watching him.\nKnows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for\nlife.\n\n\nEXT.

Without his jacket on, it is\nevident that he is not carrying a gun.\nHe walks forward.\n\n                         UTAH\n          I'm not armed.\n\n                         BODHI\n          But you're not alone.\n\n                         UTAH\n          Good guess.  There's a gun on you\n          right now.\n\nBodhi feigns casual interest.  Looks around.  He can't\nsee...\n\nPAPPAS nearby.  Moving cat-like behind a row of service\nvehicles.  He gets his snubnose .38 propped on the bumper\nof one, with a clear shot at Bodhi and Nathaniel.\n\n                         UTAH\n          Where's Roach?\n\n                         BODHI\n          Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in\n          kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can\n          I do for you?\n\n                         UTAH\n          You gotta tell me where she is.\n\n                         BODHI\n          And let my policy expire?  Sorry.\n\n                         UTAH\n          Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead.\n          The ride is over.\n\n                         BODHI\n          I say when it's over!\n\n                         UTAH\n          The guy you killed was an off duty\n          cop!  If you get out of here they'll\n          nail you wherever you land.  They\n          have a new thing called radar.\n          Maybe you've heard of it.\n\nThough he can't hear what's going on.  THE PILOT has\nclocked the tension between the two men.  And the shotgun\nin Nathaniel's hands.  He blanches, and starts to shut\ndown the plane's power.\nBy his reaction we see that he's obviously not in on it.\n\nROACH comes out of the hangar building nearby.  Neither\nUtah nor Pappas see him.  But he sees Pappas drawn down on\nBodhi.  He drops quickly to one knee and opens the duffel\nhe was carrying.\n\nTIGHT ON DUFFEL BAG, as it opens.  The pistol grip of a 12\ngauge riot-gun sticks out of lots and lots of money.\nRoach's hand slides the gun out slowly.\n\nUTAH IS VERY CLOSE to Bodhi.\n\n                         UTAH\n          I know you man, when they fall on\n          you, you won't back down.  They'll\n          have to burn your ass to the ground.\n          And I can't stop them... I'm the\n          last person they're ready to listen\n          to right now.  Thanks to you.\n\n                         UTAH\n          Shit may or may not happen.\n\n                         UTAH\n          Look, you got a death wish, you want\n          to ride to glory... fine!  But don't\n          take her with you, man.  I'm begging\n          you... tell me where she is.  Then I\n          walk away.  We've earned that much\n          trust, haven't we?\n\nThe pilot opens the door and is climbing out when\nNathaniel wheels on him.  The pilot goes cross-eyed\nstaring down the muzzle of the 12 gauge, inches from his\nface.\n\n                         BODHI\n                  (to the pilot)\n          Back in the hotseat, campadre.\n          NOW!\n\nBEHIND THE TRUCKS, Pappas senses something.\nHis head snaps around.\nRoach is behind him with the 12 gauge.  He FIRES.\nPappas hurls his weight sideways, as the buckshot punches\ninto the truck fender.  Some of it catches Pappas in the\nhip.  He hits the ground hard and whips up the .38 BAM!\nBAM!  BAM!\nRoach flips onto his back.\nThe shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck.\nPappas is on the ground, totally exposed, 20 feet from the\nothers.\n\nNATHANIEL fires once, wild.  Terrified.  His shot blows a\ndivot out of the asphalt next to Pappas.\nHe pumps the slide, chambering another round.\nThen Pappas' fourth and fifth rounds drill into him.\nHe slams back against the Cessna's fuselage.\nSlides down.  Two red smears on the white aircraft.\nBodhi lunges for the fallen 12 gauge.\nPappas takes aim.  One round left.\nUtah sprints between them.\n\n                         UTAH\n          Angelo!  Don't fire!\n\n                         PAPPAS\n          Kid, get outta the way!!\n\n                         UTAH\n          NOOO!!\n\nUtah is blocking Bodhi with his body.\nBodhi's fingers are poised, frozen, a few inches from the\nshotgun.\nStandoff.\n\n                         PAPPAS\n          GODDAMMIT!!\n\nHe snaps the pistol up, aimed at the sky.\nPappas stands panting.  Enraged and frustrated.  Pain\nsearing his leg.  Everything is tense and electrified.\nBOOM!!  Pappas' chest EXPLODES with a spray of blood!\n\nBEHIND HIM, ROACH is lying on one elbow in a pool of\nscarlet.\nHe cocks another round into the chamber and fires again.\nBOOM!\n\nAngelo drops to his knees, holding his ruined body like\nhe's hugging himself.  Johnny lunges toward him, his face\ndistorted with shock.\n\n                         UTAH\n          NNNOOOOOO!!!\n\nAngelo's eyes meet his for a moment.\nIn his dilated pupils is the great question.\nThen he slumps forward and lies very still.\nThe breath leaves his body and doesn't go back in.\n\nJohnny moves toward his friend in a daze.  Drops to one\nknee beside him.\nRoach aims the shotgun at him, coughing blood.\nUtah doesn't notice.  Or is beyond caring.\nBodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction.\nRoach's finger relaxes on the trigger.\n\nUtah puts his hand on Angelo's white crewcut hair.\nHe hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as\nBodhi picks up the other twelve gauge.\n\nRoach is working himself to his knees.  His breath is\nsucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the\ncustomary breathing orifices.  Bodhi crosses to him and\nhelps him up.  He covers Utah with the shot gun as he\nhalf-carries Roach to the plane.  The pilot is white with\nshock.  He'd run if he could remember how.\n\n                         PILOT\n          I ain't flyin' you guys to San\n          Phillipe man, forget it.

He waves the\nshotgun at the pilot, his face a vicious, blood-flecked\nmask.\n\n                         ROACH\n          Get in the fucking plane.\n\nBodhi stands behind Johnny, the shotgun aimed at his head.\nTheir expressions are lethally cold.\nWe see that Utah hates this man who was his friend, his\nteacher, more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate.\n\n                         BODHI\n          We're gonna ride this out, all the\n          way, Johnny.  You and me.  Let's go.\n\nJohnny nods slowly, as if accepting that this was all\nsomehow pre-ordained, and that they both knew the game\nwould take them this far and beyond.  He stands and walks\nto the plane.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nEXT.

The ranking officer, a\nfortyish LIEUTENANT, walks up to Utah.\n\n                         LIEUTENANT\n          D'you see him, Mr. Utah?\n\n                         UTAH\n          No.  But he's here.\n\n                         LIEUTENANT\n          Now, look, I know you used to be a\n          federal agent up in the states and\n          all that, but you're a citizen now,\n          so just find him and we'll handle it\n          from there.\n\n                         UTAH\n          No problem.  Just give me a couple\n          minutes with him first.\n\nJohnny limps out across the huge expanse of sand alone.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BELL'S BEACH - AUSTRALIA - DAY\n\nWALL OF SOLID WATER FIVE STORIES HIGH CRASHES straight\ndown in a holocaust of spray...\nRising up from the ocean to meet a tormented sky, roll the\nmost terrifying waves any surfer has ever seen.  They\nclose out, pummeling the ocean floor, casting a shockwave\nup the shore.\nSURFERS gather on the sand, gaze out to sea.\n\n                         1ST SURFER\n          Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand's\n          shakin'.\n\nThe beach sounds like a MORTAR RANGE.\nJOHNNY passes among the brahs.\n\n                         2ND SURFER\n          Totally closed-out.  It's fuckin'\n          death on a stick.\n\nON BODHI, sitting crosslegged in the sand, arms folded\naround his knees.  He stares pensively out at the waves.\nHis hand reaches out and absently strokes a surfboard\nlying next to him.\n\n                         UTAH (V.O.)\n          I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty\n          year storm, Bodhi.\n\nBodhi smiles, the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates\nthe cunning of his opponent.  Utah sits beside his prey\nand stares at the ocean.  Bodhi stares with glittering\neyes at the heaving ocean before him, face splitting into\nthat feral, death's head grin.\n\n                         BODHI\n          And I always knew I could count on\n          you, Agent Utah.\n\n                         UTAH\n          I'm not FBI anymore.\n\n                         BODHI\n          You never were...\n\n                         UTAH\n          I asked them to give me a couple\n          minutes...\n\nUtah calmly glances over his shoulder.\nBodhi follows Johnny's gaze to the cops watching from the\nroad.\n\n                         BODHI\n          It went bad, brah.  Real bad.\n                  (smiles inwardly)\n          I just felt it was time...\n\nA BOOMING ROAR sounds from the ocean.\nBodhi just stares at the waves, with awe and perhaps fear.\n\n                         BODHI\n          Time to dance with the universe.\n                  (he turns to Utah)\n          I could never handle a jail cell.\n          You'll do this for me, won't you\n          Johnny?  Haven't I earned this\n          much?\n\nUtah doesn't move to stop him as he stands, hefting the\nlongboard.\nHe half smiles, then turns toward the water, and starts\nwalking.\nHe stops.  Turns around.\n\n                         BODHI\n          Thanks, brah.\n\nBodhi doesn't wait for a reply.  He walks to the water's\nedge, and never looks back.  He throws his board into the\nfoam and paddles, the riptide pulling him out.  The\nmonsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the\ntrough of the holocaust.\n\nUTAH stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver\nfinal justice.  The cops are running clumsily across the\nsand, too late to stop Bodhi.  Tyler steps up behind\nJohnny, and puts her hands on his shoulders.\n\nBODHI is nothing more than a SPECK as he shoots across the\nlip of the colossal wave, carving the board downward -- AN\nUNTHINKABLE FOREHAND BLAST sends him into a 180 degree\nslide straight down the enormous face, eyes wild, his\nmouth opens in a soundless howl -- Bodhi and the outer-\nlimits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious\nmoment in perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect\nunion... There is no fear in his face, only awe as the\nmountain of water closes out, burying the Bodhisattva in a\nwhitewater grave... Pieces of broken surfboard explode\nupward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and\nvanish.\n\nUTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf.\nTyler lowers her head.  A fragment of surfboard washes up\nonto wet sand.  The wind gathers force.\nJohnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around her\nshoulder, gathering her close.  Tears are streaming down\nher face as she stares at the sea.\n\n                         UTAH\n          He rode it all the way.\n\nCAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP, rising high above their heads as\nthe liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the\nAustralian shore...\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint Break\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0W.
