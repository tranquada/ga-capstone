She stops halfway up the stairs. She turns \n               and comes back down the stairs to answer the phone, but then \n               thinks better of it.

Someone is \n               coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track.\n\n               Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it.

Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall \n               and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around \n               them.

It is John \n               Clifford, the detective from six years ago.\n\n               He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer, \n               his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder \n               with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an \n               uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe \n               occupation.\n\n               No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across \n               the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still \n               keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in \n               this new atmosphere.\n\n               The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme \n               of melancholy.

I've been 33 years in the \n                         business of tracking people down and \n                         putting them away. I spent almost a \n                         year on Curt Duncan alone, with the \n                         trial, the testimonies, the background \n                         investigations. I didn't come here \n                         today to look in your goddamn folders. \n                         In fact, I wouldn't have come here \n                         at all if you'd done your job right.\n\n               Pause.\n\n<b>                                     DR.

Everything that \n                         pertains to one of our patients is \n                         meticulously recorded in that \n                         patient's folder... whether you can \n                         make sense of it or not.\n\n               They glare at each other for several seconds. Monk is the \n               first one to look away.\n\n<b>                                     DR. MONK\n</b>                         Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-\n                         schizophrenic. They see themselves \n                         as victims, and they always blame \n                         other people for the way they are. \n                         When Duncan killed the Mandrakis \n                         kids, it wasn't an act of hostility \n                         against the children but against \n                         their parents. He was getting back \n                         at his own parents for traumas he \n                         suffered in early childhood. The \n                         criminal side of Curt Duncan is one \n                         of terrible, symbolic vengeance.\n\n<b>                                     CLIFFORD\n</b>                              (looking up)\n                         Assuming he isn't found right away... \n                         what will happen to him?\n\n               Monk rises and walks to a window.\n\n<b>                                     DR.

We are looking at the \n               nondescript exterior of a bar across the street.\n\n<b>               INT. BAR\n</b>\n               This is not a slum bar, but it's close. There are a few tables \n               and chairs and a pool table in the back. The atmosphere is \n               quiet, almost depressed, and the handful of REGULARS here \n               are exercising their privacy without having to be alone.\n\n               They include: HANK, the bartender, also the owner, who \n               absently polishes things with his cloth; TRACY, an unemployed \n               woman in her mid-forties who sits at the bar with a drink \n               and a cigarette and silently rummages through her current \n               feelings -- none of them new or particularly hopeful; a \n               COUPLE, probably retired, sitting at the same table they \n               come to every afternoon at this time -- him for his beer, \n               her for a glass of sweet white wine; and BILL, at the pool \n               table, a young man lithe and powerful, minding his own \n               business and playing his game of pool with a steady, \n               aggressive concentration.\n\n<b>                                     RETIRED MAN\n</b>                         Rackin' 'em up today, Bill?\n\n               Pause.\n\n<b>                                     BILL\n</b>                              (over his shoulder)\n                         Doin' all right.\n\n               The old man smiles stupidly around the room. He racked 'em \n               up a little in his day, too. His smile fades as he looks at \n               his wife. He takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories.\n\n               Then the door opens to the outside and the yellow-orange \n               light of late afternoon floods into the bar. The regulars \n               turn to glimpse who's coming in. They see the figure of a \n               MAN silhouetted in the doorway.

The door swings shut behind \n               him, plunging the room back into darkness. This man is \"a \n               little weird\", and the regulars continue to stare at him \n               until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits \n               down.

He turns away from the fight to talk.\n\n               Then, as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan, he leaps \n               to his feet and turns to the bar. He reaches over and grabs \n               the phone from Hank, slamming it down into the cradle.\n\n<b>                                     BILL\n</b>                         Who're you calling?\n\n               Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his \n               face off. He snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles \n               on a shelf behind the bar. Hank quickly hands him a bottle. \n               Bill pours himself a shot and downs it, fast. He is still \n               charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid \n               succession, spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself.\n\n               As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again, Tracy \n               stands up and quickly walks out of the bar, slamming the \n               door behind her.\n\n<b>                                     BILL\n</b>                              (calling after her)\n                         You're welcome, baby!\n\n               Then he throws down the cloth, picks up the bottle, turns \n               and, standing over Duncan's inert form, empties half the \n               bottle onto him. He sets the bottle back on the bar. He grabs \n               Duncan and, half dragging, hurries him out the back door and \n               throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap.\n\n               Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another \n               drink.\n\n<b>                                     BILL\n</b>                              (to Hank)\n                         Okay?\n\n               Hank just looks at him, doesn't answer.

Today \n               he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for \n               work, usually in slacks, turtleneck and jacket.\n\n<b>                                     GARBER\n</b>                              (genuinely surprised)\n                         What is all this?!\n\n<b>                                     SCATTERED VOICES\n</b>                         Happy birthday, Charlie!\n\n               Garber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol he'd \n               drawn just before the lights came up.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n</b>                         Look at him!\n\n<b>                                     MAN'S VOICE\n</b>                         Don't shoot us, Charlie!\n\n<b>                                     GARBER\n</b>                              (chagrined)\n                         How was I supposed to know?\n\n               Everybody starts to laugh, including Garber as he returns \n               the pistol to his shoulder holster.\n\n<b>               ANGLE ON DONNA\n</b>\n               Garber's wife. She comes out of the kitchen carrying a \n               birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the \n               crowd of GUESTS singing \"Happy Birthday\".\n\n               Everyone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside \n               her husband. Clifford is one of the guests. He has his arm \n               around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her \n               tacky/plastic appearance.\n\n               When the song is over, Garber blows out the candles and hugs \n               and kisses his wife. Everybody cheers.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

They are both fairly loaded by now.\n\n               Garber, in particular, has reached that stage of inebriation \n               where standing still is pretty hard to do.\n\n<b>                                     GARBER\n</b>                         Will you tell me what this is about, \n                         Cliff?\n\n<b>                                     CLIFFORD\n</b>                         Yeah, in a minute.\n\n<b>                                     GARBER\n</b>                         I don't think I can take any more of \n                         these surprises.\n\n<b>               INT.

The block is virtually deserted. Across the street \n               is the exterior of a bar -- the same bar Duncan was in \n               earlier. Some PEOPLE are coming out of the bar. It must be \n               near closing time. The people turn left and walk away down \n               the sidewalk. Their voices diminish. Pause.\n\n               A car passes. Then the door to the bar opens again and a \n               woman comes out onto the sidewalk. It is Tracy. She turns to \n               the right and starts to walk away.\n\n<b>               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n</b>\n               He is standing in shadows across the street, watching her.\n\n<b>               EXT. TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n               A series of shots of Tracy walking home. The CAMERA remains \n               consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes DOLLYING \n               with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up \n               her passing reflection in a darkened store window.\n\n               The impression this gives is unmistakable. Curt Duncan is \n               following her. We do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we \n               know he is there. Often we can sense that the very angle \n               from which we see Tracy is his POV.\n\n               But Tracy is aware of nothing. We know this when the CAMERA \n               begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an \n               impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety.\n\n               Tension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump \n               out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes. \n               But he doesn't.\n\n               Finally, Tracy walks up to the CAMERA at the end of a block \n               and turns a corner; but the CAMERA HOLDS on the dark street \n               she has just come up. We hear a cough which confirms that \n               Duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The doors close. CAMERA HOLDS \n               on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from \n               one to six.\n\n               O.S. we hear the door to the apartment building open and \n               close.\n\n<b>               INT. SIXTH FLOOR\n</b>\n               Tracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to \n               her door. She fumbles through her purse for keys, then bends \n               over the lock to let herself in.\n\n               Behind her down the hall, Duncan appears. He watches her, \n               starts to move silently forward. Tracy gets the door open, \n               then turns and sees him. Duncan stops.\n\n<b>                                     TRACY\n</b>                         Oh, it's you!\n                              (beat)\n                         What do you want?\n\n<b>                                     DUNCAN\n</b>                              (moving forward)\n                         ...Came to apologize.

The bolt slips and the door is securely shut.\n\n               The boy sits up in bed, apprehensive. In TIGHT SHOTS of the \n               floor we see a rat come out from under the bed, then another. \n               They make \"chit-chit\" noises as they begin to explore. One \n               of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the \n               bedpost. Then we see two more rats appear.\n\n               We go for a TIGHT SHOT of the boy on top of the bed.

Then \n               the blur grows larger, coming more into focus as the entire \n               screen image moves toward normal definition. Finally, we \n               know we are back in the alleyway, that it is night, and that \n               the white blur is actually a little BOY lost, sobbing \n               uncontrollably.\n\n<b>               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n</b>\n               Awakening to the scene, coming back to reality.

They are less than a foot apart, almost face to \n               face. Together they form a kind of frozen tableau. Something \n               close to sympathy crosses the killer's expression, and the \n               boy, likewise, achieves a faint sense of recognition.\n\n               Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he \n               runs off down the alleyway.

Before him stretches the nave of the \n               edifice with its rows of pews, its dimly glowing stained \n               glass windows, and way in the back, its choir loft. At regular \n               intervals, tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on \n               high.\n\n               There is no sign of Duncan, but Clifford knows he must be in \n               here, hiding somewhere.

A rope hangs down from the bells, \n               dangling all the way down the shaft, forty or fifty feet to \n               the floor of the church.\n\n               Clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him. \n               Duncan has little choice. He is trapped. Just before Clifford \n               reaches him, Duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the \n               bell rope.\n\n               The bell starts to clang as Duncan, hanging in mid air, swings \n               back and forth within the narrow shaft. Clifford leans way \n               out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at Duncan, \n               but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing \n               down the rope.\n\n               Clifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope. At last, \n               he gets it, and he shakes it violently to get Duncan to lose \n               his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below.\n\n               But Duncan holds firm, climbing ever downward. The bell \n               continues to clang, sending its alarm out into the night. \n               Then Clifford braces himself and slowly, laboriously begins \n               to haul up on the rope.\n\n               Clifford gains momentum until Duncan is being pulled up faster \n               than he is climbing down. Still twenty feet off the ground, \n               Duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone \n               floor.\n\n               Then PEOPLE come rushing into the church, awakened by the \n               commotion of the bells. Duncan rolls into the shadows and \n               drags himself out a side door, while Clifford plans his own \n               escape from the bell tower.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Clifford listens, then hangs up.\n\n               He picks up the .38 he has lying on the desk and idly starts \n               flipping the cartridge chamber with one of his jimmy needles. \n               After a moment, he lays the gun down and picks up the phone \n               again, this time calling the OPERATOR.\n\n<b>                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)\n</b>                         Operator.\n\n<b>                                     CLIFFORD\n</b>                         Can you dial a local number for me?\n\n<b>                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)\n</b>                         What is the number, please?\n\n<b>                                     CLIFFORD\n</b><b>                         555-2183.\n</b>\n               The operator dials. There is a pause. Then the same strange \n               noise cuts in.\n\n<b>                                     CLIFFORD\n</b>                         Operator, what does that mean?\n\n<b>                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)\n</b>                         I'm sorry, sir, that line seems to \n                         be disconnected.\n\n<b>                                     CLIFFORD\n</b>                         Why don't I get a recording?\n\n<b>                                     OPERATOR (O.S.)\n</b>                         I don't know, sir. Maybe the number \n                         was just recently disconnected. Maybe \n                         there's a temporary malfunction in \n                         the wiring.

LOCKHART HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Jill is walking down the hall to the children's bedroom. She \n               opens the door.\n\n<b>               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n               As Jill quietly enters. The children are asleep. Jill goes \n               to June and tucks her in. Then she walks over to Stevie's \n               bed. He is sleeping, but with a Sugar Daddy in his hand. \n               Jill looks down at him, again puzzled. She leans over, takes \n               the Sugar Daddy and gently wakes him.\n\n<b>                                     JILL\n</b>                         Stevie...

He was... Wings on a \n                         horse...\n\n               He closes his eyes and is asleep.\n\n               Jill stands up, turns and starts to walk out of the room. \n               Halfway across the floor, Jill stops. She stands rigid as a \n               thought penetrates her own drowsiness. She turns very slowly \n               and moves to the closet in the children's bedroom.\n\n               She stands before it a moment. Then she reaches her hand \n               forward for the knob on the closet door. She very slowly \n               pulls the door open. She looks inside. There is nothing.\n\n               Jill quietly closes the closet door and leaves the room.\n\n<b>               INT. BEDROOM\n</b>\n               Jill enters. John is still asleep facing the wall. Jill gets \n               into bed, sitting up. She is wide awake now. She sits for a \n               moment in the darkness, thinking.\n\n               Then she reaches for the princess phone on the bedside table. \n               She doesn't get a dial tone. She quietly pushes the phone's \n               disconnect button up and down several times. Still no dial \n               tone.\n\n               Jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension \n               creeping over her face.\n\n               Then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear the \n               muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. It is Duncan in \n               the throes of Guy du Marraux.\n\n               Jill freezes. As the voice gets steadily louder and more \n               menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom \n               closet which is a couple of inches ajar.\n\n<b>                                     JILL\n</b>                              (urgently whispering)\n                         John?... John?...\n\n               She reaches for the bedside lamp and turns it on, never taking \n               her eyes away from the closet door. As soon as the light \n               comes on, the voice stops.\n\n               Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's \n               shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.\n\n<b>                                     JILL\n</b>                         John!... John!...\n\n               The body beside her stirs, rolls over, looks at her hideously. \n               It is Duncan!!\n\n               Jill shrieks, and makes a move to leap out of the bed.\n\n               Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness \n               grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her \n               nightgown.\n\n               As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly \n               while she fights to get away.\n\n               Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab Jill's \n               ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to lose \n               her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the \n               doorway leading out of the room.\n\n               Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his \n               hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the desperate \n               sound of a woman facing certain death.\n\n               Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other \n               sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud.\n\n               Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol in \n               hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford walks \n               around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down.\n\n               On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall \n               lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John stirs, \n               as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some \n               time yet before he comes to.\n\n               Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over \n               Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the \n               doorway, sobbing hysterically.\n\n<b>                                     CLIFFORD\n</b>                         Your husband's okay.\n\n               Then he is gone.\n\n               As Jill sits there unable to rein in her emotions, June and \n               Stevie toddle up to her groggily from the hallway.\n\n<b>                                     JUNE\n</b>                         Mommy?\n\n               Jill clutches her children to her heaving breast and buries \n               her face between them.\n\n<b>               INT.
