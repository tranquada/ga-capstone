SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT\n\n               A quiet upper-middle class neighborhood. The CAMERA is at \n               the curb, looking down the street. There are no sidewalks. \n               Trees arch overhead. CICADAS drone on the soundtrack.\n\n               The OPENING TITLES briefly FADE IN and OUT, framed by the \n               trees on either side of the street. Footsteps are heard \n               approaching.\n\n               As the picture TITLE FADES, out of the dark emerges a GIRL \n               17 years old, carrying schoolbooks. This is JILL.

She tries to go \n               back to her homework, but she cannot.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Jill hangs up and goes back to work.\n\n               Pause.\n\n               The phone rings again. Jill picks it up.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Billy?...\n\n               A VOICE speaks on the other end of the phone.\n\n                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)\n                         Have you checked the children?\n\n                                     JILL\n                         What?\n\n               The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and goes right \n               back to work.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\n               Jill sits at the table as before, doing her homework, smoking \n               a cigarette. The phone rings. Jill picks it up.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Hello?\n\n                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)\n                         Have you checked the children?\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Mrs. Mandrakis?\n\n               The line goes dead. Dial tone. Jill hangs up and looks off \n               into space, thinking.\n\n               O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the \n               house. Jill hears it too. She stubs out her cigarette, gets \n               up from the table and walks out of the living room.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY\n\n               Jill enters the hallway and pauses. Then she starts walking \n               slowly down the hall to the kitchen door.\n\n               Again the rattling noise O.S., only louder this time. Jill \n               stops dead, listens, then continues forward even more \n               cautiously.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN\n\n               As Jill enters. She cannot find the lightswitch, so she stands \n               in the darkness listening. Again the rattle, very close now. \n               Jill turns her head sharply, then walks to the refrigerator \n               and opens it. It is only the automatic icemaker creating the \n               rattle.\n\n               Jill takes a piece of cake from the refrigerator and leaves \n               the kitchen.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n               Jill is sitting at the table, polishing off the cake. Then, \n               the phone rings. Jill stands up quickly and picks up the \n               phone.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Hello!\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)\n                         Have you checked the children?\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Billy!

Jill stands frozen beside the table with \n               the phone in her hand as the dial tone gets louder and louder.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Jill is standing at the wet bar in the corner, pouring herself \n               a drink. She samples the alcohol, doesn't cough, and starts \n               to pour a little more into the glass.\n\n               The phone rings. Jill turns, then slowly walks to the table, \n               kneels down and quietly picks up the phone and brings it to \n               her ear. She waits and listens, a full three seconds. No \n               sound comes to her.\n\n               She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be \n               broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end. \n               Then, she shuffles through her books and papers on the table-\n               top until she finds the notepad the doctor's wife has left \n               for her with the name and phone number of the restaurant.\n\n               Jill picks up the phone and dials. After several rings...\n\n                                     MAITRE D' (O.S.)\n                         Golden Bull...\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr. \n                         Mandrakis.

After thinking for a moment, she tries a couple \n               of ways of whistling as loud as she can, but frustrated and \n               feeling foolish, she soon gives up.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\n               Jill is sitting in an armchair facing the TV set. The TV is \n               on, but she is bored. She runs through several channels, \n               then gets up and turns the TV off.\n\n               She looks around and moves aimlessly back to the table, but \n               O.S. a dog is barking and she is drawn to the window. A car \n               passes outside, its lights reflecting off the window and \n               Jill's face.\n\n               Then the phone rings. Jill moves quickly from the window to \n               the table and answers the phone.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Hello?\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)\n                         Why haven't you checked the children?\n\n               Stunned, Jill hangs up the phone. She turns and goes slowly \n               back to the window. She pulls the shutters closed in front \n               of the window. Then she walks out of the living room.\n\n               INT. FRONT HALL\n\n               Jill goes to the front door, turns the bolt and draws the \n               chain across the door. Then she starts to go upstairs.\n\n               The phone rings. She stops halfway up the stairs. She turns \n               and comes back down the stairs to answer the phone, but then \n               thinks better of it. She sits on the bottom step and lets \n               the phone ring and ring...\n\n               Finally, it stops.

She sets her glass down, stubs \n               out the cigarette, leans back and sighs. She is very tense.\n\n               Then the phone rings. She rises from the sofa and slowly \n               crosses to the table.

She stands. She starts to \n               shake.\n\n               The phone rings and Jill snatches it up.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Leave me alone!\n\n                                     SACKER (O.S.)\n                         Jill, this is Sergeant Sacker!

A squad car's \n                         on its way over there now... just \n                         get out of that house!\n\n               Jill hangs up. She stands frozen in shock. Several seconds \n               go by. She doesn't move.\n\n               Then the phone rings. She turns and tiptoes toward the front \n               door. Halfway there, the phone stops ringing. She pauses for \n               a second, then continues.\n\n               INT. FRONT HALL\n\n               Jill reaches the front door. Carefully, quietly, she turns \n               the bolt. Then O.S. she hears a creak. She turns and looks \n               up the staircase. At the top, a door is opening. Someone is \n               coming out! A mumbling sound is heard on the sound track.\n\n               Jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. It opens, \n               but only an inch. The chain is still across it! She \n               frantically works to get the chain free. After agonizing \n               seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open.\n\n               Standing there on the other side of the door, is a police \n               Detective, JOHN CLIFFORD. (We have cut ahead in time some \n               twenty or thirty minutes.) Behind him on the street, several \n               patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their \n               domelights silently flashing.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Are the parents here yet?\n\n                                     COP'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes \n                         ago.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Christ!\n                              (beat)\n                         What a homecoming!\n\n                                     COP'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         They wanted to talk to someone. I \n                         asked them to wait until you got \n                         here. Come on in.\n\n               Clifford sighs and steps into the front hall. The door is \n               closed by the uniformed COP with whom Clifford has been \n               speaking. The cop is a man in his thirties. His name is \n               CHARLES GARBER. Garber and Clifford stand in the front hall \n               and talk as POLICEMEN and AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS move around \n               them. In the living room beyond can be seen several other \n               POLICEMEN, Dr. Mandrakis and his wife.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         We were only a block away when the \n                         call went out. When we got here, the \n                         guy was still waiting upstairs in \n                         the children's bedroom. He was covered \n                         with blood.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Blood?\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         Not his own.

STREET - LATER AFTERNOON\n\n               An upper-class neighborhood. The CAMERA is facing down the \n               street. A car approaches the intersection at the end of the \n               block, turns and comes slowly up the street.\n\n               Because it is not a new car or an expensive car, and because \n               it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male \n               occupant is looking for house numbers, we can assume that \n               the DRIVER is a visitor to this neighborhood.\n\n               The CAMERA PANS with the car ninety degrees as it turns into \n               the semi-circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the \n               front door.\n\n               A TITLE appears across the bottom of the screen:\n\n                             4:30 pm Thursday, April 20, 1978\n\n               As the TITLE FADES, the driver shuts off the car engine and \n               opens the door to get out.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. MANSION - DAY\n\n               The doorbell rings. A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall, \n               goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. It is John \n               Clifford, the detective from six years ago.\n\n               He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer, \n               his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder \n               with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an \n               uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe \n               occupation.\n\n               No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across \n               the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still \n               keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in \n               this new atmosphere.\n\n               The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme \n               of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishings, \n               and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady \n               and reverent.\n\n               The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase \n               and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. Without waiting \n               for an answer, he opens the door and steps aside for Clifford \n               to enter.\n\n               Clifford pauses briefly, then walks into what appears to be \n               an upstairs study.\n\n               INT. STUDY - DAY\n\n               A MAN is sitting behind a desk which faces the door. \n               Presumably he is the master of the house. Although his face \n               is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is \n               engaged in writing something down.\n\n               Clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in \n               front of it. Then, vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the \n               house, he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the \n               pervasive stillness.\n\n               After a moment, the master of the house lays down his pen \n               and leans back in his chair. Pause.\n\n                                     MASTER\n                         So you're in business for yourself \n                         now.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                              (quietly)\n                         Yes, sir, for the past three and a \n                         half years.\n\n                                     MASTER\n                         That's good.\n                              (beat)\n                         And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's \n                         escape?\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Oh, yes.\n\n                                     MASTER\n                         Do you think the police will... find \n                         him?\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         I know they haven't assigned anyone \n                         to it specifically.

He'll come back to the \n                         city. After six years in confinement, \n                         it's the only place that's familiar \n                         to him. That's important.\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     MASTER\n                         A man murders two children in cold \n                         blood.

And he escapes. \n                         It... it isn't fair.\n\n               The master of the house leans way forward over his desk, and \n               his face comes out of the shadows and into the light. It is \n               Dr. Mandrakis.\n\n               He seems much older. His complexion is pallid. His eyes stare \n               out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a \n               dark cave.\n\n                                     MANDRAKIS\n                         A thing like that should never be \n                         allowed to happen again.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         I couldn't agree with you more.\n\n               They look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment. \n               Then Mandrakis stands up with a sigh.\n\n                                     MANDRAKIS\n                         Go ahead then. My accountant will \n                         contact you.\n\n               Clifford stands and they shake hands.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Thank you.\n                              (beat)\n                         How is Mrs. Mandrakis?\n\n                                     MANDRAKIS\n                         She is... unable to have any more \n                         children.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         I'm sorry.

As with her husband, the change in her \n               is remarkable. She is now a brooding, barren woman.\n\n               O.S. the front door closes. Clifford is gone. Mrs. Mandrakis \n               walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly \n               ascending them.\n\n               The houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from a \n               side door and watches her.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

OFFICE - DAY\n\n               We see now the MAN who's been talking -- the director of the \n               State Hospital, DR. MONK. He is sitting comfortably behind \n               his desk; his jacket off, his tie loosened, his feet up on \n               the desk. He is very matter-of-fact.\n\n                                     DR. MONK\n                         Eventually, anyone will respond to \n                         the treatment here.\n\n               Clifford sits down in front of the desk, picks up a folder \n               and leafs through it.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         You gave him electric shock?\n\n                                     DR.

MONK'S SECRETARY enters the office and hands him a folder. \n               Without interrupting the delivery of his lines, Monk takes \n               the folder, opens it, initials something on the inside, closes \n               the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns and \n               leaves the office without uttering a word.\n\n                                     DR.

I didn't come here \n                         today to look in your goddamn folders. \n                         In fact, I wouldn't have come here \n                         at all if you'd done your job right.\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     DR. MONK\n                         Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital, \n                         not a penitentiary. Everything that \n                         pertains to one of our patients is \n                         meticulously recorded in that \n                         patient's folder... whether you can \n                         make sense of it or not.\n\n               They glare at each other for several seconds. Monk is the \n               first one to look away.\n\n                                     DR. MONK\n                         Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid-\n                         schizophrenic. They see themselves \n                         as victims, and they always blame \n                         other people for the way they are. \n                         When Duncan killed the Mandrakis \n                         kids, it wasn't an act of hostility \n                         against the children but against \n                         their parents. He was getting back \n                         at his own parents for traumas he \n                         suffered in early childhood. The \n                         criminal side of Curt Duncan is one \n                         of terrible, symbolic vengeance.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                              (looking up)\n                         Assuming he isn't found right away... \n                         what will happen to him?\n\n               Monk rises and walks to a window.\n\n                                     DR.

I \n                         think he's in for a bit of a shock.\n\n               Monk looks back out the window.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Not a terribly good section of town. We are looking at the \n               nondescript exterior of a bar across the street.\n\n               INT. BAR\n\n               This is not a slum bar, but it's close. There are a few tables \n               and chairs and a pool table in the back. The atmosphere is \n               quiet, almost depressed, and the handful of REGULARS here \n               are exercising their privacy without having to be alone.\n\n               They include: HANK, the bartender, also the owner, who \n               absently polishes things with his cloth; TRACY, an unemployed \n               woman in her mid-forties who sits at the bar with a drink \n               and a cigarette and silently rummages through her current \n               feelings -- none of them new or particularly hopeful; a \n               COUPLE, probably retired, sitting at the same table they \n               come to every afternoon at this time -- him for his beer, \n               her for a glass of sweet white wine; and BILL, at the pool \n               table, a young man lithe and powerful, minding his own \n               business and playing his game of pool with a steady, \n               aggressive concentration.\n\n                                     RETIRED MAN\n                         Rackin' 'em up today, Bill?\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     BILL\n                              (over his shoulder)\n                         Doin' all right.\n\n               The old man smiles stupidly around the room. He racked 'em \n               up a little in his day, too. His smile fades as he looks at \n               his wife. He takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories.\n\n               Then the door opens to the outside and the yellow-orange \n               light of late afternoon floods into the bar. The regulars \n               turn to glimpse who's coming in. They see the figure of a \n               MAN silhouetted in the doorway. He stands there for a long \n               moment, not coming in. Finally even Bill interrupts his game \n               to turn and look.\n\n                                     HANK\n                         C'mon in and shut the door.\n\n               The intruder enters, indecisively. The door swings shut behind \n               him, plunging the room back into darkness. This man is \"a \n               little weird\", and the regulars continue to stare at him \n               until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits \n               down. Then everyone returns to his own thoughts.\n\n                                     HANK\n                              (after a moment)\n                         What'll it be?\n                              (pause, no answer)\n                         Hey!

He looks understandably \n               harried. He hasn't slept or shaved in at least a couple of \n               days, and is wearing regular clothing.\n\n               He clears his throat to answer...\n\n                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)\n                         What kind of clothes was he wearing... \n                         when he escaped?\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Bill \n               picks up the bottle, nods his thanks to Hank and heads back \n               to the pool table.\n\n               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n\n               As his eyes follow Bill to the pool table, then come back to \n               Tracy at the bar.\n\n               POV - DUNCAN\n\n               Looking at the back of Tracy.

She pulls \n               out a cigarette, taps it lightly on the bar, puts it to her \n               lips.\n\n               O.S. we hear the sound of a match being struck.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               Duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match.

Duncan gets the second match lit and \n               holds it out for her. She accepts the favor and lights her \n               cigarette.\n\n               Duncan smiles. Tracy nods and turns away. Duncan is still \n               holding the burning match for her to blow out. As it doesn't \n               look like she's going to, he lets it drop, still lit, to the \n               floor.\n\n               REACTION SHOT - BARTENDER\n\n               He gives a look as if to say, \"Jesus, what a fuckin' weirdo\".\n\n               TWO SHOT - DUNCAN AND TRACY\n\n               Pause.

By pointing at what she has, he orders \n               two more drinks from the Bartender.

Duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again:\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                              (rapidly)\n                         Listen, I didn't mean nothin'.

With \n               a swipe of his hand, he knocks the glass off the bar, and it \n               shatters on the floor behind the bar.\n\n               Duncan sits there, stunned, not looking up. After a long \n               moment, Duncan coughs. Then he turns and looks at Bill. He \n               purses his lips. It looks like a nervous facial movement. \n               Then suddenly, Duncan spits at Bill, hitting him square in \n               the face.\n\n               Before anyone can register what's happened, Bill lunges at \n               Duncan, knocking him clean off the barstool and onto the \n               floor.\n\n               The fight is fast, vicious and one-sided from the very start. \n               Pinned to the floor on his back, Duncan flails his arms \n               ineffectually like a panicked insect as Bill holds him in \n               place with a left-handed grip on the collar while his powerful \n               right arm, pumping up and down like a piston, pounds into \n               Duncan's face time and time again.\n\n               Duncan's screams diminish into pathetic, sickening groans \n               and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes \n               from this brutal spectacle.\n\n               Hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing \n               a number. He turns away from the fight to talk.\n\n               Then, as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan, he leaps \n               to his feet and turns to the bar. He reaches over and grabs \n               the phone from Hank, slamming it down into the cradle.\n\n                                     BILL\n                         Who're you calling?\n\n               Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his \n               face off. He snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles \n               on a shelf behind the bar. Hank quickly hands him a bottle. \n               Bill pours himself a shot and downs it, fast. He is still \n               charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid \n               succession, spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself.\n\n               As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again, Tracy \n               stands up and quickly walks out of the bar, slamming the \n               door behind her.\n\n                                     BILL\n                              (calling after her)\n                         You're welcome, baby!\n\n               Then he throws down the cloth, picks up the bottle, turns \n               and, standing over Duncan's inert form, empties half the \n               bottle onto him. He sets the bottle back on the bar. He grabs \n               Duncan and, half dragging, hurries him out the back door and \n               throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap.\n\n               Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another \n               drink.\n\n                                     BILL\n                              (to Hank)\n                         Okay?\n\n               Hank just looks at him, doesn't answer. At the wife's silent \n               insistence, the elderly couple stand up to go.\n\n                                     OLD MAN\n                         Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh, \n                         Bill?\n\n               Bill doesn't answer and the couple quietly leave.\n\n                                     HANK\n                              (apologetic)\n                         A fight breaks out, there's gonna be \n                         damages.

Bill finishes his drink. \n               He is still very hopped up. He pulls a few dollars from his \n               wallet and drops them on the counter.\n\n                                     BILL\n                         See ya 'round.\n\n               He turns and strides out of the bar.\n\n               CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty \n               establishment. The phone starts to ring, presumably the police \n               calling back.\n\n               After several rings, Hank picks up the phone and listens.\n\n                                     HANK\n                              (into phone)\n                         No, it's over now...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

She comes out of the kitchen carrying a \n               birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the \n               crowd of GUESTS singing \"Happy Birthday\".\n\n               Everyone joins in as Donna moves forward and stands beside \n               her husband. Clifford is one of the guests. He has his arm \n               around a young BLOND who is sort of pretty despite her \n               tacky/plastic appearance.\n\n               When the song is over, Garber blows out the candles and hugs \n               and kisses his wife. Everybody cheers.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. GARBER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER\n\n               The party is still in full swing. Garber is following Clifford \n               up the stairs. They are both fairly loaded by now.\n\n               Garber, in particular, has reached that stage of inebriation \n               where standing still is pretty hard to do.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         Will you tell me what this is about, \n                         Cliff?\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Yeah, in a minute.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         I don't think I can take any more of \n                         these surprises.\n\n               INT. A BEDROOM\n\n               As Clifford and Garber enter. Garber turns on a light as \n               Clifford closes the door, shutting out the sounds of the \n               party below.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         Okay now, what's the big deal?\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Stand still. I want you to remember \n                         this in the morning.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         If you want me to remember something \n                         in the morning, then tell it to me \n                         in the morning.\n\n               Garber half comically turns to go. Clifford stops him.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Charlie, come on.\n\n               ANGLE ON CORNER OF BEDROOM\n\n               A BABY between a year and two years old is lying in a crib. \n               It opens its eyes and starts looking around.\n\n                                     GARBER (O.S.)\n                         All right, all right. What is it? \n                         You're getting married.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         No. I got a job today, tracking \n                         someone.\n\n               TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER\n\n               Garber, still moving restlessly, pats his friend on the \n               shoulder.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll \n                         find your man.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         It's Curt Duncan.\n\n               Garber stops suddenly, stunned. In an instant, he has become \n               stone sober.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         What?\n\n               ANGLE ON BABY\n\n               Kicking and wiggling about.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD (O.S.)\n                         You didn't know he got out?\n\n               The baby opens its mouth and starts to cry.\n\n               TWO SHOT - CLIFFORD & GARBER\n\n               Garber glances over his shoulder at the baby, then turns \n               back to Clifford.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         I need your cooperation on this one.\n\n                                     GARBER\n                         Sure. Anything.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT\n\n               It is late. The block is virtually deserted. Across the street \n               is the exterior of a bar -- the same bar Duncan was in \n               earlier. Some PEOPLE are coming out of the bar. It must be \n               near closing time. The people turn left and walk away down \n               the sidewalk. Their voices diminish. Pause.\n\n               A car passes. Then the door to the bar opens again and a \n               woman comes out onto the sidewalk. It is Tracy. She turns to \n               the right and starts to walk away.\n\n               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n\n               He is standing in shadows across the street, watching her.\n\n               EXT. TRACY ON STREET - NIGHT\n\n               A series of shots of Tracy walking home. The CAMERA remains \n               consistently behind her or off to one side, sometimes DOLLYING \n               with her behind a row of parked cars, sometimes picking up \n               her passing reflection in a darkened store window.\n\n               The impression this gives is unmistakable. Curt Duncan is \n               following her. We do not see him, we do not hear him, yet we \n               know he is there. Often we can sense that the very angle \n               from which we see Tracy is his POV.\n\n               But Tracy is aware of nothing. We know this when the CAMERA \n               begins to move in front of her, once more becoming an \n               impersonal observer of her walk homeward, to safety.\n\n               Tension mounts as we start to expect that Duncan will jump \n               out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes. \n               But he doesn't.\n\n               Finally, Tracy walks up to the CAMERA at the end of a block \n               and turns a corner; but the CAMERA HOLDS on the dark street \n               she has just come up. We hear a cough which confirms that \n               Duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows.\n\n               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Tracy walks up the steps and enters the apartment.\n\n               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING\n\n               Tracy steps into the elevator. The doors close. CAMERA HOLDS \n               on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from \n               one to six.\n\n               O.S. we hear the door to the apartment building open and \n               close.\n\n               INT. SIXTH FLOOR\n\n               Tracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to \n               her door. She fumbles through her purse for keys, then bends \n               over the lock to let herself in.\n\n               Behind her down the hall, Duncan appears. He watches her, \n               starts to move silently forward. Tracy gets the door open, \n               then turns and sees him. Duncan stops.\n\n                                     TRACY\n                         Oh, it's you!\n                              (beat)\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                              (moving forward)\n                         ...Came to apologize.

Look at you. Are you all \n                         right.\n\n               Duncan half shrugs, half smiles. Tracy edges into her door-\n               way. Duncan stands opposite her.\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                         I'm new in town.

Duncan coughs again.\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                         Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone \n                         cold, unfriendly...\n\n               Inside Tracy's apartment, the telephone rings. Tracy turns \n               vaguely, indecisively, and goes to answer it.\n\n                                     TRACY\n                              (over her shoulder)\n                         Excuse me.\n\n               She disappears into the apartment.

Okay... \n                         Goodbye.\n\n               She hangs up the phone, stands and turns back toward the \n               door. Duncan is standing right behind her.\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                         I'm not from New York, actually.

She turns, leans against it and sighs.\n\n               Outside the door, Duncan's footsteps move down the hall, \n               pause, then come back to the door. A moment passes. Then \n               there is a faint knocking on the door. Tracy doesn't move. \n               The knocking comes again, a little louder this time.

Clifford enters, \n               walks up to his old desk, opens some of the drawers -- they \n               are empty -- sits down in his old chair, smiles at Garber.\n\n               B.

He shows the clerk a photo \n               of Duncan taken some years ago in the mental institution. \n               The clerk shakes his head and starts to hand the picture \n               back when Clifford motions for him to keep it.

It bears the address \n               Clifford has just underlined. Clifford gets out of his car \n               and walks up to the bar. A \"Closed\" sign is displayed in the \n               window. Clifford knocks on the door. After a moment, Hank \n               opens the door.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

A BUM is stretched out on his back across one of \n               the tables like a corpse awaiting autopsy. This is CHEATER.\n\n               A MAINTENANCE MAN in grey work clothes enters from the back. \n               He opens a broom closet, takes out a bucket and mop and rolls \n               them toward the front of the laundromat. He stops at Cheater's \n               table and shakes him hard.\n\n                                     MAINTENANCE MAN\n                         Okay, man, move it out.

An OLD \n               WOMAN sitting against the wall points down one of the aisles \n               of washing machines and says to the maintenance man:\n\n                                     OLD WOMAN\n                         There's another one down there.\n\n               The maintenance man goes to the end of the aisle and looks \n               down into the nook created by the absence of one of the \n               washing machines.\n\n                                     MAINTENANCE MAN\n                         Hey!\n\n               He nudges at whatever's inside the nook with his foot.\n\n                                     MAINTENANCE MAN\n                              (nudging again)\n                         Come on, bright eyes.

After the coroner's \n                         investigation, their bodies were \n                         taken to the mortuary, where the \n                         undertaker took one look at them and \n                         said he couldn't have their bodies \n                         reconstructed for the funeral without \n                         six days of steady work. Then he \n                         asked what had been the murder weapon, \n                         because looking at the mess in front \n                         of him, he couldn't imagine what had \n                         been used. The coroner told him there \n                         had been no murder weapon. The killer \n                         had used only his hands.\n                              (beat)\n                         The undertaker went to work and had \n                         them done in four.\n\n               The picture falls out of Tracy's hands.

A transistor radio plays country music blues.

Then a MAN sitting two seats away reaches \n               over and places a quarter on the counter between them.\n\n               The waitress looks at the man irritatedly, then picks up the \n               money and moves away.\n\n               Duncan slowly sits down again. He pulls the cup back to \n               himself, then turns and looks at the man for a long moment, \n               unable to express his gratitude.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

He is panhandling PASSERSBY, without much success. \n               We see him fall into a fit of coughing that incapacitates \n               him for several seconds. He's obviously getting sicker.\n\n               We lose sight of Duncan as our MONTAGE continues. We see \n               Clifford talking to a BUM, then another. He is passing the \n               time combing the streets in the neighborhood of the bar.\n\n               PARK - DUSK\n\n               A handful of BUMS are sitting together on the grass passing \n               a bottle in a brown paper bag.

Cheater looks \n               as if he's about to cry like a baby when a hand enters the \n               frame from the other side -- the hand holding out to Cheater \n               a full bottle of wine. Cheater takes the bottle and looks up \n               gratefully... to see John Clifford standing beside him.\n\n                                     CHEATER\n                         Well!

We can work \n                         together.\n\n               Clifford stands to go.

CLIFFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Clifford is \"suiting up\" for his night's work. He is dressed \n               casually -- blue jeans, shirt open at the neck, sports jacket, \n               Adidas running shoes. He looks at himself in the mirror, is \n               satisfied. Then he picks up from the dresser two awl-like \n               instruments with short handles and long, glistening tapered \n               needlepoints -- his weapons. He slides them into a leather \n               sheath inside his jacket and turns to go.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. BAR - NIGHT\n\n               It is lit up inside. The bar is open for business. Across \n               the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is \n               waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes \n               out.\n\n               INT. BAR\n\n               The place is empty but for Hank who half watches the \n               television over the bar, and Tracy who sits alone in a corner. \n               Several moments pass as both of them sit and wait.\n\n               Then, the front door starts to swing open. Someone is coming \n               in. Tracy and Hank both glance nervously toward the door.\n\n               A MAN'S head peeks in. He is somewhere in his forties, a \n               regular customer.\n\n                                     CUSTOMER\n                         Hey, Hank, what're you doing open \n                         tonight?\n\n                                     HANK\n                              (relaxing)\n                         Trying to make a buck.\n\n               The customer walks up to the bar, sits down and talks quietly \n               with Hank.\n\n               Tracy looks nervously at her wristwatch. She stubs out her \n               cigarette, takes one last gulp of her drink and stands up to \n               go.\n\n               She walks to the bar, opens her purse and reaches inside.\n\n                                     HANK\n                         Keep it, honey. My treat.\n\n               They exchange a meaningful look.

BAR\n\n               Tracy looks up and down the street, hoping to see Clifford \n               somewhere, afraid of glimpsing Duncan instead. Then she starts \n               walking quickly homeward.\n\n               EXT. STREETS\n\n               Following Tracy to her apartment. We pick up Clifford now, \n               and we cut back and forth between the two of them -- her \n               walking quickly, never looking back, and him sneaking along \n               several hundred feet behind her, looking everywhere for \n               Duncan, whom we never see.\n\n               EXT. TRACY'S APARTMENT\n\n               She walks up the steps and enters.\n\n               INT. SIXTH FLOOR\n\n               Tracy steps off the elevator and goes to her door. She fumbles \n               through her purse for the key. Then she hears footsteps on \n               the stairs. She turns. It's Clifford.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                              (coming forward: half-\n                              whispering)\n                         No luck.

Then she steps away and turns back to the door.\n\n                                     TRACY\n                         I'm okay.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         I'm going to hang around outside for \n                         awhile.

TRACY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL\n\n               Tracy steps in. Clifford stays in the doorway. They are still \n               whispering.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Are you sure you're okay?\n\n                                     TRACY\n                         I'm fine.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         All right.

Thanks.\n\n                                     TRACY\n                         Sure.\n\n               Tracy closes the door and throws the bolt. Then she walks \n               into the apartment and out of frame. CAMERA STAYS in the \n               hallway. We can hear Tracy moving about O.S.\n\n               Then, as if on its own, the door to the hall closet slowly \n               swings open...\n\n               ...until we can see Duncan standing inside the closet.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN\n\n               Tracy is putting some coffee on. Then she removes her coat \n               and walks out of the kitchen.\n\n               INT. FRONT HALL\n\n               Tracy goes up to the closet with her coat. The door is closed. \n               She opens it. She hangs up her coat and closes the door again. \n               Then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the \n               living room.\n\n               As she is rounding the corner into the living room, she walks \n               right into Duncan. She barely has time to gasp before he \n               clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the \n               wall.\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                              (urgent whisper)\n                         I just have to talk to you.\n                              (pathetically)\n                         I want you to be my friend.\n\n               As she isn't struggling, he starts to loosen up on her.\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                         Please...\n\n               He takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and \n               slowly, cautiously steps back. Tracy looks at him for a \n               breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. Then she screams.\n\n               Duncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. Tracy \n               doesn't move. She just keeps screaming hysterically.\n\n               EXT. STREET\n\n               Tracy's screams carry out into the night as Clifford races \n               across the street and into the apartment building.\n\n               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT\n\n               Duncan runs to a window, throws it open and climbs out onto \n               the fire escape.\n\n               INTERCUT - APARTMENT STAIRS AND FIRE ESCAPE\n\n               As Clifford bounds up the stairs, flight after flight, and \n               Duncan tears down the fire escape.\n\n               INT. SIXTH FLOOR\n\n               The screaming has stopped when Clifford reaches Tracy's door. \n               He grabs the doorknob and heaves himself against the door. \n               It's bolted shut.\n\n               Clifford pulls one of the needles from his jacket and hammers \n               it into the lock. The bolt springs and Clifford runs into \n               the apartment.\n\n               INT. TRACY'S APARTMENT\n\n               As Clifford bursts in. Tracy gestures toward the window. \n               Clifford runs to it and sticks his head out.\n\n               POV - CLIFFORD\n\n               Duncan is gone.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               Clifford runs to a window on another wall and looks out onto \n               the street.\n\n               POV - CLIFFORD\n\n               No sign of the Englishman.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               Clifford runs out of the apartment, yanking his needle from \n               the lock as he passes the door, and charges back down the \n               stairs.\n\n               Tracy moves to the door and closes it. She is breathing \n               heavily.\n\n               O.S. we hear the angry sizzle of coffee spilling onto the \n               hot stove, as Tracy goes to get it.\n\n               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING\n\n               Clifford comes out, looks around and moves rapidly up the \n               street.\n\n               EXT. A STREET\n\n               Duncan is hurrying along, dodging in and out of people, trying \n               to move quickly but not draw attention to himself...\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER STREET\n\n               Clifford is travelling along the sidewalk, crossing the \n               street, looking everywhere...\n\n               EXT. ALLEYWAY\n\n               Duncan is running up the alley. He comes to a stop beside \n               some piled up trash cans. He leans against the brick wall of \n               the building, huffing and puffing. He is frightened, but he \n               feels safe for now. He slowly slides down the wall to the \n               ground...\n\n                                                             FLASH BACK TO:\n\n               INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n               Duncan is curled up in the corner of a bare cell with padded \n               walls. He is in a strait-jacket. His head is shaved. We can't \n               tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply \n               frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. A ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               This is the children's bedroom in Dr. Mandrakis' house of \n               six years ago. It is dark. Two small beds occupy one corner \n               of the room. We can see two small lumps on the beds, but no \n               more.\n\n               Duncan sits in the foreground with a telephone on his lap. \n               He is dialing a number. The phone rings three times before \n               it is answered -- or rather, picked up, because there is no \n               voice on the other end. After several seconds the phone is \n               hung up.\n\n               Duncan hangs up and thinks for a moment. He picks up the \n               phone and dials again. This time he gets a busy signal. He \n               hangs up, stands and goes to the door. He opens it slowly, \n               peers out. Jill's voice can be heard faintly talking to the \n               operator, asking for the police.\n\n               Duncan closes the door and comes back into the room, mumbling. \n               He goes to the window, looks out. Then he goes to the \n               children's beds.\n\n               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n\n               As he raises the covers and stares down into the CAMERA.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Dark. A little BOY is lying in bed, apparently asleep. This \n               is Curt Duncan as a child.\n\n               Some voices approach in the hallway outside the bedroom. \n               They are gruff, with heavy English accents, but subdued; a \n               MAN and a WOMAN, well into middle-age.\n\n               The boy's eyes open as he listens:\n\n                                     MAN (O.S.)\n                         What's the matter?\n\n                                     WOMAN (O.S.)\n                         Save it for later. Let's go out and \n                         get some food.\n\n                                     MAN (O.S.)\n                         What about the lad? You can't leave \n                         him.\n\n                                     WOMAN (O.S.)\n                         Curt's asleep. He'll never know we're \n                         gone.\n\n               From outside, a key enters the lock of the bedroom door and \n               turns. The bolt slips and the door is securely shut.\n\n               The boy sits up in bed, apprehensive. In TIGHT SHOTS of the \n               floor we see a rat come out from under the bed, then another. \n               They make \"chit-chit\" noises as they begin to explore. One \n               of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the \n               bedpost. Then we see two more rats appear.\n\n               We go for a TIGHT SHOT of the boy on top of the bed. The \n               \"chit-chit\" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's \n               apprehension turns to fear, then to terror. The boy starts \n               to whimper.\n\n               Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room. The floor \n               is crawling with rats, hundreds of them. The \"chit-chit\" \n               rises to practically a roar as the boy, alone on top of the \n               bed, begins to wail.\n\n               The room seems to darken, and the boy becomes just a little \n               white speck in it. The focus is turned. The picture becomes \n               a black and white blur.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - THE PRESENT\n\n               At first all that can be seen is a white blur against a black \n               screen. The previous sound of a boy crying increases. Then \n               the blur grows larger, coming more into focus as the entire \n               screen image moves toward normal definition. Finally, we \n               know we are back in the alleyway, that it is night, and that \n               the white blur is actually a little BOY lost, sobbing \n               uncontrollably.\n\n               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n\n               Awakening to the scene, coming back to reality. He is \n               confused.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE ON DUNCAN AND BOY\n\n               The boy continues sobbing, moving about in little circles. \n               Duncan, amazed at what he sees, slowly crawls out from the \n               wall on his hands and knees, crawls toward the weeping child, \n               staring at it with a strange look on his face.\n\n               Suddenly the boy stops crying and looks at Duncan quizzically, \n               hesitantly. They are less than a foot apart, almost face to \n               face. Together they form a kind of frozen tableau. Something \n               close to sympathy crosses the killer's expression, and the \n               boy, likewise, achieves a faint sense of recognition.\n\n               Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he \n               runs off down the alleyway. Duncan watches him disappear. \n               Then he slowly pulls himself to his feet.\n\n               EXT. STREET\n\n               Clifford is coming up the sidewalk. As Clifford crosses the \n               entrance to an alleyway, the boy comes running out and almost \n               collides with him. Clifford grabs the boy and looks down at \n               him. Then he passes the wailing child off on a nearby \n               PEDESTRIAN and runs up into the alley.\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER STREET\n\n               Duncan is hurrying along the sidewalk. Something makes him \n               look up.\n\n               POV - DUNCAN\n\n               He is looking at a neon \"Jesus Saves\" sign above the doorway \n               to an inner city mission.\n\n               BACK ON DUNCAN\n\n               As he stares at the sign.\n\n                                     DUNCAN (O.S.)\n                         Hey, Crazy Curt!\n\n               Duncan turns to see Cheater elatedly hobbling up to him.\n\n                                     CHEATER\n                         Hail fellow well met, and all that \n                         jazz.

Hey!! You really are crazy! \n                         C'mon!\n\n               Duncan enters the mission and Cheater stands out on the \n               sidewalk for a moment, bitterly frustrated.\n\n                                     CHEATER\n                         \"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! \n                         Rage!

ANOTHER STREET\n\n               Clifford comes out of a derelict hotel, looks up and down \n               the street and hurries off, not giving up the chase.\n\n               INT. MISSION - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               A MAN is leading Duncan to the bathroom. Duncan enters slowly \n               and goes to one of the wash basins where there is an old \n               razor blade and a can of shaving cream. Duncan picks up the \n               razor for a moment and looks at it. He is lost in thought. \n               Then he sets it down and turns on the tap water.\n\n               He glances at himself in the mirror and is suddenly transfixed \n               by his own image. He looks deeply into the mirror for several \n               seconds. Then he starts to cry, and having begun, a flood of \n               emotions comes pouring out of him. He drops to his knees.\n\n               The man comes running back into the bathroom. He holds Duncan \n               and helps pull him back to his feet.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Cheater is trudging along the sidewalk, hands in pockets, \n               head lowered. He looks up and sees something that brings him \n               back to life.\n\n               POV - CHEATER\n\n               Clifford is standing on the corner up ahead, looking around.\n\n               WIDE ANGLE ON STREET\n\n               Cheater calls out and starts to run toward Clifford.\n\n               Clifford turns, sees Cheater.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. MISSION - NIGHT\n\n               The \"sleeping dorm\". It is a large empty room. Thirty or so \n               OUTCASTS are stretched out on the bare floor in the darkness. \n               Their combined snoring/wheezing creates a steady, ghastly \n               din.\n\n               The door at the far end of the hall opens. A figure steps in \n               and quietly closes the door behind him. He stands for a moment \n               taking in the scene, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. \n               Then he slowly creeps forward to the prone body of the nearest \n               sleeper.\n\n               CLOSEUP - FIGURE\n\n               It is Clifford. He moves stealthily from one body to the \n               next. In one hand he carries a small flashlight. He turns \n               the bodies over just long enough to shine the light in their \n               faces and identify who they are, or rather who they are not. \n               Then he moves on. In his other hand he holds a small, gleaming \n               Jimmy needle.\n\n               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n\n               He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger. \n               He turns over and sees the dark figure of Clifford slowly \n               advancing toward him.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               Clifford keeps coming, closer and closer to where Duncan \n               lies. He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps \n               up suddenly and bolts for the door.\n\n               Clifford looks up, sees the fleeing figure and charges after \n               it.\n\n               INT. CORRIDORS\n\n               Racing through a maze of narrow hallways, Duncan can't stop \n               to think where he's going. Clifford is barreling after him \n               some forty yards behind.\n\n               Duncan rounds a corner and ten yards up ahead, the hallway \n               deadends in a set of double doors. Duncan has no choice but \n               to hurl himself against the doors. They yield and he goes \n               through them.\n\n               Four seconds later, Clifford comes to the same doors and \n               pushes through to the other side.\n\n               INT. CHURCH\n\n               As Clifford comes through the doors which are a side entrance \n               into the chancel of this large, gothic-style church. Behind \n               him now, is the altar. Before him stretches the nave of the \n               edifice with its rows of pews, its dimly glowing stained \n               glass windows, and way in the back, its choir loft. At regular \n               intervals, tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on \n               high.\n\n               There is no sign of Duncan, but Clifford knows he must be in \n               here, hiding somewhere. He slowly walks forward to the front \n               of the chancel.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Duncan. Duncan. It's over now. Come \n                         on out.\n\n               Pause. Duncan doesn't come out. Clifford holds very still. \n               He hears nothing. He speaks again and his voice echoes through \n               the large empty church.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         My name's John Clifford. I'm a private \n                         detective. I've been hired by \n                         Alexander Mandrakis to take you back. \n                         I'm not going to hurt you.\n\n               CLOSEUP - DUNCAN\n\n               Hiding beneath a pew. He hears the name \"Mandrakis\" and it \n               registers like a thunderbolt. He silently mouths the name \n               \"Mandrakis\".\n\n               Then he hears Clifford's footsteps approaching.\n\n               ANGLE ON CLIFFORD\n\n               Slowly moving up the center aisle, looking from side to side \n               into the pews.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                              (gently; coaxing)\n                         I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not \n                         going to hurt you... There'll be no \n                         more pain... You're safe now...\n\n               Clifford moves closer and closer to Duncan's row until \n               finally, Duncan can bear it no longer. He jumps up from \n               beneath the pew and runs.\n\n                                     DUNCAN\n                              (hysterical)\n                         No! Mandrakis! No!\n\n               Clifford chases him through the pews and up the aisles to \n               the front of the church. He is clutching a needle in both \n               hands, ready to strike.\n\n               Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the \n               church.\n\n               INT. BELL TOWER\n\n               Duncan faces a spiraling stone staircase. He has no choice \n               but to climb them, higher and higher, the sound of Clifford's \n               angry footsteps always coming up behind him.\n\n               Finally, Duncan can climb no higher. He is at the top of the \n               bell tower. A lanceted opening in the stone wall ahead of \n               him looks out over the narrow shaft of the tower. Above him \n               are the huge iron bells. A rope hangs down from the bells, \n               dangling all the way down the shaft, forty or fifty feet to \n               the floor of the church.\n\n               Clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him. \n               Duncan has little choice. He is trapped. Just before Clifford \n               reaches him, Duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the \n               bell rope.\n\n               The bell starts to clang as Duncan, hanging in mid air, swings \n               back and forth within the narrow shaft. Clifford leans way \n               out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at Duncan, \n               but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing \n               down the rope.\n\n               Clifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope. At last, \n               he gets it, and he shakes it violently to get Duncan to lose \n               his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below.\n\n               But Duncan holds firm, climbing ever downward. The bell \n               continues to clang, sending its alarm out into the night. \n               Then Clifford braces himself and slowly, laboriously begins \n               to haul up on the rope.\n\n               Clifford gains momentum until Duncan is being pulled up faster \n               than he is climbing down. Still twenty feet off the ground, \n               Duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone \n               floor.\n\n               Then PEOPLE come rushing into the church, awakened by the \n               commotion of the bells. Duncan rolls into the shadows and \n               drags himself out a side door, while Clifford plans his own \n               escape from the bell tower.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. ALLEYWAY NEAR CHURCH - NIGHT\n\n               Clifford runs up the alleyway, looks around and finally \n               realizes he's lost his prey.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER ALLEYWAY\n\n               Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two \n               buildings, catching his breath. CAMERA MOVES IN on him, and \n               we see him looking the craziest he's ever been. He shakes \n               uncontrollably and begins to mumble, softly at first, then \n               getting louder. He's falling back into the grips of Guy du \n               Marraux.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. CITY - MORNING\n\n               A. All is still and quiet as soft, warm sunlight pours into \n               the dirty streets and alleyways. In the background, the bell \n               tower of the church rises above the skyline.\n\n               B. We see a SHOT of the park -- all the bums are asleep.\n\n               C. Then a SHOT of the mission -- its front door open, the \n               sidewalk empty.\n\n               D. Then the bar, where the same peaceful mood prevails.\n\n               E. Then the alleyway where we last saw Curt Duncan. Now he \n               is gone.\n\n               F. Then the exterior of Tracy's apartment building. Clifford's \n               car is parked out front.\n\n                                     TRACY (O.S.)\n                         I used to see my two kids every \n                         weekend.

Suddenly the restaurant comes alive with \n               excitement and alarm.\n\n               ANGLE ON JILL\n\n               As John runs up and drops to his knees beside her. She is \n               shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Jill, what's happening? What's wrong?\n\n                                     JILL\n                         It was him! Somebody call the police! \n                         Help me!\n\n               Other PEOPLE have crowded around and are making urgent noises \n               now about calling the police, an ambulance, etc. John tries \n               to cut through the confusion and anxiety.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Wait a minute! Just hold on! \n                         Sweetheart, what was him? What are \n                         you talking about?\n\n                                     JILL\n                         That man... Curt Duncan... He's home \n                         again! He's got our children!\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         He was on the phone?\n\n               Jill nods.\n\n               John grabs the telephone and quickly dials a number. The \n               crowd tries to quiet down, as much to hear for themselves as \n               to let John talk. The phone rings and rings. Finally...\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         Hello?\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart. \n                         What's going on over there?\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         Nothing's going on.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Is everything all right?\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         Yes, there's nothing --\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Are you sure?\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         Everything's fine. Why? What's --?\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Carol, listen to me very carefully. \n                         If there's a man in the house, if \n                         there's any reason why you can't \n                         talk to me right now, just answer \n                         yes to me over the phone. That's \n                         all. If there's any danger of any \n                         kind, just say yes.\n\n               Long pause. They wait for her answer. Jill is listening into \n               the receiver now, too.\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         I don't understand what's happening. \n                         What man in the house?\n\n               Jill is confused. John breathes a guarded sigh of relief. \n               Jill takes the phone.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me \n                         truthfully. When was the last time \n                         you looked in on the children?\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         About forty-five minutes ago. \n                         Everything's fine. They were fast \n                         asleep.\n\n               Jill gives her husband a look. John takes the phone again.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Carol, I'm sorry about all the \n                         hysterics. We're leaving the \n                         restaurant now. We'll explain \n                         everything when we get home. Before \n                         we hang up, could you do just one \n                         more thing for me, please?\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         What?\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Would you go upstairs and, and check \n                         on the children for me?\n\n               Jill is violently shaking her head. John silences her with a \n               gesture.\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         Sure. Hold on.\n\n               Carol O.S. puts the phone down. Then there is silence on the \n               other end. The crowd of people around Jill and John begin to \n               shuffle and murmur. John tries to keep them quiet while \n               listening into the phone.\n\n               Then TWO POLICEMEN come forward through the crowd. One of \n               them kneels down to John and Jill who are still on the floor.\n\n                                     POLICEMAN #1\n                         What seems to be the problem here, \n                         sir?\n\n                                     JOHN\n                              (whispering)\n                         Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a \n                         second please, and I'll explain \n                         everything.\n\n                                     JILL\n                              (whispering to \n                              Policeman)\n                         I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter \n                         seven years ago with the child killer.\n\n               This means nothing to Policeman #1.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         The babysitter.

A Greek doctor...\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         That's right. That's the one.\n\n                                     POLICEMAN #2\n                              (to Policeman #1)\n                         It was in the seventh precinct...\n\n               As the two policemen and John mumble between themselves, \n               Jill takes the telephone.\n\n                                     JILL\n                              (listening)\n                         Hello?\n\n               She presses the receiver tighter to her ear.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Carol?\n\n               John quiets down the policeman. Jill can now hear what she \n               couldn't a second ago.\n\n                                     JILL\n                              (growing hysterical)\n                         Carol? Carol?!\n\n               ZOOM into the telephone until we can also hear what Jill is \n               reacting to. It grows louder and louder... A dial tone.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. LOCKHART HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               John and Jill pull up in the station wagon followed by a \n               squad car -- no sirens or lights. They all get out and rush \n               for the front door.\n\n               John pulls out his key to open the door... and discovers \n               that it's unlocked. Cautiously, they step inside.\n\n               INT. FRONT HALL\n\n               They look into the living room. Carol isn't there.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Carol? Carol?\n\n               No answer. The policemen tentatively draw their guns. Jill \n               bolts up the stairway.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Jill!\n\n               Policeman #2 runs up after her.\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS HALL\n\n               As Jill runs down to the children's bedroom followed by \n               Policeman #2. She opens the door and rushes inside.\n\n               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM\n\n               The children are in bed, asleep. Policeman #2 stands in the \n               doorway as Jill goes up to June and bends over her.\n\n                                     JUNE\n                              (opening her eyes)\n                         Mommy?\n\n               Jill kisses her gently on the forehead.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Sshhh...\n\n               June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep. \n               Jill walks over to Stevie's bed and looks down at him. He \n               turns slightly in his sleep.\n\n               Satisfied that her children are safe, Jill pulls up the covers \n               on Stevie and then walks slowly out of the bedroom.\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS HALL\n\n               Jill quietly pulls the door shut, and Policeman #2 walks \n               back up the hallway. Jill leans against the wall and buries \n               her face in her hands. She is drained. She starts to cry.\n\n                                     JOHN (O.S.)\n                         Nothing was wrong?\n\n                                     CAROL (O.S.)\n                         When I got back to the phone, the \n                         line was dead.

After a long silence...\n\n                                     JILL\n                         What are you thinking about?\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         If I ever get my hands on the guy \n                         that made that call...\n\n                                     JILL\n                         John, it wasn't a prank.

BEDROOM\n\n               Jill is tossing in her sleep. John is fast asleep next to \n               her, on his side facing away from her. Then, Jill wakes up. \n               She is heavily sedated, groggy. She hardly knows where she \n               is at first.\n\n               She pulls herself up to a sitting position on the side of \n               the bed. She tries to gather her wits.

The darkness around her is ominous, threatening.\n\n               She stops at the dining room window and looks out. On the \n               street a patrol car slowly passes and disappears down the \n               block.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN\n\n               Jill enters, turns on the light, opens a cupboard and takes \n               out a glass. She goes to the refrigerator and opens it. \n               Suddenly, the lights go out.\n\n               Jill closes the refrigerator door and goes and turns on \n               another light. Apparently, only a lightbulb has blown. Jill \n               unscrews the burned-out bulb from its socket and throws it \n               in the trash.\n\n               She leaves the kitchen.\n\n               INT.

Where did you \n                         get this candy?\n\n                                     STEVIE\n                         What?\n\n                                     JILL\n                         Where did you get this?\n\n                                     STEVIE\n                              (very groggy)\n                         The man gave it to me...\n\n                                     JILL\n                         What man?\n\n                                     STEVIE\n                              (drifting off)\n                         I don't know... He was... Wings on a \n                         horse...\n\n               He closes his eyes and is asleep.\n\n               Jill stands up, turns and starts to walk out of the room. \n               Halfway across the floor, Jill stops. She stands rigid as a \n               thought penetrates her own drowsiness. She turns very slowly \n               and moves to the closet in the children's bedroom.\n\n               She stands before it a moment. Then she reaches her hand \n               forward for the knob on the closet door. She very slowly \n               pulls the door open. She looks inside. There is nothing.\n\n               Jill quietly closes the closet door and leaves the room.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM\n\n               Jill enters. John is still asleep facing the wall. Jill gets \n               into bed, sitting up. She is wide awake now. She sits for a \n               moment in the darkness, thinking.\n\n               Then she reaches for the princess phone on the bedside table. \n               She doesn't get a dial tone. She quietly pushes the phone's \n               disconnect button up and down several times. Still no dial \n               tone.\n\n               Jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension \n               creeping over her face.\n\n               Then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear the \n               muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. It is Duncan in \n               the throes of Guy du Marraux.\n\n               Jill freezes. As the voice gets steadily louder and more \n               menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom \n               closet which is a couple of inches ajar.\n\n                                     JILL\n                              (urgently whispering)\n                         John?... John?...\n\n               She reaches for the bedside lamp and turns it on, never taking \n               her eyes away from the closet door. As soon as the light \n               comes on, the voice stops.\n\n               Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's \n               shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.\n\n                                     JILL\n                         John!... John!...\n\n               The body beside her stirs, rolls over, looks at her hideously. \n               It is Duncan!!\n\n               Jill shrieks, and makes a move to leap out of the bed.\n\n               Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness \n               grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her \n               nightgown.\n\n               As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly \n               while she fights to get away.\n\n               Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab Jill's \n               ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to lose \n               her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the \n               doorway leading out of the room.\n\n               Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his \n               hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the desperate \n               sound of a woman facing certain death.\n\n               Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other \n               sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud.\n\n               Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol in \n               hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford walks \n               around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down.\n\n               On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall \n               lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John stirs, \n               as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some \n               time yet before he comes to.\n\n               Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over \n               Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the \n               doorway, sobbing hysterically.\n\n                                     CLIFFORD\n                         Your husband's okay.\n\n               Then he is gone.\n\n               As Jill sits there unable to rein in her emotions, June and \n               Stevie toddle up to her groggily from the hallway.\n\n                                     JUNE\n                         Mommy?\n\n               Jill clutches her children to her heaving breast and buries \n               her face between them.\n\n               INT.
