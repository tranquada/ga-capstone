That next moment:\n                      What? What do I do?  Then What? \n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      Well that's what Hospice will take care of\n                      for you.  They will send a nurse, someone \n                      who can take care of all of that for you -- \n\n                                LINDA \n                      He has Phil right now.\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      Phil's one of the nurses from the service? \n\n                                LINDA \n                      Yeah.\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      If you're happy with Phil taking care\n                      of him and helping you, that's fine, \n                      but contact Hospice to arrange for the body -- \n\n                                LINDA \n                      -- you don't understand: it's more pain \n                      than before and the fucking morphine pills\n                      aren't working, he's -- past two days it's \n                      like he can't really swallow them and I don't \n                      know if they're going down -- I can't see inside\n                      his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring\n                      at him and I don't think the pills are going\n                      down and he moans and he hurts -- \n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      We can fix that, because I can give\n                      you -- are you listening? \n\n                                LINDA \n                      I'm listening.  I'm getting better. \n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      Do you wanna sit down? \n\n                                LINDA \n                      I need to sit down.\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it.\n                      He's dying. He is.  He is dying very,\n                      very rapidly -- \n\n     She breaks a bit more.\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      Now the thing here is making that experience \n                      as painless and easy as possible for him, \n                      you understand?  Now you need to get in touch \n                      with Hospice care because they can take care of\n                      all those practical things that you're asking \n                      me about -- they are who you call when he dies. \n\n     He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      This is the number for Hospice.\n                      Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go,\n                      there is something else to consider that\n                      can take the pain away that he is in,\n                      there is a very strong and very potent solution\n                      of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,\n                      with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in\n                      his mouth and drop on his tounge and \n                      it will certainly diminish the pain that\n                      he is in but you have to realize that\n                      once you give it to him; there really \n                      is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly\n                      cure his pain, but he will float in and \n                      out of consciousness, even worse than he\n                      is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the \n                      recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- \n\n                                LINDA \n                      -- how the fuck can I say anything \n                      to that -- I don't know what to say to that -- \n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      The job here is to make him as comfortable \n                      as possible -- right now -- our job is to just\n                      try and make it as painless as possible.\n                      Right?  You understand? \n\n     CAMERA pushes into an EXTREME CLOSE UP on Dr. Landon's hands writing\n     the perscription for the liquid morphine....hands it to Linda....\n\n                                                                CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

His motor skills seem to be fading quickly.)\n\n                                JIMMY \n                      Imagine you are attending a jam session\n                      of classical composers and they have \n                      each done an arrangment of the classic \n                      favorite, \"Whispering.\"  Here are three \n                      variations on the theme, as three classic \n                      composer's might have written it -- you are\n                      to name the composer.
