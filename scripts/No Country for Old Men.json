MOUNTAINS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Snow is falling in a gusting wind. The voice of an old man:\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           I was sheriff of this county when I\r\n           was twenty-five. Hard to believe.\r\n           Grandfather was a lawman. Father\r\n           too. Me and him was sheriff at the\r\n           same time, him in Plano and me here.\r\n           I think he was pretty proud of that.\r\n           I know I was.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WEST TEXAS LANDSCAPE - DAWN/DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          We dissolve to another West Texas landscape. Sun is rising.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           Some of the old-time sheriffs never\r\n           even wore a gun. A lot of folks find\r\n           that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough\r\n           never carried one. That's the younger\r\n           Jim. Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear\r\n           one. Up in Comanche County.\r\n\r\n          We dissolve through more landscapes, bringing us to full\r\n          day. None of them show people or human habitation.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           I always liked to hear about the old-\r\n           timers. Never missed a chance to do\r\n           so. Nigger Hoskins over in Bastrop\r\n           County knowed everbody's phone number\r\n           off by heart. You can't help but\r\n           compare yourself against the old-\r\n           timers. Can't help but wonder how\r\n           they would've operated these times.\r\n           There was this boy I sent to the gas\r\n           chamber at Huntsville here a while\r\n           back. My arrest and my testimony. He\r\n           killed a fourteen-year-old girl.\r\n           Papers said it was a crime of passion\r\n           but he told me there wasn't any\r\n           passion to it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WEST TEXAS ROAD - DAY\r\n\r\n          The last landscape, hard sunbaked prairie, is surveyed in a\r\n          long slow pan.\r\n\r\n                          2\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           Told me that he'd been planning to\r\n           kill somebody for about as long as\r\n           he could remember. Said that if they\r\n           turned him out he'd do it again.\r\n\r\n          The pan has brought into frame the flashing light bars of a\r\n          police car stopped on the shoulder. A young sheriff's deputy\r\n          is opening the rear door on the far side of the car.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           Said he knew he was going to hell.\r\n           Be there in about fifteen minutes. I\r\n           don't know what to make of that. I\r\n           surely don't.\r\n\r\n          Close on a pair of hands manacled behind someone's back. A\r\n          hand enters to take the prisoner by one arm.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           The crime you see now, it's hard to\r\n           even take its measure. It's not that\r\n           I'm afraid of it.\r\n\r\n          Back to the shot over the light bars: the deputy, with a\r\n          hand on top of the prisoner's head to help him clear the\r\n          door frame, eases the prisoner into the backseat. All we see\r\n          of the prisoner is his dark hair disappearing into the car.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           I always knew you had to be willing\r\n           to die to even do this job -- not to\r\n           be glorious. But I don't want to\r\n           push my chips forward and go out and\r\n           meet something I don't understand.\r\n\r\n          The deputy closes the back door. He opens the front passenger\r\n          door and reaches down for something-apparently heavy-at his\r\n          feet.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           You can say it's my job to fight it\r\n           but I don't know what it is anymore.\r\n\r\n          The deputy swings the heavy object into the front passenger\r\n          seat. Matching inside the car: it looks like an oxygen tank\r\n          with a petcock at the top and tubing running off it.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           ...More than that, I don't want to\r\n           know. A man would have to put his\r\n           soul at hazard.\r\n          The deputy slams the door.\r\n\r\n                          3\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          On the door slam we cut to Texas highway racing under the\r\n          lens, the landscape flat to the horizon. The siren whoops.\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           ...He would have to say, okay, I'll\r\n           be part of this world.\r\n\r\n          INT. SHERIFF LAMAR'S OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE DEPUTY\r\n          Seated in the sheriff's office, on the phone. The prisoner\r\n          stands in the background. Focus is too soft for us to see\r\n          his features but his posture shows that his arms are still\r\n          behind his back.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          DEPUTY\r\n           Yessir, just walked in the door.\r\n           Sheriff he had some sort of a thing\r\n           on him like one of them oxygen tanks\r\n           for emphysema or somethin'. And a\r\n           hose from it run down his sleeve...\r\n\r\n          Behind him we see the prisoner seat himself on the floor\r\n          without making a sound and scoot his manacled hands out under\r\n          his legs. Hands in front of him now, he stands.\r\n\r\n                          DEPUTY\r\n           ...Well you got me, sir. You can see\r\n           it when you get in...\r\n          The prisoner approaches. As he nears the deputy's back he\r\n          grows sharper but begins to crop out of the top of the frame.\r\n\r\n                          DEPUTY\r\n           ...Yessir I got it covered.\r\n          As the deputy reaches forward to hang up, the prisoner is\r\n          raising his hands out of frame just behind him. The manacled\r\n          hands drop back into frame in front of the deputy's throat\r\n          and jerk back and up.\r\n\r\n          Wider: the prisoner's momentum brings both men crashing\r\n          backward to the floor, face-up, deputy on top.\r\n          The deputy reaches up to try to get his hands under the\r\n          strangling chain.\r\n\r\n          The prisoner brings pressure. His wrists whiten around the\r\n          manacles.\r\n\r\n                          4\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The deputy's legs writhe and stamp. He moves in a clumsy\r\n          circle, crabbing around the pivot-point of the other man's\r\n          back arched against the floor.\r\n\r\n          The deputy's flailing legs kick over a wastebasket, send\r\n          spinning the castored chair, slam at the desk.\r\n\r\n          Blood creeps around the friction points where the cuffs bite\r\n          the prisoner's wrists. Blood is being spit by the deputy.\r\n          The prisoner feels with his thumb at the deputy's neck and\r\n          averts his own face. A yank of the chain ruptures the carotid\r\n          artery. It jets blood.\r\n\r\n          The blood hits the office wall, drumming hollowly.\r\n\r\n          INT. SHERIFF LAMAR'S BATHROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The prisoner walks in, runs the water, and puts his wrists,\r\n          now freed, under it.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Close on the air tank. One hand, a towel wrapped at the wrist,\r\n          reaches in to hoist it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROAD - LATE DAY\r\n\r\n          Road rushes under the lens. Point-of-view through a windshield\r\n          of taillights ahead, the only pair in sight.\r\n          A siren bloop.\r\n\r\n          The car pulls over. A four-door Ford sedan.\r\n          The police car pulls over behind.\r\n          The prisoner -- his name is Anton Chigurh -- gets out of the\r\n          police car and slings the tank over his shoulder. He walks\r\n          up the road to the man cranking down his window, groping for\r\n          his wallet.\r\n\r\n                          MAN\r\n           What's this about?\r\n\r\n                          CHIGURH\r\n           Step out of the car please, sir.\r\n          The motorist squints at the man with the strange apparatus.\r\n\r\n                          MAN\r\n           Huh? What is...\r\n\r\n                          5\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CHIGURH\r\n           I need you to step out of the car,\r\n           sir.\r\n          The man opens his door and emerges.\r\n\r\n                          MAN\r\n           Am I...\r\n          Chigurh reaches up to the man's forehead with the end of the\r\n          tube connected to the air tank.\r\n\r\n                          CHIGURH\r\n           Would you hold still please, sir.\r\n          A hard pneumatic sound. The man flops back against the car.\r\n          Blood trickles from a hole in the middle of his forehead.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Chigurh waits for the body to slide down the car and crumple,\r\n          clearing the front door. He opens it and hoists the air tank\r\n          over into the front seat.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ARID PLAIN - DAY\r\n\r\n          Seen through an extreme telephoto lens. Heat shimmer rises\r\n          from the desert floor.\r\n          A pan of the horizon discovers a distant herd of antelope.\r\n          The animals are grazing.\r\n          Reverse on a man in blue jeans and cowboy boots sitting on\r\n          his heels, elbows on knees, peering through a pair of\r\n          binoculars. A heavy-barreled rifle is slung across his back.\r\n          This is Moss.\r\n          He lowers the binoculars, slowly unslings the rifle and looks\r\n          through its sight.\r\n          The view through the sight swims for a moment to refind the\r\n          herd. One animal is staring directly at us, its motion\r\n          arrested as if it's heard or seen something.\r\n          Close on Moss's eyes, one at the sight, the other closed.\r\n\r\n                         HE MUTTERS:\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Hold still.\r\n          He opens the free eye and rolls his head off the sight to\r\n          give himself stereo.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Close on the hatch-marked range dial on the sight. Moss\r\n          delicately thumbs it.\r\n\r\n                          6\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He eases the one eye back onto the sight.\r\n          Point-of-view through the sight: Moss adjusts to bring the\r\n          cross-hairs back down to the staring animal.\r\n          Moss's finger tightens on the trigger.\r\n          Shot: gunbuck swishes the point-of-view upward.\r\n          Moss fights it back down.\r\n          The point-of-view through the sight finds the beast again,\r\n          still staring at us.\r\n          The sound of the gunshot rings out across the barial.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Short beat.\r\n          The bullet hits the antelope: not a kill. The animal recoils\r\n          and runs, packing one leg.\r\n          The other animals are off with it.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Shit.\r\n          He stands and jacks out the spent casing which jangles against\r\n          the rocks. He stoops for it and puts it in his shirt pocket.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ARID PLAIN - LATER\r\n\r\n          Moss is on foot, rifle again slung over his shoulder,\r\n          binoculars around his neck. He is looking at the ground.\r\n          An intermittent trail of blood.\r\n          Moss's pace is brisk. Distances are long.\r\n          He suddenly stops, staring.\r\n          On the ground is the fresh trail of blood, the glistening\r\n          drops already dry at the periphery. But this trail is crossed\r\n          by another trail of blood. Drier.\r\n          Moss looks one way along this older trail:\r\n          His point-of-view: flatlands. Scrub. No movement.\r\n          He looks the other way.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          A distant range of mountains. No movement.\r\n          He stoops to examine the trail.\r\n\r\n                          7\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He paces it 'til he finds a print clear enough to give him\r\n          the animal's orientation.\r\n          He stands and looks again toward the distant mountains. He\r\n          brings up the binoculars.\r\n          His point-of-view: landscape, swimming into focus, heat waves\r\n          exaggerated by the compression of the lens.\r\n          Panning, looking for the animal.\r\n          Movement, very distant. The animal is brought into focus: a\r\n          black tailless dog, huge head, limping badly, phantasmal by\r\n          virtue of the rippling heat waves and the silence.\r\n          Moss lowers the glass. A moment of thought as he gazes off.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He turns and heads in the direction from which the dog came.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RISE NEAR BASIN - MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          Moss tops a rise. He scans the landscape below.\r\n          Not much to see except-distant glints, off something not\r\n          native to the environment.\r\n          Moss brings up the binoculars.\r\n          Parked vehicles: three of them, squat, Broncos or other off-\r\n          road trucks with fat tires, winches in the bed and racks of\r\n          roof lights.\r\n          On the ground near the trucks dark shapes lie still.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BASIN - MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          Moss is walking cautiously up to the site, unslung rifle at\r\n          the ready.\r\n          Flies drone.\r\n          He circles two dead bodies lying in the grass, covered with\r\n          blood. A gut-shot dog of the same kind we saw limping toward\r\n          the mountains lies beside them. A sawed-off shotgun with a\r\n          pistol stock lies in the grass.\r\n          The tires and most of the window glass are shot out of the\r\n          first pickup Moss approaches.\r\n          He opens the door and looks inside.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The driver is dead, leaning over the wheel. Moss shuts the\r\n          door.\r\n\r\n                          8\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He opens the door of the second truck.\r\n          The driver, sitting upright, still in shoulder harness, is\r\n          staring at him.\r\n          Moss stumbles back, raising the rifle.\r\n          The man does not move. The front of his shirt is covered\r\n          with blood.\r\n\r\n                          MAN\r\n           Agua.\r\n          Moss stares at him\r\n\r\n                          MAN\r\n           ...Agua. Por Dios.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Ain't got no water.\r\n          On the seat next to the man is an HK machine pistol. Moss\r\n          looks at it. He looks back at the man. The man is still\r\n          staring at him. Without lowering his eyes Moss reaches in\r\n          and takes the pistol.\r\n          Moss straightens up out of the truck and slings the rifle\r\n          back over his shoulder. He snaps the clip off the machine\r\n          pistol, checks it and snaps it back on.\r\n          Moss crosses to the back of the truck and lifts the tarp\r\n          that covers the truck bed.\r\n          A load of brick-sized brown parcels each wrapped in plastic.\r\n          He throws the tarp back over the load and crosses back to\r\n          the open cab door.\r\n\r\n                          MAN\r\n           Agua.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           I told you I ain't got no agua.

He looks at the tire tracks\r\n          extending back from the truck. He thinks for a beat.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n\r\n                          (TO HIMSELF)\r\n           I reckon I'd go out the way I came\r\n           in...\r\n          He starts off.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Through the truck's open door:\r\n\r\n                          MAN\r\n           La puerta...

FLATLAND NEAR THE BASIN - LATER\r\n\r\n          Moss stops to look out at a new prospect. Flatland, no cover.\r\n          He raises the binoculars.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           If you stopped... to watch your\r\n           backtrack... you're gonna shoot my\r\n           dumb ass.\r\n          He doesn't see anything. He lowers the glass, thinking.\r\n          He raises the glass again.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           ...But. If you stopped... you stopped\r\n           in shade.\r\n          He sets off.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

One lone shelf of\r\n          rock throws shade toward us. Heat shimmers in between.\r\n\r\n                          10\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Hard sun makes the rock shadow impenetrable. But there is a\r\n          booted foot sticking into the sun toe-up like the nub on a\r\n          sundial.\r\n          Moss lowers the binoculars.\r\n          He looks at his watch.\r\n\r\n          11:30.\r\n          He sits down.\r\n\r\n                         FAST FADE\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The foot hasn't moved.\r\n          Moss gets up and walks toward it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROCK SHELF - MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          Moss arrives at the rock shelf.\r\n          The man's body is tipped to one side. His nose is in the\r\n          dirt but his eyes are open, as if he is examining something\r\n          quite small on the ground.\r\n          One hand holds a .45 automatic.\r\n          Next to the body is a boxy leather document case.\r\n          Moss looks at the man. He takes the gun, looks at it, sticks\r\n          it in his belt.\r\n          He drags the document case away from the body and opens it.\r\n          Bank-wrapped hundreds fill it. Each packet is stamped\r\n\r\n          \"$10,000.\"\r\n          Moss stares. He reaches in to rifle the stacks, either to\r\n          confirm that the bag is full or to estimate the amount.\r\n          He stands, looks around, looks back the way he came.\r\n\r\n                          11\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HIS TRUCK\r\n          Moss's pickup is parked by a cattleguard off a paved but\r\n          little-used road.\r\n          Moss is just arriving. He throws in the document case, the\r\n          rifle and the machine pistol, climbs into the cab and slams\r\n          the door.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DESERT AIRE TRAILER PARK - TWILIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss's truck pulls into a trailer park that sits alongside\r\n          the highway on the outskirts of Sanderson, Texas. An old\r\n          sign with a neon palm tree identifies the park as the Desert\r\n          Aire.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Moss gets out of the truck next to a double-wide. Lights\r\n          glow inside. He takes the case and machine pistol, gets down\r\n          on his back next to the trailer and scoots underneath it.\r\n          His point-of-view: plywood and plastic pipes. He pulls some\r\n          insulation aside and crams the machine pistol up under the\r\n          pipes.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAILER - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss enters carrying the document case. A twentysomething\r\n          woman in cutoff jeans and a halter top watches TV. This is\r\n          Carla Jean.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           What's in the satchel?\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           It's full a money.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           That'll be the day.\r\n          Moss is crossing to a back bedroom. Before he disappears\r\n          inside Carla Jean sees the pistol stuck in the back of his\r\n          waistband.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           ...Where'd you get the pistol?\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           At the gettin' place.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He emerges without the case or the gun and crosses to the\r\n          refrigerator. He takes a beer from the refrigerator and peels\r\n          its pulltab.\r\n\r\n                          12\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           Did you buy that gun?\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           No. I found it.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           Llewelyn!\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           What? Quit hollerin'.\r\n          He walks back sipping the beer and sprawls on the couch.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           What'd you give for that thing?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           You don't need to know everthing,\r\n           Carla Jean.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           I need to know that.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           You keep running that mouth I'm gonna\r\n           take you in the back and screw you.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           Big talk.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Just keep it up.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           Fine.

TRAILER BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          We are drifting down toward Moss as he lies in bed next to\r\n          Carla Jean. He lies still, eyes closed, but he is shaking\r\n          his head. As the camera stops he opens his eyes, grimacing.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           All right.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He looks at the bedside clock.\r\n\r\n                          13\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Its LED display: 1:06.\r\n          He swings his legs off the bed, looks back at Carla Jean,\r\n          and pulls the blanket up over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAILER KITCHEN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Close on a gallon jug as Moss hold it under the tap, filling\r\n          it with water.\r\n          Carla Jean appears in the doorway, looking sleepy.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           Llewelyn.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Yeah.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           What're you doin', baby?\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Goin' out.\r\n\r\n                          CARLA JEAN\r\n           Goin' where?\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Somethin' I forgot to do.

TRUCK/EXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                          14\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         A MAP\r\n          A detailed topographical survey map, illuminated by a\r\n          flashlight.\r\n          Moss is studying it in the cab of his truck.\r\n          After a beat he folds the map.\r\n          He checks the .45 taken off the corpse with the money.\r\n          Wider: the pickup truck parked outside the cattle guard.\r\n          After a beat, the truck drives over the grate onto the unpaved\r\n          part of the road, jogging up the uneven terrain.\r\n          Through the windshield, the view is pitch black except for\r\n          the boulders and scrub picked out by the crazily bouncing\r\n          headlights.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BASIN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DOOR SLAM\r\n          We are close on the water jug slapping against Moss's leg as\r\n          we pull him through the darkness. The shape of his parked\r\n          truck is just visible behind him, silhouetted on the crest\r\n          by the glow of the moon already set.\r\n          Walking across the basin to the near truck Moss freezes,\r\n\r\n                         NOTICING:\r\n          Its driver's-side door: closed.\r\n          Moss scans the horizon. Its only blemish remains his own\r\n          pickup.\r\n          He jogs the few remaining paces to the pickup. He sets down\r\n          the gallon jug. Softly:\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Hello?...\r\n          No answer.\r\n          He opens the door.\r\n          The man's body is still held upright by the shoulder harness\r\n          but his head, flayed by buckshot, is tipped away.\r\n          Moss glances at the bed of the truck.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Empty.\r\n          He again looks at the horizon.\r\n\r\n                          15\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Now another pickup stands in silhouette next to his own.\r\n          Two men are there.\r\n          Moss covers behind the dead man's truck. He eases his head\r\n          out for another look.\r\n          Only one man visible now.\r\n          Sounds hard to identify. Something airy. Up on the crest his\r\n          pickup rocks and settles. Its tires are being slashed.\r\n          The other pickup's engine coughs to life. Headlights and\r\n          roof lights go on.\r\n          Moss again covers behind the vehicle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          A search-spot sweeps back and forth across the basin tableau\r\n          of bodies and trucks. After a few trips back and forth\r\n          something happens to the spot: its weaving light begins to\r\n          bounce. We can hear the jouncing suspension of the pickup as\r\n          it trundles down the incline.\r\n          But the light tells the perspective of the slowly approaching\r\n          truck. Moss stays in the lee of his sheltering vehicle as he\r\n          runs, doubled over, directly away from the light, keeping to\r\n          the shadow that wipes on and off.\r\n          A gunshot. Its impact kicks up dirt just ahead of Moss to\r\n          his right.\r\n          Moss turns to see:\r\n          Two jogging men flanking the truck like infantry escorting a\r\n          tank. One has just halted to fire; the other is now raising\r\n          his gun.\r\n          Moss tacks and sprints and rolls under a second abandoned\r\n          pickup to his left. Another shot sounds and misses.\r\n          Bullets plunk into the metal of the truck body. One bullet\r\n          skips off the dirt in front of the truck and pings up into\r\n          the undercarriage.\r\n          Moss is elbowing out the far side, next to a body lying by\r\n          the truck's passenger door.\r\n          The firing has stopped: Moss steals a look over the hood:\r\n          The pursuing pickup is slowing so that the two gunmen can\r\n          swing onto the running boards.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The truck accelerates and as it veers around the first\r\n          abandoned pickup its lights swing off Moss's cover truck.\r\n\r\n                          16\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Moss sprints off, doubled over, at a perpendicular to his\r\n          previous path. He hits the ground, pressing himself into the\r\n          earth, head between his forearms.\r\n          He elbows away as the truck bears on his former cover.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RIVER GORGE - DAWN\r\n\r\n          He tops the small rise and straightens and flat-out runs.\r\n          We hear the pickup's engine racing and see, behind Moss, its\r\n          spot sweeping backlight across the crest.\r\n          Moss is running towards the declivity of a river gorge. Sky\r\n          there is pink from unrisen sun.\r\n          Moss bears on the gorge, panting.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The pickup bounces up into view on the crest behind him,\r\n          roof lights blazing. It is pointed off at an angle. Its\r\n          spotlight sweeps the river plain.\r\n          It finds Moss. The truck reorients as it bounces down in\r\n          pursuit. A muzzle flash precedes the dull whump of the\r\n          shotgun.\r\n          Moss races on toward the river. Another shotgun whump.\r\n          Moss stumbles, turns to look behind him.\r\n          The truck, gaining ground. A man stands up out of the sunroof,\r\n          one hand on top of the cab, the other holding a shotgun.\r\n          Moss is almost to the steep riverbank. Another whump of the\r\n          shotgun.\r\n          Shot catches Moss on the right shoulder. It tears the back\r\n          of his shirt away and sends him over the crest of the river\r\n          bank.\r\n          Moss airborne, ass over elbows, hits near the bottom of the\r\n          sandy slope with a loud fhump.\r\n          He rolls to a stop and looks up.\r\n          We hear a skidding squeal and see dirt and dust float over\r\n          the lip of the ridge, thrown by the truck's hard stop.\r\n          As Moss pulls off his boots we hear voices from the men in\r\n          the truck.\r\n          There is the clank of its tailgate being dropped and sounds\r\n          of activity on the hollow metal of its bed.\r\n\r\n                          17\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Moss tucks his boots into his belt and runs splashing into\r\n          the fast-moving water. A look back:\r\n          Something shakes the scrub down the steep slope.\r\n          Moss backpedals deeper.\r\n          Bursting out of the scrub at the foot of the slope: a huge\r\n          black dog with a large head and clipped ears. It bounds toward\r\n          Moss.\r\n          Moss turns and half stumbles, half dives into the river.\r\n          Underwater a very dull whump followed by the fizz of buckshot.\r\n          Moss breaks the surface of the water, gasping, and looks\r\n\r\n                         BACK:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Figures on the ridge. Below, the dog hitting the water.\r\n          Another gunshot from the bank. Where it hits we don't know.\r\n          River current and Moss's strokes speed him away.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RIVER BEND - DAWN\r\n\r\n          He sweeps around a bend. He finds his feet under him and\r\n          staggers onto a sandbar and then splashes through some outwash\r\n          to the far bank.\r\n          The pursuing dog's head bobs rhythmically in the water.\r\n          Moss pulls the gun from his belt. He takes the clip out and\r\n          ejects the chamber round.\r\n          The dog finds his stumpy legs much closer to the sandbar:\r\n          his massive head dips and waggles as he lurches out of his\r\n          swim. He emerges from the river and bounds across the sand.\r\n          Moss shakes the gun and blows into the barrel.\r\n          The dog splashes through the riverwash that separates him\r\n          from the human.\r\n          Moss reinserts the clip. He chambers a round as the dog runs\r\n          snarling and as the dog leaps he fires.\r\n          Moss fires twice more quickly, not waiting to see whether\r\n          the first round told.\r\n          The dog lands, stopped but not dead. It jerks and gurgles.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           Goddamnit.\r\n          He is looking out at the river. His boots are drifting by.\r\n\r\n                          18\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY\r\n\r\n          Moss has climbed the far bank and found a seat on a rock.\r\n          It is now full day. Moss has taken off his shirt and has his\r\n          neck craned round and his back upper arm twisted toward him.\r\n          Where the buckshot hit, his arm is purpled and pinpricked.\r\n          He meticulously picks shirt fiber out from where buckshot\r\n          packed it into the flesh.\r\n          He finishes. He rips swatches from his shirt. He starts\r\n          wrapping his bare feet as he gazes off.\r\n          His point-of-view: a lot of landscape, a highway in the\r\n          distance. An eighteen-wheeler shimmies along in the heat.\r\n\r\n          EXT. GAS STATION/GROCERY - SHEFFIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          At an isolated dusty crossroad.

Moss is listening at the wall. He goes to\r\n          the bed and unzips the duffle bag and pulls out the sawed-\r\n          off shotgun. He lays it on the bed. He pulls the tent poles\r\n          and some duct tape out of the duffle.\r\n\r\n          INT.

The receiver lights\r\n          ups and bleeps one time.\r\n          Chigurh slows and looks around at the buildings that line\r\n          the two-lane highway.\r\n\r\n          INT. 2ND MOTEL ROOM - LATE DAY\r\n\r\n          Moss is standing on a desk chair unscrewing the plate from\r\n          the overhead airduct. He lays it aside and raises a flashlight\r\n          and peers into the airduct.\r\n\r\n                          48\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. MOTEL DUCT - LATE DAY\r\n\r\n          Down the length of the duct we see an elbow junction ten\r\n          feet away. The end of the document case is just visible\r\n          sticking out into the elbow.\r\n\r\n                         CHIGURH\r\n          The receiver is bleeping slowly as the car creeps along. Up\r\n          at a distant intersection is Charlie Goodnight's Del Rio\r\n          Motel.\r\n\r\n          INT. 2ND MOTEL ROOM\r\n\r\n          Moss rips off a length of duct tape. He wraps it around two\r\n          tent poles placed end-to-end but an inch apart, not butting.\r\n          He gives the tape several winds.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT.

Satisfied, he starts taping on\r\n          a third length of pole.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Chigurh stands in the doorway.\r\n          The room-number bangle hangs off the key in the knob.\r\n          He stares in for a beat.\r\n\r\n                          49\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He enters slowly and reaches up for the light switch. He\r\n          doesn't turn it on. He drops his hand. He reaches up again,\r\n          feeling it.\r\n          He looks around the room. He takes the key and closes the\r\n          door behind him.\r\n\r\n                         MOSS\r\n          Moss pulls three wire hangers off the closet rack. He takes\r\n          them to the bureau and picks up a sidecutter.\r\n\r\n                         CHIGURH\r\n          He walks over to the bathroom.\r\n          He turns on its light, looks.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He leaves the door open. He goes to a closet, opens it, looks.\r\n          He goes to the door of the room but doesn't open it. He stands\r\n          with his back against it and looks at the room.\r\n          The bathroom door.\r\n          The closet door.\r\n          Chigurh goes to the bed and sits to take off his boots.\r\n\r\n                         MOSS\r\n          Moss snips the last of the wire hangers' hooks off with the\r\n          sidecutter. He wraps the three hooks with duct tape to make\r\n          a sturdier one.\r\n          He wraps more tape to attach this hook to the end of the\r\n          three-link pole.\r\n\r\n                         CHIGURH\r\n          From a bag he withdraws a twelve-gauge automatic shotgun\r\n          fitted with a silencer big around as a beer can.\r\n          He checks the loads.\r\n          He picks up the regularly beeping receiver, turns it off,\r\n          and slips it into his pocket.\r\n          He hoists the air tank.\r\n\r\n                          50\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         MOSS\r\n          He is standing on the chair below the airduct, stooping to\r\n          pick up the jury-rigged pole leaning nearby. He straightens\r\n          and feeds the length of the pole into the duct, using the\r\n          joints to angle it in.\r\n\r\n          INT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Inside the duct: he watches the pole play in, illuminated by\r\n          the flashlight he has left resting inside.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

He pulls.\r\n          The pole slides off the case.\r\n\r\n          EXT./INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHIGURH\r\n          He stands at the door of Moss's first room. He eases an ear\r\n          against it.\r\n          He steps back.\r\n          He punches out the lock cylinder with the airgun and kicks\r\n          in the door, raising the shotgun.\r\n          A Mexican in a guyabera reclines on one of the two double\r\n          beds.\r\n          He is scrabbling for a machine pistol on the nightstand.\r\n          Chigurh fires three times quickly.

Much of the man on the bed is\r\n          spattered against the chewed-up headboard.\r\n          The bathroom door is ajar, its light on.\r\n          A long beat.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Movement in the wedge of light.\r\n          Immediately, chugs from the shotgun chew up bathroom door\r\n          and nearby wallboard.\r\n          A cry from inside.

The sound brings on\r\n          indirect light as holes are punched in the duct somewhere\r\n          around the bend.\r\n          Moss holds still as the galvanized metal faintly thunders.\r\n          The flashlight resting on it wobbles.\r\n\r\n          EXT./INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHIGURH\r\n          Gun leveled, at the open door.\r\n          Again, no movement.\r\n          He advances into the room, gun pointing at the bathroom door.\r\n          As he advances he swings the gun briefly over at the closet\r\n          door and fires. The splintered-in door reveals no occupant.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Chigurh angles around the double bed to get a view of that\r\n          wedge of bathroom floor visible through its door.

From his posture and the one visible hand he\r\n          seems unarmed.\r\n          Chigurh enters the bathroom.\r\n          The cornered man is unhurt but terrified.

MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          From inside the duct: fingers reach through the grille and\r\n          Chigurh's hand pushes it up into the duct, then angles it\r\n          and withdraws it. Faintly, under the distant airy drone of\r\n          the compressor, we hear the grate clatter to the floor.\r\n          The back of Chigurh's head appears. He aims a flashlight\r\n          away down the far length of the duct. A beat.\r\n          He pivots to face us.\r\n          His point-of-view: the length of the duct, empty, with a\r\n          drag-mark through the middle of the dust.\r\n          Back to Chigurh. His look holds.\r\n          He ducks out.\r\n\r\n          INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          In the room: Chigurh steps down from the chair and pulls the\r\n          receiver from his pocket and turns it on.\r\n          It beeps once.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Silence.\r\n\r\n                          54\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Frowning, looking down at the receiver, Chigurh makes a slow\r\n          sweep with it. The silence holds-snapped off by car steady\r\n          as we cut to:\r\n\r\n          INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss, with his duffle bag and document case, sits in the\r\n          passenger seat of an old station wagon. The driver is an\r\n          elderly man in a yoked shirt.\r\n          After a beat, eyes fixed on the road, the old man shakes his\r\n          head.\r\n\r\n                          OLD MAN\r\n           Shouldn't be doin' that.

The old man gazes at the\r\n           road.\r\n\r\n                          OLD MAN\r\n           Hitchhikin'.\r\n          He shakes his head again. Silent driving. The old man murmurs:\r\n\r\n                          OLD MAN\r\n           Dangerous.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

EAGLE PASS TOWN SQUARE - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Moss is getting out of the station wagon with his duffle and\r\n          document case.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          It is a town square. Among the old buildings is the Hotel\r\n          Eagle, identified by a neon above the front door.\r\n\r\n          INT. HOTEL EAGLE LOBBY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss enters. Behind the front desk an older man sits reading\r\n          Ring magazine. He has a hand-rolled cigarette.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           One room, one night.\r\n\r\n                          CLERK\r\n           That's twenty-six dollars.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           You on all night?\r\n\r\n                          CLERK\r\n           Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow\r\n           morning.\r\n          Moss pushes a hundred along with smaller bills across the\r\n          desk.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           For you.

Not\r\n           police. Just call me if anyone else\r\n           checks in tonight.\r\n\r\n          INT. SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss is mounting the stairs from the lobby. The carpeted\r\n          hallway is lined by transom-topped doors. Moss goes to a\r\n          door halfway down on his left.\r\n\r\n          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss enters a room with old oak furniture and high ceilings.\r\n          He sets the document case next to the bed.\r\n          He unzips the duffel and takes out the shotgun which he lays\r\n          on the bed, and then goes to the window. He parts the curtain\r\n          to look down.\r\n          The street is empty. Mexican music floats up faintly from a\r\n          bar somewhere not far away.\r\n\r\n          INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER\r\n\r\n          The room is dark. The music is gone.\r\n          We are looking straight down on Moss lying, clothed, on the\r\n          bed. We are booming straight down toward him.\r\n          After a beat he shakes his head. He opens his eyes,\r\n          grimacing.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           There just ain't no way.\r\n          He sits up and turns on the bedside lamp.\r\n          The shot gun and document case are on the floor by the bed.\r\n          Moss swings the document case onto the bed and unclasps it\r\n          and upends the money onto the bed. He feels the bottom of\r\n          the case, squeezing it with one hand inside and one hand\r\n          out, looking for a false bottom. He eyeballs the case, turning\r\n          it over and around.\r\n          He starts riffling money packets.\r\n          He finds one that binds. It has hundreds on the outside but\r\n          ones inside with the centers cut out. In the hollow is a\r\n          sending unit the size of a Zippo lighter.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He holds the sender, staring at it.\r\n          A long beat.\r\n\r\n                          59\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          From somewhere, a dull chug. The sound is hard to read-a\r\n          compressor going on, a door thud, maybe something else.\r\n          The sound has brought Moss's look up. He sits listening. No\r\n          further sound.\r\n          Moss reaches to uncradle the rotary phone by the bed. He\r\n          dials 0.\r\n          We hear ringing filtered through the handset. Also, faintly,\r\n          offset, we hear the ring direct from downstairs.\r\n          After five rings Moss cradles the phone.\r\n          He goes to the door, reaches for the knob, but hesitates.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He gets down on his hands and knees and listens at the crack\r\n          under the door.\r\n          An open airy sound like a seashell put to your ear.\r\n          Moss rises and turns to the bed. He piles money back into\r\n          the document case but freezes suddenly-for no reason we can\r\n          see.\r\n          A long beat on his motionless back. We gradually become aware\r\n          of a faint high-frequency beeping, barely audible. Its source\r\n          is indeterminate.\r\n          Moss clasps the document case, picks up his shotgun and eases\r\n          himself to a sitting position on the bed, facing the door.\r\n          He looks at the line of light under it.\r\n          The beeps approach, though still not loud. A long wait.\r\n          At length a soft shadow appears in the line of light below\r\n          the door. It lingers there. The beeping-stops.\r\n          A beat. Now the soft shadow becomes more focused. It resolves\r\n          into two columns of dark: feet planted before the door.\r\n          Moss raises his shotgun toward the door.\r\n          A long beat.\r\n          Moss adjusts his grip on the shotgun and his finger tightens\r\n          on the trigger.\r\n          The shadow moves, unhurriedly, rightward. The band of light\r\n          beneath the door is once again unshadowed.\r\n          Quiet. Moss stares.\r\n\r\n                          60\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The band of light under the door.\r\n          Moss stares.\r\n          Silently, the light goes out.\r\n          Something for Moss to think about. He stares.\r\n          The hallway behind the door is now dark. The door is defined\r\n          only from his side, by streetlight-spill through the window.\r\n          Moss stares. He shifts, starts to rise, doesn't. A beat.\r\n          A report -- not a gunshot, but a stamping sound, followed by\r\n          a pneumatic hiss.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          It brings a dull impact and Moss recoils, hit.\r\n          He winces, feeling his chest.\r\n          The door is shuddering creakily in.\r\n          It is all strange. Moss gropes in his lap and picks something\r\n          up. The lock cylinder.\r\n          The creaking door comes to rest, ajar.\r\n          Moss fires. The shotgun blast roars in the confined space\r\n          and for an instant turns the room orange. The chewed-up door\r\n          wobbles back against the jamb and creakily bounces in again.\r\n          Moss has already risen and is hoisting the document case.\r\n\r\n          FROM OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW\r\n          Moss finishes draping his shotgun by its strap across his\r\n          back and climbs out onto the ledge with the document case.\r\n          He swings the document case out and drops it.\r\n          The bracketing for the hotel's sign gives Moss a handhold.\r\n          He grabs it as inside the room the door is kicked open. Moss\r\n          swings down as, with a muted thump, orange muzzleflash strobes\r\n          the room.\r\n          Moss drops.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HOTEL EAGLE SIDEWALK - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss lands and grabs the document case and straightens. He\r\n          is at the hotel entrance, standing in the light coming through\r\n          the etched glass of the double doors.\r\n\r\n                          61\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He looks at his own shadow thrown onto the street. He plunges\r\n          through the doors into the lobby as a gun thumps and crackling\r\n          shot chews the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Moss hurries across the lobby. A glance to one side:\r\n          A booted foot sticks out from behind the front desk.\r\n          Moss slows approaching the stairway. He risks a look around\r\n          the stairway wall.\r\n          Ascending balusters fade off into the blackness of the second-\r\n          story hallway.\r\n          Moss sags. He looks back across the lobby at the front door.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He unhitches his shotgun. He remains still for a moment\r\n          holding the shotgun, back against the protected side of the\r\n          wall.\r\n          He quickly swings out and with shotgun aimed up the stairs\r\n          he crosses to the back lobby.\r\n          He quietly pushes open the back door.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SERVICE ALLEY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                         OUTSIDE\r\n          Moss emerges into a shallow service alley, dark and dirty.\r\n          He is at a run when we hear soft tock and a garbage can in\r\n          front of him snaps and wobbles.\r\n          He turns looking up, backpedaling. Another tock accompanies\r\n          a muzzleflash in a dark second-story window.\r\n          Moss fires his shotgun: loud. Chips fly off the brickface\r\n          and the window shatters.\r\n          Moss rounds the alley corner. He stops and squats.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DOWNTOWN EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Wide: dark, deserted downtown Eagle Pass, Moss a lone figure\r\n          resting at a corner.\r\n          Close on Moss panting. He takes stock, painfully feeling at\r\n          his upper chest where the lock hit, then touching gingerly\r\n          at his side, beneath the ribs, newly bloody. He sighs.\r\n\r\n                          62\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He listens. No noise. He gets to his feet with the document\r\n          case in one hand and shotgun in the other. He waits a beat,\r\n          back against the wall.\r\n          He swings out and fires the shotgun into the alley and then\r\n          spins back and runs a short block and rounds the next corner\r\n          and stops to rest.\r\n\r\n          EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          He waits for his breath to slow. He brings up the shotgun\r\n          and readies himself.\r\n          He swings out to look back around the corner.\r\n          The street is empty.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He waits, at the ready for whatever might emerge from the\r\n          alley mouth a short block away.\r\n          Long beat. Stillness.\r\n          A panicky thought brings his look and the shotgun swinging\r\n          back around: the man could round the block the other way.\r\n          Empty street.\r\n          Two empty streets: Moss doesn't know which way to cover,\r\n          which way to go.\r\n          He stands looking each way, trying to devise a plan. No basis\r\n          for a plan.\r\n          Quiet hesitation.\r\n          Now, a sound: engine noise.\r\n          An old pickup rounds a corner two blocks up. It rattles toward\r\n          him.\r\n          Moss lowers the shotgun. He keeps it to the hidden side of\r\n          his body.\r\n          The pickup dutifully stops at a flashing red traffic light.\r\n          It comes on through the intersection.\r\n          Moss strides out into the street. He swings the shotgun up\r\n          and gives the driver a raised palm to halt.\r\n\r\n          INT. PICKUP/EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The truck stops and Moss opens the passenger door and swings\r\n          the case in and climbs in after.\r\n\r\n                          63\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The driver, an older man, gapes at him, frightened.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           I'm not going to hurt you. I need\r\n           you to --\r\n          The windshield stars.\r\n          A quick second round pushes part of the windshield in.\r\n          Rounds come in without pause, cracking sheet metal, blowing\r\n          the cab's rear window into the truckbed, twisting the rear-\r\n          view.\r\n          A round seems to have caught the driver in the throat: a\r\n          gurgling scream as he claws at his windpipe, blowing out\r\n          blood.\r\n          Moss, quicker to react, has already ducked below the dash.\r\n          A snap of the driver's head and a new freshet of blood from\r\n          a shot to the head. The screams turn to low gurgles.\r\n          Moss, jammed almost in to the driver's lap, frantically gropes\r\n          for the shift.\r\n          He throws the pickup into drive and stamps at the accelerator,\r\n          driving blind as bullets continue to pour in.\r\n          He raises his head enough to see his side-view. It shows\r\n          sluing, bouncing, empty street, rough guide for steering.\r\n          A tremendous jounce up onto the curb then off it, the driver's\r\n          body swaying in its restraint.\r\n          The passenger side window shatters: we are passing the gunman.\r\n          Now Moss sits up to steer looking out front. Behind him\r\n          through the shot-out back window the dark street is suddenly\r\n          punctured by muzzleflash. It comes, for the first time, with\r\n          a report: the low chug of the muted shotgun.\r\n          Rattle of shot against sheet metal.\r\n          Moss floors the gas to roar into a turn. The street sweeping\r\n          out of view behind him produces one more chugging muzzleflash.\r\n\r\n          EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The pickup bounces but Moss, sitting fully up, can now steer.\r\n\r\n                          64\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He goes half the length of the block and then yanks the wheel\r\n          hard, braking. The pickup smashes a parked car and jacks\r\n          around to a halt.\r\n          Moss emerges from the pickup with his shotgun and goes to\r\n          the sidewalk and backtracks. He covers behind a parked car.\r\n          He sits leaning back against the car, waiting.\r\n          His point-of-view: his own reflection in the facing\r\n          storefront, a lot of the driver's blood on him.\r\n          He sinks lower.\r\n          A long beat.\r\n          Footsteps. They approach without hurry.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          A gritty boot turn at the corner. The footsteps come closer\r\n          still.\r\n          They pass and recede toward the pickup.\r\n          We cut to Chigurh approaching the pickup, shotgun held at\r\n          ease across his body.\r\n          He slows.\r\n          Moss: he hears the slowing steps. He tightens his grip on\r\n          his shotgun and tenses.\r\n          Chigurh: slowing further, he sees:\r\n          Bloody boot prints outside the passenger door.\r\n          Moss rises.\r\n          Chigurh is turning.\r\n          He dives as, behind him, Moss fires.\r\n          Shot peppers two parked cars -- the one Moss rammed and the\r\n          one behind.\r\n          Chigurh dived between them: hit or not?\r\n          Moss advances down the middle of the street. He angles his\r\n          head: anything under the cars?\r\n          He fires twice. Buckshot claws up the pavement and the car\r\n          bodies and tires, and the cars sink hissing to their rims.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Moss crosses to the far curb, still advancing. No one behind\r\n          the cars.\r\n\r\n                          65\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He looks up and down the street.\r\n          Nothing to see.\r\n          He goes to the pickup truck, driver's side. He opens the\r\n          door and reaches over the driver's corpse for his lap belt.\r\n\r\n          EXT. EAGLE PASS BORDER AREA - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Deserted.\r\n          The pickup truck rattles into frame.\r\n          Moss emerges. He hoists out the case. He leaves the shotgun.\r\n          It is very quiet.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He looks around.\r\n          The Rio Grande bridge.\r\n          Moss walks unsteadily toward it, pressing his free hand to\r\n          his side.\r\n          A thought stops him.

Three youths are approaching from the Mexican\r\n          side. Fart types, they are laughing and walking unsteadily.\r\n          As they approach they gape at Moss, covered with blood.\r\n          The lead boy, holding a beer, wears a light coat.\r\n\r\n                          MOSS\r\n           I'll give you five hundred bucks for\r\n           your shirt and your coat.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The three boys stare at him.\r\n\r\n                         AT LENGTH:\r\n\r\n                          66\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          YOUTH\r\n           Let's see the money.\r\n          Moss unpeels bills from a moist wad.

Moss pours the beer over his head,\r\n          rubbing blood away.\r\n          He opens his shirt. He inspects the wounds in his midriff,\r\n          entrance and exit. Pulsing blood laps weakly out. He shrugs\r\n          off his shirt, wraps it around his waist and knots it.\r\n          He starts to put on the new shirt. Something stops him. He\r\n          pauses.\r\n          He vomits into the roadbed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He straightens slowly and puts on the new shirt.\r\n          He looks out.\r\n\r\n                          67\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He is not yet over the river: wind stirs the cane on the\r\n          bank.\r\n          He looks up: Chain-link fence encloses the walkway to a height\r\n          of about twelve feet, curling inward at the top.\r\n          He looks down the walkway. The three boys are distant figures.\r\n          He looks up the walkway.\r\n          A few paces up a light pole stanchion stands flush to the\r\n          guardrail that separates road and walkway.\r\n          He goes to the stanchion and uses it to hoist himself onto\r\n          the guardrail, his free hand holding the case.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Standing on top of the curved metal rail and holding the\r\n          post for balance, he kneebends down and up and heaves the\r\n          case.\r\n          It sails clear of the chain-link fence. A short beat and we\r\n          hear a thump.\r\n          Moss pants for a moment, recovering from the strain of the\r\n          toss. He eases himself off the guardrail and goes to the\r\n          fence and looks at the bank below. One gnarled tree stands\r\n          out in the cane. The case, wherever it landed, is not visible.\r\n\r\n          EXT. GUARDSHACK MEXICAN SIDE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          There is a lighted guardshack at the end of the walkway.\r\n          Inside, a uniformed guard.\r\n          Moss walks unsteadily up. He tilts the beer bottle in salute\r\n          at the guard.\r\n          The guard impassively lets him proceed.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Beaming, singing.\r\n          Their smiles gradually fade.\r\n          The playing falls off to silence.\r\n          In the silence, birds chirp. The musicians are looking\r\n          quizzically down.\r\n          Moss's arm swings up in the foreground, extending a bloody\r\n          hundred-dollar bill.\r\n          On Moss.

Chigurh, climbing in, tosses a\r\n          brown paper bag onto the passenger side. He has a dark towel\r\n          wrapped around one leg.

He unknots the towel from around his leg and stands\r\n          and unbuttons his pants and starts cutting from the crotch\r\n          down with a heavy scissors.

Above it is the lock\r\n          cylinder. It has been punched hollow.\r\n          Sheriff Bell stands staring at the lock.\r\n          Very quiet.

It counts out beats.\r\n          Chigurh is also looking at the lock cylinder.\r\n          The curved brass of its hollow interior holds a reflection\r\n          of the motel room exterior. Lights and shapes. The curvature\r\n          distorts to unrecognizability what is reflected, but we see\r\n          the color of Sheriff Bell's uniform.\r\n          The reflection is very still.

He nudges the door inward.\r\n          As the lock cylinder slowly recedes, reflected shapes scramble\r\n          inside it and slide up its curve. Before the door is fully\r\n          open we cut around:\r\n\r\n                         FROM INSIDE\r\n          The door finishes creaking open. Sheriff Bell is a silhouette\r\n          in the doorway.\r\n          A still beat.\r\n          At length Sheriff Bell ducks under the chest-high police\r\n          tape to enter.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The worn carpet has a large dark stain that glistens near\r\n          the door. Sheriff Bell steps over it, advancing slowly. The\r\n          room is dimly lit shapes.\r\n          There is a bathroom door in the depth of the room. Sheriff\r\n          Bell advances toward it.

MOTEL BATHROOM\r\n\r\n          The bathroom, with no spill light from outside, is pitch\r\n          black.\r\n          Sheriff Bell reaches slowly up with one hand. He gropes at\r\n          the inside wall.\r\n          The light goes on: bright. White tile. Sheriff Bell squints.\r\n          A beat.\r\n          He takes a step in.\r\n          He looks at the small window.\r\n          He looks at the window's swivel-catch, locked.\r\n\r\n          INT. MAIN ROOM\r\n\r\n          Sheriff Bell emerges from the bathroom. He sits heavily onto\r\n          the bed.\r\n          He looks around, not for anything in particular. His look\r\n          catches on something low, just in front of him:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          A ventilation duct near the baseboard. Its opening is exposed;\r\n          its grille lies on the floor before it.\r\n\r\n                          106\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Sheriff Bell stares.\r\n          At length he leans forward.

Continuing in voice over:\r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           ...goin' through this pass in the\r\n           mountains. It was cold and snowin',\r\n           hard ridin'. Hard country. He rode\r\n           past me and kept on goin'. Never\r\n           said nothin' goin' by. He just rode\r\n           on past and he had his blanket wrapped\r\n           around him and his head down...\r\n          The rider passes as described, horses' hooves drumming and\r\n          scattering divots of earth and snow.\r\n\r\n                          117\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          VOICE OVER\r\n           ...and when he rode past I seen he\r\n           was carryin' fire in a horn the way\r\n           people used to do and I could see\r\n           the horn from the light inside of\r\n           it. About the color of the moon. And\r\n           in the dream I knew that he was goin'\r\n           on ahead and that he was fixin' to\r\n           make a fire somewhere out there in\r\n           all that dark and all that cold, and\r\n           I knew that whenever I got there he\r\n           would be there. Out there up ahead.\r\n          The rider recedes and the image fades, the horn bearing fire\r\n          going last.\r\n\r\n                          THE END\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nNo Country for Old Men\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Ethan Coen\u00a0\u00a0Joel Coen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:32:18.459070"}
