A HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving\r\n          a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.\r\n          A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,\r\n          then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:\r\n          until it reaches &pleated drape --\r\n          -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the\r\n          same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.\r\n\r\n          A PUPPY,\r\n          a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit\r\n          perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.\r\n          The dog looks over to...\r\n\r\n          A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL\r\n          standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark\r\n          haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the\r\n          verge of tears.\r\n\r\n          The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture\r\n          frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,\r\n          forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.\r\n\r\n          Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel\r\n          to the floor, extending around a modest living room.\r\n\r\n          Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,\r\n          haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.\r\n\r\n          The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as\r\n          the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a\r\n          little frightening.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n\r\n                         Mommy\r\n\r\n          BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip.\r\n          This is a very careful line.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Momma, come play with me.

RACHEL's tiny hand\r\n           deliberately presses a button on it.

THE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside,\r\n          as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it --\r\n          SLAMS by itself, right in his face.\r\n          FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down\r\n          a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.\r\n\r\n                         HER ROOM\r\n          She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To\r\n          her left...\r\n          A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave\r\n          moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a\r\n          DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into\r\n\r\n                         A CLOSET\r\n          where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms.\r\n          The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.\r\n\r\n                         FROM ABOVE\r\n          In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry\r\n          eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy.\r\n          There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          NT. A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN\r\n          RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a\r\n          far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white\r\n          Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken\r\n          wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her\r\n          shoulder blade.\r\n          Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND\r\n          encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it.\r\n          There's a knock on her bedroom door.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN (O.S.)\r\n          Rachel. c et up.

A POSTER\r\n          of Jim Morrison reads: \"No One Here Gets Out Alive.\"\r\n          RACHEL stands before her dresser mirror, in a ratty bathrobe,\r\n          putting on a small nose stud. She dons her daily armor --\r\n          -- Slipping on multiple earrings.\r\n          -- Applying Kohl around her eyes.\r\n          -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate\r\n          captioned \"Manson Sucks\".\r\n          -- Disheveling her long black hair.\r\n          Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open\r\n          ground floor window.\r\n          Sorry, Walt.\r\n          And gently lowers him outside.\r\n\r\n          EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING\r\n\r\n          It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is\r\n          run down and in the section of town where people have cars in\r\n          their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is\r\n          overgrown, there's broken glass on the street.\r\n\r\n          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house.

They hear a muffled, \"pmt\", from the VET in the\r\n          examining room.

RACHEL sits up, bracing\r\n          herself for the bad news. JESSE puts an arm around her seat\r\n          back, getting ready to hold her.\r\n\r\n                         VET\r\n          Walter's banged up pretty bad, lost\r\n          quite a bit of blood, but he's gonna\r\n          make it.\r\n\r\n                         RACHEL\r\n          Can I see him?\r\n\r\n                         VET\r\n          Come back tomorrow, any time after\r\n          eight.\r\n\r\n          EXT.
