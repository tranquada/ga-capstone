DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks\r\n          and a notebook. An all-night study session.\r\n          His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more\r\n          mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on\r\n          one side of his face.\r\n          Over the desk is a MIRROR and a \"Fighting Irish\" pennant.\r\n          The only light comes from his desk lamp.\r\n          He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock\r\n          glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JESSE\r\n</b>          (rubs his eyes)\r\n          Jesus.\r\n          WALTER, Rachel's dog, hops on his lap, licks at.his face.\r\n          The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him.\r\n          In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING\r\n          MIDNIGHT: One, two...\r\n          As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise:\r\n          Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in\r\n          front of him:\r\n          kINg of HELL\r\n          Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads:\r\n          Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again:\r\n          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL\r\n          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL\r\n          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL\r\n          JESSE lowers the dog\r\n          How did...\r\n          Trails off as he stares at the page.\r\n          The CLOCK BELL in the background is still CHIMING: give, six,\r\n          seven and...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          110.\r\n</b>          T h e F R E N C H DOORS fly o behind JESSE. ns.\r\n          It's the wind.

Relax, boy.\r\n          He takes a-deep breath, flips the page on the notebook,\r\n          resumes his cram session.\r\n          On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then\r\n          scurries under the bed.\r\n          JESSE is writing, in the MIRROR above h\r\n          A WOMAN' s FIGURE\r\n          anding in the French doors, her face hidden\r\n          up, sees the WOMAN reflected, spins to watch\r\n          her stop forward into the light.\r\n          It's RACHEL, in hAk slip dress.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JESSE\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         (STUNNED)\r\n</b>          Rachel?\r\n          RACHEL smiles.

Filled only with\r\n          his study notes.\r\n          The dog, WALTER, is awake on the bed, blinking, having been\r\n          stirred by the scream.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JOS\r\n</b>          He recovers, runs his hands through his hair.
