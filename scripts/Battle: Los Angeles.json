BACK YARD OF DIFFERENT HOUSE\r\n\r\n          Lenihan creeps around the garage, spies a SIDE DOOR leading\r\n          into it. He grabs the handle. Mercifully, the door opens.\r\n\r\n          INT. DARK GARAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Lenihan falls INTO THE DARK GARAGE. Boxes and old furniture.\r\n          Just one dirt-stained WINDOW on an opposite wall.\r\n          Lenihan crouches in the dim light, coughs, spitting up blood.\r\n          He turns on his radio, says into it:\r\n\r\n          PVT. LENIHAN\r\n          Motorola? You copy?\r\n          His RADIO buzzes back with Nantz' voice:\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)\r\n          Lenihan. This is Sgt. Nantz...\r\n\r\n          PVT.

I can see two\r\n          palm trees right next to it. House\r\n          is white with black shutters...\r\n          Just as something BANGS against the garage.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ (V.0.)\r\n          Is the house a two-story?\r\n          Lenihan stares, his eyes going wide, panicked.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ (V.O.)\r\n          Lenihan, is the house a...?\r\n          Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF.\r\n          Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His\r\n          breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear.\r\n          Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the\r\n          window, as if something just brushed past it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - SAME\r\n\r\n          Nantz, Mottola and Imlay moving through the thick smoke...\r\n          Nantz still trying to raise Lenihan on the radio.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          Lenihan...? Lenihan...?\r\n          Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears.

They remain stock still. Then...\r\n          The sound fades into the distance.\r\n          Nantz looks at the men. Motions. They creep forward as...\r\n\r\n          INT. GARAGE - SAME\r\n\r\n          Lenihan moves TO THE WINDOW, searching the garage floor,\r\n          desperate not to step on anything that would make noise. He\r\n          edges forward to peer through the dirty glass. Then...\r\n          THUD THUD THUD. More NOISES... On the garage roof now.\r\n          Lenihan looks up, panicked as...\r\n          CRASH! The WINDOW suddenly CRASHES IN.\r\n          Lenihan spins, FIRING wildly, lighting up the garage as...\r\n          He stumbles to the door, fumbling for the handle, falling...\r\n\r\n          EXT. BACK YARD OF HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          .OUT OF THE GARAGE. Lenihan staggers back, eyes darting\r\n          along the garage roof, gun aimed.\r\n          Nothing there.\r\n          As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the\r\n          drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that BEHIND him...\r\n\r\n          A SHADOWY ALIEN FORM IS RISING FROM THE POOL.\r\n          Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES...\r\n          A SPLASH as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE\r\n          POOL, disappearing under the water.\r\n          Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool.\r\n          He peers over the pool edge...\r\n          An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool.\r\n          Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises his rifle to\r\n          punch more rounds into the thing as...\r\n          WHOOOM! The creature launches OUT OF THE WATER!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          36.\r\n          BLISTERING GUNFIRE! As Nantz, Mottola and Imlay burst into\r\n          the yard. They fire, as does Lenihan.\r\n          The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up.\r\n          The marines STOP FIRING as the alien falls to the ground.\r\n          They stare amazed at the 7 ft. tall ALIEN CORPSE... Rigid\r\n          skeleton bursting out of its skin, some strange layer of\r\n          machinery intertwined with its flesh.\r\n\r\n          CPL. MOTTOLA\r\n          Oh my God... What the hell are\r\n          these things?\r\n\r\n          PVT.

Choking, he\r\n          CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless.\r\n          Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets.\r\n\r\n          LT. MARTINEZ\r\n          Move!

STREET - LATER\r\n\r\n          Nantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently\r\n          through the street, supporting their wounded. They take\r\n          cover behind cars, peering out to see...\r\n          The PARK in the distance. A wide open FIELD with a COMMUNITY\r\n          CENTER BUILDING on the far side.\r\n          There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems\r\n          strangely quiet.\r\n          Then, out of the smoke, an IMAGE APPEARS... Something MOVING\r\n\r\n          AT THEM...\r\n          The marines all shift, aim forward, about to blast away as...\r\n          FOUR MARINES come into view, moving ghost-like.\r\n          Nantz signals with his flashlight.

You're\r\n          bleeding.\r\n          Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on\r\n          his pants.

FREEWAY BY BUS\r\n\r\n          Nantz and Kerns fall back BEHIND THE BUS, next to Martinez,\r\n          Correggio and a 2nd squad marine.\r\n          Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the\r\n          only ones left holding the aliens off. All FIRE forward as...\r\n          More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the\r\n          flames... Into the line of fire...\r\n          Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers,\r\n          few start to make it through, FIRING BACK at the marines.\r\n          Martinez sees the 2nd SQUAD MARINE go down in front of him.\r\n          Martinez rushes to his side... HE'S DEAD.\r\n          Martinez rises to shoot and...THWUMMP. Martinez is hit.\r\n          He looks down, blood running over his belt. Shock on his\r\n          face. He's been shot in the stomach.\r\n          Martinez looks around...\r\n          The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them.\r\n          Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured\r\n          metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy.\r\n          Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz.\r\n\r\n          LT.

He reaches into his vest...\r\n          Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment\r\n          between them.\r\n          Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          We're pulling back.

HECTOR, in Harris' arms, head\r\n          swiveling, eyes searching for his dad, sees... Imlay and\r\n          Adukwu CARRYING rINCON, who appears lifeless.\r\n\r\n          INT.

As\r\n          he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING.\r\n          He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips.\r\n          Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling. Rincon\r\n          touches Hector's face lightly.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          It'll be okay.

But you have to. Now wait\r\n          with Michele a minute. Let me talk\r\n          to the sergeant.\r\n          Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          Mr. Rincon, we can take you and...\r\n          Rincon turns to Nantz, steel-eyed.\r\n\r\n          MR. RINCON\r\n          Don't waste time, sergeant.

NANTZ\r\n          We need to destroy it.\r\n\r\n          PVT. KERNS\r\n          But we got no jets left, right,\r\n          Sergeant?\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          Hopefully, they can still fire\r\n          cruise missiles from Pendleton or\r\n          Vandenburg... I'll radio in a\r\n          strike, paint the target from the\r\n          street. You know what that means.\r\n          The man nod solemnly.\r\n\r\n          PVT. IMLAY\r\n          We gotta hold 'em off long enough\r\n          to paint the target.\r\n\r\n          CPL. STAVROU\r\n          If we can get a transmission out\r\n          before the radio dies...\r\n\r\n          CPL. HARRIS\r\n          And the targeting laser lasts long\r\n          enough for command to get a lock on\r\n          the target.\r\n\r\n          CPL.

NANTZ\r\n          Let's do it.\r\n          He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS:\r\n\r\n          SGT.

They're building a\r\n          huge complex underground... I think\r\n          it's the head of the snake.\r\n          Repeat. I will be...\r\n\r\n          THE RADIO GOES DEAD.\r\n          Alien fire EXPLODES now, rocking the station.\r\n          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Nantz and the marines cover their heads\r\n          as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall.\r\n          The walls crack. Dust fills the air.\r\n          Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE.\r\n          Then, it's over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING in PAIN,\r\n          strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS.\r\n          The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet.\r\n          He slings his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his\r\n          bad ankle to the stairs.\r\n          Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is\r\n          only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling.\r\n          The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          A chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance,\r\n          and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street.\r\n          The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as..,.\r\n          Nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble, DROPPING down,\r\n          flattening himself to the ground.\r\n          He sets the GLTD (LASER DESIGNATOR) up on top of the pile.\r\n          Nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser\r\n          designator.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n\r\n                         (TO HIMSELF)\r\n          Here we go...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          105.\r\n          Nantz switches on the TARGETING LASER.\r\n          A RED BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the designator to a fixed\r\n          point in the center of the street.\r\n          Nantz looks up to see...\r\n          The street fill with ALIEN SOLDIERS rushing out now.\r\n\r\n          PVT. IMLAY\r\n          Here they come!\r\n          The marines FORM A PERIMETER AROUND THE LASER, OPENING UP on\r\n          the aliens as...\r\n          The mass of aliens surges forward like a wave.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          Hold them back! We have to keep\r\n          the laser on target!\r\n          Nantz FIRES. An alien goes down. He picks another target\r\n          and FIRES. The alien staggers, keeps coming. Three more\r\n          rounds and the alien goes down.\r\n          But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in...\r\n\r\n          FOLLOWING THE BEAM OF THE LASER BACK TO NANTZ.\r\n          Nantz is picking his targets. AIMING, FIRING... Turning,\r\n          finding targets, reloading, the aliens getting closer...\r\n          Then his rifle runs dry.\r\n          NANTZ pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing\r\n          alien in its 'heart.' It drops.\r\n          Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien...\r\n          Then the next. The next. Then his sidearm is out of bullets\r\n          as... An EXPLOSION rips near Nantz.\r\n          Knocking the laser away.\r\n          Nantz struggles...TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as...\r\n\r\n          MORE ALIENS POUR INTO THE STREET.\r\n          The marines are pushed into a SMALL CIRCLE around the laser.\r\n          Fighting nearly back to back.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          106.\r\n          Kerns is HIT. He is thrown to the ground, but is back up,\r\n          arm bleeding, firing.\r\n          An alien RUSHES AT CORREGGIO who spins just in time, FIRING\r\n          repeatedly until the alien goes down.\r\n          Stavrou swings his rifle butt, SMASHING another alien. It\r\n          staggers back. Stavrou puts numerous rounds into it.\r\n          An alien reaches ADUKWU, knocking him to the ground, about to\r\n          blast him...\r\n          Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and\r\n          firing his rifle at the same time. The alien falls.\r\n          The marines are FIGHTING AS ONE.\r\n          All focused on SURROUNDING NANTZ. THEN THE LASER DIES.\r\n          Imlay notices the laser beam is gone.\r\n\r\n          PVT. IMLAY\r\n          Did we get a lock!?\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          I don't know!\r\n          Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...\r\n\r\n          A CRUISE MISSILE COMING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STREET!\r\n          Nantz looks up at his men, yelling:\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          INCOMING! Fall back! This way!\r\n          Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do,\r\n          trying to hold off the aliens.\r\n          Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is\r\n          there to help him up.\r\n\r\n          CPL. CORREGGIO\r\n          Think you just twisted your ankle,.\r\n          sir.\r\n          And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n          Don't stop!! We're too close to\r\n          the impact point!!\r\n          The marines start running as...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          107.\r\n\r\n          MORE CRUISE MISSILES APPEAR, RIPPING TOWARD THE GROUND...\r\n          BOOOOOM! The first missile strikes!\r\n          Then another...and another ...BOOOOM! BOOOOM!\r\n          A piercing WHISTLE sounds. Nantz looks into the sky as...\r\n          Suddenly KABOOOM!!! A 2000 pound laser-guided ARTILLERY\r\n          SHELL explodes INTO THE GROUND...\r\n          THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of fire and smoke\r\n          erupting from beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n          A SHOCK WAVE BURSTS OUT FROM THE IMPACT POINT.\r\n\r\n          THE MARINES ARE ENVELOPED... DISAPPEARING as...\r\n          Buildings shatter, cars are tossed, flames erupt.\r\n          Then SILENCE descends a moment. Only the crackle of flames,\r\n          falling glass. The dust and ash settles in a grey haze.\r\n          Nothing could have survived this. BEAT. Then...\r\n          A FIGURE RISES UP out of the grey destruction.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n\r\n          MARINES!\r\n          AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n\r\n          ON ME!\r\n          The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at its center.\r\n\r\n          SGT. NANTZ\r\n\r\n          FIRE!\r\n          They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING AS ONE.\r\n          The seven remaining marines POUR FIRE on the mass of aliens.\r\n          The Drone Ships fall from the sky, EXPLODING on the ground.\r\n          The aliens, in disarray, are mowed down. The rest FLEE.\r\n          And as the smoke drifts away, there is silence again.\r\n          Nantz looks up to see...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          108.\r\n          HIS MEN.
