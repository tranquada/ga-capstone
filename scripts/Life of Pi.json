Flamingoes\r\n    strut about in the aviary, their pink feathers reflected in\r\n    the water.\r\n\r\n    A sloth droops lazily from a tree branch, unfazed, while a\r\n    nearby hummingbird zips manically from flower to flower like\r\n    Tinkerbell...\r\n\r\n    ... the Pondicherry zoo is a children's paradise nestled in a\r\n    botanical garden.\r\n\r\n                        WRITER (V.O.)\r\n              You were raised in a zoo?\r\n\r\n\r\n3   EXT.

And\r\n                that begins with thinking\r\n                rationally.

When Thirsty got\r\n               too big, the hunter sold him to our\r\n               zoo - but the names got switched on\r\n               the paperwork. The hunter was\r\n               listed as Thirsty and tiger was\r\n               called Richard Parker. We laughed\r\n               about it and the name stuck.\r\n\r\n\r\n47   EXT.

It's for\r\n          you.\r\n\r\nPi holds the lamb through the bars, The tiger walks slowly\r\ndown the hallway, regarding Pi with a detached curiosity, as\r\nunthreatening in his manner as a large housecat. Pi begins\r\ntrembling from sheer excitement.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't hear the approach of uneven footsteps - Father\r\nappears, followed by Ravi. Just as Richard Parker approaches\r\nthe offering.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER\r\n          No!!!\r\n\r\nFather yanks Pi violently away from the cage, wrenching Pi's\r\nhand through the bars. Richard Parker, startled, raises his\r\nhead, hissing. He turns and bounds back out through the gate\r\nat the other end of the hallway, disappearing into the\r\nexhibit area. Father spins Pi around and shoves him against\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER (CONT'D)\r\n          What are you thinking?! Are you out\r\n          of your mind?

Everyone watches in silence, transfixed by the\r\n     intensity of the tiger. Pi watches the animal spirit glowing\r\n     up within Richard Parker's eyes as instinct takes over.\r\n\r\n     In a sudden, single burst, Richard Parker bolts the length of\r\n     the hallway, claws reaching out through the bars of the cage\r\n     toward the goat.\r\n\r\n     We don't see what happens next - but the family does.\r\n\r\n     ON THE CAGE: Only a few seconds have passed, but Richard\r\n     Parker has already turned to go back into his enclosure, the\r\n     lifeless goat in his mouth.

The world had lost\r\n               some of its enchantment. School was\r\n               a bore - nothing but facts,\r\n               fractions and French. Words and\r\n               patterns that went on and on. I\r\n               grew restless, searching for\r\n               something that would bring meaning\r\n               into my life. And then I met\r\n               Anandi...\r\n\r\n\r\n59   I/E.

He is drumming for a class of a dozen female students;\r\n     a DANCE MASTER (female) accompanies the beat vocally -\r\n     \"Tumtikita...\" etc. The dance master claps her hands,\r\n     interrupting to teach.\r\n\r\n                         DANCE MASTER\r\n               No. If you do not concentrate, you\r\n               cannot express your love of God\r\n               through dance.

Anandi, come\r\n               to the front; lead them.\r\n\r\n     Anandi obeys; Pi watches her, lost in admiration, until the\r\n     teacher taps a wood block to get his attention. The girls in\r\n     the class giggle - Pi blushes, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n60   I/E.

Gathering his courage, he peers out, searching for\r\n     Anandi. She is nowhere to be seen. He walks into an open area\r\n     of the market that surrounds a banyan tree.

Anandi stares at him, bewildered.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               In the dance, you went from Pataka,\r\n               which means the forest, and then\r\n               you did-then you did Samputa, which\r\n               means something that is hidden, and\r\n               after that you did this... and then\r\n               you did Chatura.\r\n\r\n     Pi demonstrates her dancing.

So...\r\n\r\n                         ADULT PI\r\n               Have I forgotten anything?\r\n\r\n                         WRITER\r\n               I think you've set the stage. So\r\n               far we have an Indian boy named\r\n               after a French swimming pool on a\r\n               Japanese ship full of animals\r\n               heading to Canada.\r\n\r\n                         ADULT PI\r\n               Yes. Now we have to send our boy\r\n               into the middle of the Pacific, and\r\n               -\r\n\r\n                         WRITER\r\n               And make me believe in God.\r\n\r\n                         ADULT PI\r\n               Yes. We'll get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n72   EXT. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE PACIFIC, 1977 - DUSK      72\r\n\r\n     Moving in on the Mariana Trench, an ominous gash of darkest\r\n     blue...\r\n                                                                31.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ADULT PI (V.O.)\r\n               It was four days out of Manila -\r\n               above the Mariana Trench, the\r\n               deepest spot on earth...\r\n\r\n     Zoom closer until the blue fills the screen...\r\n\r\n                          ADULT PI (V.O.)\r\n               Our ship, the Tsimtsum, pushed on,\r\n               bullishly indifferent to its\r\n               surroundings. It moved with the\r\n               slow, massive confidence of a\r\n               continent.\r\n\r\n                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n73   EXT. THE TSIMTSUM - NIGHT                                     73\r\n\r\n     Lightning and thunder. The freighter sailing in ominous\r\n     weather, the name Tsimtsum emblazoned on its hull. Choppy\r\n     seas, rains, a storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n74   INT. CARGO SHIP, THE FAMILY CABIN - NIGHT                     74\r\n\r\n     Darkness - the faint glow of a nightlight. Close on Pi's\r\n     sleeping face, the cabin swaying in the storm.\r\n\r\n     BANG. A loud, deep rumble breaks into his consciousness. The\r\n     ship shakes. Pi's eyes open. He looks around, listens.\r\n     Nothing. He leans over the side of his bunk and wakes Ravi.\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               Ravi? Did you hear that?\r\n                   (Pause)\r\n               Ravi?\r\n\r\n                         RAVI\r\n               ...

We'll get hit by\r\n               lightning.\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge\r\n               first.\r\n                                                               32.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RAVI\r\n               Don't tempt a storm, Pi.\r\n\r\n     On the other side of the narrow room, Mother shifts\r\n     uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with Father.\r\n\r\n\r\n75   INT. SHIP HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                               75\r\n\r\n     Pi heads upstairs to the deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n76   EXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS                             76\r\n\r\n     The deck of the ship is dark. Pi steps out into a bracing\r\n     rain and walks to the rail, wind whipping his hair. He\r\n     laughs, exhilarated, as rain splashes over his face. Throwing\r\n     arms wide, Pi dances in imitation of Anandi's dance, slipping\r\n     more than once on the rain-soaked deck, shouting in giddy\r\n     adolescent triumph.\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               More rain, lord of storms! Let it\r\n               rage!\r\n\r\n     He finishes, laughing as he falls against the railing. The\r\n     deck lights suddenly all come on at once; a warning alarm\r\n     sounds over the loudspeakers.\r\n\r\n     Pi slips to the front of the deck and stands up, watching in\r\n     horror as a wave washes over the bow, carrying several\r\n     sailors overboard. He pushes himself away from the railing\r\n     and runs back down below.\r\n\r\n\r\n     INT. THE STAIRS TO THE CABINS/LOWER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n     Pi stumbles down the tilted staircase.\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT!\r\n\r\n     Halfway down, Pi hits water. He dives, searching for his\r\n     family. The hall lights flicker - the passage falls dark an\r\n     instant before the emergency lights come on in the water\r\n     below, which nearly reaches the ceiling. Pi dives, trying to\r\n     swim against the flowing current; he's astonished to find a\r\n     ZEBRA swimming toward him, passing overhead. He tries to swim\r\n     further, but the enormous force of rushing water and air is\r\n     too great; he scrambles backward, groping toward the\r\n     stairwell.\r\n                                                        33.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. THE CARGO DECK - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nPi bursts on deck, coughing and gagging for air.\r\n\r\n                    PI\r\n          HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!\r\n\r\nPi sees movement - animals running. He scrambles toward them,\r\nthe ship groaning as it lists sideways.\r\n\r\nOxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck,\r\nbacklit by emergency lights; Pi hears monkeys screeching, the\r\nclatter of hoofs pounding. In the distance, Sailors shout\r\norders in panicked voices.\r\n\r\nPi comes onto the lower deck, where he sees three men - the\r\nBuddhist (Taiwanese Sailor) from the dining hall; the\r\nJAPANESE CAPTAIN, and SAILOR #1 - arguing with the French\r\ncook, who has climbed into the stern of one of the lifeboats\r\nthat hangs off the side of the ship. Pi runs to the Captain.\r\n\r\n                    PI (CONT'D)\r\n          Please save my family!\r\n\r\n                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN\r\n          Don't scare. Okay? Wait stay here.\r\n\r\nHe grabs a life vest and starts to put it on Pi.\r\n\r\n                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN (CONT'D)\r\n          Here, put this on!\r\n\r\n                    PI\r\n          You have to help them, please! Oh\r\n          no my family, please. You have to\r\n          help them, my family is back there.\r\n\r\n                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN\r\n          We don't have time.\r\n\r\nThe Taiwanese Sailor jumps onto the ship.\r\n\r\n                    TAIWANESE SAILOR\r\n          We help. You must go.\r\n\r\n                    PI\r\n          Who let all the animals out?\r\n\r\nThey shove a life vest over Pi's head.\r\n\r\n                    SAILOR #1\r\n          You have to go now.\r\n                                                        34.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PI\r\n          No wait! My father - he can't swim -\r\n\r\n                    JAPANESE CAPTAIN\r\n          This is your last chance--just go!\r\n\r\n                       PI\r\n          No please!\r\n\r\nThey guide Pi to the side, where a section of the ship's\r\nrailing has been removed to give access to the lifeboat. They\r\npush Pi over the edge; Pi falls onto the lifeboat, bouncing\r\non the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across\r\nthe bow. He grabs at the rope holding the bow, trying not to\r\nslip off. The sailors are shouting at the French cook, who\r\nstands at the stern.\r\n\r\n                    SAILOR #1\r\n          Hey! You! What are you doing?!\r\n\r\n                    FRENCH COOK\r\n          Loosen the lines! Bring it down!\r\n\r\n                    SAILOR #1\r\n          Tie it down! Tie it down!\r\n\r\n                    FRENCH COOK\r\n              (to the sailors:)\r\n          Jump! Jump!\r\n\r\nThe sailors look towards the upper deck. Pi follows their\r\nlooks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over\r\nthe side of the ship, careening through the air toward the\r\nsafety of the lifeboat. The French cook staggers backward and\r\njumps out of the way, falling to the water below. Pi throws\r\nup his arms as the life boat starts to drop. The zebra arcs\r\nthrough the air, missing the tarp, landing on the exposed\r\nstern with a sickening thud, shattering the rear bench. The\r\nforce sends the rig lines spinning.\r\n\r\nThe lifeboat plummets to the water below. The impact spins it\r\naround, nearly washing Pi overboard. He is left clinging to\r\nthe back of the tarp, the zebra on the floor of the lifeboat\r\nbefore him. As the lifeboat drops down the side of the swell,\r\nPi slides to the front of the tarp. The Tsimtsum's propeller\r\nrises behind him.\r\n\r\nAs Pi steadies himself, a swell lifts the lifeboat, crashing\r\nit onto the deck of the Tsimtsum. It drops back into the sea,\r\nrolling over completely. The vessel instantly rights itself -\r\nthe lifeboat is designed to be virtually unsinkable. Pi lands\r\non the lifeboat's floorboards, next to the zebra.\r\n                                                             35.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Pi sees the Tsimtsum at an angle, it's bow dipping below the\r\n     water. As he tries to get up, Pi notices the orange emergency\r\n     whistle that dangles from the vest. He grabs it and blows,\r\n     shouting between blasts.\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY, HELP ME!\r\n\r\n     The deck lights of the freighter glow with a cheery,\r\n     unnatural brilliance. By the light of the ship, Pi can just\r\n     make out a distant figure in the water.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               HEY! OVER HERE!\r\n\r\n     Pi spies a lifebuoy tied to a rope. He grabs it and heaves it\r\n     as far as he can across the water. OUT IN THE WATER, the\r\n     lifebuoy splashes a few yards away from the shadowy figure.\r\n\r\n     The moment Pi feels the tug on the line, he jumps into the\r\n     uncovered part of the boat, lies back and begins hauling the\r\n     rope in. Nearly finished, he lifts his head to peer over the\r\n     side and sees who he's rescued.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               Richard Parker?\r\n\r\n     A beat - and then Pi realizes what he's done. He scrambles\r\n     backward in horror, trying to throw the rope overboard.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               NO! GO AWAY!\r\n\r\n     Richard Parker paddles toward the boat. Pi grabs an oar,\r\n     wielding it against the approaching tiger. Richard Parker\r\n     tries to grab the oar. Pi yanks the oar away, falling onto\r\n     his back.\r\n\r\n     He listens as Richard Parker claws his way up the side of the\r\n     swaying boat, coughing and gagging water. Pi scrambles\r\n     backward, oar still in hand. He rises and jumps overboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n79   EXT. THE OCEAN - CONTINUOUS                                  79\r\n\r\n     Pi plunges into the roiling water. An enormous wave rolls\r\n     toward Pi - filling his lungs with air, Pi dives under, away\r\n     from the assault of the raging storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n80   EXT. BENEATH THE WATER - CONTINUOUS                          80\r\n\r\n     Silence as Pi hangs below the surface, arms wide, groping for\r\n     focus and calm.\r\n                                                              36.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Lightning casts a blazing white veil over the surface of the\r\n     water above him, backlighting fish and animals, waves frozen\r\n     in time like wrinkled bedsheets, their motionless texture\r\n     pocked and dimpled with raindrops. As the sky explodes in\r\n     white flashes, the scene is caught in surreal still shots.\r\n\r\n     A hippo swims past, it's heavy form moving gracefully.\r\n\r\n     Pi swims toward the camera - then freezes, reacting in horror\r\n     as...\r\n\r\n     A shark swoops past him and up toward the struggling animals\r\n     near the surface. Pi dives defensively - the camera follows.\r\n     Ahead, the Tsimtsum is visible, fifty feet beyond Pi, its\r\n     deck lights dipping below the surface, casting an eerie\r\n     underwater glow, bubbles flowing up to the surface; nearby,\r\n     Pi can make out the floating oar.\r\n\r\n\r\n81   EXT. THE OCEAN/THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS                       81\r\n\r\n     Pi bursts above water in total panic, throwing his arms\r\n     around the oar, coughing up sea water and bile. The lifebuoy\r\n     floats a dozen feet off; he swims toward it. He grabs the oar\r\n     moments before a huge wave sweeps him up and over the\r\n     lifeboat. He lands on the other side, the oar lost, and drags\r\n     himself onto the stern. He jumps over the kicking zebra and\r\n     scrambles onto the boat tarp.\r\n\r\n     An oar sticks out from under the boat cover, hanging out over\r\n     the front of the lifeboat. Pi climbs out on the oar, keeping\r\n     himself a safe distance from the tiger he assumes is beneath\r\n     the tarp. The air vibrates with a tremendous belching groan;\r\n     Pi looks over to the cargo ship, watching, astounded...\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               Amma! Appa! Ravi! I'm sorry! I'm\r\n               sorry...!\r\n\r\n     WIDE SHOT - from top, looking down into the water: the\r\n     Tsimtsum abruptly keels and sinks beneath the surface. Pi\r\n     watches in horror as the Tsimtsum plummets into the depths of\r\n     the Mariana Trench, it's deck lights gradually fading. Pi\r\n     bursts into tears as waves from the sinking vessel buffet his\r\n     lifeboat.\r\n\r\n     Pi weeps uncontrollably.\r\n\r\n\r\n     EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAWN\r\n\r\n     The storm has passed, but the skies are still heavy with\r\n     disgusting grey clouds. Pi has hung the lifebuoy on the oar\r\n     and now sits on it, slumped in exhaustion and shivering.\r\n                                                        37.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith what energy he still has, he weeps - his face is puffy\r\nand swollen from a night of tears.\r\n\r\nPi watches a shark fin knife through the waves. His feet have\r\nbeen trailing in the water; he quickly lifts them out. He\r\nraises his head, looking at his new surroundings - water and\r\nair, clouds and sky. Nothing on the horizon.\r\n\r\nPi creeps forward on the oar, pulling himself onto the\r\ngunnels - the side of the boat. No sign of Richard Parker.\r\n\r\nThe zebra comes into view in the stern of the lifeboat,\r\ninjured legs folded beneath it, staring indifferently into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n                                                  CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY\r\n\r\nPi stands a few feet away from the zebra, using an emergency\r\nbucket to bail water out of the bottom of the boat, exhausted\r\nfrom the effort. He pauses to catch his breath, then becomes\r\naware of a slight movement at one side of the tarp.\r\n\r\nA SPOTTED HYENA lurches furtively into view from beneath the\r\ntarp, then disappears again. Pi freezes, dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n                    PI\r\n          Hari?\r\n\r\nHari, the hyena, with a sloping, bear-like forehead and the\r\nnervous manner of a beaten dog, reappears. Pi instantly dives\r\nacross the tarp, scrambling for safety on the oar. The hyena\r\nstaggers and stumbles listlessly. Pi turns to face the\r\ncreature, struggling for calm.\r\n\r\n                    PI (CONT'D)\r\n          Looks as though your drugs haven't\r\n          worn off yet.\r\n\r\nThe screech of a terrified animal echoes across the water -\r\nthe hyena looks out to port, the hair rising on its back,\r\nthen staggers beneath the tarp.\r\n\r\nPi squints into the rising sun. An enormous bundle of bananas\r\nbobs into view. The bundle twists and rolls - and Orange\r\nJuice, the orangutan tries desperately to stay on top.\r\n\r\n                    PI (CONT'D)\r\n          Orange Juice!! This way!\r\n                                                             38.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Within moments, the bundle is within reach of the lifeboat;\r\n     Pi catches the oar handle in the netting that binds the\r\n     bananas together and pulls it against the side of the boat.\r\n     O.J. falls onboard in a stuporous fog.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               Welcome to Pi's ark!\r\n\r\n     The netting, wrapped around the handle of the oar, pulls\r\n     loose from the bananas, which tumble out of reach. As Pi\r\n     reels the netting in, O.J. moans in distress. Pi throws a\r\n     banana to O.J. but she is too sick to react.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n                   (A sudden realization)\r\n               Where is your boy, Orange Juice?\r\n                   (Pause)\r\n               I'll bet Mother and Father found\r\n               him. They'll all be here soon.\r\n\r\n     O.J. turns to look at Pi, a look of inconsolable sadness in\r\n     her eyes - as though she knows better what lies ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n84   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     84\r\n\r\n     High noon. Intolerable heat. Flies circle the zebra, landing\r\n     on Pi's face and arms. He's too exhausted to brush them away.\r\n     The only sound is the incessant lapping of water against the\r\n     hull. Pi stares out across the ocean - no rescue in sight. He\r\n     pushes himself upright, calling over the waves.\r\n\r\n                           PI\r\n               HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY?\r\n\r\n     Pi kneels and bangs his bailing bucket against the hull. The\r\n     hyena emergees, shaking its head violently in an attempt to\r\n     clear its thoughts. It screams in frustration and begins\r\n     yipping. Pi picks up the oar and pokes the hyena to fend it\r\n     off. He watches with increasing alarm as the hyena paces in\r\n     frantic circles - whatever tranquilizers this animal received\r\n     are wearing off. The boy wraps his grip around the paddle,\r\n     prepared to defend himself.\r\n\r\n     The hyena abruptly stops pacing, coughing and retching - then\r\n     lies down, shaking from emotional and physical distress. It\r\n     sets its head on the edge of the tarp, predator eyes fastened\r\n     on Pi.\r\n\r\n\r\n85   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DUSK                                    85\r\n\r\n     A boy, a hyena, a zebra and an orangutan silhouetted against\r\n     the last fading light of day.\r\n                                                             39.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Pi has hung the paddle and lifebuoy off the end of the boat\r\n     and perches on the bow. The hyena's eyes seem to glow in the\r\n     last light, fixed on Pi. Pi stares back.\r\n\r\n     Pi fights fatigue as waves splash interminably against the\r\n     hull. He winces at each creak of the lifeboat; his eyes glaze\r\n     over as he stares out at the endless, dusky seascape. Pi sees\r\n     movement in the shadows. The hyena attacks the zebra; the\r\n     zebra barks and squeals. O.J. reacts to the violence, crying\r\n     out.\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it!\r\n               Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n86   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAWN                                     86\r\n\r\n     Silence. Morning. Hazy. Pi slumps over the oar, eyes half\r\n     open, glazed. He has stayed up a second night for fear of\r\n     being attacked, and now he slowly nods sideways, giving in to\r\n     exhaustion despite himself, and tumbles into the water.\r\n\r\n     Pi gasps in shock as the water slaps him into full\r\n     consciousness. He climbs back onto the life ring - coughing,\r\n     tired, wet, sad and fearful.\r\n\r\n     The lifeboat rolls and growls beneath Pi's feet as he stares -\r\n     and then he notices O.J. The poor orang is sitting on a side\r\n     bench half-hidden by the tarp, and horribly seasick. Her\r\n     tongue lolls out of her mouth and she's visibly panting.\r\n\r\n                         PI\r\n               I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any\r\n               seasickness medicine for you -\r\n\r\n     And then it strikes him.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               Supplies! Ah, supplies!\r\n\r\n     Pi pulls up the edge of the tarp nearest the bow. A row of\r\n     benches with hinged lids curve around the bow. Pi opens the\r\n     rearmost bench and finds a \"LIFEBOAT MANUAL AND NAVIGATIONAL\r\n     GUIDE\" in a plastic bag along with a pencil lying on top of\r\n     bags of supplies. He pulls out the manual and flips through\r\n     it - an illustration shows that the boat is lined with\r\n     compartments. He opens the next bench - it's stuffed with\r\n     life jackets.\r\n\r\n     He tosses one of the life jackets to O.J., who has no idea\r\n     what to make of it. O.J. turns to watch him, utterly\r\n     bewildered.\r\n                                                              40.\r\n\r\n\r\n88   EXT. THE OCEAN, BEHIND THE LIFEBOAT/THE LIFEBOAT - DAY       88\r\n\r\n     An hour later. Pi finishes tying a knot in a piece of rope\r\n     that joins oars to the lifebuoy. Pull back to reveal that Pi\r\n     has built a makeshift raft, tying three oars into a triangle\r\n     around the lifebuoy and using the banana net to gather the\r\n     life vests into a bunch beneath.\r\n\r\n     Pi sits back, mopping his brow, then begins pushing and\r\n     dragging his raft over to the edge of the lifeboat to launch\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     The hyena comes out from under the tarp to see what all the\r\n     noise is. As it paces, it gets too close to O.J., who\r\n     suddenly comes to life, rising up to her full height, pulling\r\n     back her lips and roaring. The hair on the hyena's neck and\r\n     shoulders stands up - suddenly, it launches an attack. Pi\r\n     cries out, flinching - but O.J. uses one of her long arms to\r\n     thump the beast on top of the head.\r\n\r\n     Pi cheers the blow -\r\n\r\n                            PI\r\n               YES!\r\n\r\n     But the hyena gets up in an instant - it attacks again, this\r\n     time going for O.J.'s throat.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               NO!! NO!! NO!! NO!!\r\n\r\n     O.J. gets pulled down to the floor of the boat, the battle\r\n     continuing out of view. Pi searches through the piles of\r\n     rope, finding a knife. He rises and dashes forward.\r\n\r\n     Pi reaches the end of the tarp. The hyena retreats. O.J. lies\r\n     in the stern, dead.\r\n\r\n     Pi, enraged, confronts the hyena.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n               Come on! Come on!! COME ON...!!!\r\n\r\n     Pi feels the tarp move under his feet... suddenly, Richard\r\n     Parker launches like a blur from under the canvas, going\r\n     straight after the hyena. Pi falls backward on the tarp,\r\n     stunned.\r\n\r\n     As the tiger clamps his jaws around the hyena, finishing it\r\n     off, Pi leaps back to the bow, shoving his makeshift raft\r\n     into the water. The raft splashes in the water and the tiger\r\n     turns; Pi looks back and comes face-to-face with Richard\r\n     Parker.\r\n                                                                41.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The tiger stands with front feet on the crossbench, sniffing\r\n      the sea air, examining his surroundings for the first time,\r\n      agitated by this open air environment. As he turns to go back\r\n      under the tarp, his gaze falls on Pi. Richard Parker's ears\r\n      swivel, and his lip twitches, revealing a canine as long as a\r\n      finger.\r\n\r\n      Pi, terrified, grabs an oar and holds it out, trying to\r\n      prevent an attack. Unfortunately, he also blocks Richard\r\n      Parker's path back under the tarp. The tiger tries to go\r\n      around the oar, and when Pi blocks his way, the tiger swings\r\n      a paw, knocking the oar into the ocean with such force that\r\n      Pi is spun completely around with his back to the tiger. He\r\n      falls into a crouch, cowering, prepared to die.\r\n\r\n      Richard Parker's predator instinct takes over. He snarls and\r\n      pounces on the tarp, menacingly close to Pi - then hesitates,\r\n      unsettled by the softness of the tarp beneath his feet. The\r\n      tiger retreats, examining his surroundings.\r\n\r\n      Pi jumps toward the raft. He belly flops into the ocean and\r\n      rises in a panic, trying to scramble up onto the raft, only\r\n      to have it flip completely over his head.\r\n\r\n\r\nA88   EXT THE RAFT - DAY                                         A88\r\n\r\n      Grey, lifeless skies above the vastness of the ocean. Pi\r\n      shivers, his eyes glassy, his lips chapped and skin waxen\r\n      from hours of exposure. He tries various ways to re-shape the\r\n      raft.\r\n\r\n      A shark slips up alongside Pi and bumps him, sending Pi\r\n      scrambling back to the safety of the raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n91    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     91\r\n\r\n      Pi pulls the raft to the back of the lifeboat, tying the rope\r\n      line on one of the tarp hooks. Hands appear on the gunnels.\r\n      Pi lifts his head over the bow. The tiger is nowhere in\r\n      sight. Pi quietly climbs aboard. He tries in vain to control\r\n      his chattering teeth and shaking limbs as he opens the\r\n      starboard bow storage bench.\r\n\r\n      He sees a duffel bag, zips it open and rifles through the\r\n      contents. It contains an array of survival supplies - as he\r\n      lifts it out, his eye falls upon a stack of cans marked\r\n      \"Water.\" He pops a hole in a water can with the can opener\r\n      and drinks one, tilting his head back and closing his eyes in\r\n      ecstasy. He throws a few on the raft. He grabs a couple of\r\n      boxes marked \"Baked Wheat Biscuits.\" Pi tears open a box and\r\n      stuffs a biscuit into his mouth.\r\n                                                           42.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biscuits are so dry that he is barely able to chew them -\r\ncrumbs fall from his lips into the supply hatch.\r\n\r\nA rat skitters out from under the tarp, grabbing biscuit\r\ncrumbs, then retreating.\r\n\r\nA low growl. Richard Parker charges out from his den and\r\nbounds onto the tarp. Pi staggers in terror and falls\r\nhelplessly into the storage bench, with only his head poking\r\nout above the tarp.\r\n\r\nThe tiger steps toward Pi, then hesitates - again, the\r\nsoftness of the tarp unnerves him. He steps back off the tarp\r\nand paces the stern.\r\n\r\nPi creeps out of the storage bench - then watches in horror\r\nas Richard Parker swivels and charges him again, this time\r\nbeneath the tarp. The rat scurries back out of hiding and\r\nRichard Parker's head follows, looming up out from the gap\r\nbetween the tarp and the storage bench. Pi jumps onto the\r\ntarp, out of the tiger's reach.\r\n\r\nRichard Parker scrambles backward and reappears at the far\r\nend of the tarp, roaring, prepared to attack from above -\r\nthen halts, watching in astonishment as the rat hops around\r\nthe lifeboat, finally running up Pi's shirt and landing on\r\nPi's head.\r\n\r\nPi grabs the rat by the tail and throws it. The rat sails,\r\npaws and tail stretched wide, across the boat. Richard Parker\r\nopens his mouth and the rat flies in, its tail disappearing\r\nbetween the tiger's lips like a spaghetti noodle.\r\n\r\nAs Richard Parker enjoys his treat, Pi climbs backward over\r\nthe bow, unhooking the rope, grabbing the water cans and the\r\nbiscuits and slipping over the side, falling into the water.\r\n\r\nHe drops onto the raft and pushes himself back with his feet.\r\nThe raft floats back and hits the end of the ropeline with a\r\njerk. Pi remembers the rope and goes back to untie it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Richard Parker appears at the bow and lunges at him,\r\nalmost falling off the front of the lifeboat onto Pi. The\r\ntiger scrambles back onto the boat and off the tarp, while Pi\r\npaddles the raft away.\r\n\r\nWhen he is finally at a safe distance, fear and stress\r\noverwhelm Pi - he throws up what little food and water he has\r\ntaken.\r\n                                                             43.\r\n\r\n\r\n92   EXT. THE RAFT, BEHIND THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                  92\r\n\r\n     A full moon, backlit clouds rolling through the skies,\r\n     reflected in the water below. Pi floats behind the lifeboat,\r\n     weeping, surrounded by nothing but terror and the abyss. A\r\n     thick range of clouds moves in, threatening to cut off the\r\n     light from the moon and stars.\r\n\r\n     Pi watches Richard Parker on the lifeboat, a shadowy\r\n     silhouette on the bow ahead. The tiger takes the zebra\r\n     carcass under the tarp. The clouds blot out the sky. Darkness\r\n     envelops them.\r\n\r\n\r\n93   EXT. ABOVE THE RAFT - EARLY MORNING                         93\r\n\r\n     Angle on Pi, the raft and boat from above, lost on an endless\r\n     ocean, the bright colors of morning light dancing on the\r\n     surface of the water.\r\n\r\n     Pi has taken out his pencil and now writes on the back page\r\n     of his survival manual, his voice heard over:\r\n\r\n                         PI (WRITING V.O.)\r\n               \"My name is Pi Patel.

Please send\r\n               help.\"\r\n\r\n     He tears the page out and stuffs it into an empty water can,\r\n     sealing the opening with a plastic lid. He tosses it as far\r\n     as possible; the can splashes down, rippling the water, then\r\n     bobs, going nowhere. Pi stares at the bobbing can, crushed as\r\n     he sees the futility of this plan.\r\n\r\n     A defeated pause, and then Pi looks up and sees the majesty\r\n     of his surroundings. The cloud cover breaks; dawn light glows\r\n     down on Pi.\r\n\r\n     A grunt from the lifeboat. Pi turns, surprised. He grabs the\r\n     tow line and reels into the lifeboat.\r\n\r\n     He lifts the tarp; Richard Parker's eyes glow out at him from\r\n     the shadows, greeting Pi with a low snarl. Pi gingerly lowers\r\n     the tarp and casts the raft back from the bow. He looks up.\r\n\r\n                         PI (CONT'D)\r\n                   (In awe, shuddering:)\r\n               God...

Pi lifts the whistle to\r\n      his mouth and blows it repeatedly as he advances to the front\r\n      edge of the tarp, opens his fly and pisses in a straight line\r\n      across the midpoint of the boat.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                    (Pointing:)\r\n                MINE!

Richard Parker staggers to the edge of the\r\n      tarp. He takes a deep sniff and winces, groaning, his tongue\r\n      hanging out in distaste. The tiger turns away from Pi, facing\r\n      the stern. Pi thinks the battle is won - until the tiger\r\n      lifts his tail and sprays him with a tremendous burst of\r\n      urine.\r\n\r\n                          PI (READING V.O.)

Pi bends down to suck fresh\r\n      water from the straw that protrudes from a water still,\r\n      delighted to discover that it works.

He tosses the hook and biscuit onto the\r\n      water - the hook sinks, leaving the crumble of biscuit\r\n      floating uselessly on the surface.

THE LIFEBOAT/THE RAFT - DUSK\r\n\r\n      Pi still fishes with no success. Richard Parker stares in the\r\n      water at the dorado. He leans over the side of the boat,\r\n      pawing hungrily at the surface as fish streak past - but the\r\n      fish elude him. Richard Parker leans out further, striking\r\n      with both paws - and finally jumps in altogether.\r\n\r\n      Richard Parker strikes and splashes as fish streak past. Pi\r\n      grins at the tiger's predicament - but the moment Richard\r\n      Parker realizes he can't climb back aboard, he begins\r\n      swimming toward the raft. Pi snaps to, recognizing the danger\r\n      he's in. He reels the raft over to the lifeboat, practically\r\n      leaping onto the bow.\r\n\r\n      As he hauls the raft aboard, Richard Parker manages to catch\r\n      the netting on the raft with one paw. Pi leans back against\r\n      an oar with all his weight, trying to lever the raft aboard;\r\n      the weight of the tiger tips the entire bow lower in the\r\n      water. Pi is about to lose the struggle when the tiger's claw\r\n      rips through the netting, and the lifeboat springs back up in\r\n      the water; the momentum flips the raft up onto the boat.\r\n\r\n      Pi turns, watching as Richard Parker swims up behind him\r\n      alongside the bow. He digs into the supply box and rises with\r\n      a hatchet in his hand, crossing to stand over the tiger and\r\n      blowing the whistle threateningly.\r\n\r\n      Standoff. Pi pumps the axe a few times, but cannot bring\r\n      himself to kill the tiger. Richard Parker stares up at Pi a\r\n      long moment, then paddles to the stern, trying once again to\r\n      pull himself aboard at the other end of the boat.\r\n\r\n                          PI\r\n                What am I doing?\r\n\r\n      Pi kicks at the side of the boat in frustration, and is\r\n      surprised to hear a metal clunk. He finds a rectangular\r\n      aluminum air box used for bouyancy: Pi then pulls the tarp\r\n      back fully for the first time and examines the contents\r\n      below.\r\n                                                                  49.\r\n\r\n\r\n       As he removes one of the floorboard panels, imagining new\r\n       uses for the wooden slats, he hears Richard Parker scratching\r\n       at the hull of the boat.\r\n\r\n                           PI (CONT'D)\r\n                 Wait - I'm thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n107    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT                                   107\r\n\r\n       Pi has tied a bunch of the flotation boxes to his raft and\r\n       loaded it with all the provisions from the lifeboat. He\r\n       points a flashlight beam over the side at the exhausted\r\n       Richard Parker, the tiger's face and whiskers just above the\r\n       surface of the water, scratching at the side of the boat.\r\n\r\n       Pi backs to the other end of the boat, pushing his raft into\r\n       the water with one hand as he rocks the boat to help Richard\r\n       Parker climb in. The moment the tiger is aboard, Pi climbs\r\n       onto the raft and pushes off, retreating to safety, blowing\r\n       the whistle to remind Richard Parker who's in command.\r\n\r\n       As he floats away, Pi collapses, exhausted, on the raft.\r\n\r\n\r\nA107   EXT.

THE RAFT - DAY                                        B107\r\n\r\n       Pi removes all of the lifejackets from under the life ring,\r\n       stacking them onto his latest raft structure. The empty\r\n       banana netting now drapes beneath the raft; Pi notices that\r\n       dorado are attracted to the net and gets an idea.\r\n\r\n       One of the dorados gets very close to the net - Pi realizes\r\n       his opportunity. He hauls in the netting and wrestles the\r\n       dorado onto the raft, flailing against the creature's\r\n       strength and throwing his full weight onto the creature to\r\n       keep it from sliding back into the ocean, riding it like a\r\n       bucking bronco. Pi grabs a hatchet from the raft and strikes\r\n       the fish over and over again. As the fish begins to die, it\r\n       flashes all kinds of colors in rapid succession - blue,\r\n       green, red, gold and violet flicker and shimmer neon-like on\r\n       its surface. Pi starts back, watching this colorful display\r\n       in terrified wonder. Finally, the fish ebbs to grey,\r\n       lifeless.\r\n                                                               50.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PI\r\n                 I'm sorry.     I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n       Pi is devastated. He weeps, bringing his hands together,\r\n       pressing them against his forehead, murmuring a prayer to\r\n       himself and bowing over the dead fish in abject grief.\r\n\r\n                           PI (CONT'D)\r\n                 Thank you, Lord Vishnu.

THE RAFT/THE LIFEBOAT - A SHORT TIME LATER             108\r\n\r\n       Pi reels himself over to the lifeboat. He moves around to the\r\n       side of the boat, grabs the dorado by the tail and throws the\r\n       entire fish over the side and into the stern. It lands with a\r\n       thud, and from somewhere inside the boat, Richard Parker lets\r\n       out a grunt of surprise.\r\n\r\n       After a moment, Pi hears the wet mashing noises of the tiger\r\n       devouring the fish. As Pi pushes away from the lifeboat, he\r\n       puts the whistle in his mouth, blowing a few sharp blasts to\r\n       remind Richard Parker who's in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n112A   EXT. THE RAFT - NIGHT                                   112A\r\n\r\n       A full moon. All around the raft, the green surface of the\r\n       water glows with millions of flecks of glowing plankton - and\r\n       beneath the surface, fish swim past at multiple depths and in\r\n       multiple directions. Pi brushes his fingers over the surface\r\n       of the water. The surface ripples where he touched it, the\r\n       plankton glowing more brightly, the effect moving outward and\r\n       downward through the water, an ever-expanding ring.\r\n\r\n       Pi hears a faint, rapid succession of blows. He peers into\r\n       the encroaching darkness but can see nothing. Richard Parker\r\n       is nowhere to be seen. The blows stop and Pi returns his\r\n       attention to the light show below.\r\n\r\n       Pi senses movement deep within the water, a cone of rushing\r\n       energy pressing up toward the luminescent surface.\r\n\r\n       Suddenly, the glowing silhouette of a huge creature wrapped\r\n       in phosphorescent plankton - a HUMPBACK WHALE - streaks to\r\n       the surface nearby, its mouth gaping. Fifty feet in length,\r\n       it thrusts itself up into the air. Pi barely has time to\r\n       react, gripping the raft and holding on for his life as the\r\n       whale comes crashing back down into the water.\r\n                                                              51.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The animal slips back into the ocean, creating a wave that\r\n      sends the raft swirling across the water's surface,\r\n      submerging for a moment, then bouncing off the side of the\r\n      lifeboat.\r\n\r\n      Pi's neatly-stacked water cans and biscuits tumble over the\r\n      side of the raft and into the ocean.\r\n\r\n      The whale disappears into the night, leaving Pi open-mouthed\r\n      and shaken.\r\n\r\n                          PI (V.O.)\r\n                Of course, I brought all the\r\n                biscuits and water on the raft with\r\n                me to keep them safe. Idiot.\r\n\r\n\r\n116   EXT. THE RAFT/LIFEBOAT - LATE AFTERNOON                  116\r\n\r\n      A calm day; gentle waves. Afternoon, the sun beating down. Pi\r\n      wears his shirt wrapped around his head to hold off the heat.\r\n\r\n                          PI (V.O. - CONT'D)\r\n                Hunger can change everything you\r\n                ever thought you knew about\r\n                yourself.\r\n\r\n      Pi uses his knife to cut another scratch into the hull. There\r\n      are 38 scratches on the side of the lifeboat. He glances\r\n      down, staring longingly at the fish that swim just beneath\r\n      the raft, then looks across the lifeboat, where the gaff lies\r\n      hooked in the tarp close to the tiger's end of the boat.\r\n      Richard Parker is nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n      Pi reaches out with the boat hook to try to snag the gaff,\r\n      but it is hooked deeply into the tarp. He lays the boat hook\r\n      on the tarp and climbs aboard, crawling forward to free the\r\n      gaff. As he wiggles the hook free, Richard Parker's head pops\r\n      out from beneath the tarp only a few feet away.\r\n\r\n      Pi's winces, prepared for an attack. In an instant, he's\r\n      struck hard across the face - a stunning blow that sends him\r\n      backward onto the tarp.\r\n\r\n      Pause. Pi opens one eye. Richard Parker hasn't moved. Pi\r\n      looks down - a slender grey-blue fish with wings is flopping\r\n      about on the tarp. Pi has been hit by a flying fish.\r\n\r\n      Richard Parker has seen the flying fish as well. He rises to\r\n      his haunches. Pi grabs the flying fish and tosses it to\r\n      Richard Parker.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                Here, it's yours.\r\n                                                          52.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tiger stands, jaws opening in anticipation...\r\n\r\nAnd then the fish extends its wings, veering at the last\r\nsecond and dropping into the water. Richard Parker tries to\r\nbat the fish down, but it's too quick for him. The tiger\r\nturns back toward Pi with a questioning glare.\r\n\r\nThe air around the boat whirs   to life as they are struck from\r\nall directions by a school of   flying fish that descends upon\r\nthem like a swarm of locusts.   Some sail clear over the boat;\r\na number crash into the side.   Other, less fortunate fish land\r\nin the boat, where they start   a racket of flapping and\r\nflailing. Pi yelps in anguish   as he is struck repeatedly.\r\n\r\nThe school of fish is being pursued through the ocean by\r\ntuna. It is a feeding frenzy - the ocean boils with jumping\r\nfish and snapping jaws.\r\n\r\nRichard Parker becomes totally absorbed in the kill, leaping,\r\nblocking, and batting down as many of the fish as he can.\r\n\r\nA fat, three-foot long yellowfin tuna lands onboard, cracking\r\nhard against the center bench and falling, stunned and\r\ntwitching, into the boat.\r\n\r\nPi sees Richard Parker's head swivel in his direction. In a\r\nmoment of insanity brought on by hunger, Pi reaches back and\r\ngrabs the boat hook from the tarp, shoving it aggressively\r\ninto the tiger's face just as Richard Parker launches\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe boat hook catches Richard Parker square in the mouth; the\r\ntiger staggers back in shock and growls in outrage. Pi rises\r\nup to his full height, staring directly into the tiger's eyes\r\nand shouting in fury, his gaze wide, his posture defiant.\r\n\r\n                    PI (CONT'D)\r\n          MINE!!!! MINE!!! AHHH!!\r\n          AAAAHHHH!!!!\r\n\r\nBoy and tiger face off for several seconds, both panting,\r\nneither blinking nor showing fear, as the rain of fish\r\ngradually slows around them.\r\n\r\nRichard Parker turns his focus from Pi and takes in the\r\nsituation around him. Realizing that he stands up to his\r\nknees in a pile of flying fish, he turns his attention to a\r\nmore convenient meal.\r\n\r\nPi uses the gaff to snag the tuna, shoving it to the farthest\r\nedge of the bow. As he rises, late afternoon light casts\r\ngolden flames across the surface of the water, throwing Pi\r\ninto backlight.\r\n                                                               53.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Pi picks up the boat hook and turns to face Richard Parker.\r\n\r\n\r\n       EXT. THE RAFT - SUNSET\r\n\r\n       Pi takes a small piece of tuna and gingerly raises it to his\r\n       lips, tasting flesh for the first time. A pause as he savors\r\n       the taste, considering... and then hunger takes him over. He\r\n       grabs at the tuna, stuffing pieces into his mouth, devouring\r\n       it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA132   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                 A132\r\n\r\n       Pi uses a bandage from the first aid kit to wrap a cut on his\r\n       leg. As he works, he glances back toward the boat, deep in\r\n       contemplation.\r\n\r\n                           PI (V.O.)\r\n                 I can't risk my life every time I\r\n                 have to climb onto the boat for\r\n                 supplies. It's time to settle this.\r\n                 If we're going to live together, we\r\n                 have to learn to communicate.\r\n\r\n\r\nB132   EXT. THE RAFT - DAY                                     B132\r\n\r\n       Pi reaches into the stern, prying loose a seven-foot strip of\r\n       wooden molding that lines the front edge of the seats.\r\n\r\n                           PI (V.O.)\r\n                 Maybe Richard Parker cannot be\r\n                 tamed, but with God's will, he can\r\n                 be trained.\r\n\r\n       Pi works intently with his knife, whittling the strip of\r\n       molding into a long tapered wand with a handgrip on one end.\r\n\r\n\r\n133    EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                  133\r\n\r\n       Pi crosses the tarp, approaching Richard Parker with his new\r\n       training stick.\r\n\r\n       The tiger backs off as Pi approaches - curious and annoyed.\r\n       Pi uses the stick to probe into the tiger's territory,\r\n       testing his limits; Richard Parker gets angry, batting at the\r\n       stick. Pi looks away, tries again, then turns to face Richard\r\n       Parker, who growls, angry and begins batting at the stick.\r\n\r\n                             PI\r\n                 NO!\r\n                                                                 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Pi gives the tiger a stern glare. RP stops, stares back, then\r\n      backs off.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                Good.\r\n\r\n      Pi reaches into a pouch behind his back, taking out a piece\r\n      of fish. He places it on the end of the stick and reaches\r\n      out, offering it to Richard Parker, who sniffs the air.\r\n\r\n      Pi puts the fish on the bench. Richard Parker eats the fish,\r\n      then backs up, growing calmer.\r\n\r\n      Pi takes out another fish, reaches out to tap the bench, then\r\n      tosses the fish on the bench. Richard Parker takes the fish,\r\n      eats.\r\n\r\n      Pi tosses the next piece near the edge of the tarp and taps,\r\n      encouraging Richard Parker to follow his direction.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                Go Richard Parker. Go. Go on home;\r\n                I'll leave you alone. I'll respect\r\n                that. I promise. Go, c'mon.\r\n\r\n      Richard Parker stares at Pi. Pi raises his arms and yells,\r\n      chasing Richard Parker around the bench and under the tarp.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                Yes!\r\n\r\n      Pi sits, the battle over.\r\n\r\n\r\n137   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE RAFT - DAY                            137\r\n\r\n      The sun is high. Pi raises the adjustable canopy he has\r\n      rigged on his raft and sits beneath it. He feels the wind on\r\n      his face and watches Richard Parker lounge in the stern of\r\n      the lifeboat. Pi smiles, for a moment genuinely happy.\r\n\r\n      He uses his knife to carefully sharpen his pencil, then\r\n      begins writing in the margins of his survival manual, which\r\n      are covered with journal entries...\r\n\r\n      `LIFE IS GOOD' MONTAGE - Pi's raft has transformed again.\r\n      Fish strips dry on lines; he has fashioned new tools, rigged\r\n      an elaborate water collection system out of turtle shells,\r\n      and a collapsible shade umbrella.\r\n\r\n      - Pi trims his fingernails, a fish bone toothpick in his\r\n      mouth.\r\n                                                              55.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PI (WRITING - V.O.)\r\n                I never thought a small piece of\r\n                shade could bring me so much\r\n                happiness. That a pile of tools - a\r\n                bucket, a knife, a pencil- might\r\n                become my greatest treasures. Or\r\n                that knowing Richard Parker was\r\n                here might ever bring me peace. In\r\n                times like these, I remember that\r\n                he has as little experience of the\r\n                real world as I do. We were both\r\n                raised in a zoo by the same master.\r\n                Now we've been orphaned, left to\r\n                face our ultimate master together.\r\n                Without Richard Parker, I would\r\n                have died by now. My fear of him\r\n                keeps me alert. Tending to his\r\n                needs gives my life purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n138   EXT.

The freighter, now a\r\n      fleck on the horizon, hasn't seen them. Pi watches as the\r\n      dark form of the boat sinks from view.\r\n                                                                  56.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Pi fires one last time, staring up at the archways of smoke\r\n       and the darkening sky.

Pi lies curled on the tarp\r\n       in the bow; Richard Parker lies in the stern. Beneath the\r\n       boat, the ocean swirls with traffic, including an enormous\r\n       whale shark. It passes beneath the boat, the creature's form\r\n       blotting out the depths.\r\n\r\n\r\nA141   ONBOARD -                                                  A141\r\n\r\n\r\n       A series of shots to show that Pi has grown gaunt, his eyes\r\n       wild from exhaustion and endless solitude. The tarp has\r\n       faded; the paint on the boat has become sun-bleached and\r\n       weather- beaten. Pi's hair has grown long; his skin has\r\n       darkened from olive-caramel to cocoa.

Pi raises his head. Dark\r\n      thunderclouds rise up over the horizon blackening the\r\n      heavens. Another rumble of thunder, this one closer.\r\n\r\n                          PI\r\n                Storm! Storm, Richard Parker!\r\n\r\n\r\n149   EXT.

Pi begins quickly\r\n      stowing his gear in the storage bench, beneath the tarp.\r\n      Richard Parker flees to the safety of his den under the tarp.\r\n      As Pi stows gear, he remembers his manual and takes it out\r\n      from his waistband.\r\n                                                               58.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The storm front sweeps across the ocean in a squall line,\r\n      high winds and rain striking Pi and the lifeboat with\r\n      tremendous force. The manual slips from his hands and Pi is\r\n      knocked off his feet and into the water. He lifts his head\r\n      out of the water in time to watch the manual flying off into\r\n      the storm.\r\n\r\n                            PI\r\n                No!\r\n\r\n      The manual is gone.

LIFEBOAT - DAY                                         150\r\n\r\n      a stunning display of clouds and lightning fills the sky, as\r\n      Pi looks on in awe. The sky lights up, a vivid white splinter\r\n      of lightning crashing down from the sky, puncturing the water\r\n      near the lifeboat. The water is shot through with what looks\r\n      like the white roots of an enormous celestial tree; the clap\r\n      of thunder is tremendous.\r\n\r\n                          PI\r\n                Praise be to God, Lord of All\r\n                Worlds, the Compassionate, the\r\n                Merciful!\r\n\r\n      A wave washes Pi off of the tarp and onto the floor of the\r\n      boat. Pi climbs onto the bench. He looks up in wonder at the\r\n      sky, overwhelmed by the magnificence of the roiling clouds.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                It's beautiful...

You have to see\r\n                this!\r\n\r\n      Another angle: he begins unbuttoning the tarp, calling\r\n      excitedly to Richard Parker.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                Come out Richard Parker! Come see\r\n                the hand of God!\r\n\r\n      Pi continues to unfasten the tarp.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                Don't hide yourself! He's come to\r\n                us! It's a miracle!\r\n\r\n      A huge wave envelopes the lifeboat, submerging the craft\r\n      completely - and then the boat pops to the surface like a\r\n      cork. Pi resumes opening the tarp. He tears it aside,\r\n      exposing the terrified animal to the storm.\r\n                                                                 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                COME OUT AND SEE GOD RICHARD\r\n                PARKER!\r\n\r\n      The sky lights up all around them. The tiger begins roaring,\r\n      pawing at the air, eyes wide, crazed with fear. Pi turns to\r\n      face the storm.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                WHY ARE YOU SCARING HIM! I'VE LOST\r\n                MY FAMILY - I'VE LOST EVERYTHING! I\r\n                SURRENDER! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?\r\n\r\n      A wave washes Pi overboard, and the   raft comes crashing down\r\n      on top of the lifeboat, then slides   away. Pi climbs back on\r\n      board. He lies on the bench, coming   to his senses, realizing\r\n      the extent of the danger they face.   He sees Richard Parker\r\n      cowering miserably at the stern.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                I'm sorry Richard Parker!\r\n\r\n      Pi crawls to the bow in time to see the raft, no longer tied\r\n      to the lifeboat, drifting away. Pounded by rain and surf, he\r\n      works his way around the edge of the boat, re-hooking the\r\n      tarp to tarp hooks. With only four left unfastened along one\r\n      side, he pulls himself under the tarp.\r\n\r\n\r\n151   INT. THE LIFEBOAT, UNDER THE TARP - CONTINUOUS              151\r\n\r\n      Thunder, rain and surf hammer the tarp from above; Pi pulls\r\n      himself under the tarp. Richard Parker's grunts and labored\r\n      breathing can be heard, but man and beast are only fully\r\n      visible when lightning strikes, Pi trying to stay as far away\r\n      from the tiger as he can manage. Before long the boat is\r\n      tossing Pi and the tiger as though in a washing machine, the\r\n      two helplessly colliding with one another, Pi choking as\r\n      water splashes in.\r\n\r\n\r\n152   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     152\r\n\r\n      Pi wakes in the sloshing water under the tarp. Sunlight\r\n      filters in from above. The storm has passed. Richard Parker\r\n      lies listlessly in the side bench. Pi climbs out of the\r\n      waterlogged hull. A double rainbow pierces majestic clouds,\r\n      the sun breaking through.\r\n\r\n\r\n153   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - DAY                                     153\r\n\r\n      The gentle sound of water lapping at the side of the\r\n      lifeboat; the breeze rattling the tarp. Time has passed;\r\n                                                              60.\r\n\r\n\r\n      life on the boat has grown tougher for Pi, his supplies more\r\n      meager, since the raft was lost.\r\n\r\n      Pi lies in the bow, exhausted, delirious. He pulls himself\r\n      upright, takes a drink of water and looks around, confused.\r\n\r\n      Richard Parker lies in the stern of the boat, severely\r\n      emaciated, his coat dull, his eyes clouded. Shivering, Pi\r\n      uses the last of his strength to drag himself over to the\r\n      tiger. The animal's body is curled, his tail flat. Some of\r\n      his fur has fallen away from his shoulders and haunches. He's\r\n      a skeleton in an oversized bag of fur. Pi reaches out to\r\n      place a hand on the tiger. He gently touches him on one spot.\r\n\r\n                          PI\r\n                We're dying, Richard Parker. I'm\r\n                sorry.\r\n\r\n      Pi sits and places the tiger's head on his lap.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                Amma, Appa, Ravi - I'm happy I'm\r\n                going to see you soon.\r\n                    (Pause)\r\n                Can you feel the rain?\r\n\r\n      Richard Parker raises his head slightly; his tail twitches.\r\n\r\n                          PI (CONT'D)\r\n                God, thank you for giving me my\r\n                life. I'm ready now.\r\n\r\n\r\n158   EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE ISLAND - DAY                       158\r\n\r\n      Pi lies, unconscious, in the bow of the lifeboat. Waves lap\r\n      at the sides of the boat, which presses against the shore of\r\n      an island.\r\n\r\n      A gust of wind blows across Pi's face, tousling his hair. Pi\r\n      gradually opens his eyes. A beat. He tips his head back.\r\n\r\n      Pi's POV - above and behind him, the tops of trees.\r\n\r\n      Pi turns, looking at the island, amazed. The trees have a\r\n      pale bark with an amazing profusion of leaves, their color\r\n      burning with a neon-like intensity. There is no sand; instead\r\n      the ground is an intricate, tightly webbed mass of tube-\r\n      shaped seaweed, about two fingers in diameter.\r\n\r\n      Pi turns to look back to the stern; he calls under the tarp.\r\n\r\n                          PI\r\n                Richard Parker?\r\n                                                              61.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Pi rises, stepping out of the boat. The seaweed is rubbery -\r\n      uncertain ground. His legs are wobbly. He hooks the gaff on a\r\n      root and falls to the ground. Pi tears up a piece of the\r\n      seaweed and examines it. He takes an experimental bite. Soon\r\n      he's grabbing handfuls of the seaweed, eating as fast as he\r\n      can.\r\n\r\n      Pi climbs the ridge on unsteady legs. A forest comes into\r\n      view with nearly symmetrical ponds dotting the island here\r\n      and there, many of them reaching 40 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n      Half the island seems to be covered with meerkats - thousands\r\n      of them standing together in groups all over the island. The\r\n      moment the first of the meerkats notices Pi, it turns and\r\n      stands on its hind legs - and the others immediately follow\r\n      suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n      EXT. THE ISLAND - DAY\r\n\r\n      Pi walks slowly forward, taking in the meerkats and the\r\n      island. Gradually, the meerkats return to all fours - their\r\n      squeaking and barking noises coming and going in waves\r\n      throughout the herd. They pay him so little attention that Pi\r\n      has to shove them aside with his legs in order to walk.\r\n\r\n                          PI\r\n                Excuse me... Go on, move!\r\n\r\n      Pi walks beyond the throng of meerkats toward a pond, pausing\r\n      to examine the fish bones that litter the edge of one of the\r\n      ponds. The edge is steep; he gets too close, slips down the\r\n      side and into the water. Pi tastes the water. He begins a\r\n      gentle, blissful breaststroke across the pond.\r\n\r\n      Pi hears a commotion. He lifts himself up to peer over at the\r\n      meerkats. In the distance, Richard Parker blazes a trail\r\n      through the meerkats, catching, pinning and eating as many as\r\n      he can. Pi smiles, watching the tiger.\r\n\r\n                                                         LATER:\r\n\r\n\r\n164   EXT. THE TREE - SUNSET                                   164\r\n\r\n      Pi sits cradled in a nest of branches, rigging a hammock. As\r\n      the last rays of the sun disappear, he hears a commotion\r\n      below on the island and pushes aside branches to see better.\r\n      The meerkats are abandoning the ponds, scurrying up onto land\r\n      and running for the forest, their collective stampede noisier\r\n      than a herd of elephants. Richard Parker, in the meantime,\r\n      runs for the shoreline, scrambling down the ridge as fast as\r\n      possible and leaping into the lifeboat.\r\n                                                                 62.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The trunk beneath Pi is swarmed as meerkats settle upon all\r\n      the branches in the tree. Several invade Pi's hammock,\r\n      sitting on him, climbing over him, making themselves\r\n      comfortable at his expense.\r\n\r\n                          PI\r\n                Hey! Hey! Hey c'mon. Hey! Hey-get\r\n                away. This is my bed!\r\n\r\n      Pi shoves them off as best he can and settles in for the\r\n      night.\r\n\r\n\r\n165   EXT. UP IN THE TREE - NIGHT                                 165\r\n\r\n      Pi sleeps, nestled in the branches of the tree.\r\n\r\n      Meerkats snore - at least one of them in the branches beneath\r\n      Pi does. Pi wakes up, staring grumpily into the darkness at\r\n      the noisy offender.\r\n\r\n      He is amazed to discover that what he can see of the island\r\n      from his perch is bioluminescent. The leaves of the tree\r\n      around him and the seaweed below all glow in gentle greens,\r\n      while the ponds beneath seem to shimmer like liquid silver -\r\n      it is a scene at once beautiful and threatening.\r\n\r\n      Pi hears a burbling noise coming from the pond at the center\r\n      of the tree. He looks down; fish bubble to the surface. One\r\n      of the larger fish writhes in agony at the surface before\r\n      falling still along with the others.\r\n\r\n      Pi watches as the water below begins churning with the bodies\r\n      of the dead fish, the surface of the water aswirl with the\r\n      flash of fins - then gradually the fish begin to disappear,\r\n      as though slowly dissolving in the water. Pi stares at the\r\n      mysterious pool, then looks out over the island to where the\r\n      lifeboat is anchored along shore -\r\n\r\n      Richard Parker is visible, sitting in the boat, staring up at\r\n      the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n166   EXT.

From this distance, it looks - and sounds - as\r\n      though the island is gently expanding and contracting with\r\n      the tides... as though it is breathing.\r\n                                                                63.\r\n\r\n\r\n169   EXT. UP IN THE TREE - NIGHT                                169\r\n\r\n      Pi notices fruit growing on one of the branches above his\r\n      head. He looks around at the rest of the tree, but the fruit\r\n      only seems to grow along the one branch. Pi plucks one of the\r\n      fruits and examines it. Each stem that he pulls causes a leaf\r\n      to peel off. He reaches the center of the ball, peeling back\r\n      the last of the leaves, to reveal a tooth.\r\n\r\n                                                     FLASH FORWARD\r\n                                                               TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n170   INT.

During the day,\r\n                those pools held fresh water, but\r\n                at night, some chemical process\r\n                turned the water in those pools\r\n                into acid - acid that dissolved\r\n                those fish, that sent the meerkats\r\n                scurrying into the trees and\r\n                Richard Parker running to the boat.\r\n\r\n                          WRITER\r\n                But where did the tooth come from?\r\n\r\n                          ADULT PI\r\n                Years ago, some poor fellow just\r\n                like me must have found himself\r\n                stranded on that island....

To think - how\r\n                many hours spent with only meerkats\r\n                for company?

My strength was gone. I\r\n                was so weak. I was afraid that in\r\n                two feet of water, so close to\r\n                deliverance, I would drown. I\r\n                struggled to shore and fell upon\r\n                the sand. It was warm and soft,\r\n                like pressing my face against the\r\n                cheek of God.

After all we'd been\r\n          through, he didn't even look back.\r\n          But I have to believe that there\r\n          was more in his eyes than my own\r\n          reflection staring back at me.

The cook threw me\r\n                 a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard.\r\n                 Mother held onto some bananas and\r\n                 made it to the lifeboat. The cook,\r\n                 the cook was a disgusting man. He\r\n                 ate a rat. We had food enough for\r\n                 weeks, but he found the rat in the\r\n                 first few days - and he killed it,\r\n                 and dried it in the sun and ate it.\r\n                 He was such a brute, that man. But\r\n                 he was resourceful. It was his idea\r\n                 to build the raft to catch fish. We\r\n                 would have died in those first few\r\n                 days without him. The sailor was\r\n                 the same man who brought rice with\r\n                 gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't\r\n                 understand much of what he said,\r\n                 only that he was suffering. I can\r\n                 still hear him - the happy Buddhist\r\n                 who only ate rice with gravy. He\r\n                 had broken his leg horribly in the\r\n                 fall. We tried to set it as best we\r\n                 could, but the leg became infected\r\n                 and the cook told us we had to do\r\n                 something or he'd die. The cook\r\n                 said he'd do it, but mother and I\r\n                 had to hold the man down. And I\r\n                 believed him - we needed to do it.\r\n                           (MORE)\r\n                                       71.\r\n\r\n            YOUNG PI (CONT'D)\r\nSo...

He died. The morning after,\r\nthe cook caught his first dorado,\r\nand I didn't understand what he'd\r\ndone at first, but Mother did, and\r\nI'd never seen her so angry. 'Stop\r\nwhining and be happy,' he said. \"We\r\nneed more food or we'll die. That\r\nwas the whole point.' 'What was the\r\npoint?' Mother asked. \"You let that\r\npoor boy die in order to get bait?\r\nYou monster!' The cook got furious.\r\nHe started towards her with his\r\nfists raised, and Mother slapped\r\nhim hard, right across the face. I\r\nwas stunned. I thought he was going\r\nto kill her right then. But he\r\ndidn't. The cook didn't stop at\r\nbait either, no. The sailor, he\r\nwent the same way the rat went -\r\nthe cook was a resourceful man. It\r\nwas a week later that he... Because\r\nof me. Because I couldn't hold onto\r\na stupid turtle. It slipped out of\r\nmy hands and swam away and the cook\r\ncame up and punched me on the side\r\nof the head and my teeth clacked\r\nand I saw stars. I thought he was\r\ngoing to hit me again, but then\r\nMother started pounding on him with\r\nher fists and screaming, \"MONSTER!\r\nMONSTER!\" She yelled at me to go to\r\nthe raft - \"Nee poda!\" I thought\r\nshe was coming with me or I'd never\r\nhave... I don't know why I didn't\r\nmake her go first. I think about\r\nthat every day. I jumped over and\r\nturned back just as the knife came\r\nout. There wasn't anything I could\r\ndo; I couldn't look away... He\r\nthrew her body overboard. Then the\r\nsharks came. I saw what they... I\r\nsaw. The next day I killed him. He\r\ndidn't even fight back. He knew he\r\nhad gone too far, even by his\r\nstandards. He'd left the knife out\r\non the bench. And I did to him what\r\nhe did to the sailor.
