As we glide over a VAST\n\tDESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. \n\tCATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her\n\tmesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon.  A curious breeze\n\tblows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if\n\tthe wind itself were telling something to her...\n\n\tCatherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand.  She pulls the\n\treins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into\n\tnothingness.  She dismounts, affectionately scratches the\n\thorse's neck, and follows the LIGHT.  When she looks over her\n\tshoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. \n\tNot surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand\n\tsliding beneath her feet...\n\n\tShe finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed,\n\tgnarled limbs appear to form hands.  The light dances across\n\ther face.  She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source...\n\n\tA SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a\n\tlocket and chain.  It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy\n\tof seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes.  He sits\n\ton a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tThanks for the horse.\n\n\tHe's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine.\n\n\t\t\t\tEDWARD\n\t\tYou liked him?\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tHe's beautiful...\n\n\tEdward smiles, delighted he made her happy.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tBut I thought we were going sailing.\n\n\tThe boy frowns.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou promised.\n\n\tA devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. \n\tCatherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tWe can't fit into that!\n\n\tEdward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her,\n\tthen snaps the locket shut.  When her vision clears,\n\tCatherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes.  A craft\n\tweighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tThat'll do.\n\n\tShe walks toward it, but Edward doesn't follow.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(coaxing him)\n\t\tCome on, Mister E.\n\n\tShe extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tWhat now?\n\n\t\t\t\tEDWARD\n\t\t\t(nods at the ship)\n\t\t's broken.\n\n\tUndaunted, she... finds herself standing on the DECK.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\t\t(calling to him)\n\t\tWho says?\n\n\t\t\t\tEDWARD\n\t\tMocky-Lock.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tOh no...

LABORATORY - DAY\n\n\tWe are looking at a large SCREEN showing an electronically\n\tgenerated three-dimensional view of a human brain featuring\n\tcolor-coded neurological activity.  In a specific section of\n\tthe image, cells flash from yellow to red...\n\n\tPULL BACK TO REVEAL HENRY WEST surrounded by computers,\n\tmonitors, electronics, and keyboards.  DR. MIRIAM KENT stands\n\tbefore a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and\n\timages.  Both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip\n\tassemblers.  The impressive, weird computer system HUMS as it\n\tshifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors.  \n\n\tTHROUGH A LARGE WINDOW, we see into an ADJOINING ROOM within\n\twhich a HUMAN FIGURE hangs suspended in mid-air by a series\n\tof cables designed to simulate flotation.\n\n\tAT THE CONSOLE, Miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of\n\tthe touch-sensitive screen, changing the complex CHEMICAL\n\tSYMBOLS displayed there.\n\n\tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, a series of pharmaceuticals are\n\tinjected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve/arm of\n\tthe figure.  A featherweight cloth MASK electronically rises,\n\trevealing the sleeping face of Catherine.\n\n\tAT THE CONSOLE, Miriam hits a button and speaks into an\n\tintercom microphone.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tSing a song of sixpence...\n\n\tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, there is no reaction from Catherine.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (O.S.)

Miriam checks Monitors displaying\n\tCatherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a\n\troutine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the PRESSURIZED\n\tAIRTIGHT DOOR separating the two areas.\n\n\tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, lights come on and Miriam eases\n\tCatherine out of the apparatus.  She checks her pupil\n\tdilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes.  She pokes and prods\n\twith a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside\n\tobserver, but is nothing to them.  Getting to her feet, we\n\tsee that Catherine's BODYSUIT is made of an unusual dark\n\tfabric almost liquid in consistency.\n\n\tAT THE CONSOLE, Henry moves to another section and for the\n\tfirst time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. \n\tAnd the \"brain\" pictured here is smaller.  Younger...\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\t\"Mister E.\" is doing fine.\n\n\tREVEAL A SECOND FIGURE suspended from the ceiling in the\n\tPROCEDURE ROOM.  A SMALL BOY is lowered to the pedestal and\n\tas Miriam records data, Catherine removes the child's \"mask,\"\n\tdisplaying the haunted face of Edward.  Clearly, the boy is\n\tin some kind of catatonic state.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tDid we go sailing?\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tAlmost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\t\"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock\n\t\twants me where I am.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tMocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.\n\n\tHenry communicates with them via the intercom.\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tWhere did that come from again?\n\n\tCatherine looks annoyed - How could he forget?\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tA nursery rhyme.\n\n\tCatherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body\n\tinto a waiting wheelchair.  Miriam takes a penlight and\n\texamines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly\n\tbeautiful.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\t\t(thinking aloud)\n\t\tNursery rhymes, fairy tales, the\n\t\tbogeyman... All preparation for the\n\t\thorrors of the real world.\n\n\tMaking certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him\n\twith a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him\n\tinto the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam.  Henry types in\n\ta command and moves to join them.\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tAnybody hungry?  I'm hungry...\n\n\tA BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly\n\tfretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them\n\tin the corridor.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOOPERMAN\n\t\tEdward's parents are here.\n\n\tWe can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news.\n\n\tEXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY\n\n\tSituated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego,\n\tCalifornia, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini\n\tcompound.  A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A\n\tDIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES.\n\n\tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY\n\n\tAlthough this is a hospital room filled with medical\n\tequipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys,\n\tposters, photographs, and drawings to make it more \"homey.\" \n\t(Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world).  Every\n\tcomfort has been provided and no expense spared.\n\n\tHenry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual\n\tclothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitting\n\ton the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed\n\twoman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, but\n\tthe husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor\n\tof a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, but\n\twe sense a genuine love for his wife and child.  Ella smiles\n\tand caresses Edward's hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLA\n\t\tHe needs a haircut.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tI'll tell the nurse.\n\t\t\t(sensing something in Edward)\n\t\tGod, he loves when you visit.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLA\n\t\tMy husband wonders if that's true.\n\t\t\t(delivering bad news)\n\t\tHe wants to place Edward in a hospital.\n\n\tSeeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate\n\thimself from Miriam and Catherine...\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tThere are other applications for the\n\t\tscanner, Mr. Baines...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIEN\n\t\tI realize that, Henry...\n\t\t\t(to Miriam)\n\t\tAnd I know your work, Dr. Kent, is\n\t\tinvaluable to this company...\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tYou don't know about me, though, do you?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIEN\n\t\tCatherine, we've waited eighteen months\n\t\tfor signs of progress...\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tThere's been progress.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIEN\n\t\tYes, but there is no proof the procedure\n\t\tworks.  All I have is a belief that your\n\t\tinteraction with my son is not a\n\t\thallucination.\n\n\tCatherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the\n\tintensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must\n\tdefend herself.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\t\t(to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry)\n\t\tYou picked me, remember?  And I took the\n\t\tjob.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and\n\t\tI want to be part of it...\n\n\t\t\t\tCOOPERMAN\n\t\tNo one is doubting your ability.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tThen what is it?\n\n\tIntrospective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then:\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIEN\n\t\tI've invested millions of dollars in\n\t\tthis study... And I've convinced others\n\t\tto do the same.  I suppose I should feel\n\t\tresponsible to them, but I don't.  I\n\t\tcould care less if they see a profit. \n\t\tI'm responsible to my boy, that's all\n\t\tthat matters.\n\t\t\t(looks her in the eye)\n\t\tYou tell me... Am I doing the right\n\t\tthing?\n\n\tOFF CATHERINE'S FACE...\n\n\tINT. WHITE ROOM - DAY\n\n\tAt first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. \n\tIt's too bright, the space confining.  As our eyes adjust, we\n\tseem to be in a bathroom or shower stall.  We HEAR a WOMAN\n\tCRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY.  Dark circles\n\tbeneath eyes red and puffy from crying.  Hair wet and ratted. \n\tSweater and pants damp and stained.  Barefoot, she shivers\n\tfrom cold and fear...\n\n\tPULL BACK to show more of her surroundings.  The white-tiled\n\t10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push\n\tbutton SPIGOT for drinking water.  Two walls are SOLID, the\n\tother two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic.\n\n\tThe floor is littered with empty food wrappers - candy bars,\n\tjuice boxes.  In the center of the floor is a DRAIN and above\n\ther, on the ceiling, a FLUORESCENT LAMP, also encased in\n\tclear plastic.\n\n\tThere is no door.\n\n\tA mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING... Anne seems to know\n\twhat's coming.  She presses against the wall, removes her\n\tarms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and\n\traises the garment over her head, forming a tent.\n\n\tWATER ERUPTS from the shower head.  There is no steam, so\n\tthis water must be cold.  Shaking, Anne whispers a count to\n\therself - \"One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three...\" and\n\tso on.  The spray hits everything in the room - mirror,\n\ttoilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNE\n\t\tThirty.\n\n\tShe peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped,\n\tand that isn't what she expected.  We hear a soft SUCKING\n\tNOISE and a CLICK.  The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. \n\tAnne POUNDS her fist on the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNE (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(angry, scared)\n\t\tTHIRTY!\n\n\tA puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has\n\tsomehow been sealed shut.  Her panic intensifies as we hear\n\tanother CLICK and the water pressure increases.\n\n\tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY\n\n\tIn the darkened procedure room, Miriam finds Catherine\n\tstanding between the two suspension devices, alone.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tYou okay?\n\n\tCatherine turns, nods, and tries to smile.  Has she been\n\tcrying?  Miriam steps further into the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tHe hates me.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tLucien Baines?\n\n\tCatherine nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (CONT'D)\n\t\tI wouldn't say \"hates.\"  Dislikes,\n\t\tdistrusts, maybe.\n\n\tCatherine laughs.  Exactly what Miriam wanted.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (CONT'D)\n\t\tShe adores you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tShe thinks I can bring Edward back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tSomeday you can.  We all believe that...\n\n\tCatherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere,\n\tfocused on the two apparatuses.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tI want to try it.  Please.\n\n\tMiriam knows what this is about.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tWe've been over this a dozen times.  No.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tWhy not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What\n\t\tharm could it do?\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tI don't want to find out.\n\n\tEver the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously\n\texamining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in\n\ther fingertips.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tWhy is it taking so long for us to reach\n\t\thim?  Because we've been reactive,\n\t\tthat's why.  And we need to be active.\n\n\tMiriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\tMiriam...\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tShush.\n\n\tAs Miriam examines her, Catherine continues:\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tHe creates the obstacles, he decides\n\t\twhich games to play.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tI've heard this argument before.  It's\n\t\tnot happening.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\t\t(frustrated)\n\t\tIt could take years for me to get past\n\t\tthe barriers he's created.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tIf we reverse the feed and bring Edward\n\t\tinto your mind, it could be devastating\n\t\tfor him.

That one moment could erase all\n\t\tyou've accomplished.  And if that\n\t\thappened, the trust he has in you is\n\t\tgone.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\t\t(defeated)\n\t\tOkay, okay...\n\n\tMiriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tBesides, I don't know what it might do\n\t\tto you.  You're already exhausted.\n\t\t\t(concerned)\n\t\tHave you been sleeping?\n\n\tCatherine nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (CONT'D)\n\t\tI can prescribe something...\n\n\tCatherine shakes her head no.

CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY\n\n\tThe corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.  At\n\tthe NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a\n\tclosed-circuit monitor.  Further down the hall, Miriam and\n\tHenry exit.  Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a\n\tworn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room,\n\twatching him sleep.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tPleasant dreams, Mister E.\n\n\tEXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n\tA GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch\n\tof two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the\n\tspeed limit.  He signals and exits...\n\n\tEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY\n\n\tThe truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy, unpaved road. \n\tThe area is desolate, depressing, and deserted.  It feels\n\tlike no one's been anywhere near here for years.  The pick-up\n\tstops at a RUSTED GATE and the DRIVER, a tall, lean, sinewy\n\tfellow undoes a combination lock-and-chain.  We do not yet\n\tsee his face.\n\n\tEXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY\n\n\tThe truck parks inside a charred barn, now hidden from view,\n\tand the driver steps out, followed by his DOG.\n\n\tA magnificent WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD.  We notice a GLINT in\n\tits BLUE EYES - the animal's an albino.  The driver points\n\tand whistles.  Well-trained, the Shepard sprints to the gate\n\tand waits, keeping a watchful eye on the road.\n\n\tINT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY\n\n\tFrom the outside, a passerby would never know this sanctuary\n\texisted.  Within the foundation of a farm building never\n\tcompleted, we find a small room in the center of a much\n\tlarger space.  The cell.  We hear the WHIR of ELECTRONIC\n\tEQUIPMENT and notice VIDEO CAMERAS mounted on tripods pointed\n\tat the two-way glass.  We follow CABLES to a massive VIDEO\n\tRECORDER - the type used in surveillance, able to record for\n\tdays without maintenance, and an elaborate TIMING DEVICE\n\tconnected to a series of VALVES and SWITCHES.\n\n\tAs if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window\n\tand gently rests his palm on the glass.  ANNE MOVES!  Arms\n\tflailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.  The last\n\tspark of life... The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.\n\n\tAlmost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her. \n\tSuddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by\n\ttorturous pain.  He opens his mouth in a silent scream.\n\n\tAnd then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides.  Hidden in\n\tshadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self-control.  He\n\twaits, then moves back to the glass.  Anne's dead face floats\n\tpast him.  Almost angelic.  He watches her and leans his head\n\tagainst the window, closer.  And the driver catches his own\n\treflection in the mirror.\n\n\tMeet CARL STARGHER.\n\n\tEXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\tSmall and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away.\n\n\tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\tThe place is a mess.  Computer print-outs, dirty dishes,\n\tunopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs\n\tand floor.  On the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit\n\tnext to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult. \n\tTotems, figurines and artifacts (Central and South American\n\tin origin) adorn the walls and tables.\n\n\tAs Portishead plays on the stereo, we find Catherine\n\tsuffering from insomnia, wearing goofy-yet-hip eyeglasses,\n\tsweatpants and a UCSD T-shirt, sharing a late-night snack\n\twith her pet CAT.  She shuts the refrigerator door and we\n\tlinger on an odd POSTCARD taped to the surface.  A kitschy\n\tpostcard of a warrior/goddess.\n\n\tINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n\tWe MOVE out of shadow, toward a bright focused light,\n\tfollowing the albino German Shepherd - VALENTINE - as it\n\tenters a VAST SUBTERRANEAN ROOM.  Most of the walls have been\n\tknocked down, leaving only thick support posts.  Valentine\n\tfinds Stargher in a DUGOUT PIT - about five feet deeper than\n\tthe rest of the room - polishing a stainless steel table.  A\n\tbright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the\n\tchain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST.\n\n\tThe dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far\n\tcorner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a\n\tlong, deep cast iron TUB.  Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine\n\tobediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE.  Stargher gives him a\n\tchew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub.\n\n\tSoaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. \n\tThe interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and\n\tthe whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is\n\tfloating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are\n\ther eyes.  Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into\n\tsomething ghostly, they are unforgettable.\n\n\tAs the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne\n\tfrom the tub and carries her to the table.  He places her\n\tface up and dries her with a clean white towel.  He moves her\n\tlimbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then\n\tretreats into shadow.  In the harsh light, against the shiny\n\ttable, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and\n\twe almost expect her to move...\n\n\tWe HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the\n\tpool of light.  Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is\n\tlaced with some rough tatoos.  When he turns his back to us,\n\twe find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through\n\this flesh.  Two columns of four on either side of the spine,\n\trunning from shoulder blade to just below the waist.  What in\n\tGod's name are they for?\n\n\tStargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where\n\the keeps TELEVISION MONITORS and VCRs.  He inserts a\n\tvideocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tIn BLACK AND WHITE, we see Anne awaken in the cell.  Her\n\tfirst moments inside.  Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she\n\texamines her surroundings.\n\n\tStargher is mesmerized by her fear.  Fast-forwarding to her\n\tdeath, he presses a remote and we get SOUND.  Anne screaming,\n\tbegging for her life.  Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks\n\tit in like a symphony.  Valentine cowers in the back of his\n\tcage, hating this.\n\n\tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tLying on her bed (a waterbed), Catherine sleepily stares at\n\tthe ceiling, rolls onto her side, and feels herself drawn\n\tinto the comforter.  The folds of the fabric become ripples. \n\tRipples become dunes.\n\n\tEXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY\n\n\tAnd we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.\n\n\tWe fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she\n\tstruggles through waves of sand.  The tree trunk is up ahead\n\tand we glimpse someone hiding inside.\n\n\tCatherine reaches.  MOCKEY-LOCK ERUPTS FROM WITHIN THE TREE\n\tTRUNK!  SNARLING!  Catherine retreats, silently screaming.\n\n\tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN\n\n\tIN HER OWN BED, Catherine's eyes are open.  In sharp contrast\n\tto a typical reaction to a nightmare, she remains calm.  No\n\tsweaty face, no gasp, no reaction at all, really.  She might\n\tas well have been dreaming of puppy dogs.  Wide awake, her\n\teyes return their gaze to the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tGo.  To.  Sleep.\n\n\tINT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n\tCHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. \n\tAdmiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings\n\tin his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters,\n\ta series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous\n\tas the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground,\n\tpulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher\n\tgrimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the\n\thoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the\n\ttable until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's.\n\n\tIn the flickering weird light of the television screen,\n\tStargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of\n\tWilliam Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an\n\tinnocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself,\n\tchains clinking and swaying.\n\n\tEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY\n\n\tA railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek\n\tbed.  Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER,\n\tCRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI.  A SEDAN travels down a\n\tservice road and stops nearby.  TWO MEN exit, identify\n\tthemselves as FBI and move to the crime scene.\n\n\tSpecial Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself\n\ton professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. \n\tSpecial Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges,\n\tintrospective, and intense.  A loner who marches to the tune\n\tof a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with\n\tprobing eyes.  He moves slowly, observing the scene - the\n\tworld, for that matter - from a unique perspective.\n\n\tAs Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak\n\toblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the\n\tair, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY\n\t\tWho found her?\n\n\tCole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tSurveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six\n\t\tthis morning.\n\n\tNovak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by\n\twire.  Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI\n\tPATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE \"TEDDY\" LEE, a polite, dapper\n\tsouthern gentleman.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tThanks for waiting, Teddy.\n\n\tTeddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - \"My\n\tpleasure.\"  Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER\n\tand assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick\n\tclear plastic.  As the photographer reacts to a strong smell,\n\tTeddy comments.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEDDY LEE\n\t\tBleach.\n\n\tAs the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them.  Sadly,\n\tNovak recognizes the face.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tAnne Marie Vicksey.\n\n\tWe recognize her, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tShe the one from Santa Cruz?\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tJust graduated law school.  Single mom. \n\t\tHad a two-year-old daughter.\n\n\tHe and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither\n\tman surprised.  Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the\n\tkiller's tell-tale signs.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(instructing the photographer)\n\t\tThe semen on her legs and abdomen.\n\n\tFLASH! Photos are taken.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEDDY LEE\n\t\tSomeone looking after her little girl?\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tGrandparents.  Live over in Davis.\n\n\tNovak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying\n\tto imagine the horrors she beheld.  He moves to the creek and\n\tsees only a few inches of water.  His eyes move from the drop\n\tsite to the highway above.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEDDY LEE\n\t\tThe poor thing.\n\n\tFLASH!  We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the\n\tphotographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft\n\tshoulder.  Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene,\n\tsteps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the\n\tkiller's truck as it disappeared into the night.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tEXT. OFFICE PLAZA - DAY\n\n\t A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN, JULIA HICKSON, shares lunch with her\n\tfiancee, JOHN TRACY.  They talk, laugh and kiss, not a care\n\tin the world.\n\n\tINT. PICK-UP TRUCK - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY\n\n\tAs TALK RADIO plays, Carl Stargher watches them, specifically\n\tJulia, his eyes never off her for too long as his hands work\n\ton something banal but unseen.\n\n\t\t\t\tTALK RADIO HOST\n\t\t...complaining about government\n\t\tsubsidies for farmers...\n\n\tThe voice on the radio becomes DISTORTED as we hear it\n\tthrough Stargher's ears...\n\n\t\t\t\tTALK RADIO HOST (CONT'D)\n\t\t...but without subsidies, families will\n\t\tstarve, and I'm nodd\n\t\texagggeerrrrr....ayding.

Stargher looks down and we see what he's\n\tbeen working on - A TOY DOLL.  Female.  Stripped of its\n\tclothes, a single metal ring stuck through its plastic neck.\n\n\tINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\n\tHis lunch finished, Ramsey is on a cell-phone talking to his\n\twife.  Chain-drinking coffee, Novak scrutinizes photos of the\n\ttire tracks.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY\n\t\tWell, honey, what's worse?  Doing it\n\t\tyourself or asking your mother for help?\n\t\t\t(gets his answer)\n\t\tCan it wait 'til I get back/\n\t\t\t(listens, answers)\n\t\tI have no idea, Jeannie.\n\n\tNovak checks his watch and the street.  Clearly waiting for\n\tsomeone or something.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY (CONT'D)\n\t\tWell all right.  Good luck with the\n\t\tMonster.  I love you too.  Bye-bye.\n\n\tRamsey snaps shut the cell-phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY (CONT'D)\n\t\tWe call Jeannie's mother \"The Monster\"\n\t\tbecause, well... she just is.\n\n\tNovak is oblivious, pouring over tire-related info.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY (CONT'D)\n\t\tI know you could care less about my\n\t\tpersonal life, Peter, but I do\n\t\tappreciate the occasional, \"How's your\n\t\twife, Gordon?\"\n\n\tHe waits.  Novak obliges:\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tHow is she?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY\n\t\tPregnant.  Thanks for asking.\n\n\tNovak is distracted by Teddy Lee entering the diner.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tHere he is.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY\n\t\tDamn, man, I give up.  Your partner\n\t\ttells you his wife's gonna have a baby,\n\t\tand all you care about is a coroner's\n\t\treport!\n\n\tRamsey assesses the exhausted, lonely, intense man sitting\n\tacross from him.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMSEY (CONT'D)\n\t\tI feel for those girls too, Pete.  And\n\t\ttheir families.  But it's just a job. \n\t\tSomeday it'll be over.  And then what'll\n\t\tyou have?\n\n\tMuch to Novak's appreciation, Teddy Lee's arrival provides an\n\tescape from answering the question.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEDDY LEE\n\t\tHot off the presses.\n\n\tHe gives them copies of the AUTOPSY REPORT and FORENSIC\n\tANALYSIS of Anne Marie Vicksey.  The WAITRESS sees Teddy,\n\tapproaches, and offers a menu.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEDDY LEE (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(doesn't need it)\n\t\tChicken fried steak, mashed potatoes,\n\t\tgarden salad with Thousand Island\n\t\tdressing and an iced-tea.

PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n\tExiting an elevator, Julia heads for her little Toyota. \n\tSmart girl that she is, her eyes scan the area and her\n\tfingers hold a can of mace.\n\n\tINT.

She brakes, puts the car in park, and\n\tchecks her sideview mirror.\n\n\tReflected there is a WOUNDED DOG.

One grabs her hair\n\tand the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. \n\tHe presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move.  After a\n\tbrief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her\n\tuntil she passes out.  Stargher pushes Julia into the\n\tpassenger seat and starts the car.  Pulls a dog treat from\n\this pocket and WHISTLES.  The Shepherd instantly perks up. \n\tPerfectly healthy.

RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY\n\n\tIn a BRIEFING ROOM we find Teddy Lee, Ramsey, Cole and local\n\tcops.  All in need of caffeine.  They complain, gossip, and\n\tshoot the shit.

STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY\n\n\tRamsey leads Novak into Stargher's \"workroom.\"  It's all\n\there, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach.  An odd,\n\tgrisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden\n\tstorage/shelf unit.  Novak's eyes are like a camera,\n\tdocumenting and storing as much information as possible, but\n\tit's overwhelming.\n\n\tHe moves through the basement.  Careful not to touch\n\tanything.  He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks\n\tsituated over the stainless steel table.  (NOTE: ON THE\n\tWINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING \"CARVER INDUSTRIAL\n\tEQUIPMENT\" with a logo).\n\n\tRamsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills\n\twith images of Anne dying in the cell.\n\n\tNovak is painfully, tragically drawn to this.  Although he's\n\tseen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed\n\tby the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly\n\tdying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia\n\tHickson unless he finds her.\n\n\tINT. THE CELL - NIGHT\n\n\tCLICK.  WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER.  Caught by surprise,\n\tJulia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut\n\toff valve.  Of course, there is none.  Thirty seconds later,\n\tthe water stops.  Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's\n\teyes dart around her \"cage.\"  What kind of hell is this? \n\tShivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply\n\tinto it.  Something's odd about the glass.  Is someone\n\twatching her?  She bangs on it with her fist.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIA\n\t\tHey!\n\n\tPOUND, POUND, POUND!\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIA (CONT'D)\n\t\tLET ME OUT!!!\n\n\tBut there's no response.  Only her reflection.\n\n\tINT.

As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO\n\tPOLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.  Novak, Ramsey\n\tand Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR.\n\tMILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an\n\topthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes.  He pulls away and checks\n\tthe ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox.\n\n\t\t\t\tREID\n\t\tMinimal activity in the dorsolateral\n\t\tprefrontal cortex.

It lay\n\t\tdormant.  In his case for about...\n\t\t\t(guesses at Stargher's age)\n\t\t...thirty years.  Most likely, he's\n\t\texhibited symptoms for awhile now, but\n\t\tthe infraction - the breach - didn't\n\t\toccur 'til today.  You never know when\n\t\tit'll happen, at what age, or why.  The\n\t\ttriggers vary, but the results don't.\n\t\t\t(fascinated by Stargher)\n\t\tHe has no ties to reality.  No awareness\n\t\tof this world or the people in it.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEDDY LEE\n\t\tWhat about Thorazine? Or... Desoxyn?\n\n\t\t\t\tREID\n\t\tThe normal psychotropics don't work. \n\t\tHe's not just catatonic, he's...\n\t\tdisappeared.

The mind is awfully gullible, so\n\t\tshe needs to monitor herself.\n\n\tCatherine and Stargher are suspended from the ceiling.  Henry\n\ttypes and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. \n\tVarious screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs\n\tof both \"feed\" and receive.\"  Miriam initiates the injection\n\tprogram.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (CONT'D)\n\t\tCatherine?  I'm about to start.  If you\n\t\twant me to wait, or...\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tNo.  No.\n\n\tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, we see chemicals mix with her blood,\n\tthen feed the IV.  AT THE CONSOLE, as Henry types furiously\n\tat the computer keyboard, Novak asks Miriam:\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tYou said she has a \"gift.\"\n\n\tOverhearing, Henry interrupts, pointing at a section of\n\tCatherine's \"mind map.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tNot a gift.

He knew she\n\t\tcared.\n\n\tA hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching\n\tCatherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's...\n\n\tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine takes a deep breath and as\n\tthe drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. \n\tShe glances at Stargher, a man who tortures and kills women,\n\tthen looks up as the CLOTH MASK descends from the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (O.S.)

(CONT'D)\n\t\tTransfer begins 1100 hours, 34 minutes,\n\t\t12 seconds.\n\n\tCatherine's eye focuses on the mask.  As it comes closer, we\n\tsee the lining is laced with thread-like wires and microchips\n\tforming hyper-miniature circuit boards.  Catherine's eye\n\tblinks.  The mask covers her face.  Catherine's eye shuts.\n\n\tVision fades.  Darkness.  A faint light.  Microscopic veins\n\tin the eyelid become wires connected to chips.  And we're\n\tMOVING, into the circuitry.\n\n\tENTRANCE ONE\n\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD\n\n\tThe pattern of the electronics grows into something more\n\torganic, textured, concrete.  Evolving into a world.  Black\n\tand shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of\n\tvertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its\n\tcore.\n\n\tOur journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we\n\toccasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism.\n\n\tINTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness\n\tand fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the\n\tapparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world.\n\n\tThere is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion\n\tand we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with\n\ttiny fish and tadpoles.  At water's edge, lying on rough,\n\tpebble-strewn ground, is a HAND.\n\n\tCatherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. \n\tFrom the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and\n\tfeatureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders\n\tinto a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a\n\tmoment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we\n\tfollow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes\n\tit from her own face.\n\n\tIN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET\n\tsails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED\n\tANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just\n\ta TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the\n\tearth, splatter against \"twig trees,\" and explode into pools\n\tof stagnant water...\n\n\tAs we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the\n\tworld into which Catherine descended.\n\n\tShe sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to\n\ther surroundings.  The \"floor\" is covered with filth, ash,\n\tpebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms,\n\tpuddles, moisture, dripping ceilings.\n\n\tEyes focusing, queasy, not fully \"awake,\" Catherine notices\n\tthe crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets\n\tshowering the air.  She turns and finds the source.\n\n\tTHE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full\n\tof BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his \"bath.\"  Satisfied,\n\tthe animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this\n\tnightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but\n\tthen realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks\n\taround, then through a crack in the \"floor,\" briefly catches\n\tsight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As\n\the disappears into corridor ending in \"nothing,\" we PULL BACK\n\tto show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace,\n\twalls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere.\n\n\tCatherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific \"room.\" \n\tShortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she\n\tmoves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of\n\tinterlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been\n\ttorn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or\n\tdoors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes\n\ther way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.\n\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM\n\n\tA mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the\n\tfloor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck.  This sweet\n\tanimal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and\n\tCatherine approaches with respect.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tHello?\n\n\tThe frightened child retreats into a corner of the\n\tclaustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. \n\tSurprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate\n\tstep toward Catherine, inviting her to take over.  Catherine\n\tallows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along\n\tthe mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tYeah, you like that, don't you?\n\n\tShe can see the boy hiding in the corner, stealing glances at\n\ther from the shadows.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tIs your name Carl?\n\n\tThe boy - YOUNG STARGHER - is startled and intrigued by the\n\tquestion - How did she know that?! - but says nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tAnother little boy I know, he has a\n\t\thorse, too.\n\n\tThe boy reacts to an unusual SOUND coming from the CEILING.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tHis name's Edward.  The boy, not the\n\t\thorse...\n\n\tThe boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but\n\the seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than\n\t\"connecting\" with Catherine.  Very anxiously, he looks at the\n\twall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen\n\tTIMER click down.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tWhat's the matter, Carl?\n\n\tAgain, a sharp SOUND from the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tWhat's wro---?\n\n\tYoung Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard!  Catherine\n\tFALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the\n\tceiling!  Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse\n\tinto four clean sections.  They separate and compact the\n\tquadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected\n\thorse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare\n\tbarely acknowledged what happened.  Betraying no emotion, the\n\tboy runs.  The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect\n\therself, then gives chase.\n\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE LABYRINTH\n\n\tYoung Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but\n\tCatherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight.  She\n\truns, climbs and crawls.  Until she's utterly lost and\n\tdisoriented.  Tired and having difficulty breathing, she\n\tdrops to her knees and \"cools down.\"  She hears a NOISE\n\tnearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM\n\tconnected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an\n\talmost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she\n\texamines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs\n\tof \"traps\" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls\n\tthe mechanism and quickly steps back.\n\n\tThe shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive\n\tin the tiny cubicle beyond.  She retreats into shadow,\n\thiding.  Released from the chamber is a WOMAN.  As she moves\n\tout of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE.\n\n\tGhostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to\n\t\"sense\" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the\n\tshadows, and ATTACKS!\n\n\tCatherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT\n\tTHE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! \n\tShe brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and\n\tSMACKS her head against it.  Catherine drops to the floor\n\tlike a rag doll.\n\n\tVictim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great\n\tpurpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the\n\tcore.  Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness\n\tand light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a \"tour\" of\n\tStargher's world.  Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled\n\twith IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing\n\tintensity.  At one of the rooms, we think we see Young\n\tStargher silently observing...\n\n\tSitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S\n\tOTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the\n\tgrotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in\n\tStargher's basement.  Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine\n\tInch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored\n\thousewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the\n\t\"harem.\"\n\t\n\t\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE CORE\n\n\tVICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job\n\tdone, crawls away.\n\n\tGroggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up.  Unbeknownst to her,\n\tshe is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the\n\tkind of THRONE.  And someone is there.  In the dim pool of\n\tlight above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. \n\tThe wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he\n\tdescends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL\n\tRINGS pierced through the flesh of his back.  In a fluid\n\tmotion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as\n\tthe man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. \n\tUnable to stop herself, she turns.  And sees the terrifying\n\tface of STARGHER.  But no the same Stargher.\n\n\tThis is STARGHER KING.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\t\t(primitive, guttural)\n\t\tWhere you come from priddy thing?\n\n\tIn a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand.\n\n\tINT.

For my stomach.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tAny psychiatric medication?\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tNo.  \n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tWhat about narcotics?\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tI know your partner's here, but it's\n\t\tvery important that you're honest.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tI am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tI doubt that.\n\n\tHenry checks the \"maps,\"  Catherine's vitals and reports.\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tWe should hurry.\n\n\tMiriam walks Novak through what's about to happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tThe first five minutes will be\n\t\tdisorienting.  Give yourself time.  Let\n\t\tthe drugs do the work.  If you can see,\n\t\tsmell, feel, hear, taste things - you're\n\t\ton the right track.  Once you've\n\t\tacclimated, try to get a feeling for\n\t\tCatherine.  Instinct plays a huge role\n\t\tin this.  Trust it.\n\n\tShe gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and\n\tshuts the door.  IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Miriam continues\n\tvia intercom.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou can control how you see yourself -\n\t\tclothes, shoes, that kind of thing - but\n\t\tthe rest of it is up to him.  Use only\n\t\twhat he provides.  Don't try to change\n\t\tanything.  Or introduce something of\n\t\tyour own.  It'll only upset him.\n\n\tIN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Novak flexes his fingers and sees the\n\tlittle bump beneath his flesh.\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY (O.S.)\n\t\tAgent Novak?  Press the sensor.\n\n\tNovak does and the red light comes on.  As Novak is LIFTED,\n\the looks at Catherine, then Stargher.  Valentine YIPS and\n\tsettles beneath Novak.  The suspension device clicks into\n\tplace and the MASK descends.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (O.S.)\n\t\tNo matter what happens, Peter, remember\n\t\tone thing: It's not real.\n\n\tNovak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like\n\tcylinder.  A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. \n\tPreparing the mixture for injection.\n\n\tThe viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA\n\tMOVES INTO THE MIXTURE.  As blood and chemical swirls take\n\tshape, we MOVE FAST.  Deeper into the fluid at a molecular\n\tlevel.  We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid\n\tlandscape.\n\n\tNOVAK HYPERVENTILATES.  He's having difficulty making the 98\n\ttransition.\n\n\tFlying faster, faster, faster.  Through an entire universe.\n\n\tNovak is in the procedure room.  Alone.  His face contorted\n\tas if feeling the effects of tremendous G-FORCE.\n\n\tENTRANCE THREE\n\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD\n\n\tCLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with\n\thills.  THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their\n\tbodies positioned in a uniform pattern.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\tNOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down\n\tin the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. \n\tWith difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak\n\tbreathes deeply and rises to his knees.  His hand moves to\n\this face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the\n\tgravel, the sharpness of it against his face.  Removing the\n\tshroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes\n\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER ONE (O.S.)\n\t\tHave you seen him?\n\n\tNovak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S\n\tMOTHER - addressing him.  She, like the other two, speaks in\n\ta ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER ONE (CONT'D)\n\t\tMy boy, my little one.  His father took\n\t\thim from me.  Have you seen him?\n\n\tAs she continues, almost mantra-like, WOMAN TWO BEGINS:\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER TWO\n\t\t\t(similar monotone)\n\t\tMy child is an abomination.  He is\n\t\tdamned.  He has no soul.\n\n\tThe women's repetitive \"monologues\" overlap.  Aurual layers\n\tnow added by THREE.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER THREE\n\t\tMe god me boy.  Me god good son.\n\n\tNovak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings.  The sights,\n\tsounds and feel of the place.  Like being within a dream.  As\n\the backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances\n\tacross his face.  Shading his eyes.  Novak searches for the\n\tsource.\n\n\tOpposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL.  A\n\tmassive cliff face pockmarked with rough \"windows.\"  Like a\n\tstar, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of\n\tMIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH\n\tcutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall.\n\n\tThe light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to\n\tCLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly\n\tinfinite passages.  Like tombs, or the \"drawers\" of a\n\tmausoleum.  Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. \n\tFades.  And Novak crawls into darkness.\n\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN\n\n\tNovak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. \n\tThe place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty.  As he moves\n\tdeeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched\n\tatop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror\n\tLOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of\n\tthe room\n\n\tThe FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the\n\tdarkness.  It is Catherine.  Altered to an image of\n\tStargher's victims.  Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just\n\tlike the Victims'.  It's a shocking, strange image, made even\n\tmore disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face.  Novak\n\tis staggered by the sight.  His vision and hearing become\n\taffected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to\n\tclarity as he reminds himself...\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tNot real...\n\n\tLike an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him,\n\tnarrowing her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\tCatherine.\n\n\tShe exhibits no recognition of her name.  Catherine\n\tseductively moves closer to Novak, their bodies almost\n\ttouching, her hands caressing his hair, lips, neck...\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\tJesus.  Catherine.  Listen to me...\n\n\tShe presses her finger to his lips and forces him down, onto\n\tthe floor, his back to the pedestal.  Catherine straddles\n\tNovak, and when he tries to stand, she holds him down,\n\tforcing him to stay.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\tLISTEN TO ME!\n\n\tShe steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a MALE\n\tFIGURE coming toward them, coming into the light.  Novak is\n\tutterly unaware of what's happening.  Catherine is keeping\n\thim occupied.  Waiting for the arrival of...\n\n\tSTARGHER KING\n\n\tCatherine LAUGHS.  Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of\n\tthe monster before Stargher King GRABS him by the throat and\n\tSMASHES his head against a pedestal.\n\n\tBLACKOUT.\n\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN\n\n\tEyelids rise and flutter.  Novak becomes conscious.  And\n\tinstantly realizes what's happened.\n\n\tHe lies on the pedestal, face up, spread-eagle, his wrists\n\tand ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery\n\tcords.  Standing over him, in a pool of light, is Stargher\n\tKing.  Wearing what could be seen as CEREMONIAL GARB, a\n\tsilent, solemn Stargher King prepares himself for execution\n\tof a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of\n\tshiny, sharp, macabre TOOLS.\n\n\tNovak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, Not real. \n\tHe opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on Catherine.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tYou're Catherine Young.  You majored in\n\t\tPsych at UC San Diego.  You work for\n\t\tSunerset Industries.\n\n\tStargher King's fingers pass over an array of horrific\n\tinstruments - the throat piercer/collar mechanism, a cleaver\n\tknife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle...\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\tYour grandmother raised you after your\n\t\tparents died in a car crash...\n\n\tStargher King lifts the blade-like NEEDLE.  So far, Catherine\n\tlooks at Novak like he's speaking gibberish.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\tWhen you were twenty-one, you were\n\t\tarrested for possession and got off with\n\t\tcommunity service.\n\n\tStargher King SLICES through Novak's clothes, exposing the\n\tflesh of his abdomen.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(reminding himself)\n\t\tNot real, Pete...This is not real...\n\t\t\t(urgency)\n\t\tYou had to work at a center for abused\n\t\tkids for three months.  You stayed on\n\t\ttwo years for no pay.  You give half\n\t\tyour fucking salary to the nursing home\n\t\tyour grandmother stays at...\n\n\tStargher King grabs his throat and traces the blade down the\n\tcenter of Novak's torso.  Novak struggles and pleads with\n\tCatherine.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\tI know this because I work for the FBI. \n\t\tPeter Novak, remember?!?!\n\t\t\t(a desperate request)\n\t\tRemember.  You are Cath-\n\n\tStargher King cuts his flesh and INSERTS the needle into his\n\tstomach.  NOVAK SCREAMS!  This fucking hurts!\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\tHelp me!!!\n\n\tStargher King wiggles the needle, pulls it out, and digs his\n\tfinger into the wound.  NOVAK CRIES IN PAIN.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(tears forming, horrified)\n\t\tFucking FEELS real!\n\n\tThe intensity of Novak's cries hit Catherine like a\n\tthunderbolt.  There's a glimmer of life, of recognition in\n\ther eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\t\t(finally speaking)\n\t\tMe god gut you like a dear.\n\n\tAlthough we don't see it, we HEAR something awful.  Like\n\tStargher King fishing around inside the wound.  A pale,\n\tsweating Novak tries to stay conscious.  He will not go into\n\tshock...\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tNot real.  Not real.  Not real.\n\n\tA FEMALE HAND grabs the tool from the tray.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\t\t(mimicking Novak, laughing)\n\t\tNod reel, nod reel, nod reel...\n\n\tSTARGHER KING IS SLAMMED FROM BEHIND!  CATHERINE RAMS THE\n\tTHING THROUGH HIS THROAT!   As Stargher King stumbles away\n\tgagging, blood pouring form his neck, we see that she has\n\treturned to normal.  The \"bride\" persona is gone.  As\n\tStargher King emits animalistic growls, Catherine turns and\n\tsees an intact Novak standing next to her.  As if nothing had\n\thappened.\n\n\tCatherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from\n\twhich Novak gained access.  He stops, ready to press the\n\tsensor, when a FLICKER OF LIGHT dances across Catherine's\n\tface.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tWait...\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tLike hell \"wait.\"\n\n\tBut she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she\n\tmoves further from the den toward the cliff face.  The\n\tFLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tHe wants us to follow.  The little\n\t\tboy...\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tLittle boy?!  That's him!\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tHe brought you to me, didn't he?  If you\n\t\twant Julia to live, trust me.  Trust\n\t\thim.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL/CUBBYHOLE\n\n\tOn her hands and knees, she enters the TUNNEL, not waiting\n\tfor him to respond.  She knows what he'll do... Catherine and\n\tNovak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space,\n\tplaying with his mirror locket.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tCarl...\n\n\tHe so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him\n\tfrom reaching out to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tThis is Peter.\n\n\tScared, he shakes his head \"no.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tDon't be scared.  You're my friend and I\n\t\twould never hurt you.\n\n\tShe extends her hand.  Oh-so-hesitantly he takes it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tWill you take us to her?  To Julia?\n\n\tShyly, hesitantly, he nods.  She smiles gratefully and\n\taffectionately touches the boy's face.  Clasping her hand,\n\tYoung Stargher leads Catherine and Novak into utter darkness.\n\n\tINT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE IDEALIZED CELL\n\n\tMore stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately\n\tdecorated, with the atmosphere of a church.  Individual\n\tIMAGES hang like SHRINES, each showing Julia Hickson from\n\tdifferent angles.\n\n\tCentral to the room is a WINDOW INTO THE CELL ITSELF.  Where\n\twe find a beautiful, mermaid-like JULIA HICKSON floating in\n\twater.  Peaceful, joyous.\n\n\tIN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, we find Novak and Catherine, she\n\tholding the hand of Young Stargher, he stunned at the sight\n\tof Julia.  The child looks at Catherine with beatific, sad\n\teyes, regarding her as one would a saviour.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tWhere the hell are we?\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tCarl, do you know?  Like on a map...\n\n\tHe shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tIt's okay, it's okay.  You helped so\n\t\tmuch already.  I'm proud of you.\n\n\tAs a frustrated Novak searches for anything identifying,\n\tCatherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad,\n\thaunted eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tCarl, I think I can help you.  Would you\n\t\tlike that?  Even if Peter can't find\n\t\tJulia, I want to help you.\n\n\tThe boy leans against her and she caresses his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tI promise.\n\n\tNovak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell. \n\tMounted beneath the glass is a shiny, perfect metal plaque\n\treading CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, with a logo.  Novak\n\trecognizes it from the hoist in Stargher's basement.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tLet's go.\n\n\tHe pulls her to her feet.  Feeling betrayed and rejected, the\n\tchild breaks away from her.  THE ROAR OF STARGHER KING shakes\n\tthe cell.  Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tCARL!\n\n\tNovak feels what's coming.\n\n\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n\t\tCOME ON!\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tI can't leave him!\n\n\tSTARGHER KING APPEARS!  His throat wounded, bloody mess, he\n\tdescends out of dark nothingness, HOWLING with rage.  He\n\treaches for Catherine, but Young Stargher runs in front of\n\ther.  \n\n\tSTARGHER KING CLAMPS HIS MASSIVE ARMS AROUND THE CHILD! \n\tLittle Carl opens his mouth in a silent scream... Catherine's\n\tarms reach out to him, but Novak clasps her hand and presses. \n\tAnd she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the\n\tarms of a monster...\n\n\tINT.

He gets to his feet, but soon falls to\n\this knees, dizzy and disoriented.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tDon't move!\n\n\tNovak is not listening.  Fighting off any after-effects- both\n\tphysical and mental - he moves for the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (CONT'D)\n\t\tAgent Novak!\n\n\tCatherine is coming back and Miriam moves to her.

CATHERINE'S WORLD\n\n\tA bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of\n\tthings we saw in Catherine's home.  Unusual trees, rock\n\tformations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER.\n\n\tThe pond ripples.  Visible through the crystal-clear water is\n\tYOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim\n\tsuddenly breaking through to air.  Panicked, he scrambles to\n\tshore and pulls himself to land.  Although the place is\n\tcomforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it\n\tfrightens him.  Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this\n\tway and that.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (O.S.)\n\t\tYou're all right, Carl.\n\n\tThe boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair\n\twaving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a\n\tmagnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior\n\tgoddess. \n\tShe opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the\n\tcomfort of her embrace.  He shivers and she holds him\n\ttightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tIt's okay, honey, you're with me now. \n\t\tYou're safe here.\n\n\tShe looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tI promised I would help you, and I\n\t\talways keep my promises.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER\n\t\tCan...\n\n\tCatherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak.  A\n\tsad, trembling little voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)\n\t\tCan I stay here?\n\n\tShe is touched that he would ask and strokes his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\t\t(regretfully)\n\t\tOh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't\n\t\twork that way.\n\n\tThe boy breaks away from her, turning his back.  She gently\n\ttakes his hand but he yanks it free.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tBut what if I told you you could come\n\t\tvisit?\n\n\tHe slowly turns to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tI'll make sure it happens, Carl.  I'll\n\t\tget them to let me do it.  And maybe...\n\t\tmaybe we can...\n\n\tYoung Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.  Over his\n\tshoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. \n\tCENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair.  She stands and\n\tbrushes them off.  The atmosphere grows darker and ominous.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER\n\t\tHe found me...\n\n\tCatherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like\n\ta human serpent.  The brilliant colors of Catherine's world\n\tfade to GRIM TONES.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)\n\t\tHe always finds me.\n\n\tStargher King SCREECHES with anger and confusion.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\tWhere thiisss att?!?!  Me god no like id\n\t\there...\n\n\tHe snarls when he sees Catherine.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou.  Priddy bish-hor-kund.  You big\n\t\ttrubble-mekker...\n\t\t\t(sneers at the boy)\n\t\tAnd you.  You cumm home now, liddle\n\t\tcogsugger worm.  Or me god haffa punish\n\t\tyou...\n\n\tYoung Stargher tightens his embrace of Catherine.  She steps\n\tback, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tNo.!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\tNo?!??!?!?!?\n\n\tStargher King laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)\n\t\tHoo you thing you are?? Himm Muther?\n\n\tHe comes close and reaches for the boy...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou gimme liddle worm.\n\n\tFor a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated. \n\tPerhaps near an emotional breakdown.  But that is not the\n\tcase.  She quietly lowers little Carl to the ground and\n\twhispers something in his ear.  As the boy nods, runs and\n\thides, a ferocity grows within her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tI said no.\n\n\tLike a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a\n\tBATTLE CRY!  STARGHER ATTACKS!  Arms reaching for her. \n\tCatherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS.  Stargher King doubles\n\tover.  Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her\n\tbent KNEE, breaking his nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tWelcome to my world.\n\n\tAs blood flows from his nostrils, Stargher King grins...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\tYou funny.  You thing you stop me god?\n\n\tHE CHARGES.  At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and\n\tSMASHES him in the ribs as he passes.  Stargher King crumples\n\tto the ground and she KICKS an uppercut to this chin.  Rising\n\tfrom the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a POWERFUL BLOW to\n\ther head, sending her flying.  He lifts the stunned Catherine\n\twith one hand and pulls her face to his...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou cum back wif me god.  You be good\n\t\tbish-hor-kund...\n\n\tCatherine looks into his soulless eyes.  Then SPITS in them\n\tand BITES his face!  She breaks free as he YOWLS with pain. \n\tHe steps toward her, but his feet don't move.  The earth\n\titself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like\n\tconcrete.  Stargher King HOWLS with frustration.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tMy world...\n\n\tA SHIMMERING KNIFE seems to enrage from within her forearm,\n\tout the flesh and into her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n\t\tMy rules.\n\n\tShe SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER (O.S.)\n\t\tNo!\n\n\tCatherine stops.  And turns to see the distraught Young\n\tStargher.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)\n\t\tDon't hurt him!\n\n\tShe spins around and sees not Stargher King, but MARTIN.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)\n\t\tHe didn't mean it.  I was bad.\n\n\tDisturbed by the transformation, Catherine backs away.  Her\n\tvision blurs, the sound distorts.  And the earth cracks\n\taround Stargher King's ankles.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER (CONT'D)\n\t\tHe teached me a lesson.  I deserved it.\n\n\tFighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the\n\tchild and rests the knife on the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tNo one deserves it, Carl.  No one.\n\n\tShe reaches out to him, but the child is JERKED into the air\n\tby Stargher King.  In one hand, the monster holds little\n\tCarl.  In the other - a KNIFE.  His face and chest red with\n\tcrimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a\n\tpredator's stare.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\tYer world.  My knife.\n\n\tStargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and -\n\tSNAP!  The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at\n\tthe elbow.  Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground\n\tas Stargher King YOWLS like a stuck pig, the good arm\n\tcradling the other.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)\n\t\tMe god hurt!  Why you do that?  Why?!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER\n\t\tEnough.\n\n\tStargher King regards him with disgust.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\tEnuff?!?!\n\n\tMARTIN STARGHER'S VOICE comes from the belly of the beast.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER\n\t\tI'll tell you what's enough...\n\n\tStargher and Stargher King square off.  The boy stands\n\tbetween them with the knife at his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tCarl!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\t\t(still speaking as Martin)\n\t\tShut up cunt.\n\t\t\t(to the boy)\n\t\tGive it here, worm...\n\n\tthe child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking\n\tto Catherine for guidance.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(as Martin)\n\t\tYou want a mommy?  Is that what you\n\t\twant?\n\n\tIn an almost dream-like motion, the child hands the blade to\n\tadult Stargher.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER\n\t\tEnough.\n\n\tAnd he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart.  For a\n\tbrief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher\n\tKing's.  Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with\n\tsad, troubled eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARTIN\n\t\t\t(as Stargher King)\n\t\tWhy?  What'd I do?...\n\n\tStargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher\n\tKing drops dead.   Dead.  Young Stargher smiles and hugs\n\tCatherine.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER\n\t\tTime to go 'way.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tCarl...?\n\n\tThe boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his\n\tarms and holds him close.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG STARGHER\n\t\tBye.\n\n\tShe looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand.  He\n\tdescends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his\n\tshoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARGHER KING\n\t\tThank you, Catherine.  You did help me. \n\t\tMore than you'll ever know.\n\n\tMan and boy disappear beneath the water's surface.  Catherine\n\tstands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. \n\tShe walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher\n\tand little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. \n\tAnd FADE FROM VIEW.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n\t\tGoodbye Carl.\n\n\tShe presses the sensor in her hand.\n\n\tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY\n\n\tIN THE CONTROL ROOM, Miriam is shocked by what she sees on\n\tthe monitors and looks at Stargher.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM\n\t\tHe's in full arrest.\n\n\tCatherine quietly returns to consciousness and is\n\tautomatically lowered.  She pulls the mask from her face,\n\trises and opens the door.  Miriam races inside and\n\tdesperately attempts to revive Stargher.  But it's no use. \n\tAngry and stunned, she demands of Catherine.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRIAM (CONT'D)\n\t\tHelp me!\n\n\tBut Catherine chooses not to.

Kicking her legs to keep\n\tafloat, Julia DIGS with the ring and we see she has created a\n\tgap between the light fixture housing and an unused PIPE\n\tleading to the surface.  She pushes, but can't get anything\n\tto move.  The opening will get no bigger.  Julia sucks the\n\tlast bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell. \n\tSearching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out\n\tthe drinking straw.\n\n\tINT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY\n\n\tShaken, but oddly transcendent, Catherine watches as\n\tStargher's body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney.

THE CELL - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tAs Julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny\n\tholes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression\n\twhich tells us she's given up.  THUMP-THUMP-THUMP.  The cell\n\tstarts to vibrate.  A repetitive noise WHUP-WHUP-WHUP - comes\n\tfrom above.  She swims to the top of the cell and POUNDS at\n\tthe ceiling.\n\n\tEXT.

Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is\n\tstill solid.  He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the\n\tbullet-damaged section.  CRACK! CRASH!  WATER POURS FROM THE\n\tCELL.  Julia's body descends on the torrent of water.  Novak\n\treaches inside and pulls her to safety.  He's just about to\n\tgive her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks\n\tin oxygen.
