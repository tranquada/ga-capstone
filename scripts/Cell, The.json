BASEMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tWe MOVE out of shadow, toward a bright focused light,\n\tfollowing the albino German Shepherd - VALENTINE - as it\n\tenters a VAST SUBTERRANEAN ROOM.  Most of the walls have been\n\tknocked down, leaving only thick support posts.  Valentine\n\tfinds Stargher in a DUGOUT PIT - about five feet deeper than\n\tthe rest of the room - polishing a stainless steel table.  A\n\tbright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the\n\tchain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST.\n\n\tThe dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far\n\tcorner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a\n\tlong, deep cast iron TUB.  Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine\n\tobediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE.  Stargher gives him a\n\tchew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub.\n\n\tSoaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. \n\tThe interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and\n\tthe whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is\n\tfloating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are\n\ther eyes.  Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into\n\tsomething ghostly, they are unforgettable.\n\n\tAs the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne\n\tfrom the tub and carries her to the table.  He places her\n\tface up and dries her with a clean white towel.  He moves her\n\tlimbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then\n\tretreats into shadow.  In the harsh light, against the shiny\n\ttable, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and\n\twe almost expect her to move...\n\n\tWe HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the\n\tpool of light.  Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is\n\tlaced with some rough tatoos.  When he turns his back to us,\n\twe find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through\n\this flesh.  Two columns of four on either side of the spine,\n\trunning from shoulder blade to just below the waist.  What in\n\tGod's name are they for?\n\n\tStargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where\n\the keeps TELEVISION MONITORS and VCRs.  He inserts a\n\tvideocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tIn BLACK AND WHITE, we see Anne awaken in the cell.  Her\n\tfirst moments inside.  Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she\n\texamines her surroundings.\n\n\tStargher is mesmerized by her fear.  Fast-forwarding to her\n\tdeath, he presses a remote and we get SOUND.  Anne screaming,\n\tbegging for her life.  Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks\n\tit in like a symphony.  Valentine cowers in the back of his\n\tcage, hating this.\n\n<b>\tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tLying on her bed (a waterbed), Catherine sleepily stares at\n\tthe ceiling, rolls onto her side, and feels herself drawn\n\tinto the comforter.

EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY\n</b>\n\tAnd we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.\n\n\tWe fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she\n\tstruggles through waves of sand.

Catherine retreats, silently screaming.\n\n<b>\tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN\n</b>\n\tIN HER OWN BED, Catherine's eyes are open.  In sharp contrast\n\tto a typical reaction to a nightmare, she remains calm.  No\n\tsweaty face, no gasp, no reaction at all, really.  She might\n\tas well have been dreaming of puppy dogs.  Wide awake, her\n\teyes return their gaze to the ceiling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tGo.  To.  Sleep.\n\n<b>\tINT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tCHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. \n\tAdmiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings\n\tin his back.  He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters,\n\ta series of GEARS click into motion.  The sound is torturous\n\tas the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground,\n\tpulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising.  Stargher\n\tgrimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it.  As the\n\thoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the\n\ttable until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's.\n\n\tIn the flickering weird light of the television screen,\n\tStargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of\n\tWilliam Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an\n\tinnocent angel.  With his free hand, he touches himself,\n\tchains clinking and swaying.\n\n<b>\tEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY\n</b>\n\tA railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek\n\tbed.

At water's edge, lying on rough,\n\tpebble-strewn ground, is a HAND.\n\n\tCatherine's hand.  We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. \n\tFrom the darkness comes a DOG.  Black in color and\n\tfeatureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders\n\tinto a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view.  After a\n\tmoment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we\n\tfollow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes\n\tit from her own face.\n\n\tIN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET\n\tsails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED\n\tANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just\n\ta TWIG.  As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the\n\tearth, splatter against \"twig trees,\" and explode into pools\n\tof stagnant water...\n\n\tAs we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the\n\tworld into which Catherine descended.\n\n\tShe sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to\n\ther surroundings.  The \"floor\" is covered with filth, ash,\n\tpebbles, and insects.  Water is present in many forms,\n\tpuddles, moisture, dripping ceilings.\n\n\tEyes focusing, queasy, not fully \"awake,\" Catherine notices\n\tthe crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets\n\tshowering the air.  She turns and finds the source.\n\n\tTHE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full\n\tof BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his \"bath.\"  Satisfied,\n\tthe animal stops and trots away.  Still adjusting to this\n\tnightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but\n\tthen realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING.  She looks\n\taround, then through a crack in the \"floor,\" briefly catches\n\tsight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers.  As\n\the disappears into corridor ending in \"nothing,\" we PULL BACK\n\tto show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace,\n\twalls, stairs, and ladders.  Leading everywhere and nowhere.\n\n\tCatherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific \"room.\" \n\tShortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she\n\tmoves to it.  We feel as though we're looking at a series of\n\tinterlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been\n\ttorn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or\n\tdoors.  Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes\n\ther way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.\n\n<b>\tINT.

They separate and compact the\n\tquadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected\n\thorse stand within the room.  Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare\n\tbarely acknowledged what happened.

Tired and having difficulty breathing, she\n\tdrops to her knees and \"cools down.\"  She hears a NOISE\n\tnearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM\n\tconnected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an\n\talmost metallic-looking glass.  Curious yet cautious, she\n\texamines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs\n\tof \"traps\" akin to the glass blades.  Finding none, she pulls\n\tthe mechanism and quickly steps back.\n\n\tThe shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive\n\tin the tiny cubicle beyond.

In a fluid\n\tmotion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as\n\tthe man reaches the floor.  Catherine knows he is there. \n\tUnable to stop herself, she turns.

Good luck.\n\n\tNovak smiles, waves goodbye, and reaches into the Suburban.\n\n<b>\tINT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE\n</b>\n\tAs Dorothy and her companions confront the Wizard, there's a\n\tKNOCK at the screen door and Catherine sees Novak waiting.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tReady?\n\n\tCatherine cradles her cat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tReady.\n\n\tHe opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the\n\tliving room.  Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides\n\tunder the couch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tThat went well.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tGive her a minute.\n\t\t\t(smiles at the dog)\n\t\tHello, Valentine.\n\n\tNovak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine,\n\tlicking her face, wagging his tail.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tYou sure about this?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tAbsolutely.\n\t\t\t(calling for the cat)\n\t\tAbigail...\n\n\tValentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base\n\tof the sofa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tI heard Julia and John got married.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tYep.  Eloped.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tGood for them.\n\n\tValentine settles on the floor.  Slowly, Abigail's curiosity\n\tgets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's\n\tnose.  Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the\n\tcat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tWell look at that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tI told you.  You have to be optimistic. \n\t\tBelieve in them...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tSo you say.\n\n\tAmazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tHe's mine?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tAll yours.  My boss says it's one of the\n\t\tstrangest requests the Bureau's ever\n\t\thad.\n\n\tCatherine laughs.  She likes that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tHe also says that until proven\n\t\tdifferently, Julia Hickson was found as\n\t\ta result of good old-fashioned detective\n\t\twork.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tIt doesn't matter...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tI don't know.  I think it does.\n\t\t\t(genuine concern)\n\t\tYou know, Catherine... If you ever want\n\t\tto talk about it.  What happened to\n\t\tStargher.  That last time.\n\n\tIt's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tNot just yet.  Okay?\n\n\tNovak doesn't push it.  He just takes her hand and gives it a\n\tgentle squeeze.  The cat dashes into the kitchen and\n\tValentine follows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThey're hungry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tI got it.\n\n\tHe moves into the kitchen.  In a moment of quiet\n\tintrospection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at\n\tDorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket\n\tof water, causing her to melt.  And she looks away, unable to\n\twatch, disturbed by the image.  She turns to the kitchen and\n\tsees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat.  He rises and\n\treturns to the living room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tThank you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNOVAK\n</b>\t\tNo problem.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCATHERINE\n</b>\t\tNo.  Thank you.\n\n\tHe smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder. \n\tCatherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by\n\tsimple human touch...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FADE TO BLACK.\n</b>\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Cell, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Mark Protosevich\" title=\"Scripts by Mark Protosevich\">Mark Protosevich</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Cell, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Cell, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:01:53.859133"}
