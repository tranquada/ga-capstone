The structure \n               is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather-warped. \n               Dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the \n               foundation. Between the building and the tracks is a long, \n               somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, \n               termites and the elements. The match-board overhang of the \n               building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the \n               platform, sags and bellies. From the overhang is appended a \n               rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is \n               identified:\n\n               BLACK ROCK\n\n               One of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the \n               other, cocking the sign irregularly.\n\n               The railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon. Past \n               the town on each side stretches the ocean-like prairie, with \n               sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each \n               other toward infinity. The morning sun lays over this \n               wasteland of the American Southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise \n               from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread \n               themselves over the poisoned sky.\n\n               A small shack stands next to the station, separated from it \n               by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, \n               as if for support. The words POSTAL TELEGRAPH are arced across \n               its dusty vitrine. An old straight-backed chair, reinforced \n               with twisted wire, is tilted against the north-west corner \n               of the shack. In it is Mr. Hastings, the postal telegraph \n               agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity. He \n               sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding \n               chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle \n               under his watery nose.\n\n               FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK\n\n               The town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in \n               isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects \n               a secondary dirt road. The twin strips of steel glisten in \n               the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false \n               fronts of the town. In b.g. is the bluff of a black stony \n               mountain. Against this ancient mass the houses of Black Rock's \n               single street*** (See map, P.2A) are scanty in number and \n               insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint-peeled \n               modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin \n               strips torn from signs.\n\n               The town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing \n               else, the quality of inertia and immutibility -- nothing \n               moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the \n               wind. Town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held \n               forever in the sullen, abrasive earth.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               STRAIGHT SHOT - STREAMLINER\n\n               jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its \n               diesel engines pounding. Its horn \"WONKS\" twice, blasting \n               the shatterable air.\n\n               FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK - ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Nothing is changed, nothing is altered. But look close and \n               you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily \n               across the dirt and dust of the single street. HOLD for a \n               beat, then MAIN TITLE appears. Between the ensuing credits \n               INTERCUT a series of sharp LONG SHOTS. The composition of \n               each shot has that hard, sun-beaten texture of American \n               primitive painting -- pressurized in its simplicity -- best \n               exemplified, perhaps, by the work of Grant Wood.\n\n               EXT. SAM'S SANITARY BAR AND GRILL - ANGLE ON DOC VELIE\n\n               assayer and notary public, mortician to the citizens of Black \n               Rock who have departed to a better place, and veterinarian \n               to its lesser animals. An elderly, somewhat untidy gentleman, \n               he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the Bar & Grill. \n               Idling with him are three or four other loafers, among them \n               Sam, the middle-aged proprietor of the restaurant. Doc glances \n               casually at his watch; no one else moves. The hot wind \n               continues listlessly down the empty street.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               EXT. GARAGE - LIZ BROOKS\n\n               A tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton \n               shirt. She stands just outside the open barn-like door of \n               the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at \n               the endlessly receding tracks. The sultry wind, its gustiness \n               slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               EXT. PORCH OF HOTEL - COLEY TRIMBLE AND HECTOR DAVID\n\n               two enormous men. HECTOR is tall, and there is about him a \n               nasty, raw-boned tautness; COLEY is more the anthropoid type -- \n               long thick arms and a round, iron casing of a belly. They \n               glance down the street, watching incuriously a dust devil \n               swirling in the wind.\n\n               Now the CAMERA has completed its probe of the town and its \n               denizens. MAIN TITLE and CREDITS are completed...\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - MR. HASTINGS\n\n               still spineless in his chair, the chair still tilted against \n               the shack. From o.s. and far away, we hear the horn of the \n               streamliner -- two long \"WONKS\", a short and a long (engine \n               whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing). Hastings \n               straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming \n               train.\n\n               STRAIGHT SHOT - STREAMLINER\n\n               moving at tremendous speed.\n\n               BRIDGE\n\n               with train barrelling toward it. The horn BLASTS -- three \n               short WONKS (engine whistle signal for stopping at next \n               station).\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS\n\n               getting jerkily to his feet, as though charged by a galvanic \n               current. The uncharacteristic speed of his movements throws \n               the tilted chair to the station platform. He raises an arm \n               to shield his watery eyes from the sun...\n\n                                     HASTINGS\n                              (almost inaudible, as \n                              if to himself)\n                         Stopping...?\n\n               SHOT - TRAIN\n\n               heading toward CAMERA, churning across the desert like a \n               juggernaut. It PANS past CAMERA in a blur of speed. CAMERA \n               SWINGS UP on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes \n               are applied. The wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails, \n               kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust. She cuts speed, \n               brakes hissing, and starts to slow down.\n\n               LONG SHOT MAIN STREET - BLACK ROCK\n\n               SHOOTING from rear of town, toward the railroad tracks. The \n               townspeople step out, frowning, cautious, disturbed. The \n               secure ritual of the train passing through, never stopping, \n               has somehow, for some unknown reason, been violated.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - DOC VELIE\n\n               as his mouth tightens. His air of placidity vanishes, leaving \n               his features disturbed.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - LIZ BROOKS\n\n               Her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly. Her eyes \n               are coated with a vague emptiness. She seems confused as she \n               halfturns toward the hotel.\n\n               REVERSE SHOT - WHAT SHE SEES\n\n               Coley Trimble and Hector David, standing on the porch of the \n               hotel. They seem tense, responding variously to what might \n               be fear. Coley's nostrils flare, his flat ugly mouth \n               compresses. He looks profoundly serious. Hector wipes a glob \n               of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS\n\n               as he stands in surprise, nervously alert, watching the train \n               as it comes to a complete stop. His jaw droops with the \n               slackness of fear.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               EXT. STATION PLATFORM\n\n               with the train stationary before it. A sleek steel door of a \n               pullman clangs open. A colored porter carrying a suitcase \n               walks down the wrought-iron steps. He is stately, gray-haired \n               and lean, with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate \n               with trainmen. The man behind him is big-shouldered, a granite-\n               like wedge of a man with calm, piercing eyes. There is about \n               him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor, but \n               his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber \n               familiarity with pain. His left arm hangs from his shoulder \n               with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis, while the hand is \n               hidden in his pocket.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY AND PORTER\n\n               The porter puts the suitcase on the platform. In the distance \n               the town and its people are seen staring silently, \n               motionlessly. The big man glances toward them. He smiles a \n               sad, distasteful greeting to the town, its wretched dust. \n               its mean, modest buildings. The porter disappears into the \n               train as the conductor enters scene. He turns slowly, \n               following Macreedy's gaze...\n\n                                     CONDUCTOR\n                              (softly, staring at \n                              the towns people)\n                         Man. They look woebegone and far \n                         away.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (looking around)\n                         I'll only be here twenty-four hours.\n\n                                     CONDUCTOR\n                         In a place like this, it could be a \n                         lifetime.\n                              (turning to face \n                              Macreedy)\n                         Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.\n\n               Macreedy nods his thanks. The conductor signals the engineer \n               (o.s.) and steps on the train. The diesel's claxon blasts \n               the torrid air ominously. The train slowly, smoothly, begins \n               to move, picking up speed. The cars slip past until, quite \n               suddenly, the Streamliner is gone. For a moment Macreedy \n               watches it. Then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of \n               cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free \n               of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the \n               empty pack, drops it beside the tracks. He takes a cardboard \n               book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with \n               agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the \n               head against the sandpaper guard. The match flares, the \n               cigarette is lit. Macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns \n               to pick up his suitcase. Then he sees Hastings, who walks \n               slowly, almost painfully, to him. His Adam's apple grapples \n               protestingly with his collar. After a moment he controls it \n               sufficiently to talk...\n\n                                     HASTINGS\n                         You for Black Rock?\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (easily)\n                         That's right.\n\n                                     HASTINGS\n                              (uneasily)\n                         There must be some mistake.

POSTAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE\n\n               as Hastings, fumbling, picks up the phone...\n\n                                     HASTINGS\n                              (into mouthpiece)\n                         Hello, Pete? Now, listen...\n\n               REVERSE SHOT - MAIN STREET - BLACK ROCK\n\n               SHOOTING down the street as Macreedy slowly walks toward the \n               hotel. Not a person has moved, each eye is glued on the \n               stranger.\n\n               The hollow rasp of Macreedy's tread on the wooden platform \n               of the \"pavement\" seems shatteringly loud in the enveloping \n               silence...\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - LIZ\n\n               as she follows the man's movement.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               CLOSE ANGLE - ON MACREEDY\n\n               as he walks along. He feels the eyes of everyone following \n               him, glaring at him. He halts, looks around. The townspeople \n               continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal \n               incuriosity. He grins and walks on past a cluster of five or \n               six RFD mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, \n               its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's \n               pistol long ago.\n\n               SHOT - MACREEDY\n\n               heading toward the hotel. In b.g. is a relatively small farm \n               equipment yard compressed between a general store (which \n               Macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead. In the \n               yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office. \n               It is empty; the front window is thick with dust. On it, \n               etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and \n               crossbones. Running diagonally across is the printed legend:\n\n               T.J. HATES J.S.\n\n               Macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement. \n               He walks on, reaching the facade of the weather-beaten hotel. \n               A gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing \n               Macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool. \n               As it subsides...\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY\n\n               As he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel. It has \n               a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side. Macreedy \n               mounts the hotel steps. At the top of the steps Coley Trimble \n               and Hector David watch him silently. Hector is large and \n               leanly muscular, yet Coley looms over him like a battleship. \n               He is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the \n               size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw. \n               Both men wear modern Western work clothes, but there is one \n               incongruous accessory which Hector affects. Around his thick \n               wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately \n               tooled leather strap -- a cheap reproduction of one of those \n               expensive Swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished \n               accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the \n               year, the phase of the moon, etc., etc.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (slowing up)\n                         'Afternoon.\n\n               No reaction from Hector.\n\n                                     COLEY\n                              (blocking doorway)\n                         Anything I can do for you?\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         You run this hotel?\n\n                                     COLEY\n                         No.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (pleasantly)\n                         Then there's nothing you can do for \n                         me.\n\n               He brushes past Coley and enters.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                              (turning to Coley)\n                         Find Smith!\n\n               Coley nods and heads down the street. Hector enters the hotel.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               INT. HOTEL\n\n               It is a typical small town hotel, but crummier, with a tiny \n               lobby. Macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as Hector strolls \n               in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair. \n               He picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on Macreedy. \n               Macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk. For a moment, \n               he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from \n               the ink-splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those \n               World War II banners, the imitation silk now stained and \n               faded. It depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching The \n               Flag in a claw. Under it, the legend:\n\n                                   \"GOD BLESS AMERICA\"\n\n               Near it, a tacky placard proclaims:\n\n               DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN, \n               BY ALL THE MEANS YOU CAN, \n               IN ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN, \n               AT ALL THE TIMES YOU CAN, \n               TO ALL THE PEOPLE YOU CAN, \n               AS LONG AS EVER YOU CAN.\n\n               Feeling the eyes of Hector on him, Macreedy turns. Hector \n               meets his gaze with bland, insolent interest. Now a young \n               man (his name is PETE) comes out of a small room behind the \n               registration desk and walks up to it. There is a softness \n               about his regular features, a certain indefinable sugariness \n               about his mouth. He seems tight-lipped, for lorn and uneasy \n               as he faces Macreedy across the counter.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (pleasantly)\n                         I'd like a room.\n\n                                     PETE\n                         All filled up.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (a beat)\n                         Got any idea where I might --\n\n                                     PETE\n                              (stiffly, shaking his \n                              head)\n                         This is 1945, mister. There's been a \n                         war on.\n\n               Macreedy looks at the young man with impeccable tolerance. \n               Without shifting his gaze, he slowly lets fall his small \n               suitcase. It thuds softly on the frayed carpet.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         I thought it ended a couple of months \n                         ago.\n\n                                     PETE\n                         Yeah, but the O.P.A. lingers on.\n\n               Macreedy looks down at the open ledger on the desk before \n               him. The clerk reaches out to close it. Gently, yet firmly, \n               Macreedy stops him, reopening the big book. He studies it, a \n               finger straying unconsciously inside his collar. He [...] on \n               it to relieve the starchy stiffness.\n\n               Pete begins to fidget...\n\n                                     PETE\n                         You don't know about the O.P.A...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (without looking up)\n                         Tell me.\n\n                                     PETE\n                         Well, for establishments with less'n \n                         fifty rooms hotel keepers got to \n                         report regularly about...\n\n               His voice fades desperately.\n\n                                     PETE\n                         ...about tenants and... and... \n                         registration...\n                              (drawing himself up)\n                         There are penalties imposed...\n\n               Again his voice trails off.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (eyes still on the \n                              ledger)\n                         You seem to have lots of vacancies.\n\n                                     PETE\n                              (uncomfortable)\n                         Well... as I said...\n\n               Macreedy leans over the counter to a rack of keys.

He \n               draws a safety razor down his face, completing his shave; \n               then he wipes a hand over the mirror, which clouds with steam \n               almost as fast as he can clear it. o.s., the SOUND of bath \n               water gurgling down the tub drain. He runs a tentative finger \n               inside the collar of his robe, pulling loose a price tag. He \n               drops it carefully into a wastebasket. He turns on the faucet \n               at the sink to rinse his shaving brush.

He wears the bathrobe \n               and slippers; a large towel is draped over his head, like a \n               prize fighter. He stops outside a door, pushes the towel \n               from his head to his neck and puts his hand on the knob. He \n               is about to insert the key when he tenses. Slowly, silently, \n               he turns the knob and throws open the door.\n\n               INT. HOTEL ROOM\n\n               Next to the door, in the corner of the small, sparsely \n               furnished room is Macreedy's suitcase, open, its contents \n               askew and scattered over the dusty floor. On the bed sprawls \n               Hector David, his gigantic body straining the springs. He \n               lies on his back, hands clasped easily under his head, thick \n               legs crossed, his Stetson tilted over his low forehead. He \n               is completely unconcerned by Macreedy's entrance. For a moment \n               Macreedy stares at him. Then...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (slightly amused)\n                         I think you have the wrong room.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                              (not budging)\n                         You think so?\n\n               Slowly, his eyes still on Macreedy, Hector takes off his \n               elaborate wrist watch and slides it gently into his pants \n               pocket.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         What else you got on your mind?\n\n               Macreedy pauses and takes in the situation. He refuses to be \n               baited.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         Nothing, I guess.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         If you had a mind, boy, you'd of \n                         heard what Pete downstairs said.

Macreedy smiles and walks toward the door; Pete, \n               Doc et al watching him. He goes out.\n\n               EXT. STREET\n\n               As Macreedy walks down hotel steps, a station wagon pulls up \n               just before him. Tied with a rope to the right front fender \n               is a magnificent eight-point buck. A stain of dry blood weaves \n               an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable \n               bullet hole in his shoulder. Two men get out of the car; one \n               of them is Coley Trimble. He sees Macreedy coming toward \n               him. He stands motionless in the center of the narrow \n               pavement, picking at his nose with the detachment of a child. \n               The other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings \n               out from behind the wheel. He walks around the car, joining \n               Coley at the curb. Macreedy comes on. The man with Coley \n               looks at the stranger with colossal indifference, as \n               expressionless as the soil of Black Rock. His handsome face, \n               under a dusty hunting cap, is taut and hard and wind-shaven. \n               Next to Coley he stands motionless, except for the wisp of \n               smoke from a black Cuban cigarette between his thin lips. In \n               b.g., the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby \n               move out the door and stand on the porch. They watch Macreedy, \n               Coley and Reno Smith, the handsome, taut-faced man. Silence \n               soems to settle over everything. It is Macreedy who breaks \n               it...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (grinning wearily at \n                              Coley)\n                         Here we go again.\n\n               Gently he walks around Coley and Reno Smith and continues \n               down the street. Coley's eyes follow him. Smith goes up the \n               steps of the hotel and enters the lobby. Coley quickly follows \n               him. The loafers on the porch go back inside.\n\n               INT. HOTEL LOBBY\n\n               The loafers resume their familiar places as Smith walks \n               briskly to the clerk's desk. Pete, in anticipation, opens \n               the hotel register, places it before Smith\n\n                                     PETE\n                              (deferentially, \n                              gesturing toward the \n                              open register)\n                         That's all I know about him, Mr. \n                         Smith.\n\n               Smith doesn't answer; he looks up thoughtfully. His eyes \n               harden almost imperceptibly as he sees Coley, across the \n               narrow room, looking out the window after Macreedy.\n\n                                     SMITH\n                              (to Coley's back)\n                         Sit down.\n\n                                     COLEY\n                              (spinning to face him)\n                         I was only...\n\n                                     SMITH\n                              (interrupting)\n                         Sit down.\n\n               Coley sits in the nearest chair. Beyond Smith, still resting \n               easily against the high counter of Pete's desk, the gigantic \n               figure of Hector appears at the top of the stairs. He comes \n               down and joins Smith.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                              (after a pause)\n                         Pretty cool guy.\n\n                                     SMITH\n                         Doesn't push easy?\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                              (frowning)\n                         That's it -- that's just it.

LIZ'S GARAGE - FULL SHOT\n\n               The garage, without a door, opens on the street. Against the \n               front of the building is parked a battered bicycle. On one \n               of the barnlike walls a boy of nine is drawing laboriously \n               with a piece of chalk. He puts the last flourish to a skull \n               and crossbones identical with that seen earlier on the window \n               of the equipment yard office. Macreedy stops a few feet from \n               him, waiting until the boy prints \"T.J.\". As he steps back \n               to admire his handiwork...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         Hi, T.J.\n\n               T.J. nods. He approaches the wall, raising his chalk.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         This your garage?\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         Nope.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (a beat)\n                         Where's the man it belongs to?\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         Ain't a man.\n\n               He pauses.

T.J. has just completed the final letter of \n               the word \"HATES\". And again as Macreedy opens his mouth...\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         She's not here.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         Where'd she go?\n\n                                     T.J.\n                              (shrugging)\n                         I dunno.

Sometime.\n\n               Again the pause. T.J. steps back, having completed his work, \n               which, of course, broadcasts the fact that \"T.J. HATES J.S.\". \n               And again as Macreedy begins to speak...\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         In about ten minutes.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (with a grin)\n                         Thanks.\n\n               T.J. turns, pulls the bike away from the building, completes \n               a fastidious \"pony express\" and peddles furiously out of \n               scene.\n\n               EXT. STREET - FULL SHOT\n\n               as Macreedy, after a moment's hesitation, starts down it. \n               From the far end, at the telegraph agent's shack, a figure \n               starts running toward Macreedy. It is Hastings. INTERCUT \n               between the two men. Hastings, in his concentration, doesn't \n               see the stranger until he is almost upon him. He slows down, \n               suddenly, awkwardly, to a self-conscious walk. Macreedy grins \n               at him, passes on, shaking his head speculatively. Hastings, \n               with a parting glance, gallops up the hotel steps.\n\n               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - FULL SHOT\n\n               Smith, Coley, Hector, Pete, Doc, Sam et al are still in \n               evidence. Smith is in a tight little group at the desk with \n               Coley, Hector and Pete. Doc has taken a position at the \n               window, looking out. Hastings bursts in and half-runs to \n               Smith...\n\n               ANGLE FAVORING SMITH AND HASTINGS \n\n               as the excited telegraph agent speaks.\n\n                                     HASTINGS\n                         I called the Circle T.

One side leads to the cell block and \n               Macreedy heads for it.\n\n               ANGLE from interior of cell block comprising two cells, both \n               of which are open. A man is asleep in the lower bunk of the \n               front cell. The keys are in the lock. Macreedy shakes his \n               head and starts to close the creaking cell door. Sheriff TIM \n               HORN, the man in the bunk, lifts his head, blinking his bleary \n               eyes.

DESERT ROAD\n\n               An old marker, jutting on an angle at the side of the road, \n               reads: ADOBE FLAT. Beneath it an arrow points ahead. Macreedy \n               steers the jeep up the narrow, rutted trail between a serious \n               of enormous boulders.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               as he drives to the far end of the boulders, reaching a flat \n               piece of land completely surrounded by rocks. Beyond the \n               rocks is what remains of a burned-out ranch house, and an \n               abandoned well.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               MED. SHOT - MACREEDY\n\n               in the wreckage. The remains of an iron bed. The burned-out \n               shell of a pick-up truck. Part of a stove. A morass of \n               bottles, all sizes and shapes, some of them broken. Macreedy \n               halts momentarily beside the well. Reaching out he touches \n               the warped sun-beaten boards that cover the mouth. He removes \n               one, and, picking up a pebble, drops it through the opening. \n               There is a long beat and then, from far, far below we HEAR a \n               faint PLUNK (o.s.). He replaces the board and walks to a \n               broken wall. He touches the burned out frame of a picture. \n               The frame falls to the ground, leaving an un-scorched square \n               on the surface of the wall. He goes past a solitary standing \n               stone chimney. Suddenly he halts, arrested by something among \n               the rubble, the rottenness and the ashes.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT HE SEES\n\n               Surrounded by the seared and blackened earth is a rectangular \n               patch of lovely wild flowers.\n\n               BACK TO MACREEDY\n\n               studying the brightly colored flowers. His face is lined in \n               thought. He stoops, gathers a few buds in his hand. He \n               examines them, his brow furrowed. As he slowly twirls a flower \n               between thumb and forefinger, CAMERA PANS from Macreedy in a \n               long slow arc, taking in miles and miles of barren wasteland. \n               CAMERA RISES, TILTING UPWARD to a cliff far away and shielded \n               from Macreedy's view by the intervening rocks and ridges.\n\n               EXTREME LONG SHOT - CLIFF \n\n               and on it the outline of an automobile.\n\n               MED. SHOT - THE CAR \n\n               empty. It is parked on a narrow dirt road. On one side of \n               the road the cliff falls abruptly to the valley far below; \n               on the other, the steep, shaly outcropping continues to rise. \n               For a moment CAMERA HOLDS on the car. Then it PANS SLOWLY \n               upward about fifty feet, HOLDING this time on...\n\n               PINNACLE OF CLIFF \n\n               where a man is looking off toward Adobe Flat through a pair \n               of high-powered glasses. The man is Coley Trimble.\n\n               ADOBE WELLS - MACREEDY\n\n               Grimly he walks toward the jeep, still holding the wild \n               flowers. Now he pockets them, jumps into the vehicle and \n               drives off.\n\n               THE CLIFF - COLEY\n\n               continues to train his glasses on Macreedy far below in the \n               moving jeep.\n\n               THE JEEP - MACREEDY\n\n               driving steadily over rough, rocky terrain.\n\n               COLEY\n\n               climbs down from the pinnacle of the cliff and enters a big, \n               powerful '36 Packard sedan.\n\n               MACREEDY\n\n               shifts to low gear as the jeep presses into hilly country.\n\n               COLEY - IN HIS CAR\n\n               turns on the ignition.\n\n               MACREEDY - IN THE JEEP\n\n               as it winds along a road with the cliff rising on one side \n               and falling off steeply on the other. He rounds a curve, \n               passes an insignificant side road, drives on.\n\n               THE SIDE ROAD\n\n               The car with Coley at the wheel pulls out, follows Macreedy.\n\n               INTERCUT between the two cars, with the distance between \n               them constantly diminishing.\n\n               OUT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               EXT. - FLAT ROAD\n\n               a straightaway, cutting through rocky outcroppings on both \n               sides. Macreedy's jeep roars by, pursued by the gaining \n               Packard.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - MACREEDY IN JEEP - (PROCESS)\n\n               For the first time he is aware that he is being followed, \n               and that the man at the wheel of the big Packard is Coley.\n\n               SHOT - PACKARD\n\n               picking up tremendous speed.\n\n               EXT. - ROAD BED\n\n               proceeding over a series of turns, inclines, declivities \n               (according to location terrain). Engines roar, brakes whinny, \n               tires scream, skidding on the turns.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - ROAD BED \n\n               as Coley overtakes Macreedy. He steers the big car within a \n               foot or two of the jeep. The terrain has steepened; on the \n               right there is nothing between the road and the valley floor \n               far below but a few inches of soft shoulder.\n\n               As Macreedy pulls wide on a razor turn, Coley tries to come \n               inside him. Macreedy, fighting for control of the veering \n               jeep, succeeds in cutting him off.\n\n               CURVE IN ROAD\n\n               In the approach, Coley cuts sharp into the jeep. The jeep \n               seems to roll with the blow, then leaps ahead, maneuvering \n               the turn.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT COLEY IN CAR (PROCESS)\n\n               Coley is flustered, his face blood-shot with fury. He seems \n               to generate an atmosphere of vicious, cruel craziness; the \n               wild smile across his mouth is almost sensual, obscene. He \n               floorboards the Packard. Like some monstrous battering ram, \n               the heavy car smashes into the jeep's rear bumper, kicking \n               the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead. Coley floorboards the gas \n               pedal, again. Each time he slams into the jeep with sickening \n               force, with the brutal abrasion of metal pounding metal.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - MACREEDY - (PROCESS)\n\n               With one arm he works frantically to keep his under-sized \n               car on the twisty road. He sees ahead a precipitous cliff \n               falling off on an impossibly sharp curve. He makes a \n               decision...\n\n               Just ahead the gradient is comparatively gradual, however \n               steep by normal standards. He swings the jeep off the road, \n               onto the declivity. The car plunges downward, miraculously \n               upright. Macreedy jockeys it to a whirring, shuddering halt \n               in the soft sand at the bottom of a draw.\n\n               Macreedy turns slightly and looks up the mountain-side with \n               the road at its summit...\n\n               WHAT HE SEES: EXTREME LONG SHOT - COLEY\n\n               standing at the edge of the road, peering down at him. In \n               b.g., the Packard. Coley turns emphatically, gets into car, \n               drives off.\n\n               BACK TO MACREEDY\n\n               His face is caked with the sweat of his exertions and dust \n               kicked up by the grinding wheels. He exhales heavily and \n               runs a shaky hand across the side of his head. He becomes \n               aware suddenly of a NOISE, a trickling, an unmistakable tinkle \n               as of running water. He frowns, opens the jeep door...\n\n               MEDIUM SHOT - JEEP \n\n               as Macreedy unlatches the hood and throws it open. The NOISE \n               continues. Macreedy examines the engine and finds the \n               difficulty...\n\n               INSERT - ENGINE \n\n               focal point: the nut joining the gas line with the carburetor \n               has worked loose in the jouncing the car has taken. With his \n               hand Macreedy screws it tight.\n\n               MEDIUM SHOT - JEEP \n\n               as Macreedy lowers the hood, re-enters jeep. He turns on \n               ignition. The engine fires. As he drives slowly out of the \n               ravine...\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               EXT.

He stands in front of the grocery store, with \n               the baskets of fruit on the sidewalk. He looks up, stops \n               crunching.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - SAM \n\n               at the window of the Bar & Grill, cleaning an ear with a \n               toothpick. He looks out. The toothpick is motionless.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS \n\n               fidgeting outside his shack. He looks up.

He \n               looks neither to the right nor left.\n\n               GROUP SHOT - FAVORING SMITH AND COLEY\n\n               Standing on the porch of the hotel, watching. Smith's face \n               compresses, and his eyes swivel to rest on Coley's with cold, \n               contemptuous anger. Coley licks his lips uneasily. Smith \n               turns and enters the hotel. Coley meekly follows.\n\n               FULL SHOT - MACREEDY\n\n               He brakes the jeep before the garage. No one is there. He \n               parks the vehicle, gets out and heads down the street.\n\n               EXT. HOTEL\n\n               Macreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees Coley's \n               car at the curb. Both right fenders are creased. An ugly, \n               jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half, one \n               part angling crazily toward the sky, the other drooping in \n               the dust of the road. Smith and Coley come out of the hotel. \n               They stand on the porch, watching Macreedy as he in turn \n               watches the car. They exchange a glance. Smith nods, so...\n\n                                     COLEY\n                         Well, if it's not Macreedy - the \n                         world's champion road hog.\n\n               He walks down the steps to the street, joining Macreedy. \n               Smith remains on the porch.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         Yeah.

As they study \n               the engine, Hector's horsey face appears behind them.

Smith and Coley enter. \n               They walk to Macreedy, stopping just a few feet behind him.\n\n                                     COLEY\n                              (to Macreedy, with \n                              menacing friendliness)\n                         You still around?

He squirms \n               on it, his movements exaggerated. Now he spins to face Smith.\n\n                                     COLEY\n                         This seat ain't comfortable.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         I was afraid of that.\n\n                                     COLEY\n                         I think I'd like the seat you're on.\n\n                                     SMITH\n                              (to Macreedy, mildly)\n                         He's as changeable as a prairie fire.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (to Coley)\n                         Suppose you tell me where to sit.\n\n               Coley opens his mouth but, realizing he has been \n               outmaneuvered, closes it again. The loafers in b.g. are \n               silent, watching. Sam, seemingly oblivious to Coley's pressure \n               on Macreedy, places a bottle of ketchup in front of the \n               stranger. Coley gets up slowly and walks stiff-legged to \n               Macreedy. He takes the bottle of ketchup and, without removing \n               the cap, upends it over Macreedy's plate. The cap is drowned \n               in a deluge of ketchup which overflows the plate and runs \n               onto the counter.\n\n                                     COLEY\n                              (to Macreedy)\n                         I hope that ain't too much.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (to Smith, gesturing \n                              toward Coley)\n                         Your friend's a very [...] fellow.\n\n                                     SMITH\n                              (nodding)\n                         Sort of unpredictable, too.

As he passes Coley, Coley takes \n               his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. \n               The two men face each other.\n\n                                     COLEY\n                         If I tied both hands...?\n\n               Macreedy shakes free of Coley's grasp. Coley lunges. His big \n               right fist streaks toward Macreedy's face. Macreedy ducks, \n               weaving with the punch. He grabs Coley's belt, twisting \n               Coley's body. The momentum of the swing throws Coley off \n               balance. As he goes past Macreedy, the stranger tugs at his \n               belt, twisting him to one side. He plants his left foot firmly \n               on the toes of Coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring \n               Coley in place. He chops the under side of his open hand in \n               a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under Coley's ear. \n               With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard \n               against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose. The \n               cartilage shatters. Blood spills down his face. Following \n               through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone. \n               Macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind-burned face, \n               finding Coley's right wrist. He jerks the wrist out and \n               backward. It snaps. Coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain \n               and perplexity. His body lolls forward. Macreedy steps back. \n               He raises his right shoulder a few inches. His bent right \n               arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. \n               Fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber \n               shoulder giving them motion. The fist strikes Coley's face, \n               covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of \n               his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. Coley shuts his \n               eyes and falls unconscious.\n\n               Smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches Coley fall. \n               He takes half a step toward him. Macreedy looks at Smith. \n               Smith stops. Macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of \n               sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth. Working \n               methodically, Macreedy frisks Coley. He takes from a pocket \n               a long, ugly knife. He snaps the spring and the four-inch \n               blade leaps into place. He looks at the knife in his hand \n               and then at Smith. He smiles gently, even dreamily.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (to Smith)\n                         Wouldn't it be easier if you just \n                         waited till I turned my back?\n                              (looking toward the \n                              loafers at the bar, \n                              then back at Smith)\n                         Or are there too many witnesses \n                         present?\n\n               Macreedy walks slowly toward him, holding the knife. The are \n               only three feet apart. Smith's hand goes to a pocket, closes \n               inside over the outline of a pistol. Sam glances from Macreedy \n               to Smith to the unconscious Coley. He sidles toward the door \n               and runs out fast. (NOTE: From this point to end of scene \n               INTERCUT from Macreedy and Smith to exploit the reactions of \n               the loafers at the bar.)\n\n                                     SMITH\n                              (with effortless \n                              ferocity)\n                         You're still in trouble.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         So are you.\n                              (Smith snorts)\n                         Whatever happens -- you're lost.\n\n                                     SMITH\n                         You got things a bit twisted...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         You killed Komako.

Smith \n               catches it.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         And they're getting tougher every \n                         minute.\n\n               He walks past Smith and goes out the door. Self-consciously \n               holding the knife, Smith turns to face the loafers at the \n               bar. They say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like \n               a panel of ghouls. The door opens, admitting Sam and Doc, \n               who carries his little black medical bag. Doc looks at Coley.\n\n                                     DOC\n                              (softly, full of awe)\n                         Man... man-oh-man.\n\n               He goes to Coley, bending down over him. Smith has remained \n               motionless as a monument. Now he doubles shut the knife in \n               his hand. He pockets it, and without even glancing at Coley, \n               turns quickly and goes out.\n\n                                                            QUICK DISSOLVE:\n\n               INT. HOTEL LOBBY\n\n               Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the chairs. \n               He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on the \n               couch, reading a neatly folded newspaper. Behind him at the \n               clerk's desk, Pete is fitfully involved in a game of \n               solitaire. At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring change \n               into a slot machine. It whines, grinds, and clicks with \n               rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off. In the \n               chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off. He works \n               hard and with some concentration, removing the other. Then \n               he places them neatly at the foot of his chair. He wiggles \n               his toes -- watching them with some interest.\n\n               The wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops. The sudden \n               silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the one-\n               arm bandit. They follow his gaze up the steps.\n\n               STAIRWAY - MACREEDY\n\n               walks down, carrying his suitcase.

He walks across the \n               frayed carpet to the nearest chair and drops into it.

He sees Macreedy coming toward him. He walks rigidly \n               in an arc past Macreedy to Smith. He holds out a Postal \n               Telegraph form. Smith puts down his paper and takes it. \n               Macreedy, followed by Doc, goes over to Smith.

Hector swaggers over from the slot machine. \n               Hastings slips around the back of the couch, protected by \n               the barricade of Hector's great body.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (evenly, to Smith)\n                         I think that's for me.\n                              (he takes the message \n                              from Smith's hand \n                              and quickly glances \n                              at it.

You want to register a complaint?\n\n               Macreedy doesn't answer. Hector takes the message from Tim's \n               limp hand and tears it into little pieces.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         To register a complaint, boy, you've \n                         got to have evidence.

For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Tim \n               stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non-\n               committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up \n               now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of \n               slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his \n               preoccupation with the three men in the lobby.\n\n               Macreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his \n               collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette. \n               Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him, \n               flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too, \n               feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the other \n               of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so \n               haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his \n               suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of something \n               better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for \n               support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from \n               his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out \n               to Tim. Tim takes a drink.\n\n               The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that \n               day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fierce \n               light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery \n               dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver has \n               tarnished with the darkness.\n\n                                     DOC\n                              (hopefully)\n                         It's all right, Tim.

His almost imperceptible grimace is \n               not lost on Macreedy. Macreedy watches the young man as he \n               continues to light the lamps...\n\n                                     TIM\n                              (angrily)\n                         Lemme alone, I tell ya!\n\n               Doc slams the whiskey bottle down on a nearby table.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         I can't let you alone!

As he raises it to his mouth...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (to Pete, harshly \n                              guttural)\n                         It'll take a lot of whiskey to wash \n                         out your guts...\n\n               Pete is motionless, holding the glass inches from his lips, \n               hypnotized by Macreedy's voice, as hard and as cold as his \n               eyes...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         ...And it will never help -- not \n                         even a barrel full washes away murder!\n\n               Macreedy's hand shoots out, in a short, inexorable arc, \n               smashing his palm across the shot glass. The whiskey bursts \n               in a spray, the glass flies halfway across the room, \n               shattering as it lands against something solid. Pete is \n               stunned, Doc perplexed, at Macreedy's violence. They stare \n               at him...\n\n               Macreedy's eyes are murky. The creases between the brows \n               over his nose are deep. His nostrils move in and out with \n               his breathing. Pete and Doc regard him with growing \n               uneasiness. Rage comes into Macreedy's face, turning it a \n               painful red.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         But maybe I'm wrong. Go on -- drink.\n                              (scornfully)\n                         What else is left for you?!\n                              (mounting anger)\n                         You're as dead as Komako, only you \n                         don't know it!\n                              (roaring)\n                         You also don't know that it's not \n                         enough to feel guilty. It's not enough \n                         to confess. It's not enough to say, \n                         \"Forgive me, I've done wrong.\"\n\n                                     DOC\n                         Take it easy, Macreedy.

He shakes his head grimly and \n               then, with sudden decision, goes to the switchboard and plugs \n               in a line.\n\n                                     DOC\n                              (leaning over counter, \n                              staring at him)\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     PETE\n                              (into phone, ignoring \n                              Doc)\n                         Hello, Liz.

Doc takes a long, deep breath of \n               relief. Macreedy frowns thoughtfully. He strains to listen \n               to Liz, but all he (and we) can hear is the staccato jumble \n               of her words over the wire.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE - FAVORING PETE\n\n               he cuts Liz short...\n\n                                     PETE\n                              (into phone)\n                         I don't care about Smith!

Macreedy's, and mine.\n                              (again Liz answers \n                              and...)\n                         All right. Yeah... I've told him \n                         everything.\n\n               Slowly he replaces the phone on the switch-board. He comes \n               around from behind the desk, joining Macreedy and Doc.\n\n                                     PETE\n                              (flatly)\n                         She'll be here in five minutes.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         Thanks, Pete. Thanks very much.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - PETE, HECTOR AND DOC - NIGHT\n\n               Pete and Doc are nervously alert, drained of energy, waiting. \n               Hector is downright bored. He toys with his pistol, squinting \n               at it, twirling the barrel. Finding neither interest nor \n               pleasure in the piece, he jams it back in his holster and \n               strolls with exaggerated surety out on the porch.\n\n               EXT. PORCH - NIGHT\n\n               The congregation of loafers look up as Hector emerges. Imbued \n               with his own bullying importance, he draws the pistol, \n               maneuvers an extravagant pinwheel and a few other gaudy \n               tricks. Then he sighs as boredom again takes over. He walks \n               down the steps to catch a bit of air.\n\n               INT. LOBBY - DOC AND PETE\n\n               The disappearance of Hector (o.s.) down the street galvanizes \n               them into action. They hurry out of the lobby toward the \n               back of the hotel.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - BEHIND HOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               Vague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows. \n               The hotel's rear door is tightly shut. Around the far corner \n               of the street (extreme b.g.) comes the gangling body of Hector \n               David. He walks toward CAMERA. Perhaps twenty-five yards \n               away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HECTOR\n\n               His hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half \n               pack of cigarettes. Suddenly the movement is arrested; \n               something at the other end of the street captures his bleak \n               attention.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES\n\n               A jeep, headlights off, slowly turns the corner, pulls up to \n               the curb and parks.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE - HECTOR\n\n               pockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep, a \n               quizzical frown on his horsy face. He approaches the back \n               door of the hotel, oblivious to it as he continues toward \n               the jeep.\n\n               INT. REAR HALLWAY OF HOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               At the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded \n               light bulb burns dully. A slight figure stands in f.g. To \n               one side is a narrow U-shaped alcove blanketed in heavy \n               shadows. The features of the man in the hall and the slim \n               lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. With enormous \n               care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley \n               behind the hotel. Light thrown by the back windows reveals \n               that the figure is Pete. The same pallid light from the alley, \n               glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. Glued \n               as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is Doc. \n               He is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels \n               around which an old fire hose is wound. The heavy brass nozzle \n               of the hose hangs from the end.\n\n               Doc grips a twelve-inch length of lead pipe. Pete swallows \n               nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the \n               left. His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with \n               tension.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING PETE\n\n               as he stares at Hector walking toward the jeep.\n\n                                     PETE\n                              (controlling his \n                              jangled nerves)\n                         Hector!\n\n               Hector stops, turns to face Pete. He hesitates, then...\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         Hmmmm?\n\n               Then, with a final glance at the jeep, Hector lumbers to \n               Pete, who disappears inside the hallway.\n\n               INT. REAR HALLWAY\n\n               as Hector enters and stops. Pete quickly closes the door \n               behind him and walks toward the lobby, attempting to draw \n               Hector toward the black alcove center screen b.g. But Hector \n               is not to be sucked in. He glares at Pete, waiting. (NOTE: \n               The following dialogue is delivered sotto voce.)\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         What you want?\n\n                                     PETE\n                         He's still in his room. Macreedy, I \n                         mean.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         So...? You want me to tuck him in?\n\n                                     PETE\n                         I thought maybe you wanted to tell \n                         Smith.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                              (explaining something \n                              he feels Pete already \n                              knows)\n                         Smith said he'd be here at midnight. \n                         He don't want to be disturbed.\n\n               He jams a cigarette in his mouth. Pete watches him frantically \n               as he searches his pockets for a match. He can't find one.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         You got a match?\n\n                                     PETE\n                         Come on. I got some in the lobby.\n\n               He starts to turn. Hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion. \n               Before Pete can move, Hector reaches out, hooking two heavy \n               fingers inside a pocket of Pete's shirt. Slowly Hector's \n               expression changes to one of insidious cunning. His fingers \n               come out of Pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book \n               of matches.\n\n                                     HECTOR\n                         I thought you didn't have a match.\n\n               Pete is unable to answer. He is scared to death.\n\n               INT. ALCOVE - DOC\n\n               sweating with frustration. Hector is six feet away, and armed -- \n               too far away for Doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe. \n               Doc looks around vaguely, wildly, for another weapon. A \n               fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel. For a \n               split second he hesitates. Then slowly, with infinite care, \n               he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the \n               hose.\n\n               INT. REAR HALLWAY\n\n               Now Hector is alert. He studies Pete's twitching face. \n               Elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches it. \n               It takes fire, cupped in the rampart of his big hands. It \n               lights up the hall, and as Hector looks around he sees \n               something through a mirror -- over his shoulder and six feet \n               away Doc materializes out of the shadows of the alcove. As \n               Hector whirls, going for his gun, Doc swings the hose with \n               sudden deadly aim. It uncoils like a snake, and the brass \n               nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across Hector's skull. \n               Hector groans. He sinks unconscious to the floor. Doc stands \n               there, paralyzed by his action. Pete tears toward the lobby.\n\n               INT. LOBBY\n\n               as Pete rushes in. He moves directly to the desk, leans over \n               and presses the buzzer behind the desk three times. He turns \n               and runs back toward the rear of the building.\n\n               INT. REAR STAIRS\n\n               as Macreedy barrels down. He pauses briefly in the hall as \n               he sees Doc still standing with the hose and the nozzle \n               dangling like a pendulum from his hand. Their eyes lock \n               briefly in understanding...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (with a half smile)\n                         I'll never forgive you, Doc...\n                              (he gestures toward \n                              Hector, out cold)\n                         ...for depriving me of that pleasure.\n\n               He heads toward the alley.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY \n\n               as Macreedy rushes out. He pauses, looking quickly right, \n               then left. He sees a jeep parked at the curb far down the \n               street. He runs toward it. The jeep, its headlights off, \n               starts for him. He swings onto the moving vehicle, falling \n               heavily into the seat beside Liz Brooks. He slumps there, \n               breathing heavily as the jeep, with a grinding of gears, \n               cuts through the night, picking up speed.\n\n               INT. REAR HALLWAY \n\n               as Pete joins Doc. Silently, motionlessly, the two men stare \n               for a long moment at Hector -- particularly at the pistol \n               lying beside him. Then they look at each other, and the same \n               thought seems to flash in their minds...\n\n                                                            QUICK DISSOLVE:\n\n               EXT.

Solid \n               forms loom up in the darkness; they are unrecognizable, yet \n               Macreedy senses some tense familiarity with the terrain... \n               He frowns.

Macreedy bails out of the \n               jeep, still holding the girl.\n\n               CLOSE TWO SHOT - LIZ AND MACREEDY\n\n               as they fall to the earth. Macreedy pins her down. Then in \n               quick succession, four emphatically loud SHOTS from a rifle \n               squirt into the shale around them.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (harshly, through his \n                              teeth)\n                         You're stupid, Liz.

His grip on the \n               girl's shoulder is like a steel trap. He pushes her down \n               beside Komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a \n               SHOT rips the gravel at their feet. Pulling the girl with \n               him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave. \n               The jeep is between them and the headlights -- between them \n               and the source of the gunfire. Liz struggles to break away. \n               Suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him. A bullet smashes \n               into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt \n               into Macreedy's face. He gasps in pain, releasing Liz. He \n               rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind. \n               Liz breaks from the grave. Now, five yards from Macreedy... \n\n                                     LIZ\n                              (calling toward the \n                              headlights)\n                         Smitty!

A rattling noise rises from deep in her \n               throat, and then subsides.\n\n               In the silence the outline of Reno Smith emerges. Holding \n               his rifle at the ready, his silhouette illuminated sharply \n               in the twin beams of light, he climbs down the side of the \n               cliff. He looks toward the jeep and Macreedy, not once at \n               the girl at his feet.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                              (sadly, almost \n                              reproachfully)\n                         You shouldn't have done that...\n\n               Smith pays no attention to her. He advances inexorably with \n               rifle held at his hip. He fires at Macreedy.\n\n               EXT. GRAVE\n\n               Macreedy wipes the last of the fragments from his eyes. His \n               face is still streaked with dirt and shale. He turns, \n               searching for something, anything, to fight back with. Then \n               he remembers... Stiffening, his body set, his eyes narrow, \n               he moves purposefully toward the front of the jeep and crawls \n               under it. Again Smith opens up on him. Bullet after bullet \n               pours into the confined space, nicking the wall, ricocheting \n               off the jeep with a frightening, fluttery, wheezing sound. \n               The firing stops again and in the silence we HEAR a familiar \n               TRICKLE, as in running water...\n\n               EXT. RANCH - SMITH\n\n               re-loads his rifle. Stiffly, he starts slowly down over the \n               rocks toward his unarmed victim...\n\n               MACREEDY\n\n               He has unscrewed the nut and unconnected the gas line with \n               the carburator. A spurt of gasoline is running out. With a \n               quick motion he picks up an empty whisky bottle from the \n               litter-strewn earth. He fills it with gasoline, quickly screws \n               the nut back on. Now he sweeps his necktie free of his collar. \n               Holding it with his teeth, he tears the felt lining free \n               from its silk face. He twists half the lining inside the \n               bottle, knotting the other end securely around the bottle's \n               neck, leaving a long strand dangling.\n\n               EXT. RANCH - CLOSE SHOT - SMITH\n\n               moving rigidly toward the hole. He stops, levels his rifle, \n               fires.\n\n               EXT. GRAVE - MACREEDY\n\n               pinned down in the direct line of fire. The burst of the \n               rifle stops.\n\n               EXT. RANCH - SMITH\n\n               not more than twenty-five yards away, advancing carefully, \n               rifle at the ready.\n\n               EXT. GRAVE - MACREEDY \n\n               lights a match, placing the flame to the dangling end of the \n               tie. It catches. He flings himself to his feet and with the \n               same motion whips the fiery bottle like a football, hard and \n               straight toward Smith. Smith fires once, fast and wild. The \n               bottle crashes against the rocks at his feet and bursts with \n               a shattering explosion. Smith screams as the razor-sharp \n               slivers rip his flesh. In a puff of flame, his clothes ignite. \n               He drops the rifle and goes down, squirming frantically on \n               the black ashy ground.\n\n               EXT. RANCH - FULL SHOT \n\n               favoring Macreedy as he tears out of the hole. He hurls \n               himself at Smith. Wooden-faced, almost dreamy-eyed, he shovels \n               the ashy dirt over Smith's prone chest, putting out the fire. \n               Smith struggles halfway to his feet. Macreedy grabs his \n               shoulder, helping him up. Smith looks at Macreedy through \n               eyes bleary with fear and pain and shock.\n\n                                     SMITH\n                              (through his teeth)\n                         Go ahead -- kill me. Now.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         I'd like to kill you now, but you \n                         caused too much pain to die quickly.\n                              (a beat)\n                         You'll be tried in a court of law. \n                         You'll be convicted by a jury. Then \n                         you'll die.\n\n               He drives his right fist against Smith's chin. Smith's head \n               snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on \n               his chest. He collapses. Macreedy blows out his breath hard. \n               He staggers to Liz. As he bends over her...\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               EXT. BLACK ROCK - DAY (DAWN)\n\n               Liz's jeep, driven by Macreedy, rolls slowly down the empty \n               main street of the sleeping town. Behind him, under a tarp, \n               the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat. On the \n               seat beside him is Smith's rifle, the balance a few inches \n               from Macreedy's elbow. On the right front fender of the jeep \n               Smith sits precariously, his shirt scorched and ragged. He \n               wears a sullen expression of pained indifference.\n\n               In b.g., as the jeep passes, isolated lights go on, first in \n               Doc's house, then in two or three others. Macreedy is \n               oblivious to them.\n\n               EXT. JAIL - CLOSE SHOT - A MAN\n\n               almost completely hidden, looks out grimly from a corner of \n               the jail window. Protruding through the bars, swiveling to \n               follow the progress of the jeep down the street, is the long, \n               ugly muzzle of a rifle.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET - JEEP \n\n               as Macreedy pulls up to the curb in front of the jail and \n               cuts the ignition. He grabs the rifle, and steps around to \n               Smith.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (tonelessly, prodding \n                              Smith off the fender \n                              with his rifle)\n                         Hands behind your head.\n\n               Smith complies.\n\n               EXT. JAIL\n\n               as Macreedy marches Smith up the steps. The jail door opens. \n               A man emerges, wearing a Mackinaw over his vest and carrying \n               a rifle. It is Tim. For a moment Macreedy eyes him in silence. \n               His gun finger tightens on the rifle in his hand. Tim's rifle, \n               too, is at the ready...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (after a beat)\n                         Am I going to have trouble with you?\n\n                                     TIM\n                         Nope. But I sure thought the situation \n                         was going to be like reversed.

Macreedy turns slightly, to see \n               Doc huffing toward him. The older man climbs the jail steps \n               and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the \n               other of the two men in the stand-off.\n\n                                     DOC\n                              (to Macreedy)\n                         It's all right, Macreedy...\n\n               He pulls Tim's Mackinaw to one side, revealing the silver-\n               plated star pinned at the breast.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         Old Tim here's got his badge back.\n\n               Macreedy swings his rifle from Tim to Smith. Tim lowers his, \n               stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, \n               to enter the jail. He goes in, Doc following. Pete sits \n               silently at Tim's desk.\n\n               INT. JAIL\n\n               In one of the two cells are Coley and Hector. In the other, \n               Sam and Hastings.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (looking around)\n                         Well.

Even if Smith killed me for \n                         it.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (jerking his head \n                              toward Smith)\n                         Put him in with Hastings.\n\n               Tim turns his key in the cell door. Macreedy tiredly goes to \n               Pete at the desk.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                         Your sister's outside, Pete.\n\n               Pete rises. Macreedy halts him momentarily, gripping his \n               arm...\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (flatly)\n                         She's dead.\n\n               Pete walks dazedly out the door. Tim grabs Smith's shoulder \n               and propels him roughly through the cell door. He slams it \n               hard. As the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly...\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               EXT. HOTEL - BLACK ROCK - DAY\n\n               The townspeople, with Doc f.g., are gathered silently in the \n               street, staring sadly, dumbly at the hotel before them. Doc \n               wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative. The door \n               opens (o.s.) and the people look up, their eyes lighting \n               with expectancy.\n\n               WHAT THEY SEE\n\n               Macreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase. For a \n               moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people \n               in the street. In the distance we HEAR the horn of a stream-\n               liner. Macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching \n               crowd and heads for the railroad station. Almost immediately \n               Doc falls in step with him. The townspeople, still silent, \n               trail after them\n\n               MOVING SHOT - MACREEDY AND DOC\n\n               in f.g., the townspeople behind them. In b.g., as we pass, \n               we see the main street just as we saw it when Macreedy entered \n               town a few short hours ago.\n\n                                     MACREEDY\n                              (walking, after a \n                              beat, to Doc)\n                         Tim knows where to find me if I'm \n                         needed.\n\n               Doc nods.

It \n                         depends on the people.\n\n               A NOISE o.s. attracts Macreedy's attention. He turns, as do \n               Doc and the townsmen.\n\n               WHAT THEY SEE\n\n               In front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are Smith, \n               Coley, Hector, Sam and Hastings. Tim and four cops escort \n               them to two State Police cars which are parked beside Tim's \n               old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member \n               of the press). The newspaperman (WITHOUT A PRESS CARD IN HIS \n               HAT) stands to one side with Pete. Pete as well as Tim have \n               changed clothes; they look clean and trim. Coley has his arm \n               in a sling. Hector's hat hides the bandage on his head.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               Macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with \n               Doc at his side and the people behind him.

He walks on, to the platform. He pauses, \n               looking at the people silently in his wake and then at Doc. \n               He takes a black velvet-covered box from his pocket -- the \n               box containing the medal -- looks at it, and slowly hands it \n               to Doc.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         Thanks, Macreedy. Thanks for \n                         everything.\n\n               Macreedy turns and exits from SHOT. The people look after \n               him.\n\n               EXT.

PASSAGEWAY OF TRAIN\n\n               Macreedy and a conductor stand at the doorway. The town is \n               seen behind them and the people standing there.
