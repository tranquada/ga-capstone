The structure \n               is blistered by the resolute sun, the roof is weather-warped. \n               Dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the \n               foundation. Between the building and the tracks is a long, \n               somewhat narrow platform, its floorboards twisted by time, \n               termites and the elements. The match-board overhang of the \n               building, throwing some little shade to a portion of the \n               platform, sags and bellies. From the overhang is appended a \n               rectangular panel on which, in flaky paint, the town is \n               identified:\n\n<b>               BLACK ROCK\n</b>\n               One of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the \n               other, cocking the sign irregularly.\n\n               The railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon. Past \n               the town on each side stretches the ocean-like prairie, with \n               sand dunes rising and falling monotonously, shouldering each \n               other toward infinity. The morning sun lays over this \n               wasteland of the American Southwest, a gigantic yellow bruise \n               from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread \n               themselves over the poisoned sky.\n\n               A small shack stands next to the station, separated from it \n               by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building, \n               as if for support. The words POSTAL TELEGRAPH are arced across \n               its dusty vitrine. An old straight-backed chair, reinforced \n               with twisted wire, is tilted against the north-west corner \n               of the shack. In it is Mr. Hastings, the postal telegraph \n               agent, a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity. He \n               sits there spinelessly, fingering a wart on his receding \n               chin and, once in a while, for variety, rubbing a knuckle \n               under his watery nose.\n\n<b>               FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK\n</b>\n               The town is minute, dismal and forgotten, crouching in \n               isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects \n               a secondary dirt road. The twin strips of steel glisten in \n               the fierce sunlight, fencing the dreary plain from the false \n               fronts of the town. In b.g. is the bluff of a black stony \n               mountain. Against this ancient mass the houses of Black Rock's \n               single street*** (See map, P.2A) are scanty in number and \n               insignificant in architecture, a conglomerate paint-peeled \n               modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin \n               strips torn from signs.\n\n               The town and the terrain surrounding it have, if nothing \n               else, the quality of inertia and immutibility -- nothing \n               moves, not even an insect; nothing breathes, not even the \n               wind. Town and terrain seem to be trapped, caught and held \n               forever in the sullen, abrasive earth.\n\n<b>               OUT\n</b>\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n<b>               STRAIGHT SHOT - STREAMLINER\n</b>\n               jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert, its \n               diesel engines pounding. Its horn \"WONKS\" twice, blasting \n               the shatterable air.\n\n<b>               FULL SHOT - BLACK ROCK - ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\n               Nothing is changed, nothing is altered. But look close and \n               you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily \n               across the dirt and dust of the single street. HOLD for a \n               beat, then MAIN TITLE appears. Between the ensuing credits \n               INTERCUT a series of sharp LONG SHOTS. The composition of \n               each shot has that hard, sun-beaten texture of American \n               primitive painting -- pressurized in its simplicity -- best \n               exemplified, perhaps, by the work of Grant Wood.\n\n<b>               EXT. SAM'S SANITARY BAR AND GRILL - ANGLE ON DOC VELIE\n</b>\n               assayer and notary public, mortician to the citizens of Black \n               Rock who have departed to a better place, and veterinarian \n               to its lesser animals. An elderly, somewhat untidy gentleman, \n               he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the Bar &amp; Grill. \n               Idling with him are three or four other loafers, among them \n               Sam, the middle-aged proprietor of the restaurant. Doc glances \n               casually at his watch; no one else moves. The hot wind \n               continues listlessly down the empty street.\n\n<b>               OUT\n</b>\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n<b>               EXT. GARAGE - LIZ BROOKS\n</b>\n               A tall, attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton \n               shirt. She stands just outside the open barn-like door of \n               the garage, staring, from the compulsive force of habit, at \n               the endlessly receding tracks. The sultry wind, its gustiness \n               slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair.\n\n<b>               OUT\n</b>\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n<b>               EXT. PORCH OF HOTEL - COLEY TRIMBLE AND HECTOR DAVID\n</b>\n               two enormous men. HECTOR is tall, and there is about him a \n               nasty, raw-boned tautness; COLEY is more the anthropoid type -- \n               long thick arms and a round, iron casing of a belly. They \n               glance down the street, watching incuriously a dust devil \n               swirling in the wind.\n\n               Now the CAMERA has completed its probe of the town and its \n               denizens. MAIN TITLE and CREDITS are completed...\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - MR. HASTINGS\n</b>\n               still spineless in his chair, the chair still tilted against \n               the shack. From o.s. and far away, we hear the horn of the \n               streamliner -- two long \"WONKS\", a short and a long (engine \n               whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing). Hastings \n               straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming \n               train.\n\n<b>               STRAIGHT SHOT - STREAMLINER\n</b>\n               moving at tremendous speed.\n\n<b>               BRIDGE\n</b>\n               with train barrelling toward it. The horn BLASTS -- three \n               short WONKS (engine whistle signal for stopping at next \n               station).\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS\n</b>\n               getting jerkily to his feet, as though charged by a galvanic \n               current. The uncharacteristic speed of his movements throws \n               the tilted chair to the station platform. He raises an arm \n               to shield his watery eyes from the sun...\n\n<b>                                     HASTINGS\n</b>                              (almost inaudible, as \n                              if to himself)\n                         Stopping...?\n\n<b>               SHOT - TRAIN\n</b>\n               heading toward CAMERA, churning across the desert like a \n               juggernaut. It PANS past CAMERA in a blur of speed. CAMERA \n               SWINGS UP on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes \n               are applied. The wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails, \n               kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust. She cuts speed, \n               brakes hissing, and starts to slow down.\n\n<b>               LONG SHOT MAIN STREET - BLACK ROCK\n</b>\n               SHOOTING from rear of town, toward the railroad tracks. The \n               townspeople step out, frowning, cautious, disturbed. The \n               secure ritual of the train passing through, never stopping, \n               has somehow, for some unknown reason, been violated.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - DOC VELIE\n</b>\n               as his mouth tightens. His air of placidity vanishes, leaving \n               his features disturbed.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - LIZ BROOKS\n</b>\n               Her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly. Her eyes \n               are coated with a vague emptiness. She seems confused as she \n               halfturns toward the hotel.\n\n<b>               REVERSE SHOT - WHAT SHE SEES\n</b>\n               Coley Trimble and Hector David, standing on the porch of the \n               hotel. They seem tense, responding variously to what might \n               be fear. Coley's nostrils flare, his flat ugly mouth \n               compresses. He looks profoundly serious. Hector wipes a glob \n               of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HASTINGS\n</b>\n               as he stands in surprise, nervously alert, watching the train \n               as it comes to a complete stop. His jaw droops with the \n               slackness of fear.\n\n<b>               OUT\n</b>\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n<b>               EXT. STATION PLATFORM\n</b>\n               with the train stationary before it. A sleek steel door of a \n               pullman clangs open. A colored porter carrying a suitcase \n               walks down the wrought-iron steps. He is stately, gray-haired \n               and lean, with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate \n               with trainmen. The man behind him is big-shouldered, a granite-\n               like wedge of a man with calm, piercing eyes. There is about \n               him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor, but \n               his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber \n               familiarity with pain. His left arm hangs from his shoulder \n               with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis, while the hand is \n               hidden in his pocket.\n\n<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY AND PORTER\n</b>\n               The porter puts the suitcase on the platform. In the distance \n               the town and its people are seen staring silently, \n               motionlessly. The big man glances toward them. He smiles a \n               sad, distasteful greeting to the town, its wretched dust. \n               its mean, modest buildings. The porter disappears into the \n               train as the conductor enters scene. He turns slowly, \n               following Macreedy's gaze...\n\n<b>                                     CONDUCTOR\n</b>                              (softly, staring at \n                              the towns people)\n                         Man. They look woebegone and far \n                         away.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (looking around)\n                         I'll only be here twenty-four hours.\n\n<b>                                     CONDUCTOR\n</b>                         In a place like this, it could be a \n                         lifetime.\n                              (turning to face \n                              Macreedy)\n                         Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.\n\n               Macreedy nods his thanks. The conductor signals the engineer \n               (o.s.) and steps on the train. The diesel's claxon blasts \n               the torrid air ominously. The train slowly, smoothly, begins \n               to move, picking up speed. The cars slip past until, quite \n               suddenly, the Streamliner is gone. For a moment Macreedy \n               watches it. Then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of \n               cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free \n               of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the \n               empty pack, drops it beside the tracks. He takes a cardboard \n               book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with \n               agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the \n               head against the sandpaper guard. The match flares, the \n               cigarette is lit. Macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns \n               to pick up his suitcase. Then he sees Hastings, who walks \n               slowly, almost painfully, to him. His Adam's apple grapples \n               protestingly with his collar. After a moment he controls it \n               sufficiently to talk...\n\n<b>                                     HASTINGS\n</b>                         You for Black Rock?\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (easily)\n                         That's right.\n\n<b>                                     HASTINGS\n</b>                              (uneasily)\n                         There must be some mistake.

He feels the eyes of everyone following \n               him, glaring at him. He halts, looks around. The townspeople \n               continue to eye him brazenly, yet with an almost animal \n               incuriosity. He grins and walks on past a cluster of five or \n               six RFD mail boxes and a road sign [1], its paint peeling, \n               its face punctured by three or four bullets from a drunk's \n               pistol long ago.\n\n<b>               SHOT - MACREEDY\n</b>\n               heading toward the hotel. In b.g. is a relatively small farm \n               equipment yard compressed between a general store (which \n               Macreedy has just passed) and the hotel just ahead. In the \n               yard are a few tractors, and among them huddles a tiny office. \n               It is empty; the front window is thick with dust. On it, \n               etched by an anonymous, childish finger, is a skull and \n               crossbones. Running diagonally across is the printed legend:\n\n<b>               T.J. HATES J.S.\n</b>\n               Macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement. \n               He walks on, reaching the facade of the weather-beaten hotel. \n               A gust of wind swirls down the street, momentarily engulfing \n               Macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool. \n               As it subsides...\n\n<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE - MACREEDY\n</b>\n               As he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel. It has \n               a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side. Macreedy \n               mounts the hotel steps. At the top of the steps Coley Trimble \n               and Hector David watch him silently. Hector is large and \n               leanly muscular, yet Coley looms over him like a battleship. \n               He is a gross behemoth of a man, with sharp flinty eyes the \n               size of glistening pinpoints and a slack, oversized jaw. \n               Both men wear modern Western work clothes, but there is one \n               incongruous accessory which Hector affects. Around his thick \n               wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately \n               tooled leather strap -- a cheap reproduction of one of those \n               expensive Swiss timepieces which, among many distinguished \n               accomplishments, tells the day of the week, the month of the \n               year, the phase of the moon, etc., etc.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (slowing up)\n                         'Afternoon.\n\n               No reaction from Hector.\n\n<b>                                     COLEY\n</b>                              (blocking doorway)\n                         Anything I can do for you?\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                         You run this hotel?\n\n<b>                                     COLEY\n</b>                         No.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (pleasantly)\n                         Then there's nothing you can do for \n                         me.\n\n               He brushes past Coley and enters.\n\n<b>                                     HECTOR\n</b>                              (turning to Coley)\n                         Find Smith!\n\n               Coley nods and heads down the street.

HOTEL\n</b>\n               It is a typical small town hotel, but crummier, with a tiny \n               lobby. Macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as Hector strolls \n               in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair. \n               He picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on Macreedy. \n               Macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk. For a moment, \n               he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from \n               the ink-splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those \n               World War II banners, the imitation silk now stained and \n               faded. It depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching The \n               Flag in a claw. Under it, the legend:\n\n<b>                                   \"GOD BLESS AMERICA\"\n</b>\n               Near it, a tacky placard proclaims:\n\n<b>               DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN, \n</b><b>               BY ALL THE MEANS YOU CAN, \n</b><b>               IN ALL THE WAYS YOU CAN, \n</b><b>               AT ALL THE TIMES YOU CAN, \n</b><b>               TO ALL THE PEOPLE YOU CAN, \n</b><b>               AS LONG AS EVER YOU CAN.\n</b>\n               Feeling the eyes of Hector on him, Macreedy turns. Hector \n               meets his gaze with bland, insolent interest. Now a young \n               man (his name is PETE) comes out of a small room behind the \n               registration desk and walks up to it. There is a softness \n               about his regular features, a certain indefinable sugariness \n               about his mouth. He seems tight-lipped, for lorn and uneasy \n               as he faces Macreedy across the counter.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (pleasantly)\n                         I'd like a room.\n\n<b>                                     PETE\n</b>                         All filled up.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (a beat)\n                         Got any idea where I might --\n\n<b>                                     PETE\n</b>                              (stiffly, shaking his \n                              head)\n                         This is 1945, mister.

The clerk reaches out to close it. Gently, yet firmly, \n               Macreedy stops him, reopening the big book. He studies it, a \n               finger straying unconsciously inside his collar.

Macreedy smiles and walks toward the door; Pete, \n               Doc et al watching him. He goes out.\n\n<b>               EXT. STREET\n</b>\n               As Macreedy walks down hotel steps, a station wagon pulls up \n               just before him. Tied with a rope to the right front fender \n               is a magnificent eight-point buck. A stain of dry blood weaves \n               an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable \n               bullet hole in his shoulder. Two men get out of the car; one \n               of them is Coley Trimble. He sees Macreedy coming toward \n               him. He stands motionless in the center of the narrow \n               pavement, picking at his nose with the detachment of a child. \n               The other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings \n               out from behind the wheel. He walks around the car, joining \n               Coley at the curb. Macreedy comes on. The man with Coley \n               looks at the stranger with colossal indifference, as \n               expressionless as the soil of Black Rock. His handsome face, \n               under a dusty hunting cap, is taut and hard and wind-shaven. \n               Next to Coley he stands motionless, except for the wisp of \n               smoke from a black Cuban cigarette between his thin lips. In \n               b.g., the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby \n               move out the door and stand on the porch. They watch Macreedy, \n               Coley and Reno Smith, the handsome, taut-faced man. Silence \n               soems to settle over everything. It is Macreedy who breaks \n               it...\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (grinning wearily at \n                              Coley)\n                         Here we go again.\n\n               Gently he walks around Coley and Reno Smith and continues \n               down the street. Coley's eyes follow him. Smith goes up the \n               steps of the hotel and enters the lobby. Coley quickly follows \n               him. The loafers on the porch go back inside.\n\n<b>               INT. HOTEL LOBBY\n</b>\n               The loafers resume their familiar places as Smith walks \n               briskly to the clerk's desk. Pete, in anticipation, opens \n               the hotel register, places it before Smith\n\n<b>                                     PETE\n</b>                              (deferentially, \n                              gesturing toward the \n                              open register)\n                         That's all I know about him, Mr. \n                         Smith.\n\n               Smith doesn't answer; he looks up thoughtfully.

On one \n               of the barnlike walls a boy of nine is drawing laboriously \n               with a piece of chalk. He puts the last flourish to a skull \n               and crossbones identical with that seen earlier on the window \n               of the equipment yard office.

A morass of \n               bottles, all sizes and shapes, some of them broken. Macreedy \n               halts momentarily beside the well. Reaching out he touches \n               the warped sun-beaten boards that cover the mouth. He removes \n               one, and, picking up a pebble, drops it through the opening. \n               There is a long beat and then, from far, far below we HEAR a \n               faint PLUNK (o.s.). He replaces the board and walks to a \n               broken wall. He touches the burned out frame of a picture. \n               The frame falls to the ground, leaving an un-scorched square \n               on the surface of the wall. He goes past a solitary standing \n               stone chimney.

He steers the big car within a \n               foot or two of the jeep. The terrain has steepened; on the \n               right there is nothing between the road and the valley floor \n               far below but a few inches of soft shoulder.\n\n               As Macreedy pulls wide on a razor turn, Coley tries to come \n               inside him.

He \n               floorboards the Packard. Like some monstrous battering ram, \n               the heavy car smashes into the jeep's rear bumper, kicking \n               the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead.

He swings the jeep off the road, \n               onto the declivity. The car plunges downward, miraculously \n               upright. Macreedy jockeys it to a whirring, shuddering halt \n               in the soft sand at the bottom of a draw.\n\n               Macreedy turns slightly and looks up the mountain-side with \n               the road at its summit...\n\n<b>               WHAT HE SEES: EXTREME LONG SHOT - COLEY\n</b>\n               standing at the edge of the road, peering down at him.

Macreedy climbs in behind the wheel as Doc \n               comes out and stands on the small back porch.\n\n               Macreedy turns on the ignition switch. His foot kicks over \n               the starter, but the spark doesn't catch. He tries again, \n               then again. He pauses, frowns, as Doc comes down from the \n               porch and joins him.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (concentrating on the \n                              dashboard)\n                         Won't start.\n\n<b>                                     DOC\n</b>                              (nervously, to Macreedy)\n                         Something wrong?\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                         Just won't start...\n\n               Again he presses the ignition switch. Nothing. And suddenly, \n               in b.g., the great bulk of Hector David looms up, leaning \n               against the porch pillar at the corner of the alleyway. His \n               expression is almost dreamy. For a moment he stands there \n               while Macreedy toys with the ignition and the sick engine \n               wheezes and grinds.

As he passes Coley, Coley takes \n               his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. \n               The two men face each other.\n\n<b>                                     COLEY\n</b>                         If I tied both hands...?\n\n               Macreedy shakes free of Coley's grasp. Coley lunges. His big \n               right fist streaks toward Macreedy's face. Macreedy ducks, \n               weaving with the punch. He grabs Coley's belt, twisting \n               Coley's body. The momentum of the swing throws Coley off \n               balance. As he goes past Macreedy, the stranger tugs at his \n               belt, twisting him to one side. He plants his left foot firmly \n               on the toes of Coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring \n               Coley in place. He chops the under side of his open hand in \n               a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under Coley's ear. \n               With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard \n               against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose. The \n               cartilage shatters. Blood spills down his face. Following \n               through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone. \n               Macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind-burned face, \n               finding Coley's right wrist. He jerks the wrist out and \n               backward. It snaps. Coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain \n               and perplexity. His body lolls forward. Macreedy steps back. \n               He raises his right shoulder a few inches. His bent right \n               arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. \n               Fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber \n               shoulder giving them motion. The fist strikes Coley's face, \n               covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of \n               his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. Coley shuts his \n               eyes and falls unconscious.\n\n               Smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches Coley fall. \n               He takes half a step toward him. Macreedy looks at Smith. \n               Smith stops. Macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of \n               sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth. Working \n               methodically, Macreedy frisks Coley. He takes from a pocket \n               a long, ugly knife. He snaps the spring and the four-inch \n               blade leaps into place. He looks at the knife in his hand \n               and then at Smith.

At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring change \n               into a slot machine. It whines, grinds, and clicks with \n               rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off. In the \n               chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off. He works \n               hard and with some concentration, removing the other.

For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Tim \n               stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non-\n               committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up \n               now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of \n               slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his \n               preoccupation with the three men in the lobby.\n\n               Macreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his \n               collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette. \n               Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him, \n               flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too, \n               feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the other \n               of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so \n               haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his \n               suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of something \n               better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for \n               support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from \n               his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out \n               to Tim. Tim takes a drink.\n\n               The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that \n               day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fierce \n               light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery \n               dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver has \n               tarnished with the darkness.\n\n<b>                                     DOC\n</b>                              (hopefully)\n                         It's all right, Tim.

Then he sighs as boredom again takes over. He walks \n               down the steps to catch a bit of air.\n\n<b>               INT. LOBBY - DOC AND PETE\n</b>\n               The disappearance of Hector (o.s.) down the street galvanizes \n               them into action. They hurry out of the lobby toward the \n               back of the hotel.\n\n<b>               EXT. ALLEY - BEHIND HOTEL - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Vague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows. \n               The hotel's rear door is tightly shut. Around the far corner \n               of the street (extreme b.g.) comes the gangling body of Hector \n               David. He walks toward CAMERA. Perhaps twenty-five yards \n               away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - HECTOR\n</b>\n               His hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half \n               pack of cigarettes. Suddenly the movement is arrested; \n               something at the other end of the street captures his bleak \n               attention.\n\n<b>               WHAT HE SEES\n</b>\n               A jeep, headlights off, slowly turns the corner, pulls up to \n               the curb and parks.\n\n<b>               BACK TO SCENE - HECTOR\n</b>\n               pockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep, a \n               quizzical frown on his horsy face. He approaches the back \n               door of the hotel, oblivious to it as he continues toward \n               the jeep.\n\n<b>               INT. REAR HALLWAY OF HOTEL - NIGHT\n</b>\n               At the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded \n               light bulb burns dully. A slight figure stands in f.g. To \n               one side is a narrow U-shaped alcove blanketed in heavy \n               shadows. The features of the man in the hall and the slim \n               lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. With enormous \n               care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley \n               behind the hotel. Light thrown by the back windows reveals \n               that the figure is Pete. The same pallid light from the alley, \n               glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. Glued \n               as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is Doc. \n               He is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels \n               around which an old fire hose is wound. The heavy brass nozzle \n               of the hose hangs from the end.\n\n               Doc grips a twelve-inch length of lead pipe. Pete swallows \n               nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to the \n               left. His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with \n               tension.\n\n<b>               EXT.

But Hector \n               is not to be sucked in. He glares at Pete, waiting.

Hector's pig eyes are slits of suspicion. \n               Before Pete can move, Hector reaches out, hooking two heavy \n               fingers inside a pocket of Pete's shirt. Slowly Hector's \n               expression changes to one of insidious cunning. His fingers \n               come out of Pete's pocket, and between them is a paper book \n               of matches.\n\n<b>                                     HECTOR\n</b>                         I thought you didn't have a match.\n\n               Pete is unable to answer.

Hector is six feet away, and armed -- \n               too far away for Doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe. \n               Doc looks around vaguely, wildly, for another weapon. A \n               fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel. For a \n               split second he hesitates. Then slowly, with infinite care, \n               he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the \n               hose.\n\n<b>               INT.

He studies Pete's twitching face. \n               Elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches it. \n               It takes fire, cupped in the rampart of his big hands. It \n               lights up the hall, and as Hector looks around he sees \n               something through a mirror -- over his shoulder and six feet \n               away Doc materializes out of the shadows of the alcove. As \n               Hector whirls, going for his gun, Doc swings the hose with \n               sudden deadly aim. It uncoils like a snake, and the brass \n               nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across Hector's skull. \n               Hector groans. He sinks unconscious to the floor. Doc stands \n               there, paralyzed by his action. Pete tears toward the lobby.\n\n<b>               INT. LOBBY\n</b>\n               as Pete rushes in.

He pauses briefly in the hall as \n               he sees Doc still standing with the hose and the nozzle \n               dangling like a pendulum from his hand.

He runs toward it. The jeep, its headlights off, \n               starts for him. He swings onto the moving vehicle, falling \n               heavily into the seat beside Liz Brooks.

Macreedy bails out of the \n               jeep, still holding the girl.\n\n<b>               CLOSE TWO SHOT - LIZ AND MACREEDY\n</b>\n               as they fall to the earth. Macreedy pins her down.

His grip on the \n               girl's shoulder is like a steel trap. He pushes her down \n               beside Komako's grave, hugging the side of the jeep as a \n               SHOT rips the gravel at their feet. Pulling the girl with \n               him, he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave. \n               The jeep is between them and the headlights -- between them \n               and the source of the gunfire. Liz struggles to break away. \n               Suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him. A bullet smashes \n               into the flowers, exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt \n               into Macreedy's face. He gasps in pain, releasing Liz. He \n               rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind. \n               Liz breaks from the grave.

Blood trickles from the corner \n               of her pretty mouth. A rattling noise rises from deep in her \n               throat, and then subsides.\n\n               In the silence the outline of Reno Smith emerges. Holding \n               his rifle at the ready, his silhouette illuminated sharply \n               in the twin beams of light, he climbs down the side of the \n               cliff. He looks toward the jeep and Macreedy, not once at \n               the girl at his feet.\n\n<b>                                     LIZ\n</b>                              (sadly, almost \n                              reproachfully)\n                         You shouldn't have done that...\n\n               Smith pays no attention to her. He advances inexorably with \n               rifle held at his hip. He fires at Macreedy.\n\n<b>               EXT. GRAVE\n</b>\n               Macreedy wipes the last of the fragments from his eyes. His \n               face is still streaked with dirt and shale. He turns, \n               searching for something, anything, to fight back with. Then \n               he remembers... Stiffening, his body set, his eyes narrow, \n               he moves purposefully toward the front of the jeep and crawls \n               under it. Again Smith opens up on him. Bullet after bullet \n               pours into the confined space, nicking the wall, ricocheting \n               off the jeep with a frightening, fluttery, wheezing sound. \n               The firing stops again and in the silence we HEAR a familiar \n               TRICKLE, as in running water...\n\n<b>               EXT. RANCH - SMITH\n</b>\n               re-loads his rifle.

A spurt of gasoline is running out. With a \n               quick motion he picks up an empty whisky bottle from the \n               litter-strewn earth. He fills it with gasoline, quickly screws \n               the nut back on. Now he sweeps his necktie free of his collar. \n               Holding it with his teeth, he tears the felt lining free \n               from its silk face. He twists half the lining inside the \n               bottle, knotting the other end securely around the bottle's \n               neck, leaving a long strand dangling.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He flings himself to his feet and with the \n               same motion whips the fiery bottle like a football, hard and \n               straight toward Smith. Smith fires once, fast and wild. The \n               bottle crashes against the rocks at his feet and bursts with \n               a shattering explosion. Smith screams as the razor-sharp \n               slivers rip his flesh. In a puff of flame, his clothes ignite. \n               He drops the rifle and goes down, squirming frantically on \n               the black ashy ground.\n\n<b>               EXT. RANCH - FULL SHOT \n</b>\n               favoring Macreedy as he tears out of the hole. He hurls \n               himself at Smith. Wooden-faced, almost dreamy-eyed, he shovels \n               the ashy dirt over Smith's prone chest, putting out the fire. \n               Smith struggles halfway to his feet. Macreedy grabs his \n               shoulder, helping him up. Smith looks at Macreedy through \n               eyes bleary with fear and pain and shock.\n\n<b>                                     SMITH\n</b>                              (through his teeth)\n                         Go ahead -- kill me.

Smith's head \n               snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on \n               his chest. He collapses. Macreedy blows out his breath hard. \n               He staggers to Liz.

Behind him, under a tarp, \n               the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat. On the \n               seat beside him is Smith's rifle, the balance a few inches \n               from Macreedy's elbow. On the right front fender of the jeep \n               Smith sits precariously, his shirt scorched and ragged. He \n               wears a sullen expression of pained indifference.\n\n               In b.g., as the jeep passes, isolated lights go on, first in \n               Doc's house, then in two or three others.

Tim lowers his, \n               stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, \n               to enter the jail. He goes in, Doc following. Pete sits \n               silently at Tim's desk.\n\n<b>               INT. JAIL\n</b>\n               In one of the two cells are Coley and Hector.

Even if Smith killed me for \n                         it.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                              (jerking his head \n                              toward Smith)\n                         Put him in with Hastings.\n\n               Tim turns his key in the cell door. Macreedy tiredly goes to \n               Pete at the desk.\n\n<b>                                     MACREEDY\n</b>                         Your sister's outside, Pete.\n\n               Pete rises.

Tim grabs Smith's shoulder \n               and propels him roughly through the cell door. He slams it \n               hard. As the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly...\n\n<b>                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Doc \n               wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative. The door \n               opens (o.s.) and the people look up, their eyes lighting \n               with expectancy.\n\n<b>               WHAT THEY SEE\n</b>\n               Macreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase. For a \n               moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people \n               in the street. In the distance we HEAR the horn of a stream-\n               liner. Macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching \n               crowd and heads for the railroad station. Almost immediately \n               Doc falls in step with him.

It \n                         depends on the people.\n\n               A NOISE o.s. attracts Macreedy's attention. He turns, as do \n               Doc and the townsmen.\n\n<b>               WHAT THEY SEE\n</b>\n               In front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are Smith, \n               Coley, Hector, Sam and Hastings. Tim and four cops escort \n               them to two State Police cars which are parked beside Tim's \n               old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member \n               of the press). The newspaperman (WITHOUT A PRESS CARD IN HIS \n               HAT) stands to one side with Pete. Pete as well as Tim have \n               changed clothes; they look clean and trim. Coley has his arm \n               in a sling. Hector's hat hides the bandage on his head.\n\n<b>               BACK TO SCENE\n</b>\n               Macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with \n               Doc at his side and the people behind him.

He walks on, to the platform. He pauses, \n               looking at the people silently in his wake and then at Doc. \n               He takes a black velvet-covered box from his pocket -- the \n               box containing the medal -- looks at it, and slowly hands it \n               to Doc.\n\n<b>                                     DOC\n</b>                         Thanks, Macreedy. Thanks for \n                         everything.\n\n               Macreedy turns and exits from SHOT. The people look after \n               him.\n\n<b>               EXT.
