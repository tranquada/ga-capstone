They'll \n                         think to themselves - \"Something's wrong \n                         here. We've been duped. This is not \n                         according to form.

In return for which, Shangri-La \n                         has much to give you. You are still, \n                         by the world's standards, a youngish \n                         man.

Here, \n                         however, in Shangri-La, by our standards \n                         your life has just begun, and may go \n                         on and on.\n<b>                                      \n</b><b>                         CONWAY\n</b><b>                                     \n</b>                         But to be candid, Father, a prolonged \n                         future doesn't excite me. It would have \n                         to have a point. I've sometimes doubted \n                         whether life itself has any.

No, I'd need a much \n                         more definite reason for going on and \n                         on.\n<b>                                      \n</b><b>                         HIGH LAMA\n</b><b>                                     \n</b>                         We have reason. It is the entire meaning \n                         and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to \n                         me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw \n                         all the nations strengthening, not in \n                         wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and \n                         the will to destroy. I saw their machine \n                         power multiply until a single weaponed \n                         man might match a whole army. I foresaw \n                         a time when man, exulting in the technique \n                         of murder, would rage so hotly over \n                         the world that every book, every treasure, \n                         would be doomed to destruction. This \n                         vision was so vivid and so moving that \n                         I determined to gather together all \n                         the things of beauty and culture that \n                         I could and preserve them here against \n                         the doom toward which the world is rushing.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                                              \n</b>                         (pause)\n<b>                                     \n</b>                         Look at the world today!

What madness there is, \n                         what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! \n                         A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity \n                         crashing headlong against each other, \n                         propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. \n                         The time must come, my friend, when \n                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality \n                         and the lust for power must perish by \n                         its own sword. Against that time is \n                         why I avoided death and am here, and \n                         why you were brought here. For when \n                         that day comes, the world must begin \n                         to look for a new life. And it is our \n                         hope that they may find it here.
