No, you wouldn't say that. \n                         They don't count.\n                                      \n                         GEORGE\n                                     \n                         You'd better try to get some sleep, \n                         Bob.\n                                      \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. \n                         Can't you just see me, Freshie, with \n                         all those other shrewd, little Foreign \n                         Secretaries?\n                                      \n                         (confidentially - screws up face)\n                                     \n                         You see, the trick is to see who can \n                         out-talk the other. Everybody wants \n                         something for nothing, and if you can't \n                         get it with smooth talk, you send an \n                         army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. \n                         I'm not going to have an army. I'm going \n                         to disband mine. I'm going to sink my \n                         battleships - I'm going to destroy every \n                         piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy \n                         approaches we'll say, \"Come in, gentlemen \n                         - what can we do for you?\" So then the \n                         poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. \n                         And what will they think, Freshie? They'll \n                         think to themselves - \"Something's wrong \n                         here. We've been duped. This is not \n                         according to form.

He built Shangri-La, taught \n                         our natives, and began our collection \n                         of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father \n                         Perrault.\n                                      \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         When was all this?\n                                     \n                         CHANG\n                                     \n                         Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I \n                         think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled \n                         into the Valley, half frozen to death. \n                         It was typical of the man that, one \n                         leg being frozen, and of course there \n                         being no doctors here, he amputated \n                         the leg himself.\n                                      \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         (shocked)\n                                     \n                         He amputated his own leg?\n                                     \n                         ? 519 ?\n                                     \n                         CHANG\n                                     \n                         Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had \n                         learned to understand their language, \n                         the natives told him he could have saved \n                         his leg. It would have healed without \n                         amputation.\n                                      \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         Well, they didn't actually mean that.\n \n                                                              \n                         CHANG\n                                     \n                         Yes, yes. They were very sincere about \n                         it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect \n                         health is the rule here. They've never \n                         known anything different. So what was \n                         true for them they thought would naturally \n                         be true for anyone else living here.\n \n                                                              \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         Well, is it?\n                                     \n                         CHANG\n                                     \n                         Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly \n                         so in the case of Father Perrault himself. \n                         Do you know when he and the natives \n                         were finished building Shangri-La, he \n                         was 108 years old and still very active, \n                         in spite of only having one leg?\n                                      \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         108 and still active?\n                                     \n                         CHANG\n                                     \n                         You're startled?\n                                     \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         Oh, no.

In your countries, \n                         on the other hand, how often do you \n                         hear the expression, \"He worried himself \n                         to death?\" or, \"This thing or that killed \n                         him?\"\n                                      \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         Very often.\n                                     \n                         CHANG\n                                     \n                         And very true.

Who had that \n                         brilliant idea?\n                                      \n                         HIGH LAMA\n                                     \n                         Sondra Bizet.\n                                     \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         (secretly pleased)\n                                     \n                         Oh, the girl at the piano?\n                                     \n                         HIGH LAMA\n                                     \n                         Yes. She has read your books and has \n                         a profound admiration for you, as have \n                         we all.\n                                      \n                         ? 532 ?\n                                     \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         Of course I have suspected that our \n                         being here is no accident. Furthermore, \n                         I have a feeling that we're never supposed \n                         to leave. But that, for the moment, \n                         doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet \n                         that when it comes. What particularly \n                         interests me at present is, why was \n                         I brought here? What possible use can \n                         I be to an already thriving community?\n \n                                                              \n                         HIGH LAMA\n                                     \n                         We need men like you here, to be sure \n                         that our community will continue to \n                         thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La \n                         has much to give you. You are still, \n                         by the world's standards, a youngish \n                         man. Yet in the normal course of existence, \n                         you can expect twenty or thirty years \n                         of gradually diminishing activity. Here, \n                         however, in Shangri-La, by our standards \n                         your life has just begun, and may go \n                         on and on.\n                                      \n                         CONWAY\n                                     \n                         But to be candid, Father, a prolonged \n                         future doesn't excite me. It would have \n                         to have a point. I've sometimes doubted \n                         whether life itself has any. And if \n                         that is so, then long life must be even \n                         more pointless. No, I'd need a much \n                         more definite reason for going on and \n                         on.\n                                      \n                         HIGH LAMA\n                                     \n                         We have reason. It is the entire meaning \n                         and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to \n                         me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw \n                         all the nations strengthening, not in \n                         wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and \n                         the will to destroy. I saw their machine \n                         power multiply until a single weaponed \n                         man might match a whole army. I foresaw \n                         a time when man, exulting in the technique \n                         of murder, would rage so hotly over \n                         the world that every book, every treasure, \n                         would be doomed to destruction. This \n                         vision was so vivid and so moving that \n                         I determined to gather together all \n                         the things of beauty and culture that \n                         I could and preserve them here against \n                         the doom toward which the world is rushing.\n \n                                                              \n                         (pause)\n                                     \n                         Look at the world today! Is there anything \n                         more pitiful? What madness there is, \n                         what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! \n                         A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity \n                         crashing headlong against each other, \n                         propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. \n                         The time must come, my friend, when \n                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality \n                         and the lust for power must perish by \n                         its own sword. Against that time is \n                         why I avoided death and am here, and \n                         why you were brought here. For when \n                         that day comes, the world must begin \n                         to look for a new life. And it is our \n                         hope that they may find it here. For \n                         here we shall be with their books\n \n                                                              \n                         ? 533 ?\n                                     \n                         and their music and a way of life based \n                         on one simple rule: Be Kind.\n                                      \n                         (pause)\n                                     \n                         When that day comes, it is our hope \n                         that the brotherly love of Shangri-La \n                         will spread throughout the world.\n \n                                                              \n                         (pause)\n                                     \n                         Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured \n                         each other, the Christian ethic may \n                         at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall \n                         inherit the earth.\n                                      \n                         A long silence ensues during which Conway, \n                         so engrossed is he in all he has just \n                         heard, scarcely notices the Lama, who \n                         has risen slowly and now stands before \n                         him.

He comes to a spot \n                         where a man and a woman are tilling \n                         the soil, and stops to watch them. The \n                         man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes \n                         a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway \n                         also bows. The woman curtsies prettily \n                         and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in \n                         acknowledgement.\n                                      \n                         He is in a cheerful frame of mind and \n                         continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING \n                         WITH HIM. He greets several other people. \n                         Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff \n                         their hats. Conway does likewise.\n \n                                                              \n                         EXT.

FULL SHOT\n                                     \n                         Conway is walking along a street in \n                         the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare, \n                         unlike anything we have ever seen before. \n                         The small, one-story huts along its \n                         very narrow sidewalk are of singularly \n                         varied architecture - giving the impression \n                         of being \"homemade.\" As a result of \n                         this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic \n                         about them is similar - their cleanliness. \n                         Something about the atmosphere is fresh \n                         and wholesome and peaceful. In front \n                         of several of the huts native women \n                         sit - some weaving on a tapestry board, \n                         some nursing babies, some asleep, and \n                         some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.\n \n                                                              \n                         228. MED.

As he passes, \n                         the women smile at him in the most friendly \n                         fashion. From inside these homes, soft \n                         and soothing music emanates. At the \n                         end of the street, Conway finally arrives \n                         at a garden spot. The suddenness of \n                         this is startling, too - because of \n                         its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway \n                         throws himself at the foot of an overhanging \n                         tree, and leans against the trunk.\n \n                                                              \n                         ? 535 ?\n                                     \n                         229.

They're waiting for \n                         us five miles outside the valley. Come \n                         on, get your things together.
