We hear  wind\nas we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.\n\nWe DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker\nworld of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The\nrotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach\na fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing\nbuzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity\nfrom the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as\nwe approach the fissure.\n\n                             WOMAN (V.O.)\n\n           \"Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em.\"\n\n                              MAN (V.O.)\n\n    \"I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it!\"\n\nWe hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a  police\nscanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora.\n\n                             NIOBE (V.O.)\n\n     \"Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One.'\"\n\n                              MAN (V.O.)\n\n             \"Oooh, our savior.

Hold on!\"\n\nThe azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tight\nconvoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling\nnearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into\nthe sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue\nglow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the\nfirst and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables,\nis the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward,\nslowing as they reach the top of the arc.\n\n                             NIOBE (V.O.)\n\n                             \"Woo-hoooh!\"\n\nThe rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB  flails\nwildly between them.\n\n                              MAN (V.O.)\n\n                        \"They're still on us!\"\n\nMore vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES  pours\nup onto the surface.\n\n\nINT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT\n\nThe NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facing\nbackwards.  TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  Thomas\nAnderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from\nthem, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.\n\nIt's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEO\u0092S POWERS   and\nthe defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the\ninterior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and\nstressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their\nknocked-out ship.\n\n                      MORPHEUS is on a headset.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                      \"Niobe, they\u0092re closing.\"\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n                             \"How many?\"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n              \"Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred.\"\n\n\nINT. SEPHORA COCKPIT\n\nNIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her  ship\nwith her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as\nthey streak over the dark surface.\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n               \"You\u0092ve got a gift for understatement.\"\n\n\nINT. FREEDOM COCKPIT\n\nTHE  FREEDOM\u0092S CAPTAIN,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying\nblind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBE\u0092S ship.\n\nHis lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen.\nAs she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  WHITE RABBIT\ntattoo is conspicuous.\n\nThey switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.\n\n                                 MAN\n\n       \"Oh shit, we\u0092re screwed. We gotta set down and EMP \u0091em.\"\n\n                             NIOBE (V.O.)\n\n                             \"Too many!\"\n\n\nEXT. FREEDOM HULL\n\nA racing SQUIDDIES  reaches the hull  and latches on,  striking up its\ncutting laser and ripping into the hull.\n\n\nINT. SEPHORA COCKPIT\n\n                              MAN (V.O.)\n\n                 \"They\u0092re on me! Shit! Losing power!\"\n\nNIOBE\u0092S Lieutenant, a muscular Asian woman, Circa, notes something  on\na console.\n\n                                CIRCA\n\n                      \"Multiple bogies closing!\"\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n                              \"No shit.\"\n\n                                CIRCA\n\n                          \"From the front!\"\n\nNiobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. Several  objects\nare closing in fast.\n\n                                CIRCA\n\n                            \"Are they - \"\n\nShe doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters\nlaunch a massive  volley of missiles.  From afar, they  look like dark\nirises  surrounded by  a corona  of flame.  At first,  we can't   tell\nexactly what they  are, until their  fiery trails rip  straight at the\nSEPHORA cockpit.\n\nCIRCA DUCKS as the missiles harmlessly streak by.\n\n\nINT. NEB COCKPIT\n\nA massive  swarm off  missiles blasts  by the  cockpit. The individual\nwarheads  swerve  at  the last  second,  blowing  SQUIDDIES apart,  or\ncasting them to the ground aflame.\n\n\nINT. SEPHORA COCKPIT\n\nNiobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a\nwing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek,  with\nhuge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to\nthe teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n                           \"They're ours.\"\n\n                         DEFENDER ONE (V.O.)\n\n          \"Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning.\"\n\n\nEXT. THE SURFACE\n\nThe wing  of DEFENDERS  makes short  work of  the squiddies.  The half\ndozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull  are picked off by well-placed  laser\nshots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag. The\nsquiddies that survive turn tail and run.\n\n\nINT. NEB COCKPIT\n\nThe crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave\nthe scene of aerial carnage behind them.\n\nNEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He\nrelaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  enters\na cave, and starts  to descend. The blue  wash of the ship  shows rock\nwalls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back  into\nthe earth.\n\nTANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.\n\n                                 TANK\n\n                            \"We're home.\"\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n          \"Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen.\"\n\n                                 NEO\n\n                            \"What's that?\"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n \"A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion. The fighters that\n              just saved us constitute the first ring.\"\n\n                             NIOBE (V.O.)\n\n                    \"Neb crew, you can relax now.\"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n       \"For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home.\"\n\n                                                              FADE OUT\n\nand\n\nFADE INTO:\n\nTRINITY'S  CABIN.  At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway\ndiamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the\ndarkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork\nterminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more\nhospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles\nshe's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An\nunfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of\nloved ones.\n\nSoftly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is\nsitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him\nwith her head on his lap.\n\nNeo can\u0092t sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo\nof the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing\nas they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch,\nEpoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an\nunknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.\n\nGently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the\nphoto.\n\n                             She awakens.\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n           \"I'll have to take that one down now.

Trinity sits up,\n                              awakening.\n\n                                 NEO\n\n                          \"Was he like me?\"\n\n                            TRINITY nods.\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n      \"Not you, though. Like you.

MAIN DECK, NEB\n\nThe crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  to\na rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank   unlocks\nthe main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into   the\ntarmac with a resounding smash.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\nEXT. ZION TARMAC\n\nThe tarmac  is a  busy, crowded  military airport,  with hovercraft of\ndifferent  sizes  spread  across  the  lot.  Its  housed  poorly  lit,\nhouses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site.  Crewpersons run\naround,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles.  Munitions  are  carted\nacross the tarmac on   robot rolling racks. No  one  pays the NEB  and\nits battered crew any mind.\n\nNearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM  are parked. Their engines shut  down,\nand their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out.\n\nNIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but\ntheir  military manner  is quickly  restored, though  they can  barely\ncontain their grins.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                              \"Niobe...\"\n\n              SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.\n\n                                 \"M.\"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                       \"Thanks for the rescue.\"\n\n   THEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps\n                            between them.\n\n    It's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier.\n    Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in MORPHEUS' face.\n\n                                 CHOI\n\n \"Brough, you us your asses!

Get on your bikes and fucking ride!\"\n\nHIS gang burst to their feet. They scramble through the dunes, heading\nfor their bikes.\n\nA HELICOPTER, seen only by it\u0092s massively strong search lamp, and  the\nwind from its  rotors blowing sand  everywhere, flies up  and over the\ndunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet.\n\nGREGORY mounts his bike and CHANDRA jumps on back. WITH A WAVE OF  HIS\nHAND, all  the bikes,  his included,  drop into  neutral and  rev into\nstart. Their  headlights blaze  as the  helicopter returns,  joined by\nanother.\n\n                         CHOPPER LOUDSPEAKER\n\n       \"THIS IS THE POLICE, STOP YOUR VEHICLES AND SURRENDER!\"\n\nSUDDENLY, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters.

HIGHWAY\n\nTHE pack splits  up in two  directions as the  distant choppers circle\nback. GREGORY cuts the lights on  his bike and follows the highway  by\nstarlight.\n\n\nINT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT\n\nTINNY RADIO chatter fills the  red-lit cockpit over the steady  hum of\nthe  engines. The  nose of  the chopper  points to  the ground  as  it\nfocuses on GREGORY and CHANDRA, who are ripping down the highway.\n\nCU on the cockpit instruments, centered on the airspeed indicator. The\nneedle is pushing to the max, going through 150 knots.\n\n                             PILOT (V.O.)\n\n                   \"Holy shit, he\u0092s outrunning us.\"\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY\n\nGREGORY is pasted down to the  tank of his bike with CHANDRA  gripping\nhim for her life. The slipstream pulls his lips open and tears  streak\nfrom his eyes as his bike redlines in fifth gear. The helicopters grow\nsmaller behind them. They break chase.\n\nCHANDRA looks back and sees the lights turn away. She screams over the\nwind and the roar.\n\n                               CHANDRA\n\n                           \"They\u0092re gone!\"\n\n               GREGORY is staring down a dark highway.\n\n                               GREGORY\n\n                          \"Can\u0092t see shit.\"\n\nHE turns the headlights  back on, just in  time to see a  ROADBLOCK of\nheavy duty military trucks. In front  of the trucks is a sandbag  wall\nmanned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if  one\nlooks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of AGENTS standing to  the\nside.\n\nTHE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run\nfrantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal\nflying at 150 miles per hour.\n\nGREGORY  plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked\ntrucks. The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags. THEY\u0092RE\nTHROUGH, but the bike scissors  uncontrollably, until it rolls and  we\ndrop into bullet-time.\n\nAS the bike goes  over, we watch from  the side as GREGORY  dismounts,\ngrabbing CHANDRA as he  steps over onto the  safe side of the  bike. A\n\nmassive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a\nbullet  falling  through syrup,  and  GREGORY keeps  walking  over the\nrotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and  CHANDRA against\nthe flesh-ripping concrete.\n\nTHE bike is coming apart  as it\u0092s bashed against the  concrete. Pieces\nrise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers,\nand a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air,\ncarrying GREGORY  and CHANDRA  up. Holding  her to  him - she\u0092s barely\nconscious of the lightning-fast  crash, GREGORY rides the  flying body\nwith one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into  real\ntime.\n\n\nTHE  bike\u0092s body  streaks along  the highway.  The sparks  fade as  it\nslows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them.\nThey  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  GREGORY crouching  over\nCHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them.\n\nSTUNNED,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and\nCHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND  them is a blurry wall of  red\nand blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder.\n\nTHEY start running down the  highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA  to a\nstop.\n\n                               GREGORY\n\n                   \"Split up, into the desert, go!\"\n\n                             THEY split.\n\nCU on CHANDRA. In bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road. The\nhighway is  littered with  pieces of  the bike,  and she  stomps on  a\ntwisted piece of metal  that impales her bare  foot. She falls to  the\nasphalt with a scream.\n\nGREGORY turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is\nbearing down on them, it\u0092s V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD.\n\nGREGORY drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high\nbeams. He  drops over  CHANDRA, ducks  his head  and extends  his hand\ntoward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME.\n\nTHE CRUISER  runs into  his hand  and stops  as though  it hit a steel\npost. The hood crumples  in the center, pushing  the grill in even  as\nthe front quarter  panels of the  unibody continue around  GREGORY and\nCHANDRA.\n\n\nINT. CRUISER\n\nTHE ENGINE smashes in through  the console, pushing the cops  apart as\nthe glass windshield explodes and  their seats slide forward into  the\nconsole, smashing them like jelly.\n\n\nCU: GREGORY AND CHANDRA\n\nWITH  HIS  HAND  still  on  the  grille,  CHANDRA  AND  GREGORY remain\nuntouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. WE drop\nback into REAL  time and see  the cruiser\u0092s body  rip over and  around\nthem. The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission\nremain still against  GREGORY\u0092S HAND. The  cruiser was gutted,  like a\nbanana shot down the center from top to bottom. It speeds beyond them,\nsilent now, flips and explodes.\n\nTHE ENGINE block is suspended a few  feet in the air. It drops to  the\nground with a thud.\n\nGREGORY and CHANDRA get to their  feet and run into the early  morning\ndesert.\n\n\nCU: GUTTED CRUISER\n\nUNBELIEVABLY, the driver is still alive... barely. The steering  wheel\nis smashed deep  into his mouth,  splitting his jaw  open. Wet, broken\nchokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. His eyes flicker, and just\nbefore they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he MORPHS.\n\n\nEXT. GUTTED CRUISER\n\nTHE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked out  of the frame. WE SEE a  black loafer\nstep from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out\nslowly.\n\nWE rise  up from  the loafer.  As the  other cruisers  catch up to the\nscene of the accident, AGENT BROWN watches.

With SMITH pinned  below him, he  slams his palm\ndownward. SMITH\u0092S head dodges the blow that pummels the ground.\n\nGREGORY is  screaming as  he smashes  downward with  the palms  of his\nheels.

He flips onto his  back\nas GREGORY returns. The  sheer force of his  street-forged roundhouses\nknock SMITH around  as he blocks.  Growing irritated at  the untrained\nattack, SMITH turns a block into a palm-heel that hits GREGORY in  the\nforehead with  the force  of a  cannon blast.  Momentarily stunned, he\nsteps back enough for SMITH to perform a roundhouse kick. It\u0092s like  a\nhelicopter blade, smashing into GREGORY\u0092S head and sending him to  the\nground in a heap.\n\n                                SMITH\n\n                     \"Ready to change your mind?\"\n\nCU: GREGORY\n\nHE can\u0092t  respond very  well.

PLAZA\n\nNEO struggles to  fly, and as  he does, he\u0092s  pulling a stalagtite  of\nblack suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet.\n\nCU: NEO\n\n\nHIS face  is wide  with fear  and shock.  He can\u0092t  climb anymore, and\nlooks back down at the mountain  of agents he\u0092s pulling into the  air.\nHis face  clenches shut  as a  scream wells  from deep  within him. He\nstarts to glow, and we jump back to see:\n\nA MASSIVE orange, spherical shock  wave blasts away from his  body. It\nrebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts  the\nSmiths away, leaving him clean.\n\nEVERYTHING slows down  as NEO, exhausted,  tumbles out of  the sky. On\nhis way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward\nfrom the  concussion. NEO  hits the  ground, bounces,  and lies still,\nsprawled,  as people  drop all  around him,  piling up,  like Satan\u0092s\nsnowfall.\n\n\nEXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) DAY\n\nTHE sky and Matrix are still  frozen. TRINITY and CHOI make their  way\nalong cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. They pause  behind\na dumpster, and  just before looking  out, there\u0092s the  sound of metal\ntapping metal, twice.\n\nTRINITY looks in  the direction of  the sound. MORPHEUS  and NIOBE are\nstanding still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. TRINITY  AND\nCHOI make their way to them.\n\nTRINITY peeks  cautiously around  the edge.  On the  other side of the\nstreet is a phone booth.\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n                            \"Is it clear?\"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                         \"I smell an ambush.\"\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n                         \"Me too. Too quiet.\"\n\n                   CHOI grips his gun and grimaces.\n\n                                 CHOI\n\n           \"Too quiet? The world is frozen. I\u0092ll go first.\"\n\n                        NO one likes the idea.\n\nREAL-TIME suddenly returns.  The lightning bolts  in the sky  suddenly\nre-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them  jump\nout of their skulls. The sounds of the city suddenly flood back.\n\nON THE street, people stir to  their feet. Everyone is confused as  to\nwhat happened.\n\n\nEXT. PLAZA\n\nIT\u0092S a sea of the dead. From its center, NEO emerges, soaked in blood,\ngagging and  gasping for  breath. He  stumbles over  them. Shocked and\ncrazed, he glimpses the Metacortex building. It\u0092s in one piece  again,\nunharmed.\n\nHe falls against  a smashed corporate  art sculpture. He  picks a cell\nphone up from the ground and dials.\n\n                                 NEO\n\n                         \"Morpheus, pick up.\"\n\nWe hear nothing but static.  Disgusted, NEO throws the phone  away. He\nfalls against the sculpture and looks up. Coming around the corner  of\nthe building is a group of agents and soldiers.\n\nNEO  sinks down,  staring at  his hands.  He catches  his breath  and\nconcentrates.  The  blood  disappears,  and he  dons  the  suit  of an\nanonymous soldier in black. His face, too, seems to change.\n\nHE stands and walks away. We only see his back.\n\n\nEXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\nTHEY weigh their options. Finally, MORPHUES gives the nod to CHOI.\n\n\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                                \"Go.\"\n\nCHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are  lots\nof people on the streets now. Everyone\u0092s in shock over what  happened,\nand the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city.\n\n                                 CHOI\n\n\"And remember, kids, when you\u0092re in a war, never volunteer yourself!\"\n\nHE walks out  onto the street,  eyeing the phone  booth and everything\nelse. A  gorgeous Asian  businesswoman stumbles  into him. Recognition\nlights up her face and she stops him.\n\n                                WOMAN\n\n          \"Choi? Oh my God, I haven\u0092t seen you for months.\"\n\n       CHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth.\n\n                     \"Oh yeah, sorry about that.\"\n\n                           SHE turns angry.\n\n         \"Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?\"\n\n\nEXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nTRINITY is looking around the corner. She pulls back into the alley.\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n                \"Casanova just ran into an old flame.\"\n\n\nEXT.

Tears are welling in her enraged face.\n\n\"Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - \"\n\nInexplicably, CHOI  hangs his  trench coat  on the  side of the booth.\nStanding behind it, he reaches  around with his arm, keeping  the coat\nbetween his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesn\u0092t even notice the  web\nof gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering  the\ninside of the jacket.\n\n                                WOMAN\n\n  \" - you\u0092ll tell me why you don\u0092t call, why you, you, what are you\n                               doing?\"\n\n                                 CHOI\n\n\"The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss\n                            me for luck.\"\n\nHE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.\n\nCU: PHONE\n\nHis hand grabs the phone. We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one\nof the  numbers of  the keypad.  The number  tone rises  in pitch to a\ncrescendo. WE pull back and:\n\nTHE BOOTH EXPLODES. CHOI and the woman are bowled over by the flame.\n\n\nEXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nThey take  cover from  the blast  as people  all over  the street  are\nknocked flat.\n\n\nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nTHE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated.  Miraculously, CHOI and the woman  are\nstill under the cover of  the jacket. THROWING the smoking  jacket off\nthem, CHOI screams in agony as  he grasps the smoldering stump of  his\nright shoulder. The arm is history.\n\nTHE WOMAN looks on,  her eyes as wide  as dinner plates. Shaking,  she\nfalls back, still staring.\n\n                                 CHOI\n\n                         \"You weren\u0092t lucky.\"\n\nMORPHEUS, NIOBE, and TRINITY rush to him, picking him up on his  feet.\nCHOI is  screaming and  laughing. Someone  grabs his  smoldering coat,\ndragging it along. CHOI stares at the ex-flame as they cart him  away.\nHis eyes are crazy.\n\n                                 CHOI\n\n              \"You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!\"\n\nAS they struggle down the street, CHOI starts to walk more on his own.\nPEOPLE run from the scene, screaming.\n\n                        CU - the four of them.\n\nMORPHUES looks  at something  off-screen and  frowns. HE  pulls to the\nleft.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                             \"This way.\"\n\nTANKS and  TROOPS are  filling into  the street  ahead of them, coming\nfrom around the corner.\n\nTHEY turn onto a different  street. This street, too, is  filling with\ntroops. Worse, it\u0092s being lead by AGENT BROWN.\n\n                                NIOBE\n\n                         \"Tanks, or agents?\"\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n                               \"Tanks.\"\n\n                                 CHOI\n\n                         \"Yeah, tanks a lot.\"\n\nThey break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the  street\nwith the tanks.\n\nCU: TANKS\n\nTHREE ABRAMS stop in the  street. Their turrets swing into  place with\nterrifying quickness and precision.\n\nAT ONCE,  they open  fire with  their main  cannons and machines guns.\nFIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of  lead\ndown the street.  Troops filed between  the tanks pull  their triggers\nand don\u0092t let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away,\nas though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose.\n\nWITH UNEARTHLY  SPEED, EVERYONE  BREAKS for  the sides  of the street,\nexcept for CHOI. He stands amid  it all as the tracers come  closer to\nhis body. He raises his machine  gun with his good arm, and  lays into\nthe enemy.\n\nTRACER rounds kick away from  his gun, ripping straight back  into the\nwall  of soldiers.  His rounds  deflect off  the sloped  armor of  the\ntanks, recoils pile into the flesh  of troops. He rakes his fire  into\nthe enemy bodies.\n\nCU: CHOI\n\nTRACERS zoom in on  him. A tank round  blasts by, and the  wall of air\nkicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed\nby  another, blasts  through the  middle of  his body.  More and  more\nbullets smack into  him, blasting chunks  of meat and  viscera out the\nback.\n\n\nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) DAY\n\nTRINITY and NIOBE  take one side  of the street,  running and shooting\nsimultaneously. THEY reach  the buildings on  the side and  NIOBE goes\nSTRAIGHT UP THE FA\u00c7ADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to\ncover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets.\n\nON  THE  OTHER side  of  the street,  MORPHEUS  goes straight  up  the\nbuilding  fa\u00e7ade  and  starts  running  sideways,  completely  defying\ngravity, firing downward at the soldiers.\n\nCU: CHOI\n\nHE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his  body\napart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,  and\ntorso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his\nmachine gun, barrel  smoking, spinning in  the air, firing  still. The\narm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger. It is  the\nlast piece of CHOI to fall.\n\nMORPHEUS climbs  as he  runs. In  mid-stride he  changes magazines and\nstops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.\n\nOn the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing  at\nthe mass of troops with two  guns that never cease. THERE is  no cover\nand  no reprieve  from the  DOUBLE DEATH  from above.  Most are  still\nfiring down the street, or over toward TRINITY.\n\nTRINITY runs  up the  side of  the street.  Her guns  go empty and she\ndives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.\n\nCU: SOLDIER\n\nIn slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade. Somehow, the  metal\nring reaches TRINITY\u0092S ears.\n\nCU: TRINITY\n\nShe slaps a magazine into her  pistol, pulls the action and comes  out\nfrom under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade.\nShe fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group of\nsoldiers, flattening them to the ground.\n\nA  BULLET smacks  through TRINITY\u0092S  wrist, and  the hand  comes off,\npopping like the head off  a dandelion. Blood spurts from  the severed\narteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.\n\nABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND  NIOBE leap for one another.  They catch\neach other\u0092s arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin in\nplace, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast  upward\nwith their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple.\nMORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down.\n\nTHEY land amidst  the carnage. TRINITY  emerges, shaken, pressing  her\ncoat to her arm.\n\n\nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nThe other end of the street fills with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN.\n\nCU: AGENT BROWN\n\nHE surveys the  scene, and immediately  draws and fires,  running full\nbore for the rebels.\n\nMORPHEUS, Niobe and TRINITY are too close to the tanks to be fired on,\nbut the nearest one lunges at them. They climb up over concrete stoops\nand over  the side  of the  tank. They  sprint down  the street as the\ntanks turn their turrets behind them, searching.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                         \"The garage, hurry!\"\n\nTHEY dive behind a corner as  a tank fires. Morpheus throws the  woman\nforward as the tank round hits  the edge of the building, blowing  the\nconcrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder. Perhaps a  ton\nof rubble falls on Morpheus\u0092 legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe and\nTrinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble. Niobe shoots the\nlock off a steel door, and they pile into the building.\n\n\nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nAGENT BROWN  and his  men rush  into position  around the building the\nrebels are hiding in.\n\n\nSuddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine  starts, and as we stare  at\nthe  garage door,  it explodes  outward. A  jet-black, hyped  COUNTACH\nexplodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up\nsmoke. It cuts through a few  soldiers, hitting them in the knees,  as\nit rips up the street, the throttle going way too high.\n\n\nINT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nTHE street scene spins before them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a  broken\nand dusty MORPHEUS sitting next to  her. The tach is redlining as  the\ncar rips up the street. Pedestrians dive for cover.\n\nTRINITY holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed.\n\n                               \"Shift.\"\n\nMORPHEUS does so,  and the tires  squeal again when  she releases into\nsecond, then  third. In  a few  seconds they\u0092re  over 60  on the  busy\nstreet.\n\n\nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nSoldiers pick themselves up  just in time to  hear another engine -  a\nsuper powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen.\nA wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the\nrear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. There isn\u0092t\neven time to take a shot until she\u0092s gone.\n\n\nINT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nTHEY rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up\nthe breakdown lane.  Once they hit  a straightaway Trinity  floors it,\nand the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars.\n\nMORPHEUS grabs his twisted, folded legs. He was literally poured  into\nthe seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the\nbroken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.\n\n             The legs reform into straight, strong limbs.\n\n                      MORPHEUS grabs the wheel.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n              \"Keep your foot on the gas. Heal thyself.\"\n\nTRINITY pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. Her face tightens,  and\nshe closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world  out,\nwhich  is  good,  as  they suffer  constant  close  calls  as Morpheus\ncontrols the wheel from his awkward spot.\n\nWhen she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. With BOTH hands.\n\nMORPHEUS pulls out  his cell and  tries the line.  It\u0092s still full  of\nstatic.\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n                             \"Any luck?\"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n               \"None. They\u0092ve killed city-wide comms.\"\n\n                               TRINITY\n\n         \"Then the agents are out of touch with each other.\"\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n  \"They can\u0092t track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our\nexits, and find the Neb. We\u0092ll try the desert.

HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nNIOBE\u0092s bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over\n100 miles  per hour.  The wheely  bar is  folded up  against the  rear\nwheel. A dual  stream of vehicles  spit by her  like giant machine-gun\nbullets. She zooms out of view.\n\n\nEXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nGREGORY slows from a run. He looks back as police cars and  ambulances\nrace toward  the Metacortex  building. He  can\u0092t shake  what he\u0092s just\nwitnessed. He looks forward, only to run into:\n\n                             AGENT SMITH\n\n             GREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions.\n\n                               GREGORY\n\n                    \"What the fuck just happened?\"\n\n                                SMITH\n\n         \"We need you, Gregory.

APARTMENT BUILDING (MATRIX) - DAY\n\nTHE building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that\nno sane person could find attractive. The humble place is home to  THE\nORACLE.\n\nNEO exits an  elevator. Recomposed and  dressed normally, he  walks up\nand down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in.\n\nA tall black woman, one of the Oracle\u0092s priestesses, comes out of  the\nstairwell and recognizes NEO.\n\n                              PRIESTESS\n\n                                \"Neo.\"\n\nHE turns  and looks  at her.  She smiles,  but as  Neo looks at her, a\nflash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the\nsmile returns.\n\n                              PRIESTESS\n\n                 \"The Oracle is anxious to see you.\"\n\nNEO follows her into the familiar apartment. The windows are  covered,\nand NEO and the priestess are the only ones there. The Priestess moves\ninto the dark kitchen.\n\nNEO\u0092s eyes  adjust to  the darkness.  He hears  something squish as he\nsteps, and looks down.\n\nThe tattered rug  is a swamp  of dark, congealing  liquid. NEO reaches\ndown and touches it with his fingertips. It\u0092s half-dried blood.\n\nHe stands, his eyes adjusted to  the dark now. The walls are  chipped,\ncovered in bullet holes.\n\nIn slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. In walks  AGENT\nBROWN. NEO turns to the  kitchen. AGENTS SMITH and JONES  appear.

Gripping\nGregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down. The  ground\nrushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper.

Choking, unable to\nbreath with the rebar through him, he writhes. There\u0092s nothing for him\nto grab to pull himself off the steel.\n\nHis eyes clenched  shut, Gregor levitates,  by force of  will, pulling\nhis body off the rebar.  The corrugated bars make wet,  sucking sounds\nas the pull through his body.  Finally, he gets to a twisted  piece of\nbar, and can\u0092t make it over. He\u0092s losing all his breath, all his  life\nforce, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest.\n\nWITH one  last, wiggling  effort, he  works it  through him.

Instead,  it slices  cleanly\nthrough the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.\n\nRAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over\nMorpheus as  he pursues  the agent.  Smith rolls  backwards, gains his\nfooting, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death. He  turns to\nMorpheus:\n\n                                RAZOR\n\n                                \"Go!\"\n\n\nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT\n\nRAZOR is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.\n\n\nEXT. REST STOP\n\nHALF-DEAD MORPHEUS drags NIOBE to the booth.\n\nBehind them, Agent Smith backs away from RAZOR\u0092S dual blades, on long,\none short. Whenever Razor attacks,  Smith backs away. They circle  one\nanother.\n\n                MORPHEUS puts Niobe through the phone.\n\n                      RAZOR forces Smith around.\n\n                                RAZOR\n\n              \"Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor.\"\n\nSMITH frowns  and moves  forward, but  the whistling  edge of  a blade\nmakes him  think twice.  RAZOR holds  the short  sword parallel to the\nground, the long sword straight up. He hides his eyes behind the short\nsword.\n\nSMITH\u0092s back is against the sunset. The sun drops below a cloud.\n\nRAZOR flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into Smith\u0092s\neyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.\n\nSMITH, blinded, turns and backs away. RAZOR attacks.\n\nIN the  booth, Niobe  is gone.  MORPHEUS hangs  up the  phone. He  can\nbarely stand up enough to reach the handset. When it rings he picks it\nup. But he doesn\u0092t disappear.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                             \"Reload me.\"\n\n\nINT.

MORPHEUS\u0092 3-D  avatar flashes  on a  console,\nalong with a massive array of weapons.\n\n\nEXT. BOOTH (MATRIX) - SUNSET\n\nMORPHEUS disappears for a second, then reappears. Now he is  perfectly\nclean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and  kicks\nthrough  the remains  of the  booth, walking  toward the  fight as  he\nproduces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat.\n\nRAZOR keeps  swinging at  SMITH -  and missing.  Seeing his chance, he\nruns back for the ringing  phone. SMITH pursues, almost on  RAZOR when\nthe neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  sword\nafter another, like a helicopter blade from Hell.\n\nIN the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smith\u0092s\noutstretched fingers, sending them  flying. The long sword  grazes his\nforearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh.\nThe tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off,\ndigging about an inch into his torso.\n\nSMITH collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust. He\ndoesn\u0092t try to get up.\n\nRAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.  Razor\ngoes  through first.  MORPHEUS keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked on\nSMITH, who  makes no  attempt to  pursue. He  stands calmly,  and in a\ndignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheus\nstep into the booth, and replace the phone.\n\nIt rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith.\n\nSMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,  taking\nadvantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy.\n\nSMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first\nanger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  He\u0092s lost.  He\u0092ll  be  in  the Matrix\nforever.\n\nWith a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the\nrookie cop.\n\nTHE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badly\nsliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at\nthe carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in\nshock. He focuses on Morpheus.\n\nThe rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his  body\nbroken and his mind blown.\n\n\nINT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT\n\nCIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the interface chair. Razor is triumphant.\n\n                                RAZOR\n\n   \"Did you see that? We beat him! A fucking agent! He gave up!\"\n\nMORPHEUS, unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n                           \"Where is Neo?\"\n\n                                CIRCA\n\n \"Haven\u0092t heard from him.

He\npushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at  an\nincredible rate. It\u0092s obvious Morpheus can handle computers.\n\n                               MORPHEUS\n\n               \"I found him once.

PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (MATRIX) - NIGHT\n\nThe apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a\nleather couch, watching  whatever on the  tube with the  sound off. He\nabsentmindedly  manipulates a  quarter over  and around  his fingers.\nFinally, he stops and looks at the quarter.\n\nHolding it between his  thumb and forefinger, he  folds it in half  as\nthough it was a disk of bubble  gum. He folds it again, then rools  it\nas though it\u0092s a musket ball.\n\nChandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch.
