We hear  wind\nas we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.\n\nWe DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker\nworld of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The\nrotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach\na fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing\nbuzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity\nfrom the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as\nwe approach the fissure.\n\n<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)\n</b>\n           \"Six o'clock, 300 meters.

Hold on!\"\n\nThe azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tight\nconvoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling\nnearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into\nthe sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue\nglow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the\nfirst and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables,\nis the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward,\nslowing as they reach the top of the arc.\n\n<b>                             NIOBE (V.O.)\n</b>\n                             \"Woo-hoooh!\"\n\nThe rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second.

A massive army of SQUIDDIES  pours\nup onto the surface.\n\n\n<b>INT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT\n</b>\nThe NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit   facing\nbackwards.  TRINITY,  MORPHEUS,  TANK,  and  NEO,  the  former  Thomas\nAnderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from\nthem, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.\n\nIt's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEO\u0092S POWERS   and\nthe defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the\ninterior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and\nstressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their\nknocked-out ship.\n\n                      MORPHEUS is on a headset.\n\n<b>                               MORPHEUS\n</b>\n                      \"Niobe, they\u0092re closing.\"\n\n<b>                                NIOBE\n</b>\n                             \"How many?\"\n\n<b>                               MORPHEUS\n</b>\n              \"Just a few.

FREEDOM COCKPIT\n</b>\nTHE  FREEDOM\u0092S CAPTAIN,  a silhouette  in a  dark cockpit,  is flying\nblind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBE\u0092S ship.\n\nHis lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen.\nAs she does, we see her  bare shoulder fall into view, a  WHITE RABBIT\ntattoo is conspicuous.\n\nThey switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.\n\n<b>                                 MAN\n</b>\n       \"Oh shit, we\u0092re screwed.

From afar, they  look like dark\nirises  surrounded by  a corona  of flame.  At first,  we can't   tell\nexactly what they  are, until their  fiery trails rip  straight at the\nSEPHORA cockpit.\n\nCIRCA DUCKS as the missiles harmlessly streak by.\n\n\n<b>INT. NEB COCKPIT\n</b>\nA massive  swarm off  missiles blasts  by the  cockpit. The individual\nwarheads  swerve  at  the last  second,  blowing  SQUIDDIES apart,  or\ncasting them to the ground aflame.\n\n\n<b>INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT\n</b>\nNiobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a\nwing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek,  with\nhuge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to\nthe teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.\n\n<b>                                NIOBE\n</b>\n                           \"They're ours.\"\n\n<b>                         DEFENDER ONE (V.O.)\n</b>\n          \"Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning.\"\n\n\n<b>EXT. THE SURFACE\n</b>\nThe wing  of DEFENDERS  makes short  work of  the squiddies.  The half\ndozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull  are picked off by well-placed  laser\nshots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag. The\nsquiddies that survive turn tail and run.\n\n\n<b>INT. NEB COCKPIT\n</b>\nThe crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave\nthe scene of aerial carnage behind them.\n\nNEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He\nrelaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  enters\na cave, and starts  to descend. The blue  wash of the ship  shows rock\nwalls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back  into\nthe earth.\n\nTANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.\n\n<b>                                 TANK\n</b>\n                            \"We're home.\"\n\n<b>                               TRINITY\n</b>\n          \"Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen.\"\n\n<b>                                 NEO\n</b>\n                            \"What's that?\"\n\n<b>                               MORPHEUS\n</b>\n \"A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion.

At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway\ndiamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the\ndarkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork\nterminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more\nhospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles\nshe's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An\nunfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of\nloved ones.\n\nSoftly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is\nsitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him\nwith her head on his lap.\n\nNeo can\u0092t sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo\nof the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing\nas they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch,\nEpoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an\nunknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.\n\nGently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the\nphoto.\n\n                             She awakens.\n\n<b>                               TRINITY\n</b>\n           \"I'll have to take that one down now.

In front  of the trucks is a sandbag  wall\nmanned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if  one\nlooks closely enough, they  can see a pair  of AGENTS standing to  the\nside.\n\nTHE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they  run\nfrantically to get  out of the  way of the  bike, 800 pounds  of metal\nflying at 150 miles per hour.\n\nGREGORY  plows  into the  sandbag  wall, directly  between  two parked\ntrucks. The wall parts in  an explosion of sand and  sandbags.

A\n\nmassive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a\nbullet  falling  through syrup,  and  GREGORY keeps  walking  over the\nrotating surface, using  the bike to  protect him and  CHANDRA against\nthe flesh-ripping concrete.\n\nTHE bike is coming apart  as it\u0092s bashed against the  concrete. Pieces\nrise slowly into the air -  the front wheel, the forks, the  mufflers,\nand a million flakes  of metal, until the  body bounces into the  air,\ncarrying GREGORY  and CHANDRA  up. Holding  her to  him - she\u0092s barely\nconscious of the lightning-fast  crash, GREGORY rides the  flying body\nwith one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into  real\ntime.\n\n\nTHE  bike\u0092s body  streaks along  the highway.  The sparks  fade as  it\nslows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them.\nThey  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  GREGORY crouching  over\nCHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them.\n\nSTUNNED,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and\nCHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND  them is a blurry wall of  red\nand blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder.\n\nTHEY start running down the  highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA  to a\nstop.\n\n<b>                               GREGORY\n</b>\n                   \"Split up, into the desert, go!\"\n\n                             THEY split.\n\nCU on CHANDRA.

She falls to  the\nasphalt with a scream.\n\nGREGORY turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is\nbearing down on them, it\u0092s V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD.\n\nGREGORY drops  to her  side, only  to look  up into  the blinding high\nbeams. He  drops over  CHANDRA, ducks  his head  and extends  his hand\ntoward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME.\n\nTHE CRUISER  runs into  his hand  and stops  as though  it hit a steel\npost.

On\nhis way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward\nfrom the  concussion.

The\narm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger. It is  the\nlast piece of CHOI to fall.\n\nMORPHEUS climbs  as he  runs. In  mid-stride he  changes magazines and\nstops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.\n\nOn the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing  at\nthe mass of troops with two  guns that never cease. THERE is  no cover\nand  no reprieve  from the  DOUBLE DEATH  from above.  Most are  still\nfiring down the street, or over toward TRINITY.\n\nTRINITY runs  up the  side of  the street.  Her guns  go empty and she\ndives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.\n\n<b>CU: SOLDIER\n</b>\nIn slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade.

IT explodes directly over the group of\nsoldiers, flattening them to the ground.\n\nA  BULLET smacks  through TRINITY\u0092S  wrist, and  the hand  comes off,\npopping like the head off  a dandelion. Blood spurts from  the severed\narteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.\n\nABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND  NIOBE leap for one another.  They catch\neach other\u0092s arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin in\nplace, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast  upward\nwith their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple.\nMORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down.\n\nTHEY land amidst  the carnage.

Perhaps a  ton\nof rubble falls on Morpheus\u0092 legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe and\nTrinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble.

He was literally poured  into\nthe seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the\nbroken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.\n\n             The legs reform into straight, strong limbs.\n\n                      MORPHEUS grabs the wheel.\n\n<b>                               MORPHEUS\n</b>\n              \"Keep your foot on the gas.

He turns away,  just as the distant  GREGORY is falling out  of\nsight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and  grows\nlarger and larger as  it returns. A contrail  streaks behind him as  a\nrips through  the air.  FISTS FORWARD,  GREGORY is  like an MX missile\nbearing on NEO.\n\nNEO turns just in  time to catch BOTH  FISTS in his chest.

Gripping\nGregor by the neck and his  belt, he drives straight down. The  ground\nrushes, it takes  one second to  drop past a  50-story skyscraper.
