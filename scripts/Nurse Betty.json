In the midst of it all\n            stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35.  The master of his domain.\n            Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his\n            brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure.

On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie\n            is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to\n            David.

She turns the radio up louder.\n\n            When she approaches a sign saying \"You are leaving Kansas\"\n            Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious.

Her hair is\n            matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3\n            and 6 months.
