OPERATING ROOM - DAY                                1\n\n            A tense surgery in progress.  Meters flicker, instruments\n            flash in the bright overhead light.  In the midst of it all\n            stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35.  The master of his domain.\n            Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his\n            brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure.  His co\n            workers sigh collectively with relief.\n\n                                DAVID\n                          (to Asst.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY                             2\n\n            Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted.  Without\n            his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome.  TWO NURSES\n            follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring:\n            CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an\n            exotic mix of African-American and Asian.\n\n            BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up\n            the corridor.  On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie\n            is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to\n            David.  In everything.\n            The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.\n\n                                BLAKE\n                      There's been a train crash near Santa\n                      Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma\n                      here now.  How can I ask you this,\n                      David...\n\n            David rubs his eyes.  Thinks about it.\n\n                                DAVID\n                      I can do it, Blake.\n\n            His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe\n            exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.\n\n                                CHLOE\n                      Is he crazy, Jasmine?   He's been on his\n                      feet for fourteen hours.\n\n                                JASMINE\n                      Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie\n                      died.

TIP TOP DINER - DAY                                 3\n\n            Quaint, Midwestern eatery.  Knick-knacks and photos abound.\n            The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS.  A family\n            dining section off in one corner.\n\n            TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets.  The older\n            of the two holds up his empty coffee cup.  But his WAITRESS,\n            standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's\n            completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on\n            two battered, fuzzy TV sets.\n            BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that\n            competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white\n            waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers\n            behind her.\n            The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera.\n            But the older one, still wants coffee.  He gestures toward\n            Betty.\n\n                                OLDER MAN\n                      Miss?\n\n            Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front\n            of him.  Without taking her eyes from the TV, she pours the\n            java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.\n\n                                OLDER MAN\n                                (cont'd)\n                      Very impressive.  That is very...\n                          (turning to others)\n                      Did anybody see that?\n\n            The LOCAL GUYS around him don't even bother to look up. Of\n            course, they've seen it before.  Betty smiles.\n\n                                                                    3.\n\n\n                                OLDER MAN\n                                (cont'd)\n                      Thank you.  Could I bother you for a\n                      little more...?\n\n            Before he can even finish, Betty is topping him off with\n            milk.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Skim, right?\n                          (tears open an Equal)\n                      And half a pack, if I remember correct...\n\n            The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes\n            out.  He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail.  She\n            looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and\n            gobbling down a huge bacon burger.\n\n                                BETTY (cont'd)\n                      You know, you're never too young to start\n                      on a lean meat substitute...\n                          (BEAT)\n                      You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?\n\n                                YOUNGER MAN\n                      You want a tip when I'm through?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      It's your body...\n\n            Betty turns back to change pots.  The older man watches her\n            intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.\n\n                                YOUNGER MAN\n                          (to himself)\n                      That's right, so why don't you get up off\n                      it...\n\n                                OLDER MAN\n                      Wesley...\n                          (to Betty)\n                      I've told him the same thing.  Thanks for\n                      the suggestion.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      No problem.\n\n            Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye\n            always on the TV as she approaches two local types.\n\n            SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man,\n            sitting at his own booth.  Ballard is spit and polish all the\n            way:  creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes.\n            Badge proudly displayed.  He sits with\n\n                                                                    4.\n\n\n            ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter.  Betty\n            drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the\n            table for him.  Another smile.\n\n                                ROY\n                      Hi, Betty.

She moves off\n            toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups.\n            Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills.  When a\n            hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with\n            her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a\n            look around the restaurant.  The other waitresses are gone\n            and no one is behind the grill.  Alarmed, she pushes through\n            the double doors into the kitchen.\n\n\n\n      6     INT.

He's on the rented sofa in the trailer's\n            lounge, screwing his secretary, JOYCE.  But as he rocks the\n            couch, he's listening to Betty's message.\n\n                                BETTY  (V.O.)\n                      I know you want the Oldsmobile back\n                      tonight, so... I was wondering if I could\n                      take one of the new Buicks.\n\n            Del pulls out and lurches across the room.  He reaches for\n            the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet.  He\n            gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around\n            the desktop until he finds the phone.\n\n                                BETTY  (V.O.)\n                                (CONT'D)\n                      So, call me when you--\n\n                                DEL\n                      Whoa, whoa, whoa!

The\n            phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get\n            back to Joyce.  He motions for her to join him but she\n            remains where she is, fuming.\n\n                                BETTY  (V.O.)\n                      I don't need one, but it's kind of a\n                      special night, and--\n\n                                DEL\n                      What's so special about it?\n\n            LONG PAUSE.

Del shoots her a look that says 'I'm not\n            finished yet!'  They pantomime frantically back and forth\n            until Joyce throws him the finger and SLAMS out the door.\n\n                                BETTY (V.O)\n                                (CONT'D)\n                      What was that?\n\n                                DEL\n                      Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here.

Del\n            silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a\n            moment.

She sidles around Joyce, deftly removes a\n            set from the hook and drops them in her purse.

The car makes an abrupt turn into a trailer park\n            directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row\n            of battered airstreams.\n\n            Betty gets outs of the Chevy and looks back:  the handsome\n            face of Doctor David Ravell is staring at her from the car.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Oh, Christ, what am I gonna do with you?\n\n            She goes back to pick him up, then starts off.\n\n\n\n     12     EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME TIME                           12\n\n            A row of cheap trailers on both sides of a crumbling\n            driveway.  Betty appears with her cardboard man tucked under\n            one arm and then disappears behind a pickup truck.\n\n                                                                   13.\n\n\n\n\n     13     EXT. SIZEMORE MOTORS - SAME TIME                        13\n\n            She tosses the cardboard \"David\" over a concrete slab wall,\n            climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres.  Her\n            key opens the last one - maroon. She puts the doctor on the\n            passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car\n            smell.\n\n            Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the\n            phone.  She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      We deserve this.\n\n\n\n     14     INT. LESABRE - DRIVING - DAY                            14\n\n            Betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural Kansas roads,\n            wheat fields for miles on both sides of her.  The RADIO is\n            blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along.\n\n            She sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h.\n            ... 85 ... 90 m.p.h.  She turns the radio up louder.\n\n            When she approaches a sign saying \"You are leaving Kansas\"\n            Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious.  She eases up on the\n            gas ... slows down ... does a U-turn and heads back toward\n            Fair Oaks.  She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at\n            the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.\n\n\n\n     15     EXT. BETTY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER                       15\n\n            Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into\n            a driveway.  She parks in a detached garage and looks over at\n            the cardboard David.  There's no way he's going in the house.\n            She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.\n\n\n\n     16     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                        16\n\n            She walks several houses down.  On her way to the door we\n            hear a DOG BARKING, CHILDREN and GENERAL COMMOTION from\n            inside.  SUE ANN ROGERS answers Betty's knock.  Her hair is\n            matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3\n            and 6 months.  Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber\n            ball.\n\n                                SUE ANN\n                      Hey, darling... oww!  Sorry, got my own\n                      little Gulf War going on here.\n\n            Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a\n            shelf.  It's all one move; they do this every day.\n\n                                                                   14.\n\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Did you watch it yet?\n\n                                SUE ANN\n                      Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was\n                      any better looking it'd be a crime 'a\n                      some sort...\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Yep.

Larry's got a lodge\n                      meeting.

Betty\n            turns around, frustrated.  She starts yanking her apron off\n            as she crosses the street.\n\n\n\n     17     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DAY                                17\n\n            A low-end ranch.  A worn-out sofa and loveseat form an 'L'\n            that dominates the living room.  Romance novels line a small\n            bookcase.  SIX CANARIES in cages chatter away in the kitchen.\n\n            Del sits at the dining room table, agitated.  He is presently\n            attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread.\n            All we hear is A FORK CLICKING and BIRDS CHIRPING.  Betty\n            stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her\n            uniform and quietly eating a salad.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Sure you don't want any salad?\n\n                                DEL\n                      No, I do not want any goddamn... what was\n                      all that shit on the phone about the new\n                      Buicks?\n\n                                                                   16.\n\n\n                                BETTY\n                      I told you.

An eerie silence.\n\n            Suddenly, Del SCREAMS into his socks and thrashes in his\n            seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides.\n\n            Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped\n            to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near.  Blood\n            flies and curios shatter as Del thunders through the room.  A\n            dying bull, only messier.

Del bashes blindly into it.\n\n                                CHARLIE (cont'd)\n                          (to Wesley)\n                      What the fuck is the matter with you?!\n\n            Wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on\n            what he did.  Charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully\n            SHOOTS Del through the head.  The big man stops suddenly,\n            blinks once or twice, topples over.\n\n\n\n     30     INT.

He\n            looks at the scalp one more time before dropping it in.\n\n                                CHARLIE  (CONT'D)\n                      This is great - just great!

It was the only\n                      decent thing to do.\n\n            They exit the house.\n\n                                CHARLIE  (O.S.)

BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT                        32\n\n            Betty is still in the family room, staring at the TV.  She\n            pushes 'play' again and David Ravell begins to speak.\n\n\n\n     33     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - STREET - LATER                   33\n\n            Sue Ann comes out of her house, balancing a homemade cake in\n            front of her.  The candles give off an unearthly glow as she\n            picks her way up the Sizemore's gravel drive.\n\n\n\n     34     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - DEN - SAME TIME                    34\n\n            Betty is catatonic, staring at the frozen image of David\n            Ravell on her TV.  Downstairs, Sue Ann comes in.\n\n                                                                   31.\n\n\n                                SUE ANN\n                          (O.S.)\n                      Happy Birthday to you!

BETTY'S HOUSE - FOYER - LATER THAT NIGHT           35\n\n            Roy enters the foyer and looks around, carrying a pad and pen\n            in hand.  He hears VOICES from the kitchen, sees FLASHBULBS\n            going off.  He sneaks down the hall when A VOICE stops him.\n\n                                DEPUTY\n                      Hang on there, Roy.

He wants to, ahh, make\n                      a statement for the paper...\n\n            The deputy nods him through and Roy moves off toward the\n            sewing room where he has spotted Betty.\n\n\n\n     36     INT. BETTY'S HOUSE - SEWING ROOM - SAME TIME            36\n\n            Betty is packing an overnight bag on her bed when Roy enters\n            and quietly closes the door behind him.  She is working with\n            a purpose, almost like a different person from the woman we\n            first met.  Still bright and cheerful, but with a willful\n            glint in her eye.  Determined.\n\n                                ROY\n                      Hey, Betty.

It's no\n                      problem...\n\n            Betty starts whipping a T-shirt into place but stops\n            abruptly. She turns curiously to Roy.\n\n                                BETTY (cont'd)\n                      What're you doing here, Roy?\n\n                                ROY\n                      Well, I was worried about you and I\n                      wanted to make sure you were alright...\n                      and I guess I was sort of hoping I could\n                      ask you about what happened...\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Oh, that...

As he returns, Roy reappears\n            behind him, leaning in to listen. Ballard doesn't see him.\n\n                                BALLARD (cont'd)\n                      Sorry you had to see that.

She keeps\n                      talking about them...\n\n            Ballard nods, sure he's got a clue here. He looks in at Betty\n            again, just as she begins repacking her travel bag.  He\n            frowns at this, his suspicions fueled all the more.\n\n\n\n     42     EXT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                            42\n\n            A police car pulls up to Sue Ann's house.  Betty gets out,\n            carrying her overnight bag.  Sue Ann appears, embraces her\n            and leads her inside.\n\n\n\n     43     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER                  43\n\n            Betty lies down in a bright red race car bed.  Sue Ann tucks\n            her in and turns out the light.\n\n                                SUE ANN\n                      Let me know if you need anything, okay?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Are you and Larry happy?\n\n                                SUE ANN\n                      Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Then you should treasure that... you\n                      gotta hold on to whatever you got that's\n                      any good, even if it's only a little bit.\n\n                                SUE ANN\n                      All you been through...

She strokes\n            Betty's hair gently and kisses her.  After she leaves, Betty\n            lies awake, staring at the ceiling.  A mobile dangles\n            overhead.\n\n            LATER\n\n            The Mickey Mouse clock on the wall reads 3:30.  Beneath it,\n            Betty is sitting up in bed, wide awake.\n\n\n\n     44     INT. SUE ANN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              44\n\n            Betty comes down the stairs without a sound. She finds a pen\n            and paper near the phone and writes a note.\n\n            INSERT:            Dear Del:\n                                           This is the hardest thing I've ever done and I can't\n                                           even face you.

BETTY'S HOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT                       45\n\n            Betty raises the garage door, tosses her overnight bag and\n            birthday money envelope into the LeSabre, and gets in.\n            She drives through Fair Oaks, past the town limits.  She\n            keeps on driving until her car recedes into the moonlit\n            prairie horizon.\n\n                                                                   41.\n\n\n\n\n     46     EXT./INT.

She stares hard at it through the\n            windshield.  Suddenly, she hits the gas and bolts off along\n            the Oklahoma blacktop.  She never looks back.\n\n\n\n     47     INT.

Betty takes it as her\n            cue to leave. She smiles, puts two dollars on the bar near\n            the phone and leaves.

Turning\n            her head slowly, as if expecting it, she sees DAVID RAVELL\n            leaning on the rail about twenty feet away, clutching a\n            bouquet of roses.\n\n            Betty starts toward him... he starts toward her... A magic\n            moment... Shattered when a black sedan appears, inching its\n            way along. She freezes. David vanishes, and ...\n            An ELDERLY MAN helps his wife out of the car and snaps her\n            picture in front of the canyon.  Betty moves away.\n\n\n\n     75     INT.

Hurriedly, she pulls over and\n            checks herself in the visor mirror.  She is underwhelmed.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      God...

HOSPITAL / HALLWAY - LATER                         85\n\n            On her way down the hall Betty passes a patient's room when\n            the sound of A PERSON MOANING stops her.  She can't help but\n            go inside.  A TV plays commercials.\n\n            AN OLDER WOMAN lies in bed, alone and staring at the ceiling.\n            Betty looks around and notices several arrangements of\n            flowers on a deserted nightstand.  She brings them over to\n            the older woman's bedside, positions them, then gently\n            strokes her head.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      There... you rest now.\n\n            The woman's eyes flutter.  She is disoriented at first, then\n            calms as she adjusts to the comforting sight of Betty.  Betty\n            takes her hand.\n\n                                OLDER WOMAN\n                      Who... who're you?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      I'm... I'm Nurse Betty.\n\n            The woman smiles serenely at this and begins to drift off.\n            Betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of \"A Reason\n            to Love\" begin to play.\n\n            She glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees Dr.\n            David Ravell standing at the entrance.  He checks the chart\n            on the door, smiles warmly at Betty and then moves off.  In a\n            flash, Betty is up and after him.\n\n            The THEME MUSIC is her private soundtrack as she checks out\n            every man in surgical scrubs, looking for David Ravell.\n            Then... She sees him.  In all his glory at the end of a\n            corridor walking away from her.  Betty gives chase.  She\n            gains steadily on him, her heart racing.  As they near\n            Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up.\n            He stops at the nurses' station.  Betty closes the gap.  She\n            starts to run.\n\n                                BETTY (CONT'D)\n                      DAVID!!!\n\n                                                                   68.\n\n\n            He turns to face her ... It's not David Ravell.\n\n                                BETTY (cont'd)\n                      Sorry, I thought you were someone else.\n                          (BEAT)\n                      Do you know Dr. David Ravell?\n\n            The man shakes his head.  Betty keeps going, looking around:\n            it's incredible - the size, the activity, the intensity.\n\n\n\n     86     INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - SAME TIME              86\n\n            DOZENS OF PATIENTS lie on gurneys awaiting treatment in a\n            holding area.  It's still more intense at the entrance:\n            VOICES talking back and forth urgently, POLICE OFFICERS,\n            CIVILIANS, DOCTORS AND NURSES converging.\n\n\n\n     87     EXT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY AREA - LATE AFTERNOON         87\n\n            FIVE AMBULANCES unload patients at the same time.  At that\n            moment a group of TWENTY JAPANESE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS\n            reaches the E.R. portion of their tour.\n\n            A WHITE MERCEDES tears up the ramp and SCREECHES to a stop.\n            A YOUNG MAN in gang colors is pushed out, bleeding heavily.\n            A DOCTOR runs at the Mercedes to head it off, yelling\n            indignantly.  The car plows right into him and takes off.\n            Another ambulance crests the ramp, lights flashing.  The\n            Mercedes SLAMS into it head-on.  NURSES AND DOCTORS run into\n            the parking lot. A GANGBANGER gets out of the Mercedes, dazed\n            and wobbly.  He pulls a pistol.  Everyone dives for cover.\n\n            The Mercedes driver is unconscious. The driver of the smashed\n            up ambulance is slumped over the wheel.  The rear doors fly\n            open, and a young Hispanic woman, ROSA HERRERA, leaps out.\n\n                                ROSA\n                      SOMEBODY HELP US!

Doctors and\n            nurses creep out of the hospital on all fours, trying to stay\n\n                                                                   69.\n\n            low.  No one is getting to Rosa, whose frantic eyes find\n            Betty.  They look right at each other.\n\n                                ROSA (cont'd)\n                      What are you standing there for?!\n\n            Betty walks toward her calmly, indifferent to the danger as\n            Rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself.  A\n            PARAMEDIC lies unconscious inside.\n\n                                ROSA (cont'd)\n                      You gotta help him, he's hurt bad!!\n\n            On the gurney is a YOUNG MAN with a chest wound, nearly dead\n            from blood loss.  A DOCTOR appears and quickly examines him\n            while keeping one eye on the gunman.  He looks up at Betty.\n\n                                DOCTOR #1\n                      Forget it!  He doesn't have a chance.\n                      Help us over here.\n\n            The doctor takes off.  Rosa looks at Betty, crying.\n\n                                ROSA\n                      Please!\n\n            Betty hesitates, then checks his pulse - he has none.  She\n            peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.\n\n                                ROSA (CONT'D)\n                      Danny, it's gonna be all right!\n\n            Betty looks at Rosa again; looks around for help - there's no\n            one.  She plunges her fingers into the wound.\n\n                                ROSA (cont'd)\n                          (panic)\n                      What are you doing?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      He has no heartbeat!\n\n                                ROSA\n                      You're hurting him!!\n\n                                BETTY\n                      I'm massaging his heart.

We hear a GUNSHOT, and the kid\n            with the pistol falls to the pavement.  The loading area\n            immediately fills with DOCTORS, NURSES and COPS.\n\n                                BETTY (CONT'D)\n                      All right, we're moving him inside!

A DOCTOR and TWO NURSES come out to take over.\n            Betty, her white uniform now covered in blood, steps aside.\n\n\n\n     88     INT.

He's doing his job of being a soap star.\n\n            Rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on Betty's\n            shoulders and points her at George.\n\n                                ROSA (cont'd)\n                      Look who's here!\n\n            Betty's jaw drops.  She freezes.\n\n                                ROSA (cont'd)\n                      What are you waiting for?   Talk to him!\n                      You came fifteen hundred miles for this.\n\n            Rosa prods her, then Betty makes her way unsteadily toward\n            George.  When she's a few feet away he looks up.\n\n            He can't help but notice her - she's beautiful.  She's also\n            looking right into his eyes.  The conversation stops as he\n            does a double take in Betty's direction.\n\n                                                                   94.\n\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Do I know you from...?\n\n            His friends watch as George studies her face.\n\n                                 BETTY\n                      ...of course you do.\n                          (hurt)\n                      You don't remember me?\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      I take it I should.  I'm sorry.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      We were engaged.\n\n                                LYLA\n                      Oh good, another one...\n\n            George's friends look at each other.  A few heads turn.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      I beg your pardon?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      But I'm the one who's sorry.  Letting you\n                      go was the biggest mistake of my life.\n                          (to his friends)\n                      We were thirteen days away from getting\n                      married and ... I just got scared. It's a\n                      mistake I've had to live with for six\n                      years.  But it's behind me now...\n                          (to George)\n                      And I hope you can put it behind you.\n                      I've missed you... David.\n\n            George sighs with relief.  His friends smile.  The tension\n            evaporates.  They can handle a fanatical fan.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      That's very kind of you.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      The day I left you I just drove and\n                      drove.  I drove all day and all that\n                      night, and I didn't go anywhere.  I just\n                      kept driving.  I stopped at a little\n                      country church, and the pastor let me in,\n                      and I sat--\n\n                                LYLA\n                      ... in the very first pew, where we would\n                      have sat on our wedding day.\n\n                                                                   95.\n\n\n            Betty looks at her.  So does George.\n\n                                LYLA (cont'd)\n                      I can't believe I remembered that,\n                      although I suppose I should.  I wrote\n                      it...\n                          (to Betty)\n                      But that was seven years ago, and you're\n                      quoting it verbatim.  I'm flattered... I\n                      think.  Or frightened.   What's your\n                      name?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Betty Sizemore.

Then he met Leslie--\n\n                                LYLA\n                      No, no, no.  We know all that.  What\n                      happened with you?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      I married a car salesman.\n\n            The friends laugh.  Rosa watches, confused.  So is Betty.\n\n                                FRIEND #1\n                      You were dumped for a car salesman,\n                      George!\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Why are you calling him George?\n\n                                                                   96.\n\n\n                                FRIEND #2\n                      Yeah - David - tell us about this car\n                      salesman.\n\n            George likes the challenge. This party isn't so boring after\n            all.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Oh, you mean Fred.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      No, Del.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Right, Del.  Del was one hot salesman.\n                      Of cars.  He could talk anyone into\n                      anything.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      You knew Del?!\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the\n                      time, but Del and I go way back.  We went\n                      to school together.  In fact, he saved my\n                      life.  Two more minutes in that icy water\n                      and I would have drowned.  But Del jumped\n                      in and grabbed me.  We fell out of touch\n                      eventually, but I still owe him one.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      He never told me anything about...that's\n                      unbelievable!\n\n                                LYLA\n                      Funny, that's just what I was thinking...\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      I can't tell you how much it hurts me to\n                      hear that you married him.\n\n            His friends snicker.  Rosa stares.  Betty is oblivious to\n            everything but George.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      I'm so sorry.  Life makes us do awful\n                      things sometimes.\n\n            She's ready to cry.  Which only inspires him all the more.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      I tried to tell myself it was for the\n                      best, that there was a reason behind it.\n                      But... Del?\n\n                                                                   97.\n\n\n                                BETTY\n                      There was no plan!

I can't tell you how many\n                      times I've said that to myself in those\n                      exact words.\n\n            Betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now.  George\n            doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but\n            his friends interrupt.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Hey, don't... come on, I was just...\n                      you're not really crying, are you?...

Ellen drops two coasters in front of Charlie and\n            Wesley as they sit down.\n\n                                ELLEN\n                      What can I get you?\n\n                                WESLEY\n                      We're Federal Marshals, ma'am.\n\n            Ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled\n            clothes.\n\n                                CHARLIE\n                      We're looking for this young lady.\n\n            He slides the photo of Betty across the bar. Ellen's gaze\n            drops to the picture for a second, and Charlie sees what he\n            was looking for - a flicker of recognition.  He allows\n            himself a satisfied grin.\n\n            Wesley shows Ellen his badge as Merle checks out the photo.\n\n                                ELLEN\n                      I haven't seen her.\n\n                                MERLE\n                      Sure you have!

Now get out of here.\n\n            Wesley steps behind Merle, takes a handful of his hair and\n            SLAMS his head into the popcorn machine on the bar.  Merle\n            staggers away, stunned. Wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop\n            from a nearby hook.\n\n            Ellen reaches for something under the bar, but Charlie's\n            faster.  He pins her arm with one hand.\n\n                                CHARLIE\n                      You haven't been very forthcoming with\n                      us.\n\n            They watch Wesley follow Merle at a slow walk around the pool\n            table, CLOBBERING him over the head about every five steps\n            with the popcorn scoop.\n\n            Merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down.  They begin\n            a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the\n            CLANG of the scoop against Merle's head.\n\n                                CHARLIE\n                      What's your name, dear?\n\n                                ELLEN\n                      Ellen.\n\n                                CHARLIE\n                      That's a nice name.\n\n            After one more CLANGING shot Merle staggers, then falls.\n            Wesley walks over to Charlie and Ellen, drawing his knife.\n\n                                WESLEY\n                      That's a really nice name...\n\n\n\n    116     INT.

You've only got four\n                      lines today, so I thought I'd just spring\n                      it on you.  No blocking or anything, just\n                      stand near the nurse's station... we're\n                      gonna do a quick walk-through.  Alright?\n\n            He kisses her cheek and walks off toward the waiting Lyla\n            before she can respond.\n\n                                VOICE (O.S.)\n                      Quiet on the set!\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Traffic was terrible...\n\n                                LYLA\n                      No, that's fine, we've only got seventy\n                      pages to shoot...take your time.\n\n            A STAGE MANAGER hands Betty a set of sides and an on-set\n            COSTUMER tries to fit her.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Excuse me.

Lyla watches from\n            behind the cameras as David readies himself. Chloe enters the\n            set with Kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume.\n\n                                CHLOE\n                          (to Betty)\n                      Hi.

I wanna give a whole\n                      new feel to the show.\n\n            She's sliding toward a complete meltdown.\n\n                                VOICE\n                      Slate it!\n\n            George steps back behind the cameras.  Betty's still frozen\n            to her spot, overwhelmed.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Just do what you've been doing.  Watch\n                      the scene and on your cue take off from\n                      there.\n\n                                VOICE\n                      5-4-3-2...\n\n            Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop\n            when they get to Betty's cue. Their faces loom around her\n            menacingly.  Staring.  The lights are impossibly bright.\n            People begin to shuffle and stare at one another. Lyla clears\n            her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Betty?\n\n                                CHLOE\n                      Are you all right?\n\n                                BLAKE\n                          (to Chloe)\n                      I think you stepped on my first line...\n\n                                CHLOE\n                      ... I was talking to her.\n                          (to Betty)\n                      Do you need anything...?\n\n            She's freezing up.  George approaches her.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Betty, I thought this would be the best\n                      way.  You know, throw you into it...\n\n                                LYLA\n                      What the hell's going on?\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      If you need a minute, that's okay. But I\n                      thought you'd want to--\n\n                                                                  119.\n\n\n                                BETTY\n                      David, I don't...  Can we talk privately\n                      for a second?\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Stop calling me David.  We're on set, for\n                      Christ's sake, you don't have to call me\n                      David here.\n\n            As he pulls away Betty grabs his arm.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      Why are you doing this to me?\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Why am I doing this to you?  Isn't this\n                      what you wanted?\n\n            Lyla approaches.\n\n                                LYLA\n                      Is there a problem, George?\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      No!  No problem, there is no...\n                          (to Betty, sotto)\n                      What is the problem?  Just do that...\n                      thing... you do!  Come on!  You drove me\n                      nuts with this for three days, now do it!\n\n            George steps back behind the cameras as if nothing's wrong.\n            Betty still hasn't moved.  She's shaking with fear.  The cast\n            and crew members find it hard to look at her.\n\n                                LYLA\n                      All right, everybody!

It was a gamble, it\n                      didn't work.  Nice try.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Let me try this, goddamnit!  SHE'S BEEN\n                      DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!\n\n                                LYLA\n                      I SAID FORGET IT!\n\n                                                                  120.\n\n\n            George throws down his script and rushes up to Betty, who\n            reaches out to him.  He brushes her hands away.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Well, I don't know what you had in mind,\n                      but I hope you're happy.  I put myself on\n                      the line for you, my reputation, and\n                      you're making me look like an idiot.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      What do you mean?  What did I do to\n                      you...\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      Who put you up to this?  Did my ex-wife\n                      ask you to...?\n\n                                BETTY\n                      David, please--\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      STOP CALLING ME THAT!

DO YOU??\n                      Well, why don't you get a fucking life,\n                      and stop ruining mine!\n\n            Betty stands dead still as George continues to berate her.\n            ALL SOUND slowly starts to drop out, then comes back abruptly\n            with a RUSH.  Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she\n            stares at him.\n\n                                BETTY\n                      I'm sorry...Oh my gosh, are you George\n                      McCord?!\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      ...What?

Forgive me if I\n                      caused you all any trouble... I just, I\n                      don't know how I...\n                          (to George)\n                      ... I'm sorry.\n\n            George watches Betty walk off the set.  The cast and crew try\n            to pretend this scene didn't happen, except for Lyla, who\n            burns a hole into George's back.  Their eyes meet.\n\n                                GEORGE\n                      What?!\n\n\n\n    132     OMIT                                                   132\n\n\n\n    133     INT.

She is staring at a black Lincoln\n            sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome.  She\n            shudders involuntarily at it.

He rubs one foot against the other\n            until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. Rosa and Roy\n            watch.\n            He finally lifts the boot off.  It falls soundlessly onto his\n            chest. A small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle.\n            He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank.\n\n                                                                  136.\n\n            Roy and Rosa COUGH LOUDLY at the same time to cover the\n            noise.

Ballard has fucked up again.\n\n            On screen, Chloe and Jasmine kiss and embrace.

But he can't break the\n            glass. Roy can't take it any more. He launches himself at the\n            tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of\n            himself.  A torrent of water, fish, plants and gravel pours\n            down upon him.\n\n                                WESLEY (cont'd)\n                      You stupid piece of fuck!\n\n            He leaps at Roy and starts kicking him savagely.

He spots a glint of metal in the sand.\n\n            Wesley struggles out from under Rosa. Just as he gets free,\n            Ballard FIRES, hitting him TWICE into his chest. Wesley\n            stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him.  Then at\n            Ballard, as if trying to link the two.\n\n            He slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream ...\n\n                                WESLEY (cont'd)\n                      D-A-A-A-D-D-D-Y-Y-!!!!\n\n            Charlie opens the bedroom door.\n\n                                CHARLIE\n                      Wesley??!\n\n            Charlie sees Wesley turn to him as Ballard FIRES again.\n            Wesley's face explodes.

Rosa nods; she's amazed that he knew what it was.
