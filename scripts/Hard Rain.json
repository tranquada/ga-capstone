The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom \n               gets an idea. He takes his belt off.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Too hard; the belt starts \n               slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk \n               starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, \n               stretching.\n\n<b>               HIS FINGERS\n</b>\n               Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and \n               he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...\n\n<b>               THE TELEPHONE POLE\n</b>\n               Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, \n               shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the \n               room.\n\n<b>               THE DESK\n</b>\n               Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...\n\n<b>               THE KEYS\n</b>\n               And grips them tight.\n\n<b>               TOM\n</b>\n               Tries the keys in the lock.

A foot in ten seconds.\n\n<b>               TOM\n</b>\n               Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's \n               running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three \n               feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...\n\n<b>               FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE\n</b>\n               On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.\n\n<b>               TOM\n</b>\n               Is terrified, about to die.

He takes off the \n               lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.\n\n<b>               TOM\n</b>\n               Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over \n               the light fixture.\n\n               He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then \n               breathes.

The figure leans down and starts tugging \n               at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light, \n               Tom sees that it's...\n\n<b>               KAREN\n</b>\n               And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't \n               budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small \n               knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in \n               place. She gets two screws out.\n\n<b>               TOM\n</b>\n               Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.\n\n<b>               EXT.

There's a vent duct laying \n               on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the \n               light fixture. Karen helps Tom up.
