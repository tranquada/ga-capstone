HOUSE - NIGHT 1\r\n</b>\r\n          From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell\r\n          fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns.\r\n          Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window,\r\n          lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes.\r\n          He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if\r\n          he might run back into the flames. But the heat is\r\n          unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black\r\n          shadows. We cannot see his face,\r\n\r\n<b>          1A EXT.

There is a loud SNORT and\r\n          the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his\r\n          shoulder.\r\n          Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the\r\n          barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!\r\n          Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up!\r\n          When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a\r\n          fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a\r\n          handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then\r\n          takes it and wipes his mouth.\r\n          Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the\r\n          boy will never forget before waving him away.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          2.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          4 EXT.

Two of\r\n          his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust.\r\n          BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with\r\n          a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper.\r\n\r\n<b>          5 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 5\r\n</b>\r\n          Bush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older\r\n          than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old\r\n          mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets\r\n          nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUS H\r\n</b>          Just a boy, that's all.\r\n\r\n<b>                         6 SERIES: 6\r\n</b>          7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7\r\n          fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks\r\n          the road in both directions. All clear for now.\r\n          8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8\r\n          dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn\r\n          into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his\r\n          shotgun leaning against the shack.\r\n          The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees\r\n          Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation.\r\n\r\n<b>                         HORTON\r\n</b>          Mornin', sir.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          Hard life if you can't read..\r\n\r\n<b>                         HORTON\r\n</b>          Pardon?

CEMETERY - EVENING 9\r\n</b>\r\n          The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley\r\n          Starke's fresh grave. The mounded earth is covered with\r\n          beautiful flowers and wreathes, a loving send off from his\r\n          family and friends. As we pan past the flowers and cards..\r\n          we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty.\r\n          Hunkered down nearby, Bush is as still as a gravestone,\r\n          staring at the last resting place of his old friend.\r\n          As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen,\r\n          staring at a pot of YELLOW FLOWERS on a distant grave. Now he\r\n          turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          4.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          10 INT.

He finds\r\n          what he's looking for: A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.\r\n          She smiles at us from happier days. Realizing that he is\r\n          raging with a serious fever, he tries to stand up only to\r\n          collapse back on the bed.\r\n\r\n<b>                         11 OMIT 11/12/13 11\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          14 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 14\r\n</b>\r\n          Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp, Bush moves\r\n          slowly toward the barn. But he is so wracked with fever he\r\n          has to stop. It stuns him that he can't go on. He never\r\n          thought anything could stop him. Stuck in the rain with the\r\n          shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness,\r\n          the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          Well hell..\r\n\r\n<b>          15 INT. BUSH'S BARN - NIGHT 15\r\n</b>\r\n          Somehow he has made it. Sopping wet and shivering, Bush is in\r\n          bad shape and knows it.\r\n          Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises.\r\n          Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing\r\n          snatches his first meal in days.\r\n          Bush tries to think through the fever. He stumbles back to\r\n          the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush\r\n          doesn't make it. Satisfied, he comes back and drops hard onto\r\n          a pile of hay near Mule.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          Always thought you'd go first..\r\n          White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running\r\n          out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness.

The\r\n          door is still swung wide open.\r\n          Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding\r\n          sunlight. Mule is dozing in his favorite spot. He swings his\r\n          big gray head over at Bush.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          Ahh, don't look so disappointed.\r\n\r\n<b>                         17 OMITTED 17\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          18 EXT.

Bush gets a set of\r\n          reins and walks toward him. Mule starts to take a stroll,\r\n          knowing what the reins mean.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          You better not.\r\n          Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          And coffee when we get there.\r\n\r\n<b>          19 EXT.

PEOPLE try to catch a glimpse of the infamous\r\n          recluse.\r\n          Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard. Bush climbs off\r\n          the cart and walks Mule, ignoring the eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n<b>          20 INT.

In their own world, and not\r\n          realizing that there is anyone in the chapel, Kathryn picks\r\n          some lint from Buddy's jacket.

Buddy gives him nothing,\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          Thanks again for coming, Charlie.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHARLIE\r\n</b>          I'm proud of you.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (MEANING IT)\r\n</b>          Thank you for my church.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>          Did you ever get my bill?\r\n\r\n<b>                         HORTON\r\n</b>          Can we get a ride our car's about 2\r\n          miles down the road.\r\n          Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so they\r\n          all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides.\r\n          It makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting\r\n          embrace then climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long\r\n          moment all then closes the door.\r\n          As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out\r\n          the back window. Buddy waves back.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUSH\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         (TO HIMSELF)\r\n</b>          Look at that. My funeral and\r\n          everybody's in there but me.\r\n          The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          101.\r\n</b>          The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful. He looks down the\r\n          road through the fading dust and sees a WOMAN walking slowly\r\n          toward him. He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills\r\n          with a timeless love.\r\n\r\n<b>          168 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER 168\r\n</b>\r\n          It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree. Mule stands\r\n          hitched to the wagon. The three dog grave markers are\r\n          frosted.\r\n          A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the\r\n          tree. It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush. A pot of\r\n          fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker.\r\n          Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave.\r\n          Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand\r\n          beside the grave. Several MEN with shovels wait near the\r\n          tree. Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation\r\n          which Bush would probably love.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHARLIE\r\n</b>          Well, Felix, this one's for real, I\r\n          guess. I didn't actually see them\r\n          put you in the box so..\r\n          Charlie glances over and notices \"Charlie\" on one of the\r\n          dog's grave markers. He snorts and shakes his head.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHARLIE\r\n</b>          Wherever you are, you're probably\r\n          giving someone a hard time or\r\n          something wonderful and priceless\r\n          just to confuse them. Not\r\n          everything can be figured out, nor\r\n          everybody. I wish you peace from\r\n          the burdens of your mind and heart.\r\n          I wish it for us all.\r\n          Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand\r\n          out to catch her should she should stumble. She stares down\r\n          at the FB on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture\r\n          of her sister drift down onto the coffin.\r\n\r\n<b>          169 EXT. HILLSIDE - LATER 169\r\n</b>\r\n          Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave. Buddy and\r\n          Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie. Buddy\r\n          tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          102.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         BUDDY\r\n</b>          A 50 on the outside, all ones\r\n          inside.

Nobody listens to the\r\n          preacher.\r\n          Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUDDY\r\n</b>          The day of the party he told me\r\n          about the will he had in the secret\r\n          drawer of his table. He left the\r\n          raffle money to all of us.\r\n          Everyone is shocked, touched.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUDDY\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         (TO FRANK)\r\n</b>          But you have to pay for Mule's\r\n          upkeep for the rest of his life.\r\n          Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUDDY\r\n</b>          And he set up a fund for the\r\n          upkeep of your church.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHARLIE\r\n</b>          What's the catch?\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUDDY\r\n</b>          No catch, sir.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHARLIE\r\n</b>          Still don't get it, do you? With\r\n          Felix, there's always a catch.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BUDDY\r\n</b>          Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy\r\n          wondering what it was.\r\n          They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter\r\n          fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has\r\n          had upon them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but\r\n          growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the\r\n          pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity about the fearsome old\r\n          man has not abated. Nor will it ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>          THE END\r\n</b>\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Get-Low.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Get Low</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Chris Provenzano\" title=\"Scripts by Chris Provenzano\">Chris Provenzano</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Scott Seeke\" title=\"Scripts by Scott Seeke\">Scott Seeke</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=C.
