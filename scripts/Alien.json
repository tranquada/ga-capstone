Their\n     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open\n     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange\n     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.\n\n     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface\n     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a\n     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb\n     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-\n     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A\n     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and\n     cannot be removed.\n\n     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the\n     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing\n     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood\n     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not\n     kill it on the ship.\n\n     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,\n     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal\n     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a\n     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been\n     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose\n     on the ship.\n\n     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft\n     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears\n     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in\n     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific\n     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the\n     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's\n     bizarre life cycle.\n\n     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the\n     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a\n     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which\n     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>                         CAST OF CHARACTERS\n</b>\n<b>     CHAZ STANDARD,\n</b>          Captain.................A leader and a politician.

It'll arrest the progress of\n               his disease, and he can get complete\n               medical attention when we get back\n               to the Colonies.\n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>               We'll have to go into quarantine,\n               maybe for quite a while.\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>               That's okay, he can remain in\n               hypersleep until they're ready to\n               treat him.\n\n     They enter the infirmary.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - INFIRMARY</u>\n\n     As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP\n     in BED -- AWAKE.\n\n<b>                              BROUSSARD\n</b>                    (hoarsely)\n               ...

Blow the\n               lock.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>\n\n     Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind\n     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK</u>\n\n     With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature\n     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>\n\n     The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-\n<b>     HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.\n</b>\n<b>     FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,\n</b>     crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.\n\n     On the wall, a green light goes on:\n\n<b>                         \"INNER DOOR CLOSED\"\n</b>\n     <u>INTERIOR - AIR LOCK</u>\n\n     Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches\n     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.\n<b>     IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.\n</b>\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>\n\n     In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock\n     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into\n     the vacuum under pressure.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>\n\n     INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is\n     sucked out toward the lock.\n\n<b>     A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:\n</b>\n<b>                         \"CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION\"\n</b>\n     After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control\n     room.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>\n\n     Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,\n     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along\n     by the air current.\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>\n\n     A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds\n     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>\n\n     Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt\n     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,\n<b>     HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.\n</b>\n     Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running\n     again.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK</u>\n\n     Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the\n     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his\n     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound\n     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.\n\n     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a\n     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch\n     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.\n\n     Done in, he collapses to the floor.\n\n     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of\n     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --\n     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can\n     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking\n     underwater.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS</u>\n\n     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and\n     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping\n     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses\n     bleed.\n\n     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can\n     only hear distant croaks.\n\n     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others\n     follow him.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM</u>\n\n     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging\n     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen\n     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.\n\n     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening\n     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL\n     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the\n     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.\n\n     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.\n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>               How much oxygen did we lose?\n\n     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>               We've got six hours left.\n\n<b>                              HUNTER\n</b>                    (groans)\n               Oh my God.\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>               Does anybody know what happened?\n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>               I saw it.

When he lifts his head again, he has\n     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>\n\n     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other\n     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He\n     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.\n\n     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps\n     into the maintenance level.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL</u>\n\n     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that\n     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he\n     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.\n\n     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,\n     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.\n\n     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the\n     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM</u>\n\n     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal\n     ladder to the floor.\n\n<b>     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,\n</b><b>     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.\n</b>\n     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.\n\n     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from\n     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.\n\n     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close\n     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF\n<b>     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.\n</b>\n     Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps\n     violently.\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>                    (a feeble whisper)\n               Kill me... \n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>                    (sickened)\n               What did it do to you?\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>                    (moves his head slightly)\n               Look... \n\n     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles\n     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller\n     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE\n<b>     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.\n</b>\n<b>                              STANDARD (CONT'D)\n</b>                    (whispering)\n               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... \n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>                    (looking around for a tool)\n               I'll get you out of there.\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>               No... don't... \n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>               But I can save you -- get you to the\n               Autodoc!\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>               No good... it's eaten too much of\n               me... \n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>                    (in horror)\n               What can I do?\n\n<b>                              STANDARD\n</b>               Kill me... \n\n     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look\n     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and\n     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and\n     scrambles back up the ladder.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL</u>\n\n     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.\n     At length, he regains control of himself.\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED</u>\n\n     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters\n     rolling past in the infinite distance.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - BRIDGE</u>\n\n     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a\n     little oxygen tank on it.\n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>               Kitty go bye-bye.\n\n     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss\n     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in\n     front.  It YOWLS.\n\n     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - MINING &amp; CARGO BAY</u>\n\n     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the\n     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal\n     cannisters.\n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>                    (reading from labels)\n               What'll it be, Kitty?

Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one\n     by one.\n\n<b>     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.\n</b>\n<b>                              COMPUTER\n</b>               Attention!

The thing can\n     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.\n\n     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>\n\n     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding\n     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the\n     ship as he sprints for the engine room.\n\n<b>                              COMPUTER\n</b>               Attention!

The room is full of\n     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in\n     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.\n\n     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit\n     switches.\n\n     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.\n\n<b>                              COMPUTER\n</b>               Attention!

He turns and runs from the\n     engine room.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP</u>\n\n     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time\n     <u>up</u> the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:\n\n<b>                              COMPUTER\n</b>               Attention!

He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward\n     the passageway.\n\n     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.\n\n     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.\n     Then he advances on the passageway.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY</u>\n\n     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the\n     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on\n     by the siren and the computer:\n\n<b>                              COMPUTER\n</b>               Attention!

He is no sooner in the\n     seat than he hits the \"LAUNCH\" button.\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE</u>\n\n     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE\n<b>     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE \"SNARK.\"\n</b>\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates\n     away from the mother ship.\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>\n\n     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of\n     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly\n     circumstances.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the\n     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches\n     his head down over it.\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>\n\n     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,\n     until it is barely a point of light.\n\n<b>     THEN IT BLOWS UP.\n</b>\n<b>     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL\n</b><b>     DIRECTIONS.\n</b>\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling\n     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.\n\n     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of\n     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed\n     in orange light.\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - SPACE</u>\n\n     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away\n     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of\n     his ship and friends.\n\n<b>     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN\n</b><b>     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.\n</b>\n     The cat SCREECHES.\n\n     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of\n     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.\n\n     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.\n\n     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on\n     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any\n     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,\n     with the door standing open.\n\n     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.\n\n     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker\n     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\n\n     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face\n     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that\n     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is\n     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.\n\n     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It\n     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.\n\n     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\n\n     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE\n<b>     GLASS.\n</b>\n     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the\n     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.\n\n     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the\n     catbox.\n\n     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull\n     it on.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see\n     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\n\n     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing\n     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it\n     into a crevice in the wall.\n\n     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the\n     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\n\n     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the\n     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.\n\n     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.\n     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.\n\n     Again he raps on the glass.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER</u>\n\n<b>                              ROBY\n</b>               Try a little of this, you fucking\n               bastard.\n\n<b>     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.\n</b>\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT\n<b>     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.\n</b>\n     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid\n     begins to flow from the wound.\n\n     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a\n     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.\n\n     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into\n     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel\n     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT\n<b>     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.\n</b>\n   </pre>\n<img alt=\"IMAGE -- finalbattle.jpg\" src=\"alienearlyimages/finalbattle.jpg\"/>\n   <pre>\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE</u>\n\n     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing\n     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't\n     let go.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and\n     yanks it.\n\n     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END\n<b>     OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.\n</b>\n     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.\n\n     <u>EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE</u>\n\n     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,\n     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.\n\n     <u>INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT</u>\n\n     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is\n     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.\n\n     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:\n\n<b>                              \"RAM JETS\"\n</b>\n     <u>EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE</u>\n\n     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the\n     creature is wriggling.
