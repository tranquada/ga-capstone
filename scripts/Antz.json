AN ANT MOUND - DAY\n\n     The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside,\n     past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the\n     gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access\n     tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants\n     plodding along...\n\n     ...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming\n     vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants\n     rushing here and there on their business.  We see -- a\n     \"traffic cop\" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like\n     crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants\n     marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down\n     a matchbox elevator filled with workers.\n\n                         Z (V.O.)\n               ...which is kind of a problem, since\n               I've always felt uncomfortably in\n               crowds.\n\n     INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     We join Z, a worker ant with issues.  He's lying on a couch,\n     recounting his woes.\n\n                         Z\n               I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've\n               got abandonment issues.  My father\n               flew away when I was just a larva.\n               My mother didn't have much time for\n               me...when you have five million\n               siblings, it's difficult to get\n               attention.\n                      (pause)\n               I feel physically inadequate -- I've\n               never been able to lift more than ten\n               times my own weight.  Sometimes I\n               think I'm just not cut out to be a\n               worker.  But I don't have any other\n               options.  I was assigned to trade\n               school when I was just a grub.

Ants!  Millions of creatures,\n               each with his assigned task, all\n               pulling together!\n\n     Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an\n     incline.  One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down,\n     crushing his leg.  The other ants rush over -- it looks like\n     they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they\n     climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing\n     with their task.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               You see?  Being an ant is being able\n               to say, \"Hey -- I'm meaningless,\n               you're meaningless.\"\n\n                         Z\n               But -- but I've always felt life was\n               about finding meaning...and then\n               sharing it with someone special,\n               someone you love.\n\n     The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he\n     seems to understand...\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               Z...you need help.\n                      (looking at a clock)\n               Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop\n               there.  Your minute is up!\n\n     The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               Now back to work!  We've made real\n               progress!  Remember -- let's be\n               best superorganism we can be!\n\n     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY\n\n     A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the \"Chunnel\".\n     A banner strung overhead reads: \"The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling\n     Our Way to a Bright Future!\"  Along the walls hang 50's work-\n     incentive style posters with messages like, \"You asked for\n     it, you got it -- more work!\" and \"TWO MEALS A WEEK IS\n     ENOUGH!!!\"  Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel,\n     digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone\n     synchronized.\n\n     CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand.\n     PULL OUT TO REVEAL\n\n     AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands\n     there, waiting to pass the dirt on.  Z is daydreaming behind\n     her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.\n\n                         AZTECA\n               Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap\n               out of it, or there's gonna be a lot\n               of pissed off ants!\n\n     Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.\n\n                         Z\n                      (snapping out of it)\n               Sorry Azteca.

I'm so hungry I'm\n               seeing double.  It looks like there's\n               two million ants in here.  When's\n               lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?\n\n                         AZTECA\n                      (sweetly)\n               Z, old pal...\n                      (shouts)\n               SHUT UP!!!

The squeaky wheel gets thrown\n               away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z,\n               even though you are a pain in my rear-\n               segment.

Breaktime.\n\n     All the ants put down their tools.  A beat.  Then the WHISTLE\n     BLOWS AGAIN.  All the ants pick up their tools again.\n\n                         AZTECA\n                      (resigned)\n               Break's over.\n\n                         Z\n                      (getting back to work)\n               This colony needs another tunnel like\n               a hole in the ground.

We're not the ones in\n               charge.\n\n     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\n\n     The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony.  Looming over\n     the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be\n     inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.\n\n     Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters,\n     seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants\n     in the place?\n\n                         GENERAL FORMICA\n               STAIRS!\n\n     The workers look up and GROAN.  Then they start forming a\n     stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on\n     each other's shoulders.  It's extremely unpleasant work.  One\n     ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place\n     before...\n\n     GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the\n     colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he\n     ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow.  As\n     Formica mounts the \"stairs\"  we can hear the workers going,\n     \"OUCH!  OOF!  YIKES!\" etc.\n\n                         GENERAL FORMICA\n               Cut the chit-chat down there!\n                      (turning to Carpenter)\n               We've spoiled these workers,\n               Carpenter.  They've never had it so\n               good, and listen to them -- always\n               grumbling and complaining...\n\n     Formica steps on the foot of one of the \"stairway\" ants, who\n     muffles a yelp.\n\n                         CARPENTER\n               ...Yes, sir.\n\n                         GENERAL FORMICA\n               What have they got to complain about?\n               Three square meals a day...\n\n                         CARPENTER\n               Actually, sir, we've cut them down to\n               three roughly rectangular meals a\n               week.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.\n               I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!\n\n     Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase.\n     There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive\n     throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge\n     SQUEAKS.\n\n                         FORMICA\n                      (to guard ant, while\n                       passing)\n               Oil that, soldier.\n\n     INT.

General Formica.\n\n     Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.\n\n     Note:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth\n     repeatedly.  Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a\n     short \"Happy Birthday\" fanfare on his trumpet.  Mid-wife ants\n     bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few\n     words.  The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-\n     line, powered by ants on a treadmill.\n\n                         QUEEN\n               General, the severe food shortage\n               that faces the colony...pains me.\n               The thought of any of my children\n               going hungry...\n                      (she shudders; then,\n                       to baby)\n               Who's the cutest widdle worker?

ANT BAR - NIGHT\n\n     A long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch\n     for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a\n     drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at\n     the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.\n\n                         Z\n               We declared war again?\n                      (off Weaver's nod)\n               Are you scared?\n\n                         WEAVER\n                      (shrugs)\n               I'll be back.\n\n     The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like\n     a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids,\n     little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs\n     hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with\n     hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.\n\n                         APHIDS\n                      (as they're slapped\n                       on bar)\n               Ouch!

How he gave you\n               the beers, not me?

Suavely grabs the candle in a\n     glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face.\n\n     He plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit\n     apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her.\n\n                         Z\n               So uh -- how come I haven't seen you\n               around here before?\n\n                         BALA\n                      (covering up)\n               I work in the palace, I don't get out\n               much.\n\n                         Z\n               The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals\n               really live it up.  Of course they're\n               all a little, you know, from\n               inbreeding --\n\n                         BALA\n                      (shocked)\n               What?\n\n     Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the\n     ants, but Z can't do any of the steps.\n\n                         Z\n               Now, let's see, I -- it's been a\n               while since I -- I think you --\n\n     Bala watches Z, trying to follow along.  It's the blind\n     leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's\n     rapid instructions.\n\n                         Z\n               Here, I'll lead.\n\n     Z starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave\n     expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter\n     mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.\n\n                         BALA\n               Are you sure this is a real dance?\n\n                         Z\n               Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of\n               making it up --\n\n                         BALA\n                      (surprised)\n               Really?\n\n                         Z\n               Why should everyone dance the same\n               way?  It's as exciting as watching\n               fungus grow.\n\n                         BALA\n               You're right!\n\n                         Z\n                      (surprised)\n               You -- you think I'm right?\n\n                         BALA\n               Why can't I just do whatever I want\n               to do?  Why can't I just go wild?!\n               Yahoo!\n\n     Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply\n     to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of\n     them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too\n     wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their\n     intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost\n     knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's\n     back at the moment.\n\n                         SOLDIER\n               Hey!  Watch your step, worker.\n\n     Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE,\n     glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got\n     one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed\n     off.\n\n                         BALA\n               You watch yours, soldier, or my\n               worker friend will beat you up!\n\n                         Z\n                      (terrified)\n               Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off\n               this time.\n                      (whispering to Bala)\n               Are you crazy?  This guy's built like\n               a pebble!\n                      (ineptly trying to\n                       placate the soldier)\n               You know they do great prosthetic\n               antennas nowadays --\n\n                         BALA\n               Aren't you gonna stand up for\n               yourself?\n\n     Z's caught between a rock and a hard place.  He doesn't want\n     to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to\n     lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered\n     around, looking hostile.\n\n                         SOLDIER\n               How come you don't dance like the\n               rest of us?\n\n     Z glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he\n     says defiantly...\n\n                         Z\n               Because -- because I'm an individual!\n\n                         SOLDIER #2\n               An individual?  Never heard of it.\n\n                         MANDIBLE\n               You look like a worker to me.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Hey, lay off my little buddy!\n\n     Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just\n     realized something very important.  Unfortunately, just at\n     this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him\n     back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it,\n     there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the\n     middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the\n     face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess'\n     handmaidens hurries over.\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #1\n               Princess Bala!  Princess Bala!\n\n     Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.\n\n                         Z\n               Princess?  You're a Princess?\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #2\n               The police are coming!\n\n                         BALA\n               Uh oh.\n                      (to Z)\n               Goodbye!  Gotta run!\n\n                         Z\n               Wait!  When can I see you again?\n\n                         BALA\n               Let me think.  Hmmnn...\n                      (thinks)\n               Never.  Bye!\n\n     Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of\n     whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.\n\n                         Z\n               Wait!  Princess!  Wait!\n\n     But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n     INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY\n\n     Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.\n     Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Get real, Z!  She just dropped the\n               scarf by accident!\n\n                         Z\n               Are you kidding?  There were sparks\n               between us!  This scarf is a sign!\n\n                         WEAVER\n               It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do\n               you know what the penalty for\n               impersonating a soldier is?\n\n                         Z\n               What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your\n               place for the royal inspection.  Bala\n               comes strolling down the line, she\n               sees me -- bingo!

I owe you!\n\n     Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the\n     soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.\n\n     INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT\n\n     The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a\n     reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of\n     soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant\n     General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads,\n     \"GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey\".\n\n     Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.\n\n                         Z\n               Any of you guys know when the\n               Princess will show up?  She's kind of\n               a personal friend.\n\n     The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.\n\n                         LOUD VOICE\n               ATTEN-SHUN!\n\n     MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as\n     they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.\n\n     GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping\n     his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some\n     unfortunate insect)\n\n                         FORMICA\n               First of all, let me make one thing\n               clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by\n               thinking for himself.  All this\n               \"thinking\" stuff is a load of crap.\n               If the almighty had wanted you boys\n               to think, he wouldn't have given you\n               huge mandibles and a brain so small\n               you'd misplace it if it wasn't\n               trapped inside your head.\n\n     In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's\n     just made a joke.\n\n                         Z\n                      (slapping his thigh)\n               \"Trapped inside your head\" -- that's\n               a good one --\n\n     Z notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops.\n\n                         Z\n               Geez -- tough room.\n\n     From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying\n     to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many\n     ants.  He continues.\n\n                         FORMICA\n                      (striding back and\n                       forth)\n               We ants survive as a species because\n               we do what we're told.  We survive\n               because we work together, as one, we\n               get the job done, we do whatever it\n               takes to persevere!\n                      (dramatic pause)\n               Hell, we're not an army of\n               ants...we're one giant ant, with\n               giant fists, and giant jaws!\n\n     The soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.\n\n                         Z\n                      (to the soldier ant\n                       next to him)\n               Lays it on a little thick, doesn't\n               he?  If you ask me, he's one giant\n               bore.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt\n               about a food shortage.  Well you boys\n               are gonna be taken care of.  But in\n               the meantime we're gonna eat the\n               enemy for breakfast, we are gonna\n               eat the enemy for lunch, and we are\n               gonna eat the enemy for dinner!\n\n                         Z\n               Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.\n\n                         FORMICA\n                      (reflective moment)\n               Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.\n                      (he looks out at his\n                       army)\n               And I know each and every one of you\n               boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.\n\n     Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in\n     confusion.\n\n                         Z\n                      (clapping)\n               Bravo!

Let's\n               move 'em out!\n\n     The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past\n     the reviewing stand.\n\n     A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around\n     for the Princess.\n\n                         COLONEL\n               Eyes...left!\n\n     Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the\n     reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next\n     to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.\n\n                         Z\n                      (waving)\n               Princess!

Have a great\n               war!\n\n     Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's\n     surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're\n     carrying him along with them.\n\n                         Z\n               Hey!  Wait!\n\n     Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away.\n     BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails \"grunt\" soldier ant, taps Z on the\n     shoulder.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               You new, kid?\n\n                         Z\n               I just joined up.

Kid, when you join\n               this ant's army, you're in for the\n               full hitch.\n\n     At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor\n     they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the\n     OPEN AIR outside of the colony.\n\n     EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT\n\n     It's a starry, moonlit night.  The shadows crowd around the\n     panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the\n     march...\n\n                         Z\n               Wait a minute, there's been a\n               mistake!  I've got to get back to the\n               colony!\n\n     Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking\n     concerned, stops him.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               Are you crazy, kid?

TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT\n\n     Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE\n     CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here\n     it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts\n     an order.\n\n                         COLONEL\n               ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!\n\n     The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite\n     colony...Z is swept along...\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!\n\n     Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of\n     ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.\n     Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very\n     middle of the termite colony...\n\n     Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle\n     of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but\n     there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around\n     suspiciously.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               It's too damn quiet.\n\n     Then we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over,\n     and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's\n               got yer back.\n\n                         Z\n                      (petrified)\n               Maybe they went out for the evening.\n               Let's leave them a message and head\n               home.\n\n                         COLONEL\n                      (ignoring him)\n               Light it up!\n\n     A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and\n     pinches him.  The firefly, yelling \"Yipe!  Yipe!  Yipe!\",\n     shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of\n     the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.\n\n     Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like\n     innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the\n     stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of\n     hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the\n     tree, right onto the ant army.\n\n                         COLONEL\n               They're here!!!\n\n                         BARBATUS\n                      (to Z)\n               Keep your head down!\n\n     Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a\n     BLOODBATH.  The ants have broken into the colony, but are\n     taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing\n     termites.  The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as\n     something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's\n     perspective, we see:\n\n     -- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are\n     literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid\n     from its forehead...\n\n     -- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is\n     pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...\n\n     -- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one\n     and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...\n\n                         Z\n                      (looking around)\n               Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for\n               all of us to just talk this over!\n\n     Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to\n     face Z.  Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling\n     monstrosity.\n\n                         Z\n               Wait!  Please!

Z, terrified, dives into the hole\n     that the huge termite made...\n\n     INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n     ...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound.\n     The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with\n     jagged access holes.\n\n     No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes\n     burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's\n     head.  Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight\n     through the wall in order to escape...\n\n     INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n     ...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the\n     Queen's chamber.  This is nothing like the civilized court of\n     the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose\n     walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled\n     stones.\n\n     The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long\n     monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite\n     nurses.  The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.\n\n                         Z\n               Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I\n               was wondering if you could give me --\n\n     Before Z can say, \"directions\", the queen gives out a\n     piercing, blood-curdling shriek.  The nurses start shrieking\n     too.\n\n                         Z\n                      (backing away)\n               I'll let myself out.\n\n     But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the\n     biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z,\n     jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.\n\n                         Z\n                      (backing away)\n               Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro!\n\n     At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite\n     runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber.  As\n     if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and\n     shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin\n     to rumble...\n\n     The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone\n     falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and\n     collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.\n\n     As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and\n     termites pour into the room from the corridors around and\n     above...they keep struggling until...\n\n                         ANT OFFICER\n                      (points at Z)\n               He's killed their Queen!\n\n                         Z\n               Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --\n\n                         ANT OFFICER\n               VICTORY!!!\n\n     We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their\n     leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey\n     for the ants.\n\n                         Z\n                      (facetious)\n               This is terrific!

The ten or so ants standing directly below are\n     smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva\n     around the crater.  As quick as it appeared, the tongue\n     retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound.  We can now see\n     the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in\n     the ceiling high above...\n\n                         ANT OFFICER\n               INCOMING!\n\n     The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose\n     bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but\n     to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and\n     again...\n\n     Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down\n     again, barely missing him!\n\n     Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him,\n     across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting\n     closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants\n     and struggling termites...\n\n     ....Then the tongue disappears.  Silence.  Z wipes his brow...\n\n     And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater\n     searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down\n     the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it\n     ricochets along the walls!\n\n     Z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him,\n     reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana\n     Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark!  The walls disintegrate\n     under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to\n     Z...closer...\n\n     ...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down\n     to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form\n     of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final\n     contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.\n\n     EXT.

Then --\n\n     From a distance, we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING,\n     dopplering closer --\n\n     -- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit, right\n     into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly.\n\n     Bala sits up, coated in mud.

Bala looks stunned.\n\n     Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we\n     look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the\n     beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure\n     (a seven year old kid) holding it.\n\n     Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the\n     colony and runs the other way.\n\n                         BALA\n               I'm going!

Think of the vacation\n               potential!\n\n                         BALA\n               Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take\n               a nap.\n\n                         Z\n               Listen, \"Princess\", you can't order\n               me around.

It may not sound like much, but to Z\n     it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had\n     engulfed him.\n\n     Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the\n     droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down.\n     Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for\n     help.  But his screams are muffled in the water.\n\n                         BALA\n                      (annoyed)\n               Out here I'm just what?\n\n                         Z\n                      (through the water)\n               Hlllllllp!\n\n                         BALA\n                      (hands on hips)\n               Stop fooling around in there.\n\n     By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned\n     upside-down.  He manages to get one foreleg out of the\n     droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls\n     Bala in by the leg.\n\n                         BALA\n               Let me go!!!\n\n     But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet,\n     and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala\n     yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is\n     she's yelling through the water.\n\n     Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing,\n     alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries\n     to defend himself.  Finally all this commotion is enough to\n     make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing,\n     sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground.\n\n     They both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.\n\n                         BALA\n                      (chants to herself)\n               I'm going to be rescued soon.

Help me!!!\n\n     But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping,\n     ferris-wheel-like motion.  BOOM.  The sneaker on which Bala\n     is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on Z, too --\n\n                         Z\n               Bala!\n                      (mournfully)\n               I'll never see her again...\n\n     -- But he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing\n     Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --\n\n                         BALA\n               Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere!\n\n     -- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get\n     the bubblegum off her shoe...Z heart sinks as the shoe Bala's\n     stuck on lopes off into the distance...\n\n                         Z\n                      (thinks)\n               These things always come in twos...\n\n     He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --\n\n                         Z\n               Take me to your leader!\n\n     Z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment\n     catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe-lace.\n\n                         Z\n               Whoooooooaaaa!!!\n\n     The sneaker lifts off into the air, with Z holding on for\n     dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away\n     from Bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the\n     landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the\n     background...\n\n                         Z\n               Bala!  Come back here!\n\n     For a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it\n     descends again, in a stomach-churning, roller-coaster free-\n     fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again...\n\n                         BALA\n               Z!!!!!!!

The\n     sneaker rises again...\n\n                         BALA\n                      (emotional)\n               Z...if we don't make it...I just want\n               you to know....\n\n                         Z\n                      (touched)\n               Yes?\n\n                         BALA\n               This is all your fault!!!\n\n     The sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but\n     instead it just hovers there.  (The person wearing it is\n     balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum\n     with a penny).\n\n                         Z\n               We're safe...\n\n     Just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny\n     is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high.  The huge image\n     of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them.\n\n                         Z\n               Who the hell is that?!!!\n\n     The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker,\n     bringing Bala and Z along with it.  They're carried through\n     the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over\n     in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM...\n\n     ...and land with a CRASH in total darkness.\n\n     EXT.

She's\n     emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop\n     away gracefully.  Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage\n     area.  And above them and below them, peering from garbage\n     cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural\n     assortment of insects are regarding them.\n\n     A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts.\n\n                         FLY\n               What's with the bummer attitude?\n\n     A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in.\n\n                         BUTTERFLY\n               Yeah -- nobody stresses out in\n               Insectopia!\n\n                         BALA\n               Did you say...\n\n                         Z\n                      (joining Bala)\n               ...Insectopia?\n\n     Z and Bala look around.

Instead, we're looking at it through\n     ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise.  Not the\n     ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land\n     of plenty.\n\n     The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective\n     walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic,\n     thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the\n     pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a\n     gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into\n     the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which\n     appears as a multi-chambered concave dome.  Everywhere,\n     insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in\n     that's like an insect version of Woodstock.\n\n     Bala and Z are awe-struck.

Some workers surround the Queen\n     to protect her.

Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the\n     unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has\n     turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all\n     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and\n     now surround the army, dwarfing them.\n\n                         WASP\n               Are these hooligans giving you\n               trouble, Z?\n\n                         FLY\n               Say the word, Z, and we kick their\n               butts.\n\n     The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.\n     Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be\n     bulging out of his face.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               What are you doing?!

Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,\n     slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the\n     whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and\n     then tumbles over.\n\n     For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.\n\n                         FORMICA (O.S.)\n               Help...help me...\n\n     Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica\n     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,\n     which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes,\n     a new expression crossing his features: fear.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...\n\n     Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --\n     but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...\n\n     Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on\n     him.\n\n                         Z\n               I thought you said that the life of\n               one ant doesn't matter.\n\n     Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to\n     realize his error...\n\n                         FORMICA\n               I guess it does...to the ant.\n\n     Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z\n     and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a\n     nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).\n\n     Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while\n     HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala fights\n     her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then the\n     ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.\n\n     Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica,\n     carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the best\n     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen\n     general.\n\n                         CARPENTER\n               Sir, if it's any consolation, I still\n               think you're completely worthless as\n               an individual.\n\n                                              FADE TO:\n\n     CLOSE UP OF Z\n\n     As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.\n\n                         Z\n               So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just\n               your basic \"simple worker overthrows\n               the government and winds up with the\n               princess\" kind of a story.\n               You know: there was the big parade\n               and everything...\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\n\n     A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a medal by\n     the Queen.\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n     GENERAL FORMICA'S FACE, looking extremely dispeptic.\n\n                         Z (V.O.)\n               General Formica was almost\n               unemployable.  He eventually got a\n               gig as a honeydew keg.\n\n     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall, his belly\n     hideously distended with honeydew.\n\n                         Z (V.O.)\n               The Queen asked me to take over his\n               job, but I said \"Sorry, but I'm\n               really not the general type.  I'm\n               more the specific type.\"  So they\n               gave the job to Weaver instead.\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n     WEAVER, in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his\n     feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar.  Carpenter is on\n     his hands and knees scrubbing the floor.\n\n                         Z (V.O.)\n               Weaver cut the defense budget in\n               half.  Now we only have an army of\n               five million.\n\n     cut back to\n\n     Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE.\n\n                         Z\n               And me, I guess you could say that I\n               lived happily ever after.\n\n     Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him.\n\n                         Z\n               I mean, I've got the whole package,\n               right?  A great life, a beautiful\n               wife, and a few kids.\n\n                         BALA\n               A few?\n\n     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n     INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to\n     their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS.  The children cover\n     every horizontal surface.  They run around, cry, laugh, and\n     tease each other.  Z looks around the room, looks back at us,\n     and shrugs.\n\n                         Z\n               Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you\n               know?  I wouldn't change a thing.\n\n     The camera pulls up...and away from the ground...to reveal\n     that this whole story has been taking place in a small area\n     of CENTRAL PARK.  We pull back and back, and see all the\n     familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the\n     drinking fountain, etc.  We tilt up into the NEW YORK\n     SKYLINE.  BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH.\n\n     FADE OUT.\n\n     THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntz\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Todd Alcott\u00a0\u00a0Chris Weitz\u00a0\u00a0Paul Weitz\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Animation\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:33.014903"}
