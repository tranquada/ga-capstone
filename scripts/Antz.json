Suavely grabs the candle in a\n     glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face.\n\n     He plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit\n     apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her.\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               So uh -- how come I haven't seen you\n               around here before?\n\n<b>                         BALA\n</b>                      (covering up)\n               I work in the palace, I don't get out\n               much.\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               The palace, hunh?

With a suave\n     expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter\n     mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.\n\n<b>                         BALA\n</b>               Are you sure this is a real dance?\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of\n               making it up --\n\n<b>                         BALA\n</b>                      (surprised)\n               Really?\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               Why should everyone dance the same\n               way?

For a moment, the two of\n     them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little <u>too</u>\n     wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their\n     intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost\n     knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's\n     back at the moment.\n\n<b>                         SOLDIER\n</b>               Hey!  Watch your step, <u>worker</u>.\n\n     Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE,\n     glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got\n     one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed\n     off.\n\n<b>                         BALA\n</b>               You watch yours, soldier, or my\n               worker friend will beat you up!\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>                      (terrified)\n               Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off\n               this time.\n                      (whispering to Bala)\n               Are you crazy?

He doesn't want\n     to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to\n     lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered\n     around, looking hostile.\n\n<b>                         SOLDIER\n</b>               How come you don't dance like the\n               rest of us?\n\n     Z glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he\n     says defiantly...\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               Because -- because I'm an <u>individual</u>!\n\n<b>                         SOLDIER #2\n</b>               An individual?

Unfortunately, just at\n     this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him\n     back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it,\n     there's a regular <u>bar brawl</u> going on, with Weaver in the\n     middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the\n     face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess'\n     handmaidens hurries over.\n\n<b>                         HANDMAIDEN #1\n</b>               Princess Bala!

I'll make you\n               a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader\n               Z, and you survive.\n\n     This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers.\n\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b>               But if you don't hand him over,\n               you're <u>all</u> going to die, each and\n               every single...\"individual\" one of\n               you.\n\n     The workers all look at each other.\n\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b>               What shall it be, workers?\n\n     The workers remain frightened but silent.  Z trembles,\n     terrified.\n\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b>               Have it your way.\n\n     As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack, a\n     lone figure steps out from the crowd.\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               Wait...\n\n     Z stands there, shivering with fear.\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               ...I'm Z.\n\n     For a moment, Z stands alone, under the glare of Formica's\n     gaze.\n\n     Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers.\n\n<b>                         WEAVER\n</b>               No, <u>I'm</u> Z.\n\n     Z turns, astonished, to see Weaver, still and unwavering,\n     bravely risking his life for his friend.  Then, AZTECA also\n     steps forward.\n\n<b>                         AZTECA\n</b>               <u>I'm</u> Z!\n\n     Next, Bala comes forward.\n\n<b>                         BALA\n</b>               No, <u>I'm</u> Z.\n\n     More and more ants step forward.\n\n<b>                         WORKERS\n</b>               I'm Z!

I am Z!  I am Z!\n\n     Z is plainly flabbergasted.  Formica is outraged.  He gives\n     the signal.\n\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b><b>               ATTACK!\n</b>\n     The army swells forward on all sides, pushing the workers\n     towards the swirling water.  Some workers surround the Queen\n     to protect her.  All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia\n     alights on the rim of the horizon.\n\n<b>                         FLY\n</b>               Hey, guys!\n\n     THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.\n\n<b>                         WASP\n</b>               It's them!\n\n     Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the\n     ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford\n     film.  Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the\n     unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has\n     turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all\n     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and\n     now surround the army, dwarfing them.\n\n<b>                         WASP\n</b>               Are these hooligans giving you\n               trouble, Z?\n\n<b>                         FLY\n</b>               Say the word, Z, and we kick their\n               butts.\n\n     The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.\n     Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be\n     bulging out of his face.\n\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b>               What are you doing?!

With\n     his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and\n<b>     CHARGES Z!\n</b>\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b><b>               AHHHHHHH!!\n</b>\n     Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet\n     blows off his head.  Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,\n     slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the\n     whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and\n     then tumbles over.\n\n     For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.\n\n<b>                         FORMICA (O.S.)\n</b>               Help...help me...\n\n     Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica\n     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,\n     which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes,\n     a new expression crossing his features: fear.\n\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b>               Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...\n\n     Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --\n     but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...\n\n     Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on\n     him.\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               I thought you said that the life of\n               one ant doesn't matter.\n\n     Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to\n     realize his error...\n\n<b>                         FORMICA\n</b>               I guess it does...to the ant.\n\n     Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z\n     and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a\n     nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).\n\n     Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while\n     HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala fights\n     her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then the\n     ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.\n\n     Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica,\n     carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the best\n     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen\n     general.\n\n<b>                         CARPENTER\n</b>               Sir, if it's any consolation, I still\n               think you're completely worthless as\n               an individual.\n\n<b>                                              FADE TO:\n</b>\n<b>     CLOSE UP OF Z\n</b>\n     As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.\n\n<b>                         Z\n</b>               So, uh, that's pretty much it.
