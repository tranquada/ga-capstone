We move thru the second\n        doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room.\n\n        Mrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room.

We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring.  The symbols on the\n        ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave.\n\n        Cooper seems concerned.\n\n<b>                                  COOPER\n</b>                                (to camera)\n                        Don't take the ring...

Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her\n        mother's distant call.  Still holding the ring she gets out of bed\n        and goes to her door and slowly opens it.\n\n        It is dark on the other side of the door.\n\n<b>        AT THE DOORWAY OF LAURA'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n        In the doorway Laura gets a strange feeling in back of her and turns\n        to look at Mrs. Tremond's picture.

She looks\n        in her hand and the ring is gone.\n\n        Laura gets out of bed and goes to Mrs. Tremond's picture hanging on\n        the wall.  She stares at it.

With\n        Laura tied up, Leo starts to tie up Ronette.\n\n<b>                                                        DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>215.    INT.

Leo gets up and goes for the bottle of\n        bourbon.

Jacques stands up and decks Leo with his\n        big French Canadian paw.  He grabs the spilling bottle from the floor\n        and stumbles outside.\n\n<b>216.    EXT.

He sees Jacques bleeding on\n        the ground.  He panics and weaves down the hill to his corvette and\n        takes off.\n\n        Leland goes into the cabin.  His smiling eyes are on Laura while he\n        rapes Ronette.  Laura watches as her fear drives her to hysteria.\n\n<b>217.    EXT./INT.

He digs into his pockets\n        for the pages torn from Laura's secret diary.  he tosses them and\n        the bloody towel to the wind.\n\n        He goes to the centre of the circle of the twelve sycamore trees.\n        The red curtains appear and he passes between them entering the red\n        Room.\n\n<b>229.
