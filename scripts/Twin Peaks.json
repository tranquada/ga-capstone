I'd like to see Sheriff Cable.\n\n        Cliff just smiles for a long minute.\n\n                                   CLIFF\n                        Why don't you folks have a seat.  Make\n                        yourself at home.  It's gonna be a while.\n\n        Desmond stays standing and Stanley sits.  After another long moment,\n        Cliff joins the SECRETARY in a conspiratorial giggle over the long\n        wait they are planning to give the FBI.  In the middle of a giggle\n        Cliff smiles up at Desmond.\n\n                             CLIFF (continued)\n                        Why don't you have some of that coffee.\n                        It was fresh two days ago.\n\n        Cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary\n        pretending to look at some paper work.  They both laugh.\n\n                                  DESMOND\n                        Okay, that's it.  I've had enough of the\n                        waiting room now.\n\n                                   CLIFF\n                              (still smiling)\n                        Oh.\n\n        Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to Sheriff\n        Cable's office.\n\n        Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to\n        do something.  While they stare eye to eye, Desmond's hand goes up\n        slowly towards Cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way.  Cliff tries\n        to knock Chet's hand away.  Chet counters by grabbing Cliff's nose\n        and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great amount\n        of pain.\n\n                             CLIFF (continued)\n                        AAAHHHHHHHH...\n\n        Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of\n        the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down into a\n        chair.\n\n        While the Deputy's eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the secretary.\n\n                                  DESMOND\n                        You can start that FRESH pot of coffee\n                        right now.\n\n        Desmond stalks to Sheriff Cable's office.  Stanley remains behind\n        continuing to observe every detail.\n\n15.     INT.  SHERIFF CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n        SHERIFF CABLE looks up from his work.\n\n                                   CABLE\n                        How the hell did you...\n\n        Desmond shows his credentials.\n\n                                  DESMOND\n                        Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special\n                        Agent Chet Desmond.\n\n        Cliff, still holding his nose, appears just behind Desmond, who turns\n        to him.\n\n                            DESMOND (continued)\n                        That's all right, Deputy, Sheriff Cable\n                        can take it from here\n\n        Cable signals Cliff to leave.\n\n                            DESMOND (continued)\n                        I'm here to investigate the murder of\n                        Teresa Banks.\n\n                                   CABLE\n                        Well, little fella, we don't need any\n                        outside help here.  I don't like you\n                        people sniffin' around my neck of the\n                        woods.  In fact, when the state boys\n                        called me about a \"J. Edgar\" coming up I\n                        think I said, \"So what?\"\n\n                                  DESMOND\n                        Your behavior is not funny and is\n                        wasting the time of the Federal\n                        Government.\n\n                                   CABLE\n                        You're lucky I am not wasting you.\n\n                                  DESMOND\n                        Well, little fella, let me put it this way.\n                        The operative word here would be\n                        \"Federal\".  With or without the\n                        semantics of all this, I am now ordering\n                        you to release all pertinent information\n                        concerning Teresa Banks, both while\n                        living and deceased.\n\n        Cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects.\n        He throws it to Desmond.\n\n                                   CABLE\n                        A basic kill.  Banks was a drifter and\n                        nobody knew her.  My boys have been all\n                        over this.  It's a dead end.\n\n                                  DESMOND\n                        That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable.\n                        Where's the body?\n\n                                   CABLE\n                        Out back in our morgue\n\n        Desmond starts to leave.\n\n                             CABLE (continued)\n                        It's 4:30.

We'll lock up.\n\n        As Desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed Newspaper\n        clipping with picture.\n\n        The caption reads:\n\n                            \"CABLE BENDS STEEL\"\n\n        The newspaper shows a picture of Cable in a He-Man pose bending a\n        steel BAR into a U shape.  He turns to leave and Stanley seems to\n        have appeared right on time.  Desmond moves down the hall and Stanley\n        follows.\n\n16.     EXT.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY\n\n        As Desmond and Stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of\n        steel BARS similar to the one they saw Cable bending in the picture.\n\n        AT THE MORGUE DOOR\n\n        Stanley moves up to Desmond and speaks confidentially.\n\n                                  STANLEY\n                        You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this\n                        whole office, furniture included, is\n                        worth 27,000 dollars.\n\n        Desmond doesn't know what to say to him.  They enter the morgue.\n\n17.     INT.  TINY MORGUE - DAY\n\n        Teresa's body is on the platform in the middle of the room,  Stanley\n        hangs his recorder on the hooks at the end of the autopsy table and\n        puts on rubber gloves.  Desmond opens Teresa Banks file.\n\n                                  DESMOND\n                                 (reading)\n                        Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon\n                        Trailer Park for a month.

Desmond walks over and around\n        Cliff's red trailer.  He gets a strange feeling.  He looks past\n        Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a\n        HAND appear in the window of a trailer.  Then the hand disappears.\n\n        Desmond walks to that trailer.  He knocks on the door but no one\n        answers.  He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_\n        _a_small_indentation_at_the_top_.  In the indentation is _Teresa_\n        _Bank's_ring_.

The clues that\n                        were found by Agent Desmond and Agent\n                        Stanley have lead to dead ends.  The\n                        letter below the fingernail gives me the\n                        feeling that the killer will strike again.\n                        But like the song says, \"...who knows\n                        where or when\".\n\n39.

INT.  LAURA'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n        The clock reads:  11:30.  Laura's hands open the window and release\n        the screen.  Laura silently sneaks out the window and down the side\n        of her house.\n\n81.     EXT.  SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - LATER\n\n        A big semi comes to a stop at a wide spot in the road.  Laura climbs\n        into the truck.\n\n82.     INT.  TRUCK - SAME\n\n        The TRUCKER smiles.  Eager.\n\n                                  TRUCKER\n                        Friend of Leo's, right?  Partyland?\n\n        Laura begins to unbutton her blouse.  Turns and sneaks a toot of\n        cocaine.\n\n                            TRUCKER (continued)\n                              (catching her)\n                        Wait a minute.  Leo says this is my\n                        party.\n\n        Laura puts her hand between his legs.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        If you can fuck and drive the party\n                        starts right now.\n\n        Momentarily taken aback, the trucker stares at her.  Laura takes his\n        hand and puts it on the gear shift.\n\n                             LAURA (continued)\n                        You shift that one.  This one's mine.\n\n        She climbs over on top of him.\n\n83.     EXT.  THE TRUCK - SAME\n\n        The stack blows.  The truck rolls away onto the road.  We watch it as\n        it moans into the distance - the sound slowly diminishing and fading.\n\n        Natures' nighttime sounds take over.  Finally, we hear the _hooting_\n        _of_an_owl_.\n\n84.     EXT.  PHILADELPHIA FBI OFFICE - DAY\n\n        Reestablish.\n\n85.     INT.

EXT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON\n\n        Establish.\n\n87.     INT.  DOUBLE R DINER - AFTERNOON\n\n        Laura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her \"Meals on Wheels\"\n        on the counter.\n\n        On screen it reads:\n\n                        \"FRIDAY - SIX DAYS BEFORE\"\n\n        NORMA JENNINGS and SHELLY JOHNSON watch from the cash register.\n        Shelly is ringing someone out, handing back their change.\n\n                                   NORMA\n                        Shelly, would you give Laura a quick\n                        hand with the \"Meals on Wheels\"?\n\n                                  SHELLY\n                        I'm kind of busy, Norma.\n\n                                   NORMA\n                        You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.\n\n        With a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove, Norma moves\n        Shelly towards Laura who is at the end of the counter.\n\n        The door opens to the Diner and ED and NADINE HURLEY come in.  Nadine\n        stops when she sees Norma.\n\n                                  NADINE\n                        I changed my mind, I don't want any\n                        coffee, Eddie.\n\n        Nadine goes out.

THE DOUBLE R - DAY\n\n        Shelly loads her stuff in the back.  She returns to the diner and\n        Laura follows doing the same.\n\n        As Laura places her dinners in the back something catches her eye and\n        she turns.\n\n        LAURA'S POV\n\n        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring\n        at Laura.  Mrs. Tremond waves to Laura to come over.  When Laura comes\n        to them Mrs. Tremond holds out a framed picture.\n\n                                  TREMOND\n                        This would look nice on your wall.\n\n        She hands Laura the picture.  It is a picture of a room with flowered\n        wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner.  Laura's study of it is\n        interrupted by the grandson.\n\n                                 GRANDSON\n                        He's looking for a book with pages torn\n                        out.  He's walking towards the hiding\n                        place.  He's moving under the fan now.\n\n        ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n        Shelly comes out of the Diner with another load of meals.  Laura turns\n        back to her and then back to the Tremonds, who are walking away from\n        her and are farther away than they realistically could be.  Laura\n        comes to Shelly in a panic.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        Shelly, you really can help me.  I can't\n                        do the \"Meals on Wheels\" today.

She studies\n        the empty diner.  After a while the cook, TOAD, calls from the\n        kitchen.  A distant forlorn call.\n\n                                   TOAD\n                        Kind of quiet.\n\n        CLOSEUP:  ON NORMA\n\n        She starts to cry.\n\n90.     EXT.

Her house suddenly looks very frightening to\n        her.  She slowly crosses her front yard and enters the house.\n\n91.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE - DAY\n\n        Laura comes in the front door still holding the picture.  She crosses\n        thru the dining room.\n\n92.     INT.  PALMER HOUSE, STAIRS - DAY\n\n        Laura moves ever so slowly up the stairs - the fan still and silent\n        above her.\n\n        At the top of the stairs, she stops and stares at her bedroom door.\n        Her whole body is shaking.  Her hand goes out in front of her.  She\n        touches her bedroom door and inches it open.\n\n93.     INT.  LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n        The opening of the door reveals more and more of her room.  Suddenly\n        it reveals Bob standing in her room at her dresser.  He has pulled\n        the dresser away from the wall looking for something.\n\n        ON BOB\n\n        He is frozen.  Smiling at her.\n\n        ON THE SCENE\n\n        With a scream, Laura bolts from her room.\n\n94.     EXT.

PALMER'S NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE\n\n        Laura runs across two yards to a large tree and falls to her knees,\n        crying.  She looks up and sees her father come out the front door of\n        her house.  She watches him cross to his car and drive away.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                             (frantic whisper)\n                        What?  It can't be...  It can't be him...  no...\n                        no...\n\n        Laura is coming apart, sobbing.  Behind her, on the sidewalk,\n        a NEIGHBOR has noticed her.\n\n                                   WOMAN\n                        Laura...\n\n        A closer look reveals how upset Laura is.\n\n                                   WOMAN\n                        What...  Laura are you all right?\n\n        Laura turns away so the woman can't see her crying.  The woman takes\n        a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                       (trying to hold it together)\n                        I...  lost my necklace...  it must have\n                        fallen.\n\n        Laura mimes that she has found her gold half-heart necklace.  She\n        pretends to be clasping her gold half-heart necklace which was already\n        around her neck.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                                (clumsily)\n                        Oh, here it is.\n\n        Woman moves back to the sidewalk.\n\n                                   WOMAN\n                        Well, I'm glad you found it, darling.\n\n        Slowly, Laura stands and moves away - leaving Mrs. Tremond's picture\n        on the grass under the tree.\n\n96.

She turns off the light and\n        stares at the picture in the dark.\n\n                                                        DISSOLVE TO:\n\n111.    INT.  LAURA PALMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n        She is asleep.\n\n112.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE\n\n        We hold on the picture.  As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move\n        into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark\n        doorway in the room in the picture.\n\n        On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room.\n        Mrs. Tremond is standing in that room.  She is beckoning us towards\n        her and beyond her thru yet another doorway.  We move thru the second\n        doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room.\n\n        Mrs. Tremond's grandson is standing in that room.  He is holding his\n        hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball.  As we\n        move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there\n        and we move thru that into...\n\n113.    INT.  RED ROOM\n\n        The MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE walks into the red room to a table.\n        A ring lies upon the table.\n\n        COOPER ENTERS THE RED ROOM.  The Man From Another Place turns toward\n        Cooper.\n\n                          MAN FROM ANOTHER PLACE\n                        Is it future?  Or is it past?...  Do you\n                        know who I am?...  I am the Arm...  And I\n                        sound like this...\n\n        The Man From Another Place puts his hand in front of his lips and\n        makes an Indian Whooping sound.\n\n        The Man From Another Place picks up the ring and moves it very close\n        to us.  We recognize it as Teresa Banks' ring.  The symbols on the\n        ring are identical to the symbols of Owl Cave.\n\n        Cooper seems concerned.\n\n                                  COOPER\n                                (to camera)\n                        Don't take the ring...  Laura, don't take\n                        the ring.\n\n        The Man From Another Place moves the ring towards us till the ring\n        fills the screen.\n\n114.    BACK IN LAURA'S ROOM\n\n        Laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise.  She tries\n        to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep.  She moves it with\n        her right arm.\n\n        SFX: THE NOISE\n\n        It sounds as if someone is calling her name.\n\n        ON LAURA\n\n        She turns to her right to see who it is, then turning back to her left\n        she discovers ANNIE BLACKBURN lying in bed with her.  Annie has blood\n        around her mouth.  She tries to raise herself and strains to speak.\n\n                                   ANNIE\n                        My name is Annie.  I've been with Laura\n                        and Dale.  The good Dale is in the lodge\n                        and he can't leave.  Write it in your\n                        diary.\n\n        ON LAURA'S DOOR\n\n        Her mother calls her name.  The sound is distant and mournful.\n\n        ON LAURA\n\n        Laura looks towards her door then turns back to Annie but she is gone.\n        Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring.\n        SHE SCREAMS.  Again, her attention is drawn to her door and her\n        mother's distant call.  Still holding the ring she gets out of bed\n        and goes to her door and slowly opens it.\n\n        It is dark on the other side of the door.\n\n        AT THE DOORWAY OF LAURA'S BEDROOM\n\n        In the doorway Laura gets a strange feeling in back of her and turns\n        to look at Mrs. Tremond's picture.  There in the picture is Laura\n        (herself) in the doorway looking back into the darkened rooms where\n        Mrs. Tremond and her grandson were.\n\n115.    MRS. TREMOND'S PICTURE\n\n        Laura is in the picture.  In the picture Laura turns around in the\n        doorway of the picture and looks down at her room.\n\n116.    LAURA'S PICTURE POV OF HER ROOM\n\n        Laura sees herself asleep in her bed.\n\n        CLOSEUP: LAURA\n\n        Asleep in her bed.\n\n        ON THE SCENE\n\n        She wakes up from her dream.  Trying to clear her head.  Looks at the\n        photo and nothing is there -- looks like the day before.  She looks\n        in her hand and the ring is gone.\n\n        Laura gets out of bed and goes to Mrs. Tremond's picture hanging on\n        the wall.  She stares at it.  She slowly takes it off the wall and\n        places it in the trash.  Trembling she does two lines of cocaine.\n\n                                                        DISSOLVE TO:\n\n117.

He beeps out a signal on the bike's horn.\n        After a beat Laura runs out to him.\n\n                                   JAMES\n                        Where were you last night?

Looks at Laura and James.\n        Laura can feel him staring.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        I gotta go.\n\n        James just looks at her then guns his bike and roars away.\n\n        Laura walks back to the front door where her father stands.\n\n                                  LELAND\n                        Who was that?\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        A friend from school.\n\n                                  LELAND\n                        A special friend?\n\n        Laura looks at her Dad, eyeball to eyeball for a moment.  Then she\n        walks past him to the stairs.\n\n118.    INT.

Her hand is cooling on Laura's head.\n        Laura moves in behind it.  Pushing the cool hand into her face and\n        forehead.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                                (whispers)\n                        Margaret?\n\n                                 LOG LADY\n                        The tender bows of innocence burn first\n                        and the wind rises - then all goodness\n                        is in jeopardy.\n\n        They look into each other's eyes.

On stage a SINGER sings.\n\n        As Laura comes in she makes eye contact with Jacques Renault who is\n        behind the bar.  Laura sits at a table.\n\n        Jacques nods to a COUPLE of BURLY TRUCKERS who come over to Laura\n        with drinks.  One of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine\n        inside.\n\n                                  TRUCKER\n                        Let's go around the world, babe.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        This isn't going to get you to Walla-\n                        Walla.\n\n        They all take a drink.\n\n                                  TRUCKER\n                        You do go all the way, don't you, little\n                        girl?\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        Sooner or later.\n\n        Laura reaches below the table grabbing him hard by the balls.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        You willing to go all the way?

Donna comes in\n        just as a beautiful song of lost love begins.\n\n        Laura and Donna see each other -- As the truckers toss down bourbons\n        and beer chasers, Laura gets _lost_in_the_song_and_starts_to_cry_.\n        Donna just stares at her from the other side of the Roadhouse.\n\n        AFTER THE SONG\n\n        Donna stands and walks over to Laura's table.  She reaches down,\n        picks up one of the trucker's bourbons and downs it.\n\n                                   DONNA\n                        Let's boogie.\n\n                                  TRUCKER\n                                (to Donna)\n                        You part of the deal?\n\n                                   LAURA\n                            (answering for her)\n                        No, she isn't.\n\n        Laura and Donna stare at each other.  For Donna's benefit, Laura\n        turns and gives a big, juicy French kiss to one of the truckers.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                             (to the trucker)\n                        What was your name again?\n\n                                  TRUCKER\n                        Buck.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        Buck, that was really nice.\n\n        Donna grabs Buck's buddy, TOMMY, and gives him the same type kiss.\n\n                             LAURA (continued)\n                              (very serious)\n                        All right, Donna.

Donna reaches forward to the front dash and\n        turns the radio up full blast.  Buck and Tommy start to whoop and\n        yodel like cowboys.\n\n        Buck does an Indian whoop in Laura's face.  Laura freezes in horror.\n\n131.

Several\n        big rigs shadow the lot.  They all pop out of Buck's car sporting\n        \"long necks\".\n\n        Laura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see Donna watching.\n        Buck circles Donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose.\n\n                                   DONNA\n                        No.\n                             (turns to Laura)\n                        I don't need to take this to be you\n                        friend.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        YES YOU DO, DONNA.

On it a three\n        piece HELL-METAL BAND is building up toward oblivion.  The LEAD SINGER\n        is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo\n        head and horns.  He wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots.\n\n        Some HALF DRESSED GIRLS and COWBOYS are dancing to the band.  In\n        darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the\n        band to oblivion.\n\n        Laura leans over to Donna noticing her shocked look.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        Don't expect a turkey dog in here.\n\n        Jacques Renault comes up to the group.\n\n                                  JACQUES\n                        Hey, slow pokes, guess what?

He mimes a gun with his right\n        hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak,\n        slack cheeked puff sound.\n\n                                  JACQUES\n                                 (slurred)\n                        I am as blank as a fart.\n\n        Laura winks at Buck as he SECRETLY drops a red depth charge into\n        Donna's beer.\n\n                                   LAURA\n                        Hey, Donna, chug-a-lug.\n\n        As the cowboys gather around and begin to chant, both Laura and Donna\n        chug down their drinks.  They finish and Laura smiles and pushes\n        Donna out onto the dance floor.\n\n        They start to dance expertly and smile at each other.  Soon Buck and\n        Tommy cut in separating the two.\n\n        Buck dances Laura over to ANOTHER of his buddies.  The two of them\n        start to unbutton Laura's blouse as they dance.\n\n        The hell-metal band kicks into high gear.  In the pulsating red and\n        black light Donna sees Laura now topless dancing and kissing with\n        Buck and his friend.  Donna stops.

Through some dancing legs and feet she\n        spots Laura's blouse on the floor.  Teetering she leans over, picks\n        up the blouse, and ties it around her waist.\n\n        RONETTE PULASKI, flying high, makes her way through the crowd to\n        Laura.

For\n                        instance, I don't eat fish eyes.\n\n                                   JOSIE\n                        Fish eyes?\n\n                                  TRUMAN\n                        Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't\n                        eat a fish eye.\n\n                                   JOSIE\n                        Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?\n\n                                  TRUMAN\n                        I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in\n                        Seattle.  He was digging through his\n                        food with his chopsticks for about five\n                        minutes till he found the fish eye and he\n                        dropped it into his throat.  I guess it\n                        must have gotten stuck in his uvula\n                        because right away he started to have\n                        trouble.  His throat began to flutter\n                        there like there was a wind blowing.\n                        And he couldn't swallow and they rushed\n                        to him and loosened his collar and they\n                        were asking him if he was alright and\n                        he started to turn blue and his eyes\n                        started to roll back into his head and he\n                        still couldn't get the fish eye out and\n                        they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver.  I\n                        went over to him as they were\n                        preparing to do an emergency\n                        tracheotomy.  They were over him with\n                        a knife when he suddenly shot the fish\n                        eye out of his throat and right onto the\n                        ceiling.  Splat!  It just stuck up there\n                        and spread out.  It was about the size of\n                        a half dollar.  And that's why I don't ever\n                        eat fish eyes.\n\n        He plays the guitar for Josie.  Then stops.\n\n                            TRUMAN (continued)\n                        I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's\n                        just the way I feel.  It's the custom\n                        thing I was thinking of.  In America we\n                        don't use any part of the fish but the\n                        meat just to the side of the insides.  We\n                        throw away the tail, the rest of the\n                        insides and the head.\n\n                                   JOSIE\n                        I understand.\n\n                                  TRUMAN\n                        We throw away the _whole_ head.\n\n141.

Something\n                        is burning.\n\n        Leland turns and gives her a look.\n\n        The car that was tailing them races around them, races around the\n        logging truck, and comes back around stopping on Leland's side of\n        the car.\n\n        Leland spots Gerard, the one armed man, behind the wheel - sweating\n        like crazy.\n\n                             LAURA (continued)\n                        Something is burning.\n\n        Leland starts to rev his engine while holding the brake with his left\n        foot.\n\n                                  LELAND\n                        It's the engine.\n\n                                  GERARD\n                        You stole the corn.  I had it canned\n                        above the store.\n\n        Leland is panicked.

There was a closeness.  Like\n                        the formica table top.\n\n        The car is now smoking and making a horrendous sound.  Gerard\n        continues to yell, but we can barely hear it.\n\n                                  GERARD\n                        The thread will be torn, Mr. Palmer, the\n                        thread will be torn.\n\n        Leland turns to Laura.  Sweat pours from his forehead.\n\n        While Leland is turned away, Gerard holds up his hand with a ring on\n        the little finger.  He is shouting over the engine noise and the horn\n        which Leland has begun to blow frantically.\n\n                                  GERARD\n                                (shouting)\n                        It's him.

As soon as\n        the logging truck moves Leland lets go of the brake and the car flies\n        into a service station on their right.

He sees Jacques bleeding on\n        the ground.  He panics and weaves down the hill to his corvette and\n        takes off.\n\n        Leland goes into the cabin.

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n        A NURSE mops the sweat from Annie's forehead.  Annie tries to get\n        thru to her.\n\n                                   ANNIE\n                        My name is Annie.  I've been with Laura\n                        and Dale.  The good Dale is in the lodge\n                        and he can't leave.  Write it in your\n                        diary.\n\n        The nurse pats Annie's forehead and takes her hand.  We see\n        _TERESA/LAURA'S_RING_ on Annie's ring finger.  The nurse gently\n        slides the ring off Annie's finger.\n\n235.    INT.  ANOTHER ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL\n\n        The nurse enters.  With an anticipatory smile, then a selfish laugh,\n        she puts the ring on her finger.\n\n236.    INT.  HOTEL ROOM, GREAT NORTHERN - NIGHT\n\n        Doc Hayward and Sheriff Truman watch the door of the bathroom\n        anxiously.\n\n                                  TRUMAN\n                        Coop...

INSIDE THE BATHROOM\n\n        Cooper, in his pajamas, lies on the floor.  The mirror above the sink\n        is shattered with blood all over it and the sink.  Cooper smiles up\n        at them strangely.\n\n                                  COOPER\n                            (smiling strangely)\n                        I slipped and hit my head on the mirror.\n                        The glass broke as it struck my head.\n                                 (laughs)\n                        It struck me as funny, Harry.  Do you\n                        understand me, Harry, it struck me as\n                        funny.\n\n                                    DOC\n                        You are going right back to bed.\n\n        Doc and Truman help Cooper up.\n\n                                  COOPER\n                        But I haven't brushed my teeth yet.\n\n        Cooper smiles at the uneasy pair.\n\n238.    BLACK LODGE/RED ROOM\n\n        Laura is sitting in a chair.  As the end credits begin...\n\n        We move back to see that Laura is sitting in Cooper's lap in the\n        same chair.\n\n                                                        FADE OUT.\n\n                                  THE END\n\n\n\n\nTwin Peaks\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Mark Frost\u00a0\u00a0David Lynch\u00a0\u00a0Robert Engels\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:37:44.313367"}
