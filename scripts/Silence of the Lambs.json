She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with \n               concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, \n               very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy \n               windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a \n               navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, \n               hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left \n               hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.\n\n               CLOSE ON\n\n               A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its \n               knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and \n               the door bursts open.\n\n               WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT\n\n               as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She \n               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at \n               the ready in both hands...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the \n               edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, \n               hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled \n               MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a \n               rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her...\n\n               Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Freeze! FBI!\n\n               CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION\n\n               all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with \n               a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his \n               hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not \n               pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers...\n\n               THE SUSPECT'S HANDS\n\n               are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use \n               it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which \n               registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, \n               drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -\n\n               THE \"HOSTAGE\"\n\n               pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW \n               MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, \n               flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar \n               in these close quarters, but -\n\n               Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is \n               already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -\n\n               THE \"HOSTAGE\"\n\n               pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still \n               in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one \n               knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case \n               of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill \n               blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal \n               ACTION and SOUND are restored.\n\n                                     BRIGHAM (O.S.)\n                         Okay, people, good exercise...\n\n               Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten.\n\n               PULLING BACK\n\n               we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the \"hotel \n               room\" and its \"corridor\" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM \n               walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex-\n               Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says \"Firearms Instructor / \n               FBI Academy.\"\n\n                                     BRIGHAM\n                         Starling's reaction time was \n                         excellent. Let's break. Critique in \n                         five.\n\n               A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, \n               begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. \n\n               Clarice nods amiably to the \"Suspect\", then gives her \n               \"Hostage\" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her \n               broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both \n               remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of \n               southern accent.\n\n                                     ARDELIA\n                         Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                              (indicating her gun)\n                         Never cock.

He frowns good-naturedly.\n\n                                     BRIGHAM\n                         What're you laughin' at, Junior G-\n                         Man? She got off four rounds to your \n                         two.\n\n               He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her \n               palm.\n\n                                     BRIGHAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         One hundred reps, each hand, every \n                         day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief \n                         wants to see you.\n\n               He nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile \n               finally fading, looks out into the auditorium.\n\n               SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD\n\n               sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He \n               is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through \n               the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one \n               arm.\n\n               Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof \n               vest, follows her worried gaze.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         What'd I do?\n\n                                     ARDELIA\n                         Stay cool.

FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY\n\n               Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, \n               as Clarice joins him. He looks tired, haunted. Between master \n               and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.\n\n                                     CRAWFORD\n                         Starling, Clarice M., good morning.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Good morning, Mr. Crawford.\n\n                                     CRAWFORD\n                         Your instructors tell me you're doing \n                         well.

His driver stamps on a cigarette, \n               climbs in behind the wheel.

She gives a little cry, touching her \n               fingers to the wetness.

Her breathing is shallow, \n               very labored. Crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a \n               long moment, tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into \n               place, then bends over to kiss her forehead.

YOW (O.S.)\n                         You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         That wasn't me.\n\n                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)\n                         Oh.\n\n               Clarice crawls a bit further. There's hardly room to stand, \n               but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away \n               cobwebs, next to the car. Holding her light under one arm, \n               she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending \n               with the car. Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, \n               she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof. The resulting \n               clouds of dust make her cough.\n\n               THE CAR\n\n               is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard. It's very dusty, despite \n               the tarp. Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, \n               but there's a narrow gap in them. More mousy RUSTLINGS.\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight.\n\n               HER POV - SHIFTING\n\n               as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... \n               as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled \n               lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, \n               high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin \n               evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs.\n\n               Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks \n                         like somebody is sitting in this \n                         car.\n\n                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)\n                         Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better \n                         come out now, Miss Starling.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Not yet! - just wait for me.\n                              (under the breath)\n                         Maybe in about two seconds.\n\n               She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the \n               gap, then tries the door handle. Locked. So is the front \n               door. She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle \n               of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac. \n               She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends \n               the tip into a hook.\n\n               CLOSE ANGLE\n\n               as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back \n               passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the \n               inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK.\n\n               Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't \n               open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her \n               flashlight.\n\n               HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM\n\n               revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in \n               white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other \n               atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands \n               of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white \n               neck stub of a female mannequin. No face or head.\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               sighs with relief. She takes a couple more FLASHES, then \n               very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by \n               the corners, and setting it atop the car. Then she eases \n               herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK \n               loudly.\n\n               ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh. \n\n               Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard. \n               She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic \n               elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as \n               she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening \n               bag's drawstring.\n\n               A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded \n               material slides away.\n\n               Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart-\n               pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more \n               closely.\n\n               The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory \n               specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, \n               by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, \n               into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeared \n               badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself \n               quickly regaining control. She murmurs to herself.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas \n                         anymore.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING)\n\n               A loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates \n               the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum.\n\n               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs \n               through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard \n               admits her.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Why, Dr. Lecter?\n\n               The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making \n               her jump up. In its tray is a clean, folded white towel. She \n               hesitates, then crosses, takes this.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Thank you.\n\n               She sits again, rubbing her wet hair. When he finally speaks, \n               he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the \n               shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering TV light.\n\n                                     DR.

I want \n                         a window where I can see a tree, or \n                         even water. I want to be in a federal \n                         institution, away from Chilton - and \n                         I want a view. I'll give good value \n                         for it. Crawford could do that for \n                         me, but he won't. You persuade him.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                              (almost a whisper)\n                         Who killed your patient?\n\n                                     DR.

CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - \n               NIGHT\n\n               CATHERINE MARTIN takes a long toke from a bong pipe. She is \n               21, a tall, big-boned, rather fleshy girl with long brown \n               fair. Her head is on the lap of her boyfriend, CODY; they're \n               sprawled on a couch in the den of her well-furnished \n               apartment. The TV in on, with low SOUND.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         This stuff's givin' me the munchies. \n                         Where's that bag of popcorn?\n\n                                     CODY\n                         Shit. Left the groceries in the car.\n\n               He starts to rise, but she pushes him back.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         'S okay, I'll go.\n\n               She rises, goes out the front door.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT\n\n               Catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting \n               her car's back door. She sees, a short distance away -\n\n               A MAN\n\n               standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. His \n               right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, \n               unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. Parked \n               nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer. A thin, breast-\n               high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. \n\n               Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         Help you with that?\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Would you? Thanks.\n\n               His voice is odd, strained, very soft. A fog lamp, set on \n               end on the ground, distorts his features from below. We can't \n               get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above \n               average height; he's in his mid 30's. She sets down the bag, \n               then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.\n\n                                     MAN (O.S.)\n                         Let's slide it up, you mind?\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT\n\n               He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, \n               and grabs the chair. She hesitates again, but climbs in after \n               him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Are you about a size 14?\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                              (surprised)\n                         What?\n\n               Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of \n               her head with his cast. She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding \n               off the armchair to lie on her stomach. He pulls off his \n               cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, \n               grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. \n               He bends over her face with the lamp.\n\n               We hear her shallow BREATHING.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Good.\n\n               He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size \n               tag.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Good.\n\n               He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of \n               bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. There's no \n               bra strap. He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Gooood...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               LOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse \n               is tossed out beside it. SOUND of the truck's motor starting. \n               The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, \n               partly squashing it. Then is drives away, taillights \n               shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

Ardelia \n               is beside her. Other tables and students in the background. \n               Each trainee has his own microscope. Clarice is tired, but \n               straightens, hearing -\n\n                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)\n                         Both of these blouses were worn by \n                         victims of Buffalo Bill.

He always slits \n                         them up the back, like a funeral \n                         suit...\n\n               ON THE SCREEN\n\n               successively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we \n               are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs.

Its door is open, the twin \n               props and beacons already turning. Brigham turns to her, \n               holding out his small canvas bag.\n\n                                     BRIGHAM\n                         You're goin' in the field, so you \n                         gotta have full kit.

They're \n               both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed.\n\n                                     BRIGHAM\n                         Bless you, Starling...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms.\n\n               Clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in \n               her lap. The cover reads \"Case File: / BUFFALO BILL.\" Clarice \n               is moody, distracted. She hesitates, then opens the file, \n               begins to scan.\n\n               INSERTS - HER POV\n\n               Police forms, some handwritten... Typed lab reports; we catch \n               words, phrases: \"Autopsy Protocols\", \"Histamine Analysis\"... \n               Grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched \n               grooves... And then a stack of victim photos. The first one, \n               taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, \n               face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter.\n\n               Clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at \n               the next. It makes her flinch, just slightly. Quickly she \n               turns through several more photographs, trying hard to \n               concentrate.\n\n                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)\n                         He keeps them alive for three days.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               shows Crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's \n               motion.

Then, if you're \n                         lucky, out of all the stuff you know, \n                         one little part of it tugs at you, \n                         tries to get your attention...

She pulls her blazer a bit \n               tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR\n\n               as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge. \n               The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the \n                         chapel. And tell Lamar to come on \n                         when he's done playin' that music.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. EMBALMING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton \n               Policefax fingerprint transmitter. SOUND of many men's low \n               voices, in background. He is on the phone, and has to speak \n               loudly.\n\n                                     CRAWFORD\n                         I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, \n                         Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, \n                         Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can \n                         you hear me...?\n\n               He looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere.\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. She raises her voice, \n               turning up her natural accent by several notches.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! \n                         Listen here a minute, please. There's \n                         things I need to do for her...\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies \n               and troopers. They gradually fall silent, looking at her.\n\n                                     CLARICE (O.S.)\n                         Y'all brought her this far, and I \n                         know her folks would thank you if \n                         they could. Now please - go on out \n                         and let me take care of her... Go \n                         on, now.\n\n               The men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin \n               to to file out, whispering among themselves. As they go, a \n               bright green body bag is REVEALED, tightly zipped, lying on \n               a porcelain embalming table. It is almost the only modern \n               object in this Victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets \n               and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.\n\n               FAVORING CRAWFORD\n\n               as he looks at Clarice with a new degree of respect. Men \n               brush by him, till finally only two are left: DR. AKIN, a \n               family g.p., and LAMAR, a lean, whiskey-reddened mortician. \n               SOUND of the door closing. Lamar dabs around his nostrils \n               with Vicks VapoRub.\n\n                                     CRAWFORD\n                              (on phone)\n                         We're starting. Tell everybody to \n                         stand by for fingerprint transmission.\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint \n               kit. She is lifting out a camera when she hears the ZIPPER \n               of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her...\n\n               One gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, \n               involuntarily, to the sudden smell. She blinks at her \n               reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, \n               look at the corpse.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                              (pause; softly)\n                         Bill...\n\n               She steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a FLASH \n               photo.\n\n               LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP, FROM BENEATH TABLE\n\n               as Dr. Akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms. \n               A piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged \n               around it, dangling. Crawford leans in for a closer look.\n\n                                     DR. AKIN\n                         Wrongful death... She'll have to go \n                         to the state pathologist at Claxton \n                         when you're done.\n                              (Crawford nods)\n                         I better - get on back for the rest \n                         of that service.

Her ears are \n                         pierced three times each, and she's \n                         wearing green glitter nail polish. \n                         Looks like town to me...\n\n               CLOSE ANGLE\n\n               on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as Clarice trails the \n               inside of her bare wrist along the skin.\n\n                                     CLARICE (O.S.)\n                         She waxed her legs, I think... A big \n                         girl, just like the others - but she \n                         was careful about her appearance...\n\n               UPWARD ANGLE AGAIN\n\n               as Lamar joins them for a closer look.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Two of the fingernails are broken \n                         off, and there's - dirt or grit under \n                         the others. She tried to claw her \n                         way through something... I'll scrape \n                         out samples after I've printed her.\n\n               She takes another FLASH, then quickly reloads film.\n\n                                     LAMAR\n                         Them fishhooks are set too close \n                         together.

Like \n                         poaching. There's a big fine.\n\n                                     LAMAR\n                         Right...

Then we'll \n                         fax her fingerprints to Washington, \n                         try to trace her through Missing \n                         Persons.\n\n               SIDE ANGLE - CLOSE ON THE DEAD GIRL'S FACE\n\n               staring blue eyes, short reddish hair. Clarice sets the \n               Polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, \n               while Lamar gently retracts the lips. Each time the camera \n               FLASHES, there's a bright glow inside the cheeks.\n\n               NEW ANGLE - CHEST HIGH\n\n               as Clarice examines a developing print.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         She's got something in her throat.\n\n               She hands the print to Crawford; he and Lamar look at it, as \n               she searches in her kit.\n\n                                     LAMAR\n                         When a body comes out of the water, \n                         alots of times there's like, leaves \n                         and things in the mouth.\n\n               Clarice holds up a pair of forceps. She glances at Crawford, \n               who nods. She bends over, partially OUT OF SHOT, and after a \n               few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical \n               object. She turns this in the air, as they all stare.\n\n                                     CRAWFORD\n                         What is it - some kind of seed pod?\n\n                                     LAMAR\n                         Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon.

BACK STEPS OF THE FUNERAL HOME - DAY\n\n               Clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. \n               She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of \n               Coke.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Thanks, I'm not thirsty.\n\n                                     LAMAR\n                         No, hold it under your chin, there, \n                         and on your temples.

When Lamar sees \n               Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. Crawford sits \n               beside her; there's a brief silence.

LECTER (V.O.)\n                         You should try to obtain a list of \n                         males rejected from all three gender \n                         reassignment centers...\n\n               PULLING BACK\n\n               we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths. They \n               crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings \n               pumping lazily. In the distant background, the incongruous \n               SOUND of show music.\n\n                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)\n                         Check first the ones rejected for \n                         lying about criminal records...\n\n               CONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE\n\n               at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL \n               through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar.\n\n               As we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the \n               dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom \n               briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... \n               a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming \n               knives...\n\n                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)\n                         Among those who tried to conceal \n                         their past, look for severe childhood \n                         disturbances, associated with \n                         violence... Possibly you'll find a \n                         childhood incarceration... Then go \n                         to their personality tests...\n\n               We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing \n               colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various \n               stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese \n               lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty \n               background.\n\n               MUSIC is growing even louder: Fats Waller singing \"Bye Bye \n               Baby.\" And now we hear something else, too - the rapid \n               CLICKING of a sewing machine...\n\n                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)\n                         Study their drawings, especially. \n                         Billy's house drawings will show no \n                         happy future... No baby carriage, \n                         out in the yard. No pets, no toys, \n                         no flowers, no sun...\n\n               We TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself. As we \n               APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old-\n               fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a \n               piece of material that we mercifully cannot see. A female \n               wig rests near him on a head form. He wears a hairnet and a \n               beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.\n\n                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)\n                         His females will be more crudely \n                         sketched than him males - but he'll \n                         compensate by adding exaggerated \n                         adornments... jewelry, big breasts... \n                         And his tree drawings - oh, his trees \n                         will be frightful...\n\n               Next to Mr. Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the \n               MUSIC. His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles. \n               As we PASS Mr. Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting \n               happily, and we FOLLOW the little dog down another corridor, \n               the music starting to fade behind us...\n\n                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)\n                         Billy hates his own identity, he \n                         always has - and he thinks that makes \n                         him a transsexual. But his pathology \n                         is a thousand times more savage... \n                         He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He \n                         will be reborn...\n\n               At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a \n               low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in \n               the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette. \n               Precious sniffs her way over to the edge - excited, tail \n               wagging - than BARKS happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly \n               moan from below.\n\n                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)\n                         Pleeeeeeeease.....!\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

RISING along his \n               tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel \n               restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are \n               bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a \n               strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.\n\n                                     CHILTON (V.O.)\n                         Bad news, Hannibal...\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               shows that Dr. Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed \n               down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell.\n\n                                     CHILTON (V.O.)\n                         Gourmet magazine has rejected your \n                         recipe for braised kidneys...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL - DAY\n\n               Chilton lounges on Dr. Lecter's cot, casually reading his \n               large stack of private correspondence, and making notations \n               with his gold pen on a little pad. Another orderly mops the \n               floor.\n\n                                     CHILTON\n                         Perhaps you should have been less \n                         specific about what kind.\n                              (to Barney)\n                         Stand him by the toilet.

I can \n                         hardly wait to analyze it in more \n                         detail... But first things first.\n\n               Tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the \n               corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from \n               underneath Clarice's desk. He waggles it triumphantly at Dr. \n               Lecter.\n\n                                     CHILTON\n                         I thought she might be looking for a \n                         civil rights violation in Migg's \n                         death, so I bugged you... Not a word \n                         to me in all these years, Hannibal. \n                         Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff \n                         over here, and you just turn to jelly. \n                         It's too pathetic.\n\n               SIDE ANGLE - TWO SHOT\n\n               as Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the \n               front of Dr. Lecter's mask.\n\n                                     CHILTON\n                         You still think you're going to walk \n                         on some beach, and see the birdies? \n                         I don't think so, Hannibal... I called \n                         Senator Ruth Martin, and she never \n                         heard of any deal with you. She never \n                         heard of Clarice Starling, either. \n                         They scammed you, Hannibal...\n\n               CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.\n\n                                     CHILTON\n                         When Crawford gets through milking \n                         you, he's giving you to Baltimore \n                         Homicide for the Raspail murder.

You've seen the old ones, \n                         Hannibal. They weep when their stewed \n                         peaches get cold. That'll be you, \n                         too.

I've been \n                         on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on \n                         your behalf. Here's what you get: if \n                         you identify Buffalo Bill, and the \n                         girl is found in time, Senator Martin \n                         will have you transferred to Brushy \n                         Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee...\n\n               CLOSE AGAIN ON DR.

Parked to one \n               side: an EMS ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a \n               dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there. \n               Prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances \n               towards the open hanger doorway.\n\n                                     BOYLE\n                         If you'll please sign right here, \n                         sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.\n\n               Chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold \n               pen; it's gone.

Boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring \n               of keys.\n\n                                     PEMBRY\n                         Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for \n                         dinner, extra rare.\n\n                                     BOYLE\n                              (laughs)\n                         What you reckon he'll want for \n                         breakfast - some fuckin' thing from \n                         the zoo?\n\n               INSIDE THE SCREEN\n\n               Dr. Lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet - swaying \n               slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in \n               his cheek. Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of \n               metal protrudes from his lips. He plucks it out, opens his \n               eyes.\n\n               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP\n\n               he is holding the pocket clip from Prentice's disassembled \n               pen - a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar \n               at one end, a square edge at the other.\n\n               DR. LECTER\n\n               lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then \n               braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim. He pushes \n               down, hard, using both hands for leverage. After a moment he \n               smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his \n               eyes.\n\n               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP\n\n               the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle, \n               and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE CELL\n\n               Pembry and Boyle turn as the toilet FLUSHES, and Dr. Lecter \n               reappears, looking jaunty.\n\n                                     PEMBRY\n                         Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same \n                         drill as lunchtime.\n\n               Dr. Lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggles \n               backwards. He stretches his arms behind him, hands and wrists \n               through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps his \n               hands.\n\n                                     DR. LECTER\n                         I'm ready when you are, Officer \n                         Pembry.\n\n               Pembry comes around the cell to squat behind Dr. Lecter. He \n               tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his \n               wrists. He shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then nods \n               to Boyle.\n\n               NEW ANGLE - AT CELL DOOR\n\n               as Boyle picks up the dinner tray, and Pembry crosses around. \n               Pembry takes the keys from Boyle, unlocks the cell door, and \n               pushes it inward. Boyle goes inside with the tray.\n\n               DR. LECTER\n\n               watches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet from \n               him. Boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear \n               off some of the mess of drawings. The MUSIC plays on.\n\n               VERY CLOSE ON\n\n               ...Dr. Lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift \n               key, held between the tips of his right index and middle \n               fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs. And finds \n               it.\n\n               NEW ANGLE - FAVORING BOYLE\n\n               as he finishes clearing the drawings, then turns back towards \n               Dr. Lecter, stooping to pick up the tray.\n\n               BOYLE'S RIGHT HAND\n\n               is just inches from the tray when Dr. Lecter's hand darts \n               INTO SHOT, snapping a handcuff onto his wrist.\n\n               BOYLE\n\n               looks up, astonished, to find himself right in the grinning \n               face of Dr. Lecter - who just as quickly rolls sideways, and \n               snaps -\n\n               THE OTHER CUFF\n\n               around the bolted leg of the table. And suddenly all natural \n               SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much \n               louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and \n               we see...\n\n               VARIOUS ANGLES - EACH BLURRING INTO STOP-ACTION\n\n               Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... \n\n               Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into \n               Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door \n               frame...\n\n               Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his \n               pants pocket for his handcuff key...\n\n               Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he \n               strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist... \n\n               Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at...\n\n               Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...\n\n               Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it \n               like a dog shakes a rat...\n\n               Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...\n\n               Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed \n               Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing \n               him to his knees...\n\n               Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, \n               unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, \n               seeing...\n\n               Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised \n               high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and \n               again...\n\n               Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to -\n\n               CLOSE ANGLE ON\n\n               the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now \n               flecked with blood. In addition to the Bach, we now hear \n               soft PANTING, close by, and whimpering SOBS in the background.\n\n               ANGLE ON DR. LECTER\n\n               eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music. His \n               bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breathing \n               slows to normal. He opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, looks \n               down.\n\n               HIS POV\n\n               By the sprawled legs of Boyle lie various objects that spilled \n               from his pants pocket - coins, a comb, a big pocketknife.\n\n               DR. LECTER\n\n               picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily. About a four-\n               inch blade. He becomes aware of the WHIMPERING, off screen, \n               turns.\n\n               LOW ANGLE ON PEMBRY\n\n               as he crawls, with torturous slowness, towards the command \n               desk, and the phone.

The \n               door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult \n               moths flutter out.\n\n                                     MR.

The cocoon is gently \n               placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives.\n\n                                     MR.

The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note \n               of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice.\n\n                                     MR.

His back is to us; he is looking \n               anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. \n               Genuinely scared.\n\n                                     MR.

He stares inside; his face in shadows.\n\n                                     MR. GUMB\n                         Sweetheart...?\n\n               From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice.\n\n                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)\n                         She'd down here you sack of shit.\n\n               Mr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the \n               doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with \n               a series of YIPS.\n\n               UPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM\n\n               as Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.\n\n                                     MR. GUMB\n                         Precious, are you all right?\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE ON CATHERINE\n\n               crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. Seeing \n               Mr. Gumb, the dog squirms frantically, BARKING.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         Get me a telephone. Lower it down to \n                         me. Do it now, mister! I don't want \n                         to have to hurt this little dog.\n\n               UPWARD ANGLE\n\n               on Mr. Gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the Colt from \n               inside his kimono. The muzzle gleams as he takes aim.\n\n               Catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming \n               at him.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         You shoot motherfucker you better \n                         kill me quick or I'll break her \n                         fucking neck, I swear to God!\n\n                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)\n                              (wails)\n                         Nooooooo!\n\n               Tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting \n               the head. The dog WHINES piteously.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         Back off, you son of a bitch! Back \n                         off!\n\n               UPWARD ANGLE\n\n               as Mr. Gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream \n               of rage and anguish. But then he slowly lowers his gun.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               On Catherine, as she maintains her grip.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         That's better... Now get me a live \n                         telephone. Get a long extension and \n                         lower is down here... And you better \n                         do it fast, too, 'cause I think her \n                         leg's broken. She's in pain, mister, \n                         she needs a vet.\n\n               MR. GUMB\n\n               stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily.\n\n                                     MR. GUMB\n                         You think she's in pain? You don't \n                         know what pain is. But you're going \n                         to find out...\n\n               And abruptly he vanishes. SOUND of his footsteps, rushing \n               off.\n\n               CATHERINE\n\n               begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. She \n               hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in \n               its fur, sobbing...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

Double-\n               checking this address, she glances up from a folded street \n               map to -\n\n               AN OLD, THREE-STORY WOODEN HOUSE\n\n               in a row of similarly shabby homes, all backing onto a narrow \n               river. A path of boards, laid over mud, leads back along \n               this house towards the brown water. SOUND of hammering from \n               there.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. BIMMEL HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY\n\n               An awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish \n               water. The birds' COOING mixes with the HAMMERING. A tall, \n               gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a \n               new coop.\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               approaches him, and the man lowers his hammer. He has red-\n               rimmed eyes of watery blue. His face is deeply seamed.\n\n                                     CLARICE\n                         Mr. Bimmel...? \n\n               He stares back at her, warily.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

She \n                         never come home.\n\n               Clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: \n               the familiar graduation portrait. Others pictures show \n               Fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful \n               at each age.\n\n                                     MR.

There is loneliness here, an echo \n               of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling.

A shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing \n               supplies, in clear plexiboxes. She flips through the hanging \n               clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer \n               look.\n\n               THE DRESS\n\n               is very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut. Some of \n               the seams still look unfinished. She turns it around, sees a \n               blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back.\n\n               FAVORING THE SEWING MACHINE\n\n               as Clarice turns, looks towards it. She hangs the dress on \n               the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine. She \n               takes off its dust cover. She runs one hand over the cool \n               metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind.\n\n                                     DR.

MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)\n\n               Slowly, savoring the moment, Mr. Gumb aims the big Colt, \n               which is already cocked, using both hands... He is just about \n               to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his DOOR BUZZER, \n               surprisingly loud and close by. He turns, startled, and sees -\n\n               DUSTY BLACK METAL BOX\n\n               the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is \n               making the hideous, grating JANGLE. It finally stops, but \n               not before waking Precious, who starts frantically BARKING, \n               off screen, as -\n\n               MR.

Instantly the \n               two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass.\n\n               MR. GUMB\n\n               bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to \n               safely place his shot. The maddening BUZZER sounds again, \n               even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and \n               fury. But as the BUZZER continues, he reluctantly uncocks \n               his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Mr. Gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, \n               raising the top. He bends over, begins poking through cubby \n               holes.

For several \n               agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but \n               then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of \n               pure fear.

Its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several \n               padded hangers... She moves on, past the big sink, with its \n               DRIPPING faucet... the counter, with its gleaming knives... \n               the rows of chemical jars. At the end of this room is\n\n               A CLOSED DOOR\n\n               Clarice starts to open it, then hesitates. Looking around, \n               she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, \n               sealing off this section of the cellar. With her back thus \n               defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

She crosses to the door, listens and hears no sound \n               inside, takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob. She \n               twists it, and, as it turns, shoves hard and follows her gun \n               inside, all in one quick move...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - DAY (BRIGHTLY LIT)\n\n               An old-fashioned bathroom: tiled floor, sink, toilet - and a \n               big, free-standing tub. An opaque shower curtain, suspended \n               from an oval ring, hides whatever might be inside.\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks \n               it aside with her left hand. No one standing there. Something \n               lower down catches her eye.\n\n               She leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at \n               first, that she's seeing -\n\n               FEMALE HAND AND WRIST\n\n               sticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple \n               plaster. The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish \n               and a dainty wristwatch. As -\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               is reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to \n               be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow \n               of Mr. Gumb's infra-red system. Clarice cries out, turns \n               blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand \n               clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness. \n               SOUND of Catherine KEENING again, in the far distance.

She stops, listens. In her raw-nerved \n               darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of \n               the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified \n               BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths \n               smack against her face and arms. She eases forward, then \n               stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following \n               her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past -\n\n               MR. GUMB\n\n               who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a \n               high priest, Colt in one hand. He wears his goggles and \n               kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, \n               like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed \n               suit of human skins. This is an exquisite moment for him - a \n               ritual of supreme exaltation. He smiles at Clarice as, \n               completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back. \n               Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his \n               gun in both hands, aiming...\n\n               CLOSE ON\n\n               the Colt Python as - in SLOW MOTION - his thumbs cock the \n               hammer, the SOUND registering as a LOUD METALLIC CLICK, and -\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               spins, still in SLOW MOTION, flame already leaping from her \n               gun muzzle, as we see -\n\n               THE TWO FIGURES\n\n               almost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH \n               from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, \n               overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly -\n\n               CLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE -\n\n               with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the \n               floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; \n               there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but \n               she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her \n               jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, \n               reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her \n               stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled \n               eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is \n               he, where...? Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears \n               something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps \n               eight feet away...\n\n               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE\n\n               as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, \n               until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He is lying on \n               his back, chest a bloody mess. She slides her muzzle against \n               his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't \n               needed. He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips \n               working. He tries to speak, but cannot. One hand reaches \n               slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize \n               something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand \n               drops, he is dead. Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, \n               making sure. Then, and only then, does she permit herself to \n               roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him.\n\n               OVERHEAD ANGLE\n\n               down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers \n               on their pillow.

The BUZZ of their voices goes even higher as\n\n               CLARICE\n\n               dazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking \n               protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney.\n\n               They are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen \n               with an extension ladder. Catherine, blinking in confusion, \n               is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her \n               up even as she's trundled into an ambulance. Clarice sways \n               with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at \n               once, pulling her sleeve.

Popping \n               an orange section into his mouth, he turns towards the \n               brightly lit house. Stepping delicately over the sprawled \n               body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open \n               french doors.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

The \n               extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls Dr. Lecter's own \n               former restraints. His screams are muffled by the tape over \n               his mouth; he stares at Dr. Lecter like a rabbit trapped in \n               headlights.\n\n               DR.
