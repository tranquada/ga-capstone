(CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He\r\n          was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one\r\n          year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised\r\n          sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected\r\n          many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and\r\n          has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His\r\n          favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and\r\n          Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more.\r\n          He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges\r\n          quotes from it with his friend TONY.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE has been dreaming. The dream frightened him. A\r\n          TITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the frame: CHARLIE. He gets\r\n          up to look at his face in the mirror. His room is lit by\r\n          moonlight. It is a small tenement bedroom with a fire-\r\n          escape outside.\r\n                         \r\n           2.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow, we hear\r\n          the RONETTES singing \"BE MY BABY.\"\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          An 8-mm. projector whirring away.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. PARTY - HOME MOVIES - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Opening TITLES appear over 8mm. HOME MOVIES in which\r\n          CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family in a\r\n          celebration...a sense of \"one big unending party.\"\r\n                         \r\n          During this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters\r\n          that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL,\r\n          TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They\r\n          are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian-\r\n          American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from\r\n          these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people\r\n          to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family,\r\n          Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during\r\n          some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE\r\n          participated.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          INT. BATHROOM IN A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR\r\n                         \r\n          A longhaired \"freak\" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the\r\n          door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is\r\n          totally different in appearance and dress from the \"freak.\"\r\n          He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts.\r\n          His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part\r\n          of the city and owns several night club type discotheques\r\n          and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is\r\n          operated by TONY - \"TONY'S PLACE.\" CHARLIE is one of his\r\n          closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless.\r\n          He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           What the fuck...hey!\r\n                         \r\n          TONY rushes over to the \"freak\", who is too strung out to\r\n          defend himself, smashes the needle, and slaps him around.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           Not in my fuckin' place... get\r\n           out... get out!\r\n                         \r\n          INT. BAR AREA\r\n                         \r\n          TONY pushes him out the door and into the bar area. There\r\n          are a few people in the bar...mainly neighborhood guys like\r\n          TONY. A few \"freaks\" are in the BG.\r\n                         \r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          TONY pushes him out the front door.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           And keep the fuck out-a-here. I\r\n           know your face.\r\n                         \r\n          TONY crosses over to one of the neighborhood guys by the bar\r\n          and slaps him in the back of the head knocking off his hat.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           And you scumbag...what did I tell\r\n           you 'bout passin' that shit in my\r\n                          PLACE\r\n                          (HITS AGAIN)\r\n           ...huh?\r\n                         \r\n                          BOY\r\n           Hey I didn't do nothin'...cut it\r\n           out...\r\n                         \r\n          TONY pushes the BOY out of the bar also.

WEST SIDE DOCKS - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n                         \r\n          The area is totally deserted except for two trucks parked\r\n          side by side. Two men are tossing boxes from one truck to\r\n          another and looking around furtively. MICHAEL stands nearby.\r\n          MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different\r\n          neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as\r\n          CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and\r\n          dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles\r\n          in from Maryland. He also deals in contraband cigarettes\r\n          and runs a small-time \"loan shark\" business. He has a knack\r\n          for business but he is otherwise unintelligent.\r\n                         \r\n          Michael crosses over to a '58 black Oldsmobile.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHAEL\r\n           Hey, hurry up with that shit will ya.\r\n                         \r\n          MICHAEL gets in the car. Another MAN is sitting in the back.\r\n          He is also well dressed. MICHAEL takes a small lens out of\r\n          his pocket and tosses it to the MAN.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAN\r\n           What's this?

STREET - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan. Prominent in\r\n          the frame is a brightly painted red white and blue mailbox,\r\n          contrasting with the drab hues of the neighborhood.\r\n                         \r\n          JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN\r\n          CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child\r\n          and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut\r\n          looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled\r\n          from high school for vandalism and consequently spent\r\n          several months in reform school. He is reckless,\r\n          unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-\r\n          F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next\r\n          door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own\r\n          and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.\r\n                         \r\n          JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper\r\n          under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into\r\n          the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little\r\n          faster now and smiling a little more.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and\r\n          blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the\r\n          blast knocks JOHNNY down. TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame:\r\n          JOHNNY BOY.\r\n                         \r\n           5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He is up in a moment. The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he\r\n          starts running. WE SEE that he is grinning - quite\r\n          literally - like crazy.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

The CAMERA\r\n          ZOOMS OUT to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the\r\n          foreground. CHARLIE suddenly begins to speak softly and\r\n          confidentially to an unseen entity that is OFF SCREEN.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n                          (CONFESSION)\r\n           A...As you know, I've just come out\r\n           of Confession.

TONY directs\r\n          CHARLIE to a corner of the club where the rest of the group\r\n          is now getting boisterously drunk.\r\n                         \r\n           6.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE joins in, immediately taking on the mood of the group.\r\n                         \r\n          The rest of the club is filled with many different types of\r\n          customers: teenagers, adults pretending to be teenagers,\r\n          sailors, male and female gays, and \"the boys from the\r\n          neighborhood.\" The music is loud and the lights are flashing\r\n          but the strippers have not yet appeared.\r\n                         \r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n          TONY is at the bar. He is approached by GEORGE one of the\r\n          bouncers. He seems upset about the noise that CHARLIE and\r\n          his friends are creating. TONY doesn't take GEORGE very\r\n          seriously.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE\r\n           It's ten o'clock and they're like\r\n           this. And they're just starting?\r\n                         \r\n          TONY smiles.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE\r\n                          (CONTINUING)\r\n           Smile...What are you smiling at?\r\n           This is a business night.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n                          (INTERRUPTING)\r\n           George...did I ever tell you the\r\n           story about the three chickens?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE\r\n                          (GENUINELY)\r\n           No...\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           Too bad.\r\n                         \r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There\r\n          is no particular logical sequence except that events are\r\n          suited to the rythmic pattern of the music.\r\n                         \r\n          1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the\r\n           music.\r\n                         \r\n          2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a\r\n           filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the\r\n           bar. He fails.\r\n                         \r\n          3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's\r\n           table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also\r\n           fails.\r\n                         \r\n           7.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the\r\n           puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the\r\n           darkness.\r\n                         \r\n          5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes\r\n           obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to\r\n           her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half\r\n           amusedly to ignore him but she can't.\r\n                         \r\n          6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a\r\n           chaser swigs down Aqua Velva.\r\n                         \r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE sitting at an empty table watching DIANE, the\r\n          stripper, perform again. He stares glassy-eyed and then\r\n          begins to speak softly, continuing his Confession.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Y'know...she's really good-looking...\r\n           really good-looking.

BEDROOM - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAYBREAK\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE returns to the bedroom. JOHNNY BOY appears to be\r\n          asleep. CHARLIE goes to the window and peers through the\r\n          blinds. He sees in the window across the fire escape.\r\n                         \r\n          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various\r\n          stages of getting dressed.\r\n                         \r\n          TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and\r\n          intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she\r\n          makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically\r\n          supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented\r\n          her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious\r\n          relationships with men. She has however, been having an\r\n          affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept\r\n          secret from both families because the families regard each\r\n          other as blood relations.\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has\r\n          begun to dial the telephone.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHNNY BOY\r\n           (pretending to be angry)\r\n           Hello...fifth precinct? Yeah...I\r\n           want to report a disturbance. Yeah\r\n           this man and woman next door are\r\n           disturbing the peace. They're\r\n           keeping me awake all night now.\r\n           What the hell is this. What?\r\n           Well... yelling, fighting, throwing\r\n           things. Uh-huh. If they don't\r\n           kill each other soon I'm goin' over\r\n           there and do the job myself. Yes -\r\n           the address is 270 Mott street. I\r\n           think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah,\r\n           right... thanks. Look, I demand\r\n           immediate action. Never mind my\r\n           name I don't like getting involved\r\n           in things like this.\r\n                         \r\n           27.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed.\r\n          CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this\r\n          was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at\r\n          TERESA but she is no longer in her room.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. TERESA'S BEDROOM\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both\r\n          nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and\r\n          ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate\r\n          sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on\r\n          the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out\r\n          in pain.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. HOTEL ROOM - MID-DAY\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE and TERESA are in the hotel room making love.

The quality has diminished but the prices\r\n          remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE\r\n          is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up\r\n          a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it.\r\n          He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She\r\n          apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on\r\n          the table. He takes a menu.\r\n                         \r\n          A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He\r\n          is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his\r\n          shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are\r\n          smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted.\r\n                         \r\n                          OSCAR\r\n           (with a slight Jewish accent)\r\n           Hey...you're here.

This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy\r\n          store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle\r\n          GIOVANNI and his associates.\r\n                         \r\n          GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and\r\n          powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a\r\n          head figure not by being introduced formally as was the\r\n          custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the\r\n          organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype\r\n          of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man.\r\n                         \r\n          GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian.\r\n                         \r\n           34.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          A man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in\r\n          the corner of the room in the luncheonette area.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           (to repair man)\r\n           Is my uncle back there?\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE points in the direction of a doorway.\r\n                         \r\n                          REPAIR MAN\r\n           Yeah, but I think he's busy now.\r\n           Hey Charlie play 463 today - for\r\n           sure.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Thanks!\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining\r\n          room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at\r\n          the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.\r\n                         \r\n          MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest\r\n          associate, brought into the organization in the traditional\r\n          manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders).\r\n          He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to\r\n          GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.\r\n                         \r\n          MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are\r\n          deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by\r\n          unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He\r\n          shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the\r\n          conversation.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Party noises can be heard in the background TONY is\r\n          wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a World War I \"dough\r\n          boy\". Atop his head is a mask, the features of which can't\r\n          be seen. He opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red\r\n          Jello. He turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly\r\n          begins to empty each packet of Jello into the tub of steaming\r\n          water.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          LIVING ROOM & KITCHENETTE - PARTY - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Most of the characters that were at the club the other night\r\n          are present at the party. Many of them are dressed in semi-\r\n          masquerade outfits. Some are wearing soldiers' uniforms.\r\n          One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga. The girls are\r\n          in costumes also. All of the costumes are makeshift.\r\n          MICHAEL is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi\r\n          tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his\r\n          mouth. His hair is slicked back to give him a \"Bela Lugosi\"\r\n          look. He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys,\r\n          proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. TONY\r\n          comes out of the bathroom and passes by. He takes the photo\r\n          from MICHAEL. Group attention focuses on TONY now. He\r\n          stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer\r\n          to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down.\r\n                         \r\n                          TERESA\r\n           Oh sure! I know her Michael...In\r\n           fact, I saw her a few days ago\r\n           under a bridge in Jersey, making\r\n           out with a nigger.\r\n                         \r\n          MICHAEL grimaces in shock. He spits.\r\n                         \r\n                          MICHAEL\r\n           You sure?...a nigger...Uh!...and I\r\n           kissed her.\r\n                         \r\n          He wipes his lips with his cape.\r\n                         \r\n          The guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. He is\r\n          attempting to open his going away presents, one of which\r\n          turns out to be a carefully folded American flag. He\r\n          attempts to open it with one great flourish. He fails\r\n          however, knocking over the glasses on the table. The group\r\n          applauds.\r\n                         \r\n           53.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up. The\r\n          door opens and CHARLIE appears, arms outstretched, dressed\r\n          as the ressurected Christ - with white robes, fake beard and\r\n          hair, and artificial wounds. His arms stretch out wider.\r\n          The initial shock wears off and TONY greets him.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n                          (SMILING)\r\n           Hallelujah!!\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE enters in mock holiness.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           I have come to create order...\r\n           Scotch and water please.\r\n                         \r\n          They all laugh. The rock music blares as CHARLIE walks to\r\n          and fro blessing all in the room. TONY is delighted with\r\n          the scene. CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table, TONY opposite\r\n          him, and the others gather around. The party is getting\r\n          noisier. TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes. CHARLIE\r\n          plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice\r\n          is filled with wine and water, TONY pours the scotch over\r\n          his fingers first.\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest\r\n          would. He signifies that there is enough in the glass.\r\n          TONY then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda-water.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           May God be with you.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           'And with your spirit.'\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           (gesturing with his drink)\r\n           Salute!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Everyone drinks after repeating the toast. The crowd around\r\n          them begins to break up as CHARLIE and TONY begin to have\r\n          fun with each other. TONY pulls down his mask, revealing a\r\n          skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his\r\n          mouth. It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well.\r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           (taking on the guise\r\n           of an interviewer)\r\n           'Art thou the King of the Jews'?\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           'Dost thou say this of thyself, or\r\n           have others told thee of me?'\r\n                         \r\n           54.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          TONY\r\n           'Am I a Jew?

CHARLIE comes out of the\r\n          next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through\r\n          the madness, his arms outstretched.

It is obvious that she is quite stoned. She\r\n          caresses him and they find themselves kissing.

When they see CHARLIE and\r\n          TERESA they call out.\r\n                         \r\n                          FRIENDS\r\n           Charlie, stay there...He's crazy...\r\n           He's got a 22.\r\n                         \r\n          TERESA gets up against a wall. CHARLIE sends her down the\r\n          block and she leaves reluctantly.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Johnny it's me, Charlie.\r\n                         \r\n          JOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight\r\n          on the tenement roof. He has a gun in his hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHNNY BOY\r\n           Don't come any closer!!!\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Cut it out stupid. It's me.\r\n                         \r\n          JOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air. CHARLIE clings to the\r\n          wall with the others. A moment later he makes a quick run\r\n          for the doorway of the building across the street. He\r\n          enters the building that leads to the roof.\r\n                         \r\n                         BLACK & WHITE\r\n                         \r\n           58.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and\r\n          then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems\r\n          totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in\r\n          the distance.\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take\r\n          them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a\r\n          sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his\r\n          attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top\r\n          floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is\r\n          having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.\r\n          Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open\r\n          windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of\r\n          the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the\r\n          fire escape.\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard\r\n          and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find\r\n          JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           'Could you not, then, watch one\r\n           hour with me?'\r\n                         \r\n          He wakes JOHNNY BOY up.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           'The spirit is willing but the\r\n           flesh is weak.'\r\n                         \r\n           61.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          They leave.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

GIOVANNI enters with MARIO. The old\r\n          Mafiosi are greeted first. They rise and kiss GIOVANNI on\r\n          the cheek. CHARLIE is very impressed at their respectful\r\n          showing. The waitresses and everyone else in the club treat\r\n          them all like royalty.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          OSCAR approaches the table where CHARLIE, GIOVANNI, and\r\n          MARIO are seated and greets them warmly.\r\n                         \r\n                          OSCAR\r\n           Put the menus away.

Now...\r\n           (reaching in pocket)\r\n           he wants you outta the way.\r\n                         \r\n          MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARIO\r\n           He says use it. Don't sell it. He\r\n           says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe.\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously\r\n          uncomfortable.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARIO\r\n                          (ABRUPTLY)\r\n           Things worked out rotten kid.

TONY'S car pulls up to the\r\n          curb, CHARLIE gets out, waves away help from an idle porter,\r\n          and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat.

Then he picks\r\n          up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He makes his way toward the large flight board\r\n          that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce\r\n          planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight\r\n          board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin\r\n          and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines\r\n          and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman\r\n          calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE\r\n          continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses\r\n          and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy\r\n          dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           I don't know what to say to you...\r\n                         \r\n          The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually\r\n          works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor\r\n          and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of\r\n          dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a\r\n          pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.\r\n                         \r\n           98.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          CLERK\r\n           May I help you?\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision.\r\n          He apparently does not hear her.\r\n                         \r\n                          CLERK\r\n           Sir, may I help you?\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket\r\n          pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to\r\n          her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           (questioning, challenging)\r\n           Where can I go?\r\n                         \r\n          The question is unusual.
