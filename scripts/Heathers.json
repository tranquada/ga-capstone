She undos the waist-\n     knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow\n     over the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Hey Mom, why so tense?\n\n<b>     THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE\n</b>\n     Montage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner\n     plate to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her.\n\n<b>     INT.

VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her locker.\n     A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing VERONICA\n     as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.\n\n<b>                             PAULINE\n</b>               Veronica!

She swirls her locker\n     combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and freezes.\n\n     In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway\n     carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.\n\n     VERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is\n     barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into\n     the Boys bathroom.\n\n<b>     BOYS BATHROOM\n</b>\n     J.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He\n     turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.\n\n<b>     THE HALLWAY\n</b>\n     The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell\n     rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway.\n\n     VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down\n     the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.\n\n<b>     THE GYM\n</b>\n     A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily\n     doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up\n     beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs.\n     PRINCIPAL GOWAN says \"Testing\" into a microphone.\n\n     J.D., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips\n     inside. He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath\n     the bleachers.\n\n<b>     THE HALLWAY\n</b>\n     VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.\n\n<b>     UNDER THE BLEACHERS\n</b>\n     Using heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a\n     steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can\n     be discerned taped to other supports.\n\n<b>     THE EMPTY HALLWAY\n</b>\n     VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to\n     keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from\n     classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of\n     STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her\n     troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers.\n     She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at\n     his clutched arm with a nervous smile.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Rodney, where's everybody going?\n\n<b>                             RODNEY\n</b>               It's Friday.....\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Oh my God, the damn pep assembly....\n\n<b>                             RODNEY\n</b>               Yeah, these things are pretty artificial,\n               but at least we all get out of class...\n\n     VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to\n     inquisitively move forward through the crowd.\n\n<b>     THE GYM\n</b>\n     J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors.\n     He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move\n     toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby\n     set of stairs.\n\n<b>     THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM\n</b>\n     VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS\n     heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates\n     file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of\n     dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Rodney, what's underneath the gym?\n\n     RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA.\n     and says........\n\n<b>                             RODNEY\n</b>               The boiler room.\n\n     VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a\n     couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the\n     staircase beside the gym.\n\n<b>     HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM\n</b>\n     J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room,\n     eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy\n     steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly\n     pick the lock. He swings open the steel door.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA (O.S.)\n</b>               May I see your hall pass?\n\n     J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him,\n     pointing the bedroom gun at him.\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               I knew that loose was too noose!

A serious-as-\n               fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll\n               set off a pack of thermals upstairs.\n               Okay, so let's start by slowly putting\n               the bomb down on the ground.\n\n     J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He\n     folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Okay, okay. I knew that.

J.D. gracefully\n     retrieves it.\n\n<b>     THE GYM\n</b>\n     The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the\n     bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making\n     swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard.\n     Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with\n     PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.\n\n<b>     THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM\n</b>\n     VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs.\n     J.D. raises the gun to her head.\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               Live by the sword...\n\n     VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand\n     upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow\n     annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of\n     composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder\n     right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the\n     boiler room, jarring the gun loose.\n\n     They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the\n     better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun\n     from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall.\n     VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs\n     scissors-style around her and trips her.\n\n<b>     THE PREP ASSEMBLY\n</b>\n     The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER\n     MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around\n     a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the\n     cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the\n     bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a\n     thermal bomb.\n\n<b>     THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY\n</b>\n     A snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him.\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               You think just because you started\n               this thing, you can end it?\n\n     J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA\n     sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then\n     savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm\n     and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               You, really didn't think I'd, forget,\n               forget, to disconnect the....\n\n     VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D.\n     grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.\n\n     A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds\n     toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel\n     steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently\n     kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins\n     from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of\n     the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on\n     the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...\n\n<b>     THE PEP ASSEMBLY\n</b>\n     The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing \"The Wave\". BETTY\n     FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act,\n     all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers,\n     pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. EARL and\n     the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening\n     before the crowd.\n\n<b>     THE BOILER ROOM\n</b>\n     VERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler\n     room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting\n     position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its\n     digital clock clicking to 3:00. VERONICA crawls to the gun and\n     levels it at a rousing-up J.D.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do\n               you turn it off? Tell me!\n\n     Fully standing, J.D. flicks open his switchblade. He gives\n     VERONICA \"the finger,\" screaming in exploded saliva...\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               Fuck you!\n\n     Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off \"the finger.\"\n     Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden\n     geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun.\n     The bomb clicks down to 2:25.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               It's all over, J.D.

Okay, so maybe I am\n               killing everyone in the school\n               because nobody loves me. You have a\n               purpose though! Remember? Let's face\n               it, the only place different social\n               types can genuinely get along with\n               each other is in heaven.\n\n     VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               How do you turn the fucker off?\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               You're not listening.

Is that\n               deep or what? I'll let you put it in\n               your diary, babe.

Coughing and\n     moaning, he splatters against a generator.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Cool guys like you out of my life.\n\n     VERONICA saunters to J.D.'s writhing body.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               But babe, don't worry, these here\n               were Ich Luge bullets.\n\n     J.D. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. VERONICA turns\n     to the bomb and crouches over it. A lit green light is next to\n     a green button. Above it, an unlit red light is next to a red\n     button. The bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17. VERONICA\n     presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and\n     stopping the clock. VERONICA falls back into a sitting\n     position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face.\n\n<b>     THE PEP ASSEMBLY\n</b>\n     A cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music\n     plays. The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow\n     motion as well.\n\n     At normal speed, VERONICA walks to the doors of the Gym and\n     peers in. The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and\n     prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion.\n     VERONICA walks away from the gym.\n\n<b>     EXT.   THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL   DAY\n</b>\n     VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges\n     outside of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically\n     bask in the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face.\n     A strange voice kills it.\n\n<b>                             J.D. (O.S.)\n</b>               Color me impressed.\n\n     J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting\n     from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. He painfully speaks\n     through his assasinated vocal cords.\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               You really fucked me up, Veronica.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>                       (vertigo city)\n               I thought I...you..\n\n<b>                             J.D.\n</b>               You've got power, Veronica.

Now that you're dead,\n               what are you gonna do with your life?\n\n     VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and\n     puts it in her mouth. She then folsd her arms.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Perfecto.\n\n     J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks\n     to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his\n     crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.\n\n<b>     THE PEP ASSEMBLY\n</b>\n     The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-\n     down pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the\n     bleachers screaming less out of fear than a \"Whoa Dude\" sense\n     of excitement.\n\n<b>     THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL\n</b>\n     VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school\n     with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and\n     her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in\n     bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns\n     to go inside.\n\n<b>     INT.   THE FRONT HALLWAY\n</b>\n     VERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling\n     students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the\n     thrill of it. HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces.\n\n<b>                             HEATHER DUKE\n</b>               Veronica, you look like hell.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Yeah, I just got back.\n\n     VERONICA tosses away the cigarette. She then grabs HEATHER\n     DUKE by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.\n\n<b>                             HEATHER DUKE\n</b>               What are you doing?\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Heather, my love, there's a\n               new sheriff in town.\n\n     VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKE's red ribbon and ties it\n     around the hair of her own head. She kisses HEATHER DUKE on\n     the cheek, leaving a black stain. VERONICA calls off.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               Hey, Martha, wait up.\n\n     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK revealed to be in an electric\n     wheelchair, brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused.\n     VERONICA walks up beside her. MARTHA starts up her wheelchair\n     and accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               My date for the prom kind of flaked\n               out on me, so I thought if you\n               weren't doing anything that night\n               we could go to the video store and\n               rent some new releases or something.\n               Maybe pop some popcorn.\n\n<b>                             MARTHA\n</b>               I'd like that.\n\n<b>                             VERONICA\n</b>               So would I.\n\n     VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding down the hall\n     Bogart/Rains style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Heathers</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Daniel Waters\" title=\"Scripts by Daniel Waters\">Daniel Waters</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Heathers Script.html#comments\" title=\"Heathers comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:07.270368"}
