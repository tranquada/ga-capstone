SUBURBAN STREET--DAY\n\n     VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is\n     jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit.\n     Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing.\n\n     EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY\n\n     VERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an\n     increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder.\n\n     EXT.   PROMENADE--DAY\n\n     VERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre.\n\n     EXT.   THE SAWYER HOME--DAY\n\n     Reveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto\n     the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home.\n\n     She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as\n     the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative\n     wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob.\n\n     INY.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY\n\n     VERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she\n     launches into voice-over narration.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               Heather told me she teaches people\n               Real Life.\n\n     Composed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the\n     mirror then rambles off.\n\n     INT.   HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY\n\n     Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling\n     high school hallway with a frozen smile.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               She said Real Life sucks Losers dry.\n               If you want to fuck with the eagles,\n               you have to learn to fly.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA\n\n     With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the\n     outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint\n     approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that\n     she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               I said so you teach people how to\n               spread their wings and fly.

She told me to haul\n               your ass into the caf pronto. Back\n               me up, Heather.\n\n     From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily\n     accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE.\n     She is clutching a tattered copy of \"The Catcher in the Rye.\"\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...\n\n     INSIDE THE CAFETERIA\n\n     VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE,\n     strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.\n\n     The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her\n     toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and\n     expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (submissively)\n               Hello, Heather.\n\n     Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER\n     CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is\n     consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks\n     is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of\n               Kurt Kelly's.

I don't have anything\n               against Martha Dunnstock.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               You don't have anything for her\n               either. Come on, it'll be Very. The\n               note'll give her shower nozzle\n               masturbation material for weeks.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I'll think about it.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n                       (looking off)\n               Don't think.\n\n     POV ON CAFETERIA LINE\n\n     Unattractive and quite overweight, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK\n     guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line.\n\n     CAFETERIA ENTRANCE\n\n     VERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the\n     outstretched pen.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Splendid.

HEATHER\n     CHANDLER violently laughs.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.\n\n     HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect, embarrassed.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Heather Duke, back down.\n\n     VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Dear Martha, you're so sweet..\n\n     THE JOCKS' TABLE\n\n     The traditionally handsome KURT KELLY, the serene black EARL\n     FRAZIER and the massive RAM sit with other stereotypical\n     Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS.\n\n                             KURT\n               It'd be so righteous to be in a\n               Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler\n               sandwich.

Right.\n\n                             RAM\n               Damn right right.\n\n     CAFETERIA ENTRANCE\n\n     In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up\n     along with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.\n\n     HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.\n\n     VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.\n\n     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then,\n     grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward\n     VERONICA and the HEATHERS.\n\n     HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as\n     MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER\n     passes the note to her frantic disciple.\n\n     In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA\n     saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the\n     note onto MARTHA's tray.\n\n     The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles\n     past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black,\n     bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand\n     which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner\n     reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.\n\n                             PETER\n               Come on people, let's give that\n               leftover lunch money to people\n               without lunches!

I told Dennis if he\n               gave me another topic that was\n               political, I'd spew burrito chunks.\n\n     VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly\n     captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark\n     in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a\n     Cause lunchbox. They make eye contact.\n\n     Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly\n     overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.\n\n                             BETTY\n               Sorry Veronica.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Betty Finn. Gosh.....\n\n     VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I'm really sorry I couldn't make it\n               to your birthday party last month.\n\n                             BETTY\n               That's okay. Your Mom said you had\n               a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip\n               my own birthday party for a date.\n\n     VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe.\n\n                             VERONICA\n              Don't say that.\n\n                             BETTY\n              Oh Ronnie, you have to look at\n              what I dug up the other day.\n\n     BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY\n     FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween\n     costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.\n\n     VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows\n     VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I was talking with someone!\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Color me impressed.

HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth\n     doing the \"induce-vomiting\" signal before devouring the tot\n     and turning back around.\n\n                             COURTNEY\n               Thanks. I just got it last night at\n               the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard.

A deadly pause ensues.\n\n                             BRAD\n               So when you go to college, what kind\n               of subjects do you think you'll study?\n\n     INT.   DAVID'S DORM ROOM\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER and DAVID sit on the latter's bed, surrounded\n     by a Macintosh and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters.\n     They kiss. DAVID doing most of the work.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Come on David, let's go back to the party.\n\n                             DAVID\n                       (unzipping his pants)\n               Don't worry, we will. You're just so\n               hot tonight. I can't control myself.\n\n     DAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER's head down.\n\n     DORM HALLWAY\n\n     BRAD has given up on conversation.\n\n                             BRAD\n               So what do you say we head up to my\n               room and have a real party. I've got\n               the best Windham Hill C.D. collection\n               in the dorm.\n\n     A BIG AMIABLE STUDENT approaches before VERONICA can show disgust.\n\n                             BIG AMIABLE STUDENT\n               Brad-man, Robinson's looking for\n               you. He says he owes you for blow\n               and he just got some product himself.\n\n                             BRAD\n               You're kidding. That pecker actually\n               scored something on his own?\n\n                             BIG AMIABLE STUDENT\n                       (ambling off)\n               He's in Sheila's room, guy. Party up.\n\n                             BRAD\n               Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV\n               anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.\n\n                             BRAD\n               Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't\n               drinking and driving?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?\n\n                             BRAD\n               Hey, don't run away now.\n\n     With a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room\n     with the coats.\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA rampages through her diary.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               Seventeen is the last year Mom buys\n               the Twinkies. When you make the\n               jump from working weekends at Pizza\n               Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you\n               lose something. Not innocence--power.\n\n     J.F.K. the cat jumps onto the Diary.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               J.F.K.!\n\n     VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm\n               allowed an understanding that my\n               parents and these Remington University\n               assholes have chosen to ignore. I\n               understand I must stop Heather.\n\n     DORM \"COAT\" ROOM\n\n     Panting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the \"coat\" room.\n     She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours\n     some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair.\n\n     VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily\n     brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches.\n     With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka\n     cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before\n     tossing the flaming cup out the window.\n\n     EXT.   ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY  NIGHT\n\n     The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled\n     with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...\n\n     INT.   DORMITORY BATHROOM  NIGHT\n\n     A dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink\n     bathroom. Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some\n     water and then spits it at her own reflection.\n\n     THE DORM \"COAT\" ROOM\n\n     VERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door.\n\n                             BRAD\n               How's my little cheerleader? Now I\n               know everyone at your high school\n               isn't so uptight, come on.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Hey really, I don't feel so great.\n\n                             BRAD\n               Let's do it on the coats. It'll\n               be excellent.\n\n     BRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I have a little prepared speech I\n               give when my suitor wants more\n               than I'd like to give him....\n               Gee Blank, I had a nice....\n\n                             BRAD\n               Save the speeches for Malcom X.\n               I just wanna get laid.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You don't deserve my fucking speech!\n\n     VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed\n     causing him to slide off onto the floor.\n\n     DORM HALLWAY\n\n     VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she\n     sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited\n     BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some\n     STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm.\n\n     BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish.\n     DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set\n     down her beer and walk toward VERONICA.\n\n     DORMITORY ALLEY\n\n     The fire in the trashcan is raging.\n\n     DORM HALLWAY\n\n     A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               What's your damage? Brad says\n               you're being a real cooze.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Heather, I feel awful, like I'm\n               going to throw up. Can we jam, please?\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               No. Hell no.\n\n     VERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings\n     herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds.\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               Betty Finn was a true friend and I\n               sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs\n               and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd\n               be like offing the Wicked Witch of the\n               West. Or is it East? West! I sound\n               like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing\n               her aerobicized ass but tonight let me\n               dream of a world without Heather. A\n               world where I am free.\n\n     DORM HALLWAY\n\n     VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth.\n     A smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss.\n     VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background.\n\n     DORMITORY ALLEY\n\n     VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a\n     screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the\n     trashcan bellows like Mt. Vesuvius.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               You stupid cunt!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You goddamn bitch!\n\n     The flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic light.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               You were nothing before you met me!\n               You were playing Barbies with Betty\n               Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a\n               Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout\n               Cookie! I got you into a Remington\n               Party! What's my thanks? It's on the\n               hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n                       (totally in control)\n               Monday morning, you're history. I'll\n               tell everyone about tonight.

Transfer to Jefferson.\n               No one at Westerburg's going to let\n               you play their reindeer games.\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the\n     wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (exhaling deeply)\n               S'okay....\n\n                             J.D.\n               I saw the croquet set-up in the back.\n               Up for a match?\n\n     VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems\n     ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead....\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Sure. But I'm Blue.\n\n     EXT.   THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT\n\n     The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's\n     backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of\n     clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest\n     together by the first wicket.\n\n                             J.D. (V.O.)\n               Goddamn, no wonder you looked so\n               mangled when I came through the window.\n\n     Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               I've always treated Heather's teen\n               queen power plays as bullshit.....\n\n     As VERONICA quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a\n     rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               But I'm really scared. Who am I going\n               to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound\n               like an Afterschool Special.\n\n     The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans\n     resting side by side at another wicket.\n\n                             J.D. (V.O.)\n               That was my first game of Strip\n               Croquet, you know. I thank you.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               You're welcome. It's a lot more\n               interesting than just flinging\n               off your clothes and boning away\n               on the neighbor's swing set.\n\n     VERONICA'S blue mallet has been staked into the ground. Her\n     panties hang on one end, J.D.'s underwear hangs on the other.\n\n                             J.D. (O.S.)\n               Well, I don't know. There's\n               something to be said for...Ouch!\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. are finally revealed, entangled in an\n     artful pose upon J.D.'s gunslinger coat. They warmly kiss.\n     VERONICA breaks off to uneasily giggle.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               What a night.\n\n     J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on\n     it, closing her eyes tightly.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               What a life. I almost moved into high\n               school out of sixth grade because I\n               was some genius. We all decided to\n               chuck the idea because I'd have\n               trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.\n\n     VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and\n     gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she\n     murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use\n               my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss\n               to wear and how to hit three keggers\n               before curfew. Some genius.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Heather Chandler is one bitch that\n               deserves to die.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Killing her won't solve anything.\n\n                             J.D.\n               A well-timed lightning bolt through\n               her window and Monday morning, all\n               the other heathers, shit, everybody\n               would be cast fucking adrift.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Well then, I'll pray for rain.\n\n                             J.D.\n               See the condoms in the grass over\n               there. We killed tonight, Veronica.\n               We murdered our baby.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Just saying it's not hard to end a life.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               There's a big difference between\n               the most popular girl in the school\n               and dead sperm.\n\n     They laugh. VERONICA maneuvers herself into a sitting position.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I guess I don't know what the hell\n               I'm talking about.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I know exactly what the hell you're\n               talking about and you're right, you\n               don't know what the hell you're\n               talking about. Let's just grow up,\n               be adults, and die.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Good plan.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               But before that, I'd like to see\n               Heather Chandler puke her guts out.\n\n     INT.   HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM--DAY\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER's bedroom is lushly and expensively\n     furnished with a glass coffee table as an eye-catching\n     centerpiece. HEATHER CHANDLER half-sleeps in twisted\n     bedsheets as MRS. CHANDLER sticks her head in the door.\n\n                             MRS. CHANDLER\n               We are leaving soon for your\n               grandmother's. If you care to join us...\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Bag that.\n\n                             MRS. CHANDLER\n               Is that a \"No\" in your lingo?\n\n     As the door closes, HEATHER CHANDLER raises her arm and\n     gives her departed Mother \"the finger.\"\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Lingo this.\n\n     INT.   THE CHANDLER KITCHEN--DAY\n\n     The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before\n     VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (quietly)\n               Trust me. She skips the Saturday\n               morning trip to Grandma's even\n               when she's not hungover.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Then let's just concoct ourselves a\n               little hangover cure that'll induce\n               her to spew red, white, and blue.\n\n     VERONICA opens the refrigerator. J.D. opens the cupboard\n     beneath the sink.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               What about orange juice and milk?\n               What's the upchuck factor on that?\n\n     J.D. holds up a bottle of Pine-Sol.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Don't be a dick. That stuff'll\n               kill her.\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends\n     back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as\n     J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent,\n     scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put\n               it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it\n               be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?\n\n                             J.D.\n               Man Veronica, pull the plug on that\n               shit. I say we go with Big Blue.\n\n     J.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue\n     liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               What are you doing? You just\n               can't go.....Besides, she'd never\n               drink anything that looks like that.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Okay we'll use this. She won't be\n               able to tell what she's drinking.\n\n     J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the\n     poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause\n     ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of orange\n     juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Just give me a cup, jerk.\n\n     J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA\n     tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange\n     juice into the cup.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe\n               we could cough a phlegm globber in\n               it or something.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Yeah, great.\n\n     They both start coughing harshly.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll\n               do quite nicely. Quite nicely.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Chick-en.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You're not funny.\n\n     J.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down at\n     the mess of toxic containers. With both arms, VERONICA clumps\n     the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put\n     them away. J.D. swaggers back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs\n     back into view.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I'm sorry.\n\n     J.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes\n     with a grudging smile.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Bonehead.\n\n     VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups.\n\n     Not the one with milk and orange juice in it.\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER angelically sleeps as VERONICA and J.D. enter.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Morning, Heather.\n\n     Like a lion, HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle\n               surprise. Hear about Veronica's\n               affection for regurgitation?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               We both said a lot of things we\n               didn't mean, last night.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?\n\n                             J.D.\n               Veronica knew you'd have a hangover.\n               So I whipped this up. Family recipe.\n\n     J.D. holds out the ceramic cup. HEATHER CHANDLER snorts.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Did you put a phlegm globber in it\n               or something? I'm not drinking that piss.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I knew this stuff would be too intense.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink\n               it just because you call me chicken.\n\n     They do. They're right.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Just give me the cup, jerk.\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in anger.\n     She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all. She then\n     launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Corn nuts!\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER'S eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes\n     through the glass coffee table. VERONICA and J.D. freeze.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Something tells me you picked up\n               the wrong cup.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               No shit, sherlock. I can't believe\n               it. I just killed my best friend.\n\n                             J.D.\n               And your worst enemy.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...\n\n     VERONICA staggers to a desk. J.D. laughs out of shock.\n\n                             J.D.\n               What are we going to tell the cops?\n               \"Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge.\"\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Stop kidding around. I'm going to\n               have to send my S.A.T. scores to\n               San Quentin instead of Stanford.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I'm just a little freaked, all right?\n                       (a beat)\n               You got what you wanted, you know.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               It's one thing to want somebody out\n               of your life. It's another thing to\n               serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.\n\n     VERONICA stares off as J.D. paces like a caged animal. He\n     scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees\n     Cliff Notes for The Bell Jar plus a magazine proclaiming\n     \"THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN\" sticking out from beneath\n     HEATHER CHANDLER's body.\n\n                             J.D.\n               We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime.\n               But if this was like a suicide thing.....\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Like a suicide thing?\n\n                             J.D.\n               Adolescence is a period of life\n               fraught with anxiety and confusion.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (calming down)\n               I can do Heather's handwriting as\n               well as my own.\n\n     VERONICA takes some stationery from the desk and begins\n     writing, calling out her words.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               \"You might think what I've done is\n               shocking...\"\n\n                             J.D.\n               \"To me though, suicide is the\n               natural answer to the myriad\n               of problems life has given me.\"\n\n                             VERONICA\n               That's good, but Heather would\n               never use the word \"myriad.\"\n\n                             J.D.\n               This is the last thing she'll ever\n               write. She'll want to cash in on as\n               many fifty-cent words as poss.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               She missed \"myriad\" on a vocab\n               test two weeks ago, all right?\n\n                             J.D.\n               That only proves my point more. The word\n               is a badge for her failures at school.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You're probably right...\"People think\n               just because you're beautiful and\n               popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody\n               understood I had feelings too.\"\n\n                             J.D.\n               \"I die knowing no one knew the real me.\"\n\n                             VERONICA\n               That's good. Have you done this before?\n\n     VERONICA's smile dies as she looks to HEATHER CHANDLER'S corpse.\n\n     INT.   SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY\n\n     At the head of a long conference table is the bearlike\n     PRINCIPAL GOWAN. Circling the table is the gray-haired but\n     savvy MRS. POPE, the black counselor PAUL HYDE, the yuppie math\n     teacher KEVIN STAPLES, and most noticeably, the eccentrically\n     dressed MS. PAULINE FLEMING. Coats are in chairs and cigarette\n     smoke is in the air, as the group batters their way through a\n     morning mourning conference.\n\n                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN\n               Any other Principal would take the same\n               position. Keep things business as usual.\n\n                             COUNSELOR HYDE\n               Heather Chandler's not your everyday\n               suicide. She was very popular.\n\n                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN\n               I let the kids go before lunch and\n               the switchboard'll light up like a\n               Christmas Tree.\n\n                             KEVIN STAPLES\n               The parents will be sympathetic, sir.\n               These are troubled times for the young.\n\n                             MRS. POPE\n               I must say I was impressed to see\n               that she made proper use of the word\n               \"myriad\" in her suicide note after\n               brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.\n\n                             PAULINE\n                       (dramatically cutting in)\n               I find it profoundly disturbing that\n               we are told of a tragic destruction\n               of youth and all we can talk about\n               is adequate mourning times and\n               misused vocabulary words.\n\n     A collective sigh goes across the room.\n\n                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN\n               Oh Christ.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               The school, meaning both students\n               and teachers, must revel in this\n               revealing moment. I suggest we get\n               everyone into the cafeteria and\n               just talk. And feel. Together.\n\n                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN\n               Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me\n               when the shuttle lands...Now is\n               this Heather the cheerleader?\n\n                             COUNSELOR HYDE\n               That would be Heather Mcnamara.\n\n                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN\n               Damn. I'd be willing to go half a\n               day for a cheerleader.\n\n                             KEVIN STAPLES\n               Let's just pack it in an hour early.\n\n                             PRINCIPAL GOWAN\n               Done. I hate Mondays.\n\n     INT.   PAULINE FLEMING'S CLASSROOM--DAY\n\n     The desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an\n     amusingly chaotic position by PAULINE'S PUPILS. She is furious.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget\n               it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled\n               to be given an example of everything\n               I've taught you. That example is\n               Heather Chandler. I have the note!\n\n     PAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note. The class AAAHS.\n\n                             MALE STUDENT\n               All right!\n\n                             PAULINE\n               I'll pass the suicide note around\n               the room so you can feel its tragic\n               beauty for yourself. Let us share\n               together the feelings the suicide has\n               spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?\n\n                             FEMALE STUDENT\n               I heard it was really gnarly. She\n               drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and\n               stuff then she smashed....\n\n                             PAULINE\n               Now, now, we're not here to rehash\n               the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions.\n\n                             THE ALL-OUT NERD\n               Are we going to be tested on this?\n\n     A stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks.\n     The note continues to be breathlessly passed around.\n\n                             PETER\n               Heather and I used to go together,\n               but she said I was boring. I realize\n               now I wasn't really boring. She was\n               just dissatisfied with her life.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               That's very good Peter.\n\n     VERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by\n     putting her hands over her face.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               Dear Veronica, Heather was your\n               soulmate.....Share.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Heather was cool, but cruel. The good\n               looks and bad manners gave her power,\n               but it could not give her happiness.\n\n     The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to\n     her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues,\n     realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               She realized the only way she could\n               be happy was to give up her power and\n               the only way she could do that was death.\n\n     PAULINE cries. The PUPILS applaud. VERONICA queasily smiles.\n\n     INT.   THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY\n\n     The GIRLS are finishing up putting on their clothes.\n\n                             HEATHER MCNAMARA\n               Oh God, it's so unfair.

My clothes!\n\n     HEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward\n     the cameras. VERONICA looks down at the soaked, stopped Swatch\n     on her arm. She takes it off and drops it in a nearby trashcan.\n\n     INT. THE DEAN LIVING ROOM--LATE AFTERNOON\n\n     A massive T.V. set shows the image of HEATHER DUKE\n     posed by a tree, talking into a microphone.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE (T.V.)\n               I choose to remember the good times.\n               Like when we got our ears pierced\n               at the mall.\n\n     The image of HEATHER MCNAMARA sitting in the grass talking\n     into a microphone supersedes HEATHER DUKE's.\n\n                             HEATHER MCNAMARA (T.V.)\n               I can still hear those late night\n               talks on the phone.\n\n     The image of PETER DAWSON sitting on a rock comes on next.\n\n                             PETER (T.V.)\n               The day I won her that stuffed rhino\n               at the 4-H Fair, she said to me....\n\n                             VERONICA (O.S.)\n               You're an asshole!

He rows as he speaks.\n     The Brady Bunch sputters on the T.V. screen before him.\n\n                             FRED DEAN\n               It was miserable. Some damn tribe of\n               withered old bitches doesn't want us\n               to terminate that fleabag hotel. All\n               because Glenn Miller and his band once\n               took a shit there. It's just like\n               Kansas.

He turns to watch KURT,\n     wearing an overwhelmingly tinted motorcycle helmet that\n     reads THE TRUE KILLER across the top. KURT is spooked.\n\n                             RAM (O.S.)\n               Say it!\n\n                             BRACES\n               Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks.\n\n     Unamused, RAM throws BRACES to the ground. BRACES semi-cries.\n\n                             BRACES\n               I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm!\n               I can't get enough of them.

Promise.\n\n     Moving into the background, BRACES wipes dirt and blood off\n     his face as his friends glumly watch on.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               All right, but I hope it isn't\n               going to be one of those nights where\n               they get shitfaced and take us to a\n               pasture to tip cows.\n\n     EXT.   COW PASTURE--NIGHT\n\n     A COW stands sleeping. Giggling and drunk, KURT and RAM\n     scramble around the COW. Uncomfortable and sober, VERONICA\n     and HEATHER MCNAMARA look on.\n\n                             KURT\n               Is it sleeping, dude?\n\n                             RAM\n               I think so, man.\n\n                             KURT\n               Then get over on my side. Oh shit,\n               cowtipping is the fucking greatest.\n\n                             RAM\n               Punch it in!\n\n     KURT and RAM slam their knuckles and then lean against the\n     COW, poised to shove. HEATHER MCNAMARA manages a smile but\n     VERONICA glares it away.\n\n                             KURT\n               Count of three, guy.\n\n                             KURT AND RAM\n               One. Two. Three!\n\n     An O.S. Moo and the Jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes\n     against the mortified faces of VERONICA and HEATHER MCNAMARA.\n\n     DEEPER IN THE PASTURE--LATER IN THE NIGHT\n\n     KURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA.\n\n                             KURT\n               \"When I get that feeling, I need\n               sexual healing.....\"\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Yeah, right, asshole.\n\n     VERONICA makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately\n     stare at RAM on top of a dispirited HEATHER MCNAMARA. KURT's\n     intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline.\n     Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT\n     squints up the hill and falls over backwards.\n\n                             J.D.\n               What is this shit?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I'm doing a favor for Heather. A\n               double date. I tried to tell you\n               at the funeral but you rode off.\n\n                             KURT\n                       (still face down)\n               \"Feel like making bah da dah bah da\n               dah, feel like making love.\"\n\n                             J.D.\n               Another fucking Heather.\n                       (harshly laughs)\n               I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior\n               tonight. Seven high schools in seven\n               states and the only thing different\n               was my locker combination. We've broke\n               through the peer pressure cooker. So\n               what if we had to kill Miss Popularity..\n\n     VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!\n\n                             J.D.\n               Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.\n\n     J.D. solemnly reaches toward VERONICA. She, less solemn,\n     takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill.\n\n                             KURT\n               \"And she's buying the stairway to heaven..\"\n\n     INT.   NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY\n\n     In a cluttered school workshop, Editor DENNIS and a YEARBOOK\n     GIRL, wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, confer over a layout sheet.\n     Dennis's Famine Fund partner PETER DAWSON pouts behind them.\n\n                             DENNIS\n               I'm not belittling the Famine Fund\n               Peter, but we're talking teen suicide!\n               Westerburg finally got one and I'm\n               not going to blow it.\n\n                             PETER\n               Great. Heather gets the headline and I\n               get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.\n\n     VERONICA breezes in.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Hi Guys. I came to check on this\n               week's lunchtime poll topic.\n\n                             DENNIS\n               Don't worry about it, Veronica,\n               sit down. That funeral yesterday\n               must have been really rough.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Oh. Sure.\n\n                             YEARBOOK GIRL\n               We were, uh, wondering if maybe you\n               had some poems or artwork that\n               Heather did that we could put in\n               the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               The what?\n\n                             YEARBOOK GIRL\n               Take a look.

And? I left him drunk and\n               flailing in cowshit.\n\n                             COURTNEY\n               I don't know. He was really detailed.\n\n                             PETER\n               Shut up, Courtney.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Don't shut up.

VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY\n\n     VERONICA arousingly speaks into her phone.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I\n               didn't expect to be calling either. I\n               guess my emotions took over. I was\n               wondering if you wanted all those\n               things you've been saying to really\n               happen. It's always been a fantasy of\n               mine to have two guys at once......\n               Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.\n\n     Revealed to be lounging on her bed, J.D. laughs out loud.\n     VERONICA throws a book at him.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               That's right, tonight. In the woods\n               behind the school. Don't forget Ram.\n\n     INT.  THE KELLY KITCHEN--DAY\n\n     KURT hangs up with an amazed expression on his face.\n\n                             KURT\n               Women.\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA\n     breaks into a laugh.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I don't get the point of me writing\n               a suicide note when we'll just be\n               shooting them with blanks.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Get crucial.

Hey listen,\n               my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.\n\n     VERONICA drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed.\n     With a patient smile, J.D. pulls her back down.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Do you take German?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               French.\n\n     J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.\n\n                             J.D.\n               These are Ich Luge bullets. My\n               grandfather snared a shitload of\n               them in W.W. Two. They're like\n               tranquilizers only they break the\n               surface of the skin, enough to\n               cause blood, but not any real harm.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               So it looks like the person's been\n               shot and killed when they're really\n               just unconscious and bleeding.\n\n     J.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring.\n\n                             J.D.\n               We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look\n               like they shot each other. By the time\n               Kurt and Ram regain consciousness,\n               they'll be the laughingstock's of the\n               school. The note's the punchline.\n               How'd it turn out?\n\n     VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also\n     plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of\n     the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both\n     papers.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               First tell me this similarity is\n               not incredible.\n\n                             J.D.\n                       (warmly)\n               Incredible similarity.\n\n     VERONICA pulls back the note and reads.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Ram and I died the day we realized\n               we could never reveal our forbidden\n               love to an uncaring and ununderstanding\n               world. The joy we shared in each other's\n               arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet\n               we were forced to live the lie of Sexist-\n               Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Exquisite, but I don't think\n               ununderstanding is a word.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               We don't want to make them out to be\n               too secretly eloquent. Why would the\n               Germans invent a bullet that doesn't\n               kill people? I mean it was World War\n               Two, not a school play.\n\n                             J.D.\n                       (rapid-fire)\n               They used them on themselves to\n               make it look like they were dead.\n               Really quite a brilliant device, but\n               too flamboyant to seriously produce.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.\n\n     VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable\n     tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her.\n\n                             J.D.\n               It doesn't work on small animals!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Oh.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Uh well hey, let's take a look at the\n               homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now,\n               prepare to be a little disappointed.\n\n     J.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the\n     contents on the bed.\n\n                             J.D.\n               We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a\n               Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You must have had fun.\n\n                             J.D.\n               You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot.\n               The one perfecto thing I picked up...\n\n     J.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly\n     raises out two bottles of Perrier water.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Perrier water!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Oh come on. Lots of people drink\n               Perrier. It's come a long way.\n\n                             J.D.\n               This is Ohio. If you don't have a\n               brewsky in your hand after dark you\n               might as well be wearing a dress.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (mock-seductively)\n               Oh, you're so smart. How about a\n               little heterosexuality before we go?\n\n     J.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss.\n\n     EXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT--NIGHT\n\n     A tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk\n     through the parking lot toward the woods.\n\n                             RAM\n                       (singing)\n               Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever\n               need!

I said Sex and Drugs and...\n\n                             KURT\n               Shut the fuck up, all right.\n\n                             RAM\n               Lighten up, dude. In those woods is\n               some of the finest pussy in the school\n               and we don't even have to buy it a\n               hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!\n\n     KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM.\n\n     EXT.   CLEARING IN THE WOODS--NIGHT\n\n     VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods.\n     She nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT\n     and RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods.\n\n                             KURT\n               Hi Veronica.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (forced cheerfulness)\n               Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.\n\n     RAM smacks his hands together.\n\n                             RAM\n               So do we just start fucking?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I've made a circle on each end of\n               the clearing. Ram, you come over here.\n\n     KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him.\n     A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at\n     the opposite end of the foggy clearing.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               When you get in the circle, strip.\n\n     The guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.\n\n                             RAM\n               What about you?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I was hoping you'd rip my clothes\n               off me, sport.\n\n                             RAM\n               Oh. Good idea.\n\n     KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Count of three, guys.\n\n     RAM giggles in anticipation.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               One.\n\n     KURT finally cracks a smile.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Two.\n\n     J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his\n     right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Three.\n\n     J.D. almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead.\n\n     VERONICA rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT. Using\n     both hands, she fires, but misses completely. KURT runs\n     away onto the path. VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Shucks.\n\n     J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Did you miss him completely?\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (giggling)\n               Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth\n               it just to see the look on....\n\n                             J.D.\n               Don't move! I'll get him back!\n\n     VERONICA's laughter cuts off like a faucet. Suddenly trembling\n     and confused, she watches J.D. bolt into the woods.\n\n     THE PATH\n\n     A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.\n\n     OFF THE PATH\n\n     J.D., with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees.\n\n     THE CLEARING\n\n     VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.\n\n     THE PATH\n\n     KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly\n     moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun.\n     KURT runs back the other way with a strangled moan.\n\n     THE CLEARING\n\n     VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He\n     does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding\n     and dead, dead, dead.\n\n     KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Now!\n\n     In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips\n     around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.\n\n     SQUAD CAR IN SCHOOL PARKING LOT\n\n     Two cops, MILNER and McCORD, smoke marijuana in a squad car\n     already filled with smoke. After a coughing fit, MILNER shouts.\n\n                             MILNER\n               I heard it that time!\n\n                             McCORD\n               Wha?\n\n                             MILNER\n               Another gunshot! From the woods!\n\n                             McCORD\n               Shit, let's roll.\n\n     The two officer explode out of the car.\n\n     THE CLEARING\n\n     J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA\n     zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Kurt doesn't look too good.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Remember he's left-handed.\n\n     A quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand.\n\n                             MILNER (O.S.)\n               Keep going until you hit the clearing!\n\n     J.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run\n     into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into\n     the clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop.\n\n                             McCORD\n               Mother of Shit!\n\n                             MILNER\n               Call in!\n\n     MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out.\n\n                             MILNER\n               I heard something out there. I'm\n               checking it out.\n\n     MILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is\n     holding the pulse of KURT KELLY.\n\n                             McCORD\n               This is Officer McCord and I've got\n               two dead bodies in the woods behind\n               Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of\n               them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.\n\n     IN THE WOODS\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. flow through the trees. An Owl hoos.\n\n     ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS\n\n     MILNER blindly barrels through the woods.\n\n     JUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and start running up\n     a grassy hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Faster!\n\n     IN THE WOODS\n\n     MILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving.\n\n     THE HILL\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting.\n\n     MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam\n     the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill.\n\n     THE SAWYER CAR\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin\n     taking off their clothes.\n\n     THE HILL\n\n     MILNER continues to move up the hill.\n\n     THE SAWYER CAR\n\n     VERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE CAR\n\n     MILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie-\n     talkie startles him.\n\n                             McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)\n               Milner, can you hear me? What's going down?\n\n     MILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-talkie.\n\n                             MILNER\n               Think what I heard was just a\n               stinking owl. All I got is two kids\n               making out in the backseat of a\n               car. Should I pry them apart?\n\n                             McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)\n               Forget it. I got all the answers\n               back here, partner.\n\n     THE SAWYER CAR\n\n     Seeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They\n     catch their breath, smile, then continue passionately necking.\n\n     THE CLEARING\n\n     MILNER runs back into the clearing.\n\n                             MILNER\n               What's the deal?\n\n                             McCORD\n               Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot\n               each other.\n\n                             MILNER\n               That's Kurt Kelly!\n\n                             McCORD\n               Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.\n\n                             MILNER\n               Oh my God, suicide? Why?\n\n                             McCORD\n               Does this answer your question?\n\n     McCORD reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the\n     bottles of Perrier water.\n\n                             MILNER\n               Oh man, they were fags!\n\n                             McCORD\n               Listen up, \"We could never reveal our\n               forbidden love to an uncaring and\n               ununderstanding world.\"\n\n                             MILNER\n               Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade\n               magazine Honorable Mention...\n\n     MILNER shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up.\n\n                             MILNER\n               Wait a second. How did they shoot\n               each other if we heard two separate\n               sets of gunshots?\n\n                             McCORD\n               Shit, I always hear gunshots when I'm\n               high. Life is one crazy bitch. Don't\n               try to analyze it. The quarterback\n               buggering the linebacker. What a waste.\n\n                             MILNER\n               Oh the humanity.\n\n     INT.   SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--MORNING\n\n     Another morning mourning conference. The participants look a\n     little more frazzled.

Whatever.\n\n     EXT.   STUDENT PARKING LOT--MORNING\n\n     VERONICA's car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot.\n\n     THE SAWYER CAR\n\n     A battered VERONICA climbs into the front seat, pulling on her\n     blazer. She presses in the car cigarette lighter. J.D. rumbles\n     from the back as other cars begin to fill the lot.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               We killed them, didn't we?\n\n                             J.D.\n               Of course.\n\n     VERONICA tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm\n     of her hand. J.D. hurdles into the front seat and bats the\n     lighter away. He lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh\n     of VERONICA's hand as she wails away.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Ich Luge bullets!

Really? On the\n               suicides. No, sounds great. Bye.\n\n     VERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying\n     against the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reaches\n     up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen.\n     She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing.\n\n                             VERONICA (V.O.)\n               Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit\n               has a body count.\n\n     Sitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as\n     J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup.\n\n                              VERONICA (V.O.)\n               The most popular people in the school\n               are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a\n               good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather\n               depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I\n               gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing\n               but what really frightens me is that\n               I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do\n               next. It's God versus my boyfriend\n               and God's losing....\n\n     VERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping\n     out her monocle.

He\n     raucously crawls after her.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               We're breaking up. I am out!\n\n                             J.D.\n               Wha-at? Come on, there's another\n               T.V. in the kitchen. You know\n               you used to have a sense of humor.\n\n     J.D. playfully tackles VERONICA. This calms rather than angers.\n     She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You're getting too cool for me, J.D.\n               I don't know how to talk to you.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Our relationship's moving fast, I know,\n               but I have real, real respect for you.\n\n     VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and\n     eventually into a walking-out-the-door position.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline\n               thing work.

You'll be back.\n\n     J.D. bounds up to a kitchen counter and flicks on a small T.V.\n     BIGFUN can be heard booming their song. J.D. broods.\n\n     INT.   EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY\n\n     J.D. moves to an empty row of desks. He turns the first desk as\n     to face the second. HEATHER DUKE warily lowers herself into the\n     second desk as J.D. flops a manilla envelope onto it. HEATHER\n     DUKE opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8 by 10's.\n     She gasps.\n\n     The first shot shows a YOUNG HEATHER DUKE in a summer camp\n     uniform that vibrantly reads HEATHER, She is holding one end\n     of a large poster board drawing of two Eskimos rubbing noses.\n     Holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly\n     reading MARTHA, is a YOUNG MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               What the.....\n\n     With a harsh laugh, she takes in the next photograph. It has\n     YOUNG HEATHER DUKE and YOUNG MARTHA eating toasted\n     marshmallows off each other's sticks.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n                       (trying to stay clam)\n               Where did you get these?\n\n                             J.D.\n               Oh, I just had the nicest chat with\n               Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's\n               scary how everyone's got a story to\n               tell....Would you care to see the\n               canoeing shots?\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               What do you want from me?\n\n                             J.D.\n               Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy\n               togetherness, it needs a leader.\n               Heather Chandler was that leader but...\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               But she couldn't handle it.\n\n     J.D. laughs. She's on the ball.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye\n               Holden says his ideal job'd be making\n               sure some kids don't fall off a cliff.\n               He doesn't realize if you pay too much\n               attention to the kids, you'll back off\n               the cliff yourself.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Very very. The photographs?\n\n                             J.D.\n               Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a\n               favor. You'll get the negatives and\n               everything back then.\n\n     J.D. launches away from his desk with a grin. He places a\n     red ribbon on HEATHER DUKE's desk.\n\n                             J.D.\n               In the meantime, strength, And hey,\n               there's a little gift.\n\n     INT.   THE GIRLS BATHROOM\n\n     A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up\n     into the mirror. In a trance, she pulls her hair back Heather\n     Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon J.D. gave her.\n\n     A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC\n     BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly\n     in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet\n     hands using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKE's dress. HEATHER\n     DUKE winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off.\n\n     HALLWAY\n\n     HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly\n     strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather\n     Chandler fashion to various passers-by.\n\n     EARL FRAZIER'S LOCKER\n\n     VERONICA genially lobbys the big black EARL FRAZIER.\n\n                             EARL\n               Let me get it clear, Veronica. You\n               want yourself a sweet homeboy for\n               this T.V. show so you can show\n               everybody what a loose, Martin Luther\n               Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (chuckling)\n               Something like that. Will you do it?\n\n                             EARL\n               Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I just want to show different kinds\n               of people can get together and it\n               doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't\n               get treated badly here do you?\n\n                             EARL\n               I don't get treated at all, but hey,\n               don't worry about it. I'll do your\n               thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.\n\n     VERONICA hands him a Guest Pass tag.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Things are going to change, Earl.\n\n                             EARL\n               Uh-huh.\n\n     HEATHER DUKE impishly blinds VERONICA with her hands.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Guess who?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Heather.\n\n     HEATHER DUKE lets go with a small giggle. VERONICA turns to\n     face her Heather Chandler-looking friend and her smile dies.\n     VERONICA violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off.\n\n     INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT\n\n     Lying on the floor, VERONICA concentrates on her phone. With\n     a deep sigh, she pushbuttons out a number. She pauses, then...\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Ouch. Your machine's got the most\n               obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry.\n\n     INT.   HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA's voice drones through HEATHER DUKE's answering machine.\n\n                             VERONICA (O.S./machine)\n               I'm just calling to say you can\n               wear your hair any way you want to.\n\n     A Male hand picks up the phone. It's College boy DAVID.\n\n                             DAVID\n               Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on\n               anybody's carpet lately?\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA cringes.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Is this David? Heather's David?\n               What are you doing....\n\n     HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM\n\n                             DAVID\n               What can I say? I was pretty broken\n               up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed\n               somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I'm delirious for the both of you.\n               Can you put Heather on?\n\n     HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM\n\n     DAVID proudly looks down off-screen to his lap.\n\n                             DAVID\n               She can't really talk right now.\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather\n     address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away,\n     VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night\n     table drawer and draws up another address book; this one is\n     frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and dials.....\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Hello, Betty.....\n\n     EXT.   SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY\n\n     BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in\n     delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face.\n\n                             BETTY\n               I don't believe it. I'm winning.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Don't get cocky, girl.\n\n     BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.\n\n                             BETTY\n               I missed you. I know I'm not as, as\n               exciting as your other friends.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               That's bullshit. Just shoot.\n\n     BETTY once again bends and raises.\n\n                             BETTY\n               Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (warmly)\n               Shoot.\n\n     BETTY finally shoots. Feebly.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Betty, your daydreams are a lot\n               better than my realities, believe\n               me. I'm afraid though it's time to\n               get your butt kicked.\n\n                             BETTY\n               Ronnie!\n\n     VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead\n     hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she\n     determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.\n\n                             BETTY\n               Hey, you're not settling for the two\n               shots are you? Knock me out girl.\n               It's the only way.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               It's not my style, okay?\n\n                             BETTY\n               Nice guys finish last. I should know.\n\n     VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing\n     toward the porch and a statuesque HEATHER DUKE who does\n     not budge as the ball whizzes past her.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Brav-o!\n\n                             BETTY FINN\n                       (nervously)\n               I've got to get going, Veronica.\n               See you at the studio.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Sure. See ya.\n\n     HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering\n     desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and\n     fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.\n\n                             HEATHER MCNAMARA\n               Croquet won't be the same without Heather.\n\n     HEATHER DUKE hustles back toward a passing BETTY FINN.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The\n               Whitney James Teenage Suicide\n               Prevention T.V. Special isn't going\n               to be taped at the studios. It's\n               going to be done in the Park.\n\n                             BETTY\n               But I thought...\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n                       (heading back)\n               It's going to be like a big picnic.\n               Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED!\n\n     LATER IN THE GAME\n\n     HEATHER DUKE's red ball slams into HEATHER MCNAMARA's green one.\n\n                             HEATHER MCNAMARA\n               Shit.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               So did you call people to tell them\n               how to get to the studio tonight?\n\n     HEATHER DUKE savagely \"sends\" HEATHER MACNAMARA's ball into\n     the flower bed.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Back off. I called everyone, even that\n               Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone\n               a bath. I told Betty just now...Damn!\n\n     HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You're so polluted. Talking down to\n               people, making fake notes....\n\n     VERONICA blows her shot.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               I don't see what gives you the right\n               to lecture, Ronnie. You were\n               soulmates with Betty Finn until you\n               realized you're the cover of\n               Seventeen magazine and she's the\n               before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.\n\n     HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares\n     to send it.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Some people just don't matter. Why\n               should those who do carry their\n               weight? Am I right?\n\n     As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her\n     own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two\n     balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               No, you're wrong. It's not even\n               your turn.\n\n     The depressed and disoriented HEATHER MCNAMARA, laying\n     against a tree, pipes in.\n\n                             HEATHER MCNAMARA\n               She's right.....Boy, croquet's not\n               the same without Heather.\n\n     INT.  WETC T.V. STATION--DUSK\n\n     In a sleek WETC station hallway, VERONICA SAWYER, a Guest Pass\n     affixed to her heart, holds her hand in a spurting drinking\n     fountain. She watches the water splash her car lighter burn-mark.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Ich Luge bullets.

All STUDENTS are wearing pink armbands.\n\n                             PETER DAWSON\n               This is excellent, but I thought we\n               were going to get equal representation\n               on this thind: Geeks, Gearheads...\n\n     Out of nowhere, a bubbling HEATHER DUKE knots a pink armband\n     around PETER's arm with a giggle.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               They're probably just being\n               fashionably late.\n\n     PETER DAWSON prances off with a raucous laugh. VERONICA stares\n     dumbfounded at the wicked homogeneity of the STUDENTS as HEATHER\n     DUKE ties a pink armband on her.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Is this very or what? Oh, you've\n               gotta meet Whitney James! Come on!\n\n     HEATHER DUKE tugs VERONICA across the crowded studio floor to\n     where the WETC news set is situated. Smoking casually in her\n     anchor's chair is the beautiful WHITNEY JAMES.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Whitney, here's my friend.....\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               Ah please sit down.\n\n     HEATHER DUKE glides away. VERONICA uncomfortably steps onto\n     the news set and moves down next to WHITNEY JAMES.\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               I got a confession to make. My name\n               used to be Heather, too.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               But my name's not...\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               People just don't take the name Heather\n               seriously. They should, shouldn't they?\n\n     WINE AND CHEESE TABLE\n\n     HEATHER MCNAMARA surreptitiously picks up a bottle of wine and\n     with a sad expression, proceeds to down it.\n\n     THE NEWS SET\n\n     VERONICA apologizes to a blissfully oblivious WHITNEY JAMES.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there\n               were going to be different kinds of social\n               and psychological types at this gathering.\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather.\n               The minute you try to deal with the actual\n               teenagers who have contemplated suicide\n               you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand\n               filled with bad complexions, bad grades,\n               bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of\n               doody nobody wants to hear let alone\n               bend down to clean up.\n\n     WHITNEY JAMES tears open a bag of Corn Nuts and showers some\n     into her mouth. She speaks as she sucks and chews.\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's\n               exciting stuff. My personal faves\n               are those kids from loaded families\n               grabbing the mike to whine how even\n               though they bagged a B.M.W. on their\n               birthday, they're still quote-unquote\n               depressed. It's ridiculous. People who\n               say money can't buy happiness don't\n               know where to shop.\n\n     WHITNEY JAMES titters. VERONICA is a statue of mortification.\n\n     EXT.   THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--TWILIGHT\n\n     In the neighborhood park, gloomy members of various cliques sit\n     in silence at picnic tables. All are ludicrously wearing\n     Guest Passes. BETTY FINN mumbles down to her potato salad.\n     EARL FRAZIER stoically stares off into space. Heavy Metaler\n     CLYDE holds an absurdly large picnic basket.\n\n                             CLYDE\n               What the fuck?\n\n     NEWS SET\n\n     Completely flabbergasted, VERONICA manages a light tone.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               The world wants winners, I guess.\n               Not people stained with loserness.\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               Stained with loserness. Oh, I like\n               it. Can I use that. It'd be\n               dynamite on interoffice memoranda.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll\n               excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               Sure. Ciao.\n\n     STUDIO FLOOR\n\n     Sickened, VERONICA stumbles onto the studio floor. Studio\n     lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE\n     grabs VERONICA by the arm and shouts into the air.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               Everyone take their places on the stage!\n                       (to Veronica)\n               Isn't this thrilling?!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               What, the wine? I realize you're all\n               under 21, but it seemed like such a\n               perfect touch.\n                       (shouting upward)\n               Could we get some more light up here?\n\n     THE STAGE\n\n     The pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage.\n     Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a\n     seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar.\n\n     VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and\n     the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks\n     into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               Our schools have been torn apart by\n               tragedy. Let's fuse them back together\n               through love. Let's clasp hands and\n               connect ourselves in one mighty circuit\n               like a dove.\n\n     The students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp\n     hands. VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through\n     a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the stage.\n\n                             PAULINE (O.S.)\n               Let's begin a new happiness...\n\n     VERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN. He pushes up a\n     console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the\n     circle of hand-holding students is, to slowly spin around\n     the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               ...with no more suicide...\n\n                             STUDENTS\n                       (eeriely)\n               Oh yeah...\n\n     Ripping off her pink armband, VERONICA freezes. Standing at\n     the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is J.D.\n     He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Holy traumatic experiences, Batman.\n               I'm sorry you felt you had to put\n               yourself through all that shit. I\n               told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in\n               the past already, right?\n\n                             PAULINE\n               No more problems....\n\n     Devastated,  VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIAN's console.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Oh yeah.\n\n     VERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle\n     of handholding, pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground\n     around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Cute.\n\n     WHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before\n     coolly leaning over to her microphone.\n\n                             WHITNEY JAMES\n               Let's go for another take.\n\n     OUTSIDE STUDIO DOORS\n\n     VERONICA bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. She\n     kicks off her shoes and begins to jog barefoot through the\n     station hallway, weaving through various REPORTER-types.\n\n     EXT.  OUTSIDE T.V. STATION--TWILIGHT\n\n     VERONICA pops out the studio door, running faster.\n\n     GRAVELLY ROAD\n\n     She sprints down the side of a road. Her bare feet pound\n     against sharp pebbles.\n\n     THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK\n\n     VERONICA now barrels through the neighborhood park. She looks\n     to her outcast classmates. In tableau, they stare back. BETTY\n     FINN on a park carousel spins in and out of view.\n\n     PROMENADE\n\n     VERONICA speeds past the shops and the movie theatre. The viewer\n     remains at the theatre ticket booth as MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK\n     wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, pushes three dollars through the\n     ticket window to a bored female cashier.\n\n                             CASHIER\n               Bargain matinees are for the first\n               show only.\n\n                             MARTHA\n               Oh, I forgot.\n\n     MARTHA puts two crumpled bucks through the window. The\n     CASHIER shines a cruelly patronizing smile.\n\n     INT. SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM--NIGHT\n\n     VERONICA huffs and puffs into her family room where her MOM and\n     DAD are watching T.V.\n\n                             DAD\n               Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage\n               Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Color me educated. I learned high\n               school happiness is for members only,\n               Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality\n               if it lived in her uterus, and reality's\n               name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a\n               major creep.\n\n                             MOM\n               I don't know what you're talking\n               about, honey, but can it wait a bit.\n               We're watching this special program\n               on Teen Problems.\n\n     VERONICA half-bitterly laughs at the irony.\n\n     INT.  MOVIE THEATRE\n\n     The light of the screen flickers on an overwhelmingly sullen\n     MARTHA. She moves her leg and knocks a large Coke across the\n     floor. She tragically stares at the Cola pool.\n\n     SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM\n\n     A DAN RATHER VOICE booms from the T.V. The SAWYERS stare.\n\n                             DAN RATHER VOICE (O.S.)\n               Oh sure, I'll bet even back when I\n               went to school there were drugs, even\n               sex, but they were simpler times. The\n               Sherwood suicides tell the bitter\n               truth of today's young. What a waste...Oh\n\n     VERONICA snaps off the T.V.\n\n                             MOM\n               Turn that back on!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               This condescending junk makes suicide\n               seem like a cool thing to do. Hey\n               kids, make your parents and teachers\n               feel like shit! Get the respect in\n               death you'll never get in life.\n\n                             DAD\n               If we're not going to watch that\n               program, can I put on the game?\n\n                             MOM\n               Are you trying to tell me it is not\n               a troubled time for the nation's youth?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Everybody cares for youth but nobody\n               cares about Joey Blow. When that news\n               reporter gets home he'll scream at his\n               son for not mowing the lawn in the\n               right pattern.\n\n                             MOM\n               I'm lost. You don't get enough\n               attention, you get too much attention.\n               Which is it? Where are your shoes?\n\n                         VERONICA\n               All we want is to be treated like\n               human beings, not like guinea pigs\n               to be experimented on and not like\n               bunny rabbits to be patronized.\n\n                             DAD\n               I don't patronize bunny rabbits.\n\n                             MOM\n               Treated like human beings? Is that\n               what you said little Miss Voice of\n               a Generation? Just how do you think\n               adults act with other adults? You\n               think it's all just Doubles Tennis.\n               Adults can be horrible to other adults.\n               When teenagers complain that they\n               want to be treated like human beings,\n               it's usually because they are being\n               treated like human beings.\n\n     VERONICA leans against the wall with a melancholy smile.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I guess I picked the wrong time to\n               be a human being.\n\n     MOM is embarassed for getting so involved. She meekly\n     gestures to a tray of pate with a compassionate smile.\n\n                             MOM\n               You'll live. Want some pate?\n\n     HEATHER DUKE suddenly breezes in the room.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica,\n               you missed it! Pauline and Whitney\n               James were up there doing there\n               suicide rap when the cops come in\n               and announce that Martha Dumptruck\n               tried to buy the farm. She gave\n               the ticket girl at the Colfax\n               theatre a suicide note then\n               bellyflopped in front of a car.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (repulsed)\n               Is she dead?\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               That's the punchline. She's still\n               alive, in stable condition. Another\n               case of a geek trying to imitate the\n               popular people of the school and\n               failing miserably. Is that pate?\n\n     VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE in the face.\n\n     INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT\n\n     HEATHER DUKE paces the room holding an icepack to her jaw.\n     VERONICA is on the ground wiping off her bloodied feet.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I said I was sorry.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               You are out of control. Heather and\n               Kurt were a shock, but Martha\n               Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed\n               suicide hotlines in her diapers.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You're not funny. Ouch!\n\n     VERONICA rubs her feet. HEATHER DUKS shakes her head.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n                       (Heather Chandleresque)\n               What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha\n               couldn't take the heat so she got\n               out of the kitchen.

It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey-\n               I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me-\n               so-let's-commit-suicide ambience. Give\n               it a try, underline something.\n\n     J.D. giddily underlines words then slides into a prone\n     position, tossing the book to an enraged VERONICA.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Get off my bed, you sick psycho!\n               You think you're a rebel! You're\n               not a rebel! You're a sick psycho!\n               Do you think you're a rebel? Do you\n               think you're a rebel? I wanna know!\n\n                             J.D.\n               \"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's\n               call the whole thing off...Hold it!\n\n     VERONICA freezes and J.D. reaches up to her hand where she\n     holds the Catcher in the Rye. Her index finger is curled into\n     the book. Sitting up, J.D. carefully opens the book at that\n     place and peers in.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I\n               love it. I usually go for whole\n               sentences myself, but hey this is\n               perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Wait a....You're not listening! I'm\n               not on your side....\n\n     J.D. obliviously underlines the word then pulls the flailing\n     VERONICA up like an enthusiastic camp counselor.\n\n     INT.   THE DUKE KITCHEN--NIGHT\n\n     The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before\n     VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door. J.D. moves to the\n     dishwasher and opens it like a burglar opening a safe.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You're still not listening! I'm not..\n\n                             J.D.\n                       (pulling out the knife)\n               Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (taking the knife from him)\n               This knife is filthy.\n\n                             J.D.\n               What in the hell do you think I'm\n               doing? Taking out her tonsils?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               I think I know Heather a bit better\n               than you, okay? If she was going to\n               slash her wrists, the knife would\n               be absolutely spotless.\n\n     J.D. grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife.\n\n                             J.D.\n               How's this? Can you see your\n               fucking reflection?\n\n     She can and so can the viewer. Tears well in VERONICA's eyes.\n     She begins to shudder, a shattered smile quaking on her face.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Tomorrow someone else will move\n               into her place. That person\n               could be me.\n                       (suddenly deliriously defiant)\n               Ha, there's only one of us who knows\n               Heather's handwriting and if you think\n               I'm doing another suicide note.\n\n                             J.D.\n                       (laughing)\n               You don't get it, do you? Society\n               nods its head at any horror the\n               American teenager can think to\n               bring upon itself. We don't need\n               gloves and does anyone really\n               care about exact handwriting?\n\n     J.D. tears his gloves off with a giggle. He takes a pen from\n     the kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad. He\n     shoves the pen in VERONICA's hand and grabbing her hand,\n     forces her to scribble LIFE SUCKS on the paper.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Perfecto. Man, I've even got a\n               marked-up Catcher in the Rye.\n               What else does a suicide need?\n\n     J.D. pulls out the copy of the Catcher in the Rye and opens a\n     door revealing HEATHER DUKE, asleep in an artful pose on a\n     couch, MTV images from the T.V. flashing against her.\n\n                             J.D.\n                       (raising the knife)\n               If you'll excuse me......\n\n                             VERONICA\n               No-o!\n\n     J.D. hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door. VERONICA\n     races to the door wailing. She maniacally rattles the doorknob\n     trying to open the locked door.\n\n     INT.   AN ANOYNYMOUS T.V.\n\n     The sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild\n     African music thundering on the soundtrack as WHITNEY JAMES,\n     in a T.V. screen, maniacally addresses the viewer. A shiny\n     number 4 flashes on and off in the corner.\n\n     INT.   NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY\n\n     In speeded-up imagery, DENNIS, PETER, and the YEARBOOK GIRL\n     manuever pictures of HEATHER CHANDLER, KURT, RAM, and HEATHER\n     DUKE in mind-bogglingly countless ways in order to accomodate\n     them all on the same two page layout.\n\n     INT.   FRONT OF THE CAFETERIA--DAY\n\n     With even more speeded-up imagery, four STUDENTS wearing \"What\n     a Waste, Oh the Humanity\" T-shirts toss out tons of black\n     armbands into a hungry crowd.\n\n     INT.   FUNERAL HOME--DAY\n\n     The wild African music and the speeded up imagery slams to a\n     halt at the sigh of HEATHER DUKE lying serenely in a coffin.\n     FATHER FAUST wearing dark sunglasses and a terrifying toupee,\n     walks in front of her to address a sizable group of ADULTS and\n     STUDENTS sitting in foldout chairs before him. FATHER FAUST\n     dramatically looks over the crowd before finally speaking.\n\n                             FATHER RIPPER\n               Eskimo.\n\n     FATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up\n     the copy of The Catcher in the Rye.\n\n                             FATHER RIPPER\n               Heather Duke underlined a lot of\n               things in this copy of The Catcher\n               in the Rye, but I believe the word\n               Eskimo, underlined all by itself is\n               the key to understanding Heather's pain.\n\n     VERONICA stands in a corner with an \"Oh brother\" look on her face.\n\n                             FATHER RIPPER\n               On the surface, Heather Duke was the\n               vivacious young lady we all knew her\n               to be. But her soul was in Antartica,\n               freezing with the knowledge of the way\n               fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way\n               parents can be unresponsive, and as she\n               writes so eloquently in her suicide note,\n               the way life can suck. We'll all miss\n               Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope\n               she's rubbing noses with Jesus.\n\n     HEATHER CHANDLER moves next to VERONICA holding a plate\n     of steaming spaghetti. She is wearing nerdy glasses and\n     something that looks like an intergalactic prison unifrom.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Is this turnout weak or what? I had\n               at least seventy more people at\n               my funeral.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Heather? Wha...\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is\n               s-o-o boring. If I have to sing\n               \"Kumbaya\" one more time...\n\n                             VERONICA\n               What are you doing here?!\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               I made your favorite. Spaghetti.\n               Lots of oregano.\n\n     With a squeal, HEATHER CHANDLER plunges VERONICA's face into\n     the plate of spaghetti.\n\n                             HEATHER CHANDLER\n               Dinner!\n\n     INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT\n\n     Uncurling from the fetal position that she had fallen asleep\n     in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her\n     mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all\n     been a dream...........\n\n                             MOM (O.S.)\n               Dinner! Veronica! Dinner!\n\n     VERONICA closes her eyes and holds her heart. She suddenly\n     launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her\n     monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing.\n\n                             VERONICA (O.S.)\n               Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not\n               the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A.\n               That is to say, no one but me. I know\n               where J.D. is coming from and where\n               he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going\n               to teach him what's right. I'm going\n               to stop J.D....If it's the last thing\n               I do.\n\n     VERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the\n     pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls\n     out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She\n     puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back\n     in the blazer.\n\n     EXT.   OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT\n\n     J.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with\n     his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began\n     dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He\n     checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads\n     toward the house.\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     VERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie.\n\n     EXT.   THE SAWYER FRONT YARD\n\n     J.D. leans a ladder against the Sawyer house.\n\n     INT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE\n\n     MOM sets down three plates of spaghetti. DAD watches on.\n\n                             MOM\n               Does she want a written invitation?\n                       (yelling upward)\n               Veronica! Dinner!\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     J.D. crawls through VERONICA's window. Hanging from the\n     rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA.\n\n     INT.   THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE\n\n     MOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed.\n\n                             MOM\n               Honey?\n\n     VERONICA'S BEDROOM\n\n     J.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in\n     one hand, the Barbie doll in the other.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I can't believe you did it. I was\n               teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed\n               up here to kill you, but first I was\n               going to try and get you back. With\n               amazing petition.\n\n     J.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the\n     computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out\n     on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different\n     sizes, styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks.\n\n                             J.D.\n               It's a shame you can't see what our\n               fellow students really signed.\n\n     J.D. flicks open a switchblade. He runs the blade beneath\n     the typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off,\n     reavealing another typed paragraph.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Listen. \"We students of Westerburg\n               High will die. Today. Our burning\n               bodies will be the ultimate protest\n               to a society that degrades is. Fuck\n               you all.\" Not that subtle but neither's\n               blowing up the school. Talk about your\n               suicide pacts. When our school explodes\n               tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of\n               thing that infects a generation. A\n               Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we\n               coulda toasted marshmallows together.\n\n                             MOM (O.S.)\n               Honey, are you all right in there?\n\n     J.D. swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window.\n     MOM enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter,\n     launches into frantic screams.\n\n                             MOM\n               Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my\n               baby back! I should have let you keep\n               that job at the mall. I was just afraid\n               of you coming home alone at night!\n\n     VERONICA opens her eyes.\n\n                             MOM\n               I made your favorite! Spaghetti!\n               Lots of oregano!\n\n     VERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains\n     hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath\n     her blazer and is tied around her waist. She undos the waist-\n     knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow\n     over the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Hey Mom, why so tense?\n\n     THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE\n\n     Montage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner\n     plate to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her.\n\n     INT.   J.D.'S BEDROOM--NIGHT\n\n     J.D. tools with a bomb at his desk. A KNOCK on the door. J.D.\n     turns down his stereo (and the Montage music).\n\n                             FRED DEAN (O.S.)\n               I need some help with my homework...\n\n                             J.D.\n               Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy....\n\n     J.D. turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music).\n\n     EXT.   FRONT OF WESTERBERG HIGH--MORNING\n\n     The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front\n     of the school. STUDENTS pour out.\n\n     EXT.   SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING\n\n     STUDENTS come out of their cars.\n\n     INT.   HALLWAY--MORNING\n\n     Typically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of-\n     locker-action. VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her locker.\n     A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing VERONICA\n     as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.\n\n                             PAULINE\n               Veronica! J.D. told me you\n               committed suicide last night!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Where is he? Where's J.D.?\n\n                             PAULINE\n               We have to talk.  Whether to kill\n               yourself is one of the most important\n               decisions a teenager has to make.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Get a job.\n\n     VERONICA storms away to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker\n     combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and freezes.\n\n     In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway\n     carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.\n\n     VERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is\n     barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into\n     the Boys bathroom.\n\n     BOYS BATHROOM\n\n     J.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He\n     turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.\n\n     THE HALLWAY\n\n     The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell\n     rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway.\n\n     VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down\n     the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.\n\n     THE GYM\n\n     A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily\n     doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up\n     beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs.\n     PRINCIPAL GOWAN says \"Testing\" into a microphone.\n\n     J.D., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips\n     inside. He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath\n     the bleachers.\n\n     THE HALLWAY\n\n     VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.\n\n     UNDER THE BLEACHERS\n\n     Using heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a\n     steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can\n     be discerned taped to other supports.\n\n     THE EMPTY HALLWAY\n\n     VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to\n     keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from\n     classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of\n     STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her\n     troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers.\n     She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at\n     his clutched arm with a nervous smile.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Rodney, where's everybody going?\n\n                             RODNEY\n               It's Friday.....\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Oh my God, the damn pep assembly....\n\n                             RODNEY\n               Yeah, these things are pretty artificial,\n               but at least we all get out of class...\n\n     VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to\n     inquisitively move forward through the crowd.\n\n     THE GYM\n\n     J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors.\n     He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move\n     toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby\n     set of stairs.\n\n     THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM\n\n     VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS\n     heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates\n     file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of\n     dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Rodney, what's underneath the gym?\n\n     RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA.\n     and says........\n\n                             RODNEY\n               The boiler room.\n\n     VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a\n     couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the\n     staircase beside the gym.\n\n     HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM\n\n     J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room,\n     eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy\n     steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly\n     pick the lock. He swings open the steel door.\n\n                             VERONICA (O.S.)\n               May I see your hall pass?\n\n     J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him,\n     pointing the bedroom gun at him.\n\n                             J.D.\n               I knew that loose was too noose! I\n               mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Like father, like son. A serious-as-\n               fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll\n               set off a pack of thermals upstairs.\n               Okay, so let's start by slowly putting\n               the bomb down on the ground.\n\n     J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He\n     folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that.\n               Put your hands on your head.\n\n                             J.D.\n               You didn't say Simon Says.\n\n     J.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her\n     over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully\n     retrieves it.\n\n     THE GYM\n\n     The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the\n     bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making\n     swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard.\n     Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with\n     PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.\n\n     THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM\n\n     VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs.\n     J.D. raises the gun to her head.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Live by the sword...\n\n     VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand\n     upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow\n     annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of\n     composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder\n     right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the\n     boiler room, jarring the gun loose.\n\n     They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the\n     better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun\n     from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall.\n     VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs\n     scissors-style around her and trips her.\n\n     THE PREP ASSEMBLY\n\n     The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER\n     MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around\n     a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the\n     cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the\n     bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a\n     thermal bomb.\n\n     THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY\n\n     A snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him.\n\n                             J.D.\n               You think just because you started\n               this thing, you can end it?\n\n     J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA\n     sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then\n     savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm\n     and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.\n\n                             J.D.\n               You, really didn't think I'd, forget,\n               forget, to disconnect the....\n\n     VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D.\n     grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.\n\n     A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds\n     toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel\n     steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently\n     kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins\n     from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of\n     the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on\n     the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...\n\n     THE PEP ASSEMBLY\n\n     The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing \"The Wave\". BETTY\n     FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act,\n     all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers,\n     pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. EARL and\n     the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening\n     before the crowd.\n\n     THE BOILER ROOM\n\n     VERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler\n     room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting\n     position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its\n     digital clock clicking to 3:00. VERONICA crawls to the gun and\n     levels it at a rousing-up J.D.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do\n               you turn it off? Tell me!\n\n     Fully standing, J.D. flicks open his switchblade. He gives\n     VERONICA \"the finger,\" screaming in exploded saliva...\n\n                             J.D.\n               Fuck you!\n\n     Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off \"the finger.\"\n     Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden\n     geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun.\n     The bomb clicks down to 2:25.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.\n\n                             J.D.\n               You want to wipe the slate clean as\n               much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am\n               killing everyone in the school\n               because nobody loves me. You have a\n               purpose though! Remember? Let's face\n               it, the only place different social\n               types can genuinely get along with\n               each other is in heaven.\n\n     VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               How do you turn the fucker off?\n\n                             J.D.\n               You're not listening. People are\n               going to look at the ashes of\n               Westerburg and say there's a school\n               that self-destructed not because\n               society didn't care, but because\n               that school was society. Is that\n               deep or what? I'll let you put it in\n               your diary, babe. Free of charge.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               The bomb, asshole!\n\n                             J.D.\n               Just push the red button twice.\n               That's what stops it. If that's\n               what you want, babe?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               You know what I want, babe?\n\n                             J.D.\n               What?\n\n     VERONICA fires the gun twice into J.D.'s throat. Coughing and\n     moaning, he splatters against a generator.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Cool guys like you out of my life.\n\n     VERONICA saunters to J.D.'s writhing body.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               But babe, don't worry, these here\n               were Ich Luge bullets.\n\n     J.D. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. VERONICA turns\n     to the bomb and crouches over it. A lit green light is next to\n     a green button. Above it, an unlit red light is next to a red\n     button. The bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17. VERONICA\n     presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and\n     stopping the clock. VERONICA falls back into a sitting\n     position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face.\n\n     THE PEP ASSEMBLY\n\n     A cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music\n     plays. The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow\n     motion as well.\n\n     At normal speed, VERONICA walks to the doors of the Gym and\n     peers in. The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and\n     prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion.\n     VERONICA walks away from the gym.\n\n     EXT.   THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL   DAY\n\n     VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges\n     outside of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically\n     bask in the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face.\n     A strange voice kills it.\n\n                             J.D. (O.S.)\n               Color me impressed.\n\n     J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting\n     from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. He painfully speaks\n     through his assasinated vocal cords.\n\n                             J.D.\n               You really fucked me up, Veronica.\n\n                             VERONICA\n                       (vertigo city)\n               I thought I...you..\n\n                             J.D.\n               You've got power, Veronica. Power I\n               didn't think you had. The slate is\n               clean.\n\n     J.D. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to\n     his torso. The green light is on and the clock says 00:10..00:09.\n\n                             J.D.\n               Pretend I did blow up the school. All\n               the schools. Now that you're dead,\n               what are you gonna do with your life?\n\n     VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and\n     puts it in her mouth. She then folsd her arms.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Perfecto.\n\n     J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks\n     to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his\n     crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.\n\n     THE PEP ASSEMBLY\n\n     The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-\n     down pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the\n     bleachers screaming less out of fear than a \"Whoa Dude\" sense\n     of excitement.\n\n     THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL\n\n     VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school\n     with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and\n     her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in\n     bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns\n     to go inside.\n\n     INT.   THE FRONT HALLWAY\n\n     VERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling\n     students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the\n     thrill of it. HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               Veronica, you look like hell.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Yeah, I just got back.\n\n     VERONICA tosses away the cigarette. She then grabs HEATHER\n     DUKE by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.\n\n                             HEATHER DUKE\n               What are you doing?\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Heather, my love, there's a\n               new sheriff in town.\n\n     VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKE's red ribbon and ties it\n     around the hair of her own head. She kisses HEATHER DUKE on\n     the cheek, leaving a black stain. VERONICA calls off.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               Hey, Martha, wait up.\n\n     MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK revealed to be in an electric\n     wheelchair, brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused.\n     VERONICA walks up beside her. MARTHA starts up her wheelchair\n     and accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               My date for the prom kind of flaked\n               out on me, so I thought if you\n               weren't doing anything that night\n               we could go to the video store and\n               rent some new releases or something.\n               Maybe pop some popcorn.\n\n                             MARTHA\n               I'd like that.\n\n                             VERONICA\n               So would I.\n\n     VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding down the hall\n     Bogart/Rains style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeathers\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Daniel Waters\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:40.784391"}
