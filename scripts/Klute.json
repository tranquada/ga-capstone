DINING ROOM - TOM GRUNEMANN HOUSE - DAY\n\nCLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young\nexecutive, sitting at the head of the dining room\ntable carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner.\nThere are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA\nPANS around the table revealing the happy family\nand guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE.\n\nCamera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot\nof the table opposite her husband. She smiles\nacross at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom\nGrunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a\ncloseup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her\nhusband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's\nchair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds\ndisappear on this cut. It appears that Tom\nGrunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One\nmoment he is there, and the next moment he is gone.\nThe camera pans back down the table, only now it is\nempty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs.\nGrunemann. She is now dressed in something dark.\nShe and the three children sit eating another meal\nin emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman\nto a woman bereaved.\n\nINT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAY\n\nThe industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS steps\ninto frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little\nimpatiently) in this direction at some loud\nindustrial goings-on just beyond camera, then\nreturns toward GROUP.\n\nThe group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENT\nwith clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplying\npreliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhat\nrumpled, awkward.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tKlute. With a K. K - L - U -\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tAre you with plant security,\n\tSergeant?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(shakes head)\n\tTown Police.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tThen how are you involved?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(slowly)\n\tI know Tom Grunemann.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\t\t(shortcutting again)\n\tYou knew the subject Thomas\n\tGrunemann. How well?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWe grew up together. Kids.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tCan you account for his\n\tdisappearance in any way?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tDid he recently appear to you\n\tagitated or depressed?\n\t\t(aside to younger Agent,\n\t\trecording)\n\t-- indicates no -- Did he voice to\n\tyou grievance or discontent with\n\this research work here? Indicates\n\tno. Moral or sexual problems or\n\tpeculiarities? --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tMarital problems in general?\n\tIndicates possibly -- am I right\n\tSergeant?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tEverybody's got some, I guess.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tDid he ever mention specifically a\n\tgirl or woman in New York?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tExamine this letter please.\n\t\t(continues)\n\tWe recovered that from the shredder\n\t-- the plant disposal and\n\tincinerator system. Grunemann\n\tapparently typed it Friday, before\n\the left, decided not to send it,\n\ttossed it away. We've already\n\tcontacted the New York Police; they\n\tthink they know the girl in\n\tquestion.\n\nC.U. KLUTE\n\nKlute reads. We see a controlled incredulity and\nrevulsion.\n\n\t\t\tROSS (CONT'D)\n\tHe never mentioned this type thing\n\tto you? You didn't know he had\n\tthese interests?\n\nINT. GRUNEMANN HOUSE: C.U. HOLLY - DAY\n\nHOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward\nKLUTE crying out -\n\n\t\t\tHOLLY\n\tMy husband was not like that! My\n\tGod, Klute.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tIt looks like he sent her quite a\n\tfew of those Holly -- the girl --\n\tshe recalls six or seven letters\n\tlike --\n\n\t\t\tHOLLY\n\t\t(calmly)\n\t-- No. I mean sure a little rough\n\tstuff, but just what people usually\n\t-- No, I would've said we were\n\tpretty good.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tJohnnie I don't understand. I just\n\tdon't understand.\n\nKlute nods. She is talking for both of them. Klute\nlooks out the window to the children playing\noutside. CAMERA PANS out window to Klute's POV of\nchildren playing on a cold winter day. The trees\nare stripped bare.\n\nEXT. RESEARCH PLANT\n\nTree lined area, lush and green - Summer.\n\nINT. RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nCAMERA pulls back inside window to Klute staring\noutside, as if still pondering the fate of Tom\nGrunemann. The group in the office includes ROSS\n(holding a report), TRASK, a New York detective,\nCable, and the plant director, STREIGER.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\t-- has disclosed no evidence of\n\tcrime or criminal intent within the\n\tjurisdiction of this bureau, and\n\tsince subject Thom --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\t\t(turns sharply,\n\t\tinterrupts)\n\tIt's been almost a year! Tom\n\tGrunemann's been missing for a\n\tyear.

You got Lieutenant\n\tTrask here from New York\n\trepresenting his department and I\n\tdon't frankly consider --\n\n\t\t\tSTREIGER\n\t\t(moderating, suggesting)\n\tWhy couldn't you ever find out\n\tanything from the girl?\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\t\t(refers the question)\n\tTrask --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\t\t(summarizes from notes)\n\tWe first hold her under\n\tsurveillance expectin your boy\n\tGrunemann to show up there. Didn't.\n\tThen we bagged -- we arrested her\n\ton a CP charge, convicted, two\n\tmonth's women's city prison, offer\n\tto reduce sentence, she cooperated.\n\t\t(counts)\n\tFour interrogations. She thought\n\tshe remembered Grunemann -- from\n\tthose letters from before, she made\n\tthat connection -- but she hadn't\n\tseen him since and couldn't\n\tidentify his photograph and she --\n\n\t\t\tSTREIGER\n\tWhy not?\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tOh a good call girl, she'll turn\n\tsix-seven hundred tricks a year.\n\tThe faces get blurred.\n\t\t(resumes)\n\tAnd since then, recent months,\n\tshe's reported several, you know,\n\tincidents: like breather calls,\n\tanonymous phone calls, also\n\tsomebody maybe following her,\n\twatching her, things like that. So\n\tit's I guess you could say,\n\tconceivable Grunemann's still\n\taround there, just hangin around\n\ther, spooking her. But you know,\n\tthat --\n\nHe shakes his head, gestures doubtingly. Ross caps\nit.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tThe subject got emotionallv\n\tdisturbed; he just dropped out.\n\tThere's thousands.\n\n\t\t\tSTREIGER\n\tInspector we understand your\n\tposition; ours is a little\n\tdifferent. We have an investment in\n\tTom Grunemann. The Company has an\n\tinvestment, and we feel entitled to\n\tinvestigate for ourselves.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tPrivate investigation, you mean.\n\tYes sir, of course you're entitled,\n\tand there's some very competent --\n\n\t\t\tSTREIGER\n\tKlute offered us his services;\n\twe've accepted.\n\nPause. Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than a\nbit startled - then at each other. Klute just looks\nuneasy.\n\n\t\t\tSTREIGER (CONT'D)\n\tKlute knew Tom. He has a great many\n\tideas about the case --\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\t\t(sourly)\n\tYes sir, we know he --\n\n\t\t\tSTREIGER\n\tWe'd expect him to work in\n\tcooperation with you. He'd report\n\tto each of you and to our Company's\n\tNew York office, to Pete -- Pete\n\tgoes there on a regular schedule\n\tback and forth, and --\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\t\t(tactfully)\n\tMr. Streiger, speaking frankly --\n\twe've appreciated the Sergeant's\n\tinterest you know, all along. Here,\n\tlocally. But New York, that's -\n\twell --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\t\t(to Klute, leniently)\n\tEver done any missing person's\n\twork?\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tSpent much time in the city?\n\t\t(to others)\n\tYou see, I have to wonder --\n\tspeaking frankly; the Sergeant\n\tknows I'm only speaking frankly -\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou wonder why we thought of Klute?\n\tFrankly? He's interested.\n\nINT/EXT. WIDE SHOT: PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY\n\nVerdant Pennsylvania farmland. Early morning. Near\nat hand an open field set about with bee hutches\nand patched with mist.\n\nA FIGURE, a shadow (Klute's actually) moves across\nframe from the left, blanking in. We reorient to -\n\nINT. BEDROOM - KLUTES HOUSE - DAY\n\nWe see that we've been looking out from the bedroom\nwindow of this house. Klute turns to rolltop desk\nin bedroom and picture of Tom Grunemann, picture of\nBree Daniel, and other material he has collected on\nthe case. He puts them in his suitcase and closes\nthe suitcase. He shuts rolltop desk.\n\nINT. KLUTE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nWe follow Klute through the house with suitcase. He\nputs away a last dish, shutting off water, gas, and\nelectricity, and so on -- takes a last look around \n- reaches for the door handle. WE CUT TO --\n\nINT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUND STAGE - DAY\n\nA section of wall, a door coming open -- and the\nFIGURE of BREE entering and standing. We have gone\nfrom the warm sunlight of the country to mustv\ndarkness.\n\nShe appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine\npicture.\nBut as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes\nfocus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting\nand waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see\nthat she is a great deal less certain of demeanor.\nAssailable. WE CUT TO -\n\nEXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD, HOUSE, BARN - DAY\n\nKlute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the\nhouse door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage\nPlymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then\ntakes a last turn around the yard itself; props\nopen the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the\nrail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll\nshut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT\nagain TO --\n\nINT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY\n\n\t\t\tDIRECTOR (O.S.)\n\t\t(hastily)\n\tHoney, no, we don't have too many.\n\nShe slaps the cup down, hurls herself forward --\nSWISH PAN -- onto a MALE ACTOR, thrusting him down\nto the floor, her hands at his throat. As we WIDEN\nTO INCLUDE DIRECTOR AND MORE OF SCENE, and as the\nDirector reads from script, supplying a narrator\nvoice -\n\n\t\t\tDIRECTOR (CONT'D)\n\tNow before it comes to that, let's\n\thave a look, et cetera, et cetera --\n\tOK -\n\nBree and the Male Actor relax slightly, as -\n\nANGLE TO REVEAL ROOM, OTHERS\n\nWe reestablish the scene -- a few pieces of film\nequipment -- and the congery of other ACTORS and \nACTRESSES preparing to read for parts. As the\nDirector approaches, counsels Bree -- all of this\nquick and consecutive --\n\n\t\t\tDIRECTOR (CONT'D)\n\t-- Honey you make it look a little\n\treal. It should have, you know,\n\tthat fun to it.\n\t\t(beat)\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tStrangle him to death funny?\n\n\t\t\tDIRECTOR\n\tWell we go from this into stomach\n\tdiagrams. It can't be too -- look\n\tlet's try it again from -\n\n-- but then he glances at his watch, and at the\nothers waiting their turn.\n\n\t\t\tDIRECTOR (CONT'D)\n\tNo -- just give us the faces at the\n\tend, would you?\n\nBree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together,\nbeaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a\nmoment, as the Director reads again -\n\n\t\t\tDIRECTOR (CONT'D)\n\t\t(reads)\n\t-- And another family saved by Elso\n\ttablets. OK --\n\t\t(brightly)\n\tThank you very much.\n\n-- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at\nthe same time as he summons from a list in his\nother hand --\n\n\t\t\tDIRECTOR (CONT'D)\n\tPierce -- Danner -\n\nBREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting\nin line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly\nas possible.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK: PEDESTRIANS - DAY\n\nThey trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the\nlate-afternoon crush. A LONG-LENS shot, the crowd\ncompacted. We see BREE milling along with the rest.\nShe maneuvers to a sidewalk PHONE BOOTH, enters. We\nsee her deposit, dial.\n\nINT. PHONE BOOTH, BREE - DAY\n\nShe is connected (to her registry).\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tBree Daniel, any messages?\n\t\t(waits -- none)\n\tOK, thanks.\n\nShe waits for a moment. Then makes a curious, small\ngesture of her hand -- deposits another dime, dials\nagain, is answered.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tTrina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a\n\tcommercial I thought I might get,\n\tthat's all.\n\t\t(quickly, more brightly)\n\tWell I'd take a quick thirty, hon.\n\tDo you have a commuter for me?\n\tWait.\n\nAs she prepares to write it down, we CUT BACK TO -\n\nEXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn\ndoor. He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door\nopen) starts engine. Again -- one last time -- the\nlook around. Then he pulls the door shut, pulls\nout. And on this we CUT TO --\n\nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nA GROUP -- middle-aged Couple, Child, Bellman with\nsuitcases -- wait to descend in elevator as BREE\ngets off. We TRACK with her along corridor to a\ndoor. She checks number and knocks.\n\nREVERSE: THROUGH DOOR TO BREE\n\nA MAN opens the door. We neither see or hear him\nclearly -- he is foreground, defocused. His shirt\nis untucked. Bree cocks her head, greets him\ncutely.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tHullo.\n\nHe mumbles some kind of greeting, steps back. She\npauses a moment in the door (casing, instantly) --\nthen quite confident, friendly, provocative all at\nonce --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tOoh, I knew I'd like you.\n\n-- and CUT TO --\n\nEXT. CENTER OF TOWN: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY\n\nKlute's car draws through the business section of\ntown, moves on --\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM: BREE - DAY\n\nC.U. BREE (the Man out of frame and unheard-from)\nas she bargains gaily -- and at the same time a\nlittle watchfully.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tLover, that's got to be a little\n\textra. I mean it sounds very\n\texciting, what you speak of, you've\n\tgot me all excited. But something\n\tspecial like that, you know it's\n\tgot to cost a little more, mm?\n\n-- and CUT TO --\n\nINT. CAR: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY\n\nKlute has laid his jacket aside, rolled his\nsleeves, is eating the last of a vending machine\nsandwich. The CAR RADIO is on. He leans forward,\ntuning it from --\n\n\t\t\t1ST ANNC'R\n\t\t(energetic)\n\t--R - W - M, radio's voice is the\n\tShippensburg Valley, on a beautiful\n\tclear warm Thurs --\n\n-- to --\n\n\t\t\t2ND ANNC'R\n\t\t(rural)\n\t-- Tucky Wonder Beans picking up a\n\thalf cent over yesterday's price at-\n\n-- and CUT TO --\n\nINT. C.U. ON BREE, MAN (HOTEL BED) - DAY\n\nThe Man's face is buried against her neck, her\nlabors over her. She cries out ecstatically,\ntransportedly -- it would seem at the edge of\norgasm --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh lover, oh it's too much -- oh\n\tyou thrill me -- yes, like that,\n\tit's -- oh it's beautiful, oh --\n\n-- and at the same time refers privately to her\nwristwatch. And CUT TO --\n\nEXT. WIDE SHOT: ACCESS RAMP OF TURNPIKE - LUSH\nHILLY COUNTRY - DAY\n\nKLUTE'S CAR\n\nAs Klute's car drives onto the turnpike surrounded \nby green country, we ZOOM into a close shot of\nKlute through the windshield of his car. And then\nin what seems like a continuous shot we ZOOM back\nto a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the\nendless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at\nthe entrance to New York City, surrounded by\nsmoggy, grey, urban skies.\n\nINT. CITY MULTILAYERED PARKING BUILDING - KLUTE'S\nCAR - NIGHT\n\nKLUTE sits inside his car as it is mechanically\nlifted into the air. It looks as if he is being\nmanipulated by a robot.\n\nEXT. STREET: OUTSIDE THE BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\nBREE moves along street, returning home,\napprehensive of the one or two other distant\nFIGURES. She turns in at one of the Brownstones.\n\nINT. STAIRWELL OF BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\nWe watch Bree as she mounts to the top floor, the\ndoor of her apartment, barren, isolated,\nfrightened.\n\nINT. BREE'S APTARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nBREE unlocks the door, switches on a light, cases\nthe apartment for a moment before entering,\nsecuring chain-lock, putting aside her things.\nThere is a RECORD PLAYER near the first interior\ndoorway. She switches it as she moves by. By time\nthe first record has dropped, she has the shower\nturned on, is getting rid of her dress. We CUT BACK\nTO --\n\nEXT. EMPTY STREET: KLUTE - NIGHT\n\nKlute walks, as before, carrying his suitcase. We\nsee him slow, concernedly looking toward --\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT: ON BREE - NIGHT\n\nBree sits on a studio couch, near the record\nplayer, with a QUILT huddled over and around her,\nher back against the wall. The MUSIC is classical,\ncuriously -- the sound of a HARPSICHORD. She is\nmore or less expressionless -- but trembling\nviolently, shaking.\n\nFRONT WINDOW SIGN BEING REMOVED WHICH READS \"FOR\nRENT\" - STORE - INQUIRE CRAWICZ, DAY\n\nINT. BREE's APARTMENT: BREE - DAY\n\nBree moves about energetically, preparing to set\nout on rounds. A KNOCK on the door. She startled,\nthen approaches to door, to peep-hole, lifts lid\naside.\n\nTHROUGH PEEPHOLE TO KLUTE FACE\n\nKlute's face is somewhat distorted by the peephole\nlens; he is gazing mildly about the landing.\n\nBREE\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(through door, curtly)\n\tWhat is it?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (O.S.)\n\tMiss Daniel? My name is Klute --\n\tJohn Klute --\n\nShe turns the door handle , parts the door about\nthree inches, looks through at him. He starts to\nenter.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\tCan I talk to you?\n\n-- and the door crunches against its chain-lock. He\nstops perforce, a bit startled. A pause. A slice of\nBree's face looks coldly out at him. He summons a\nsmile.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWhat about?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tMy name's John Klute.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tYou said that.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI'm an investigator. I'd like to\n\task you some questions about Tom\n\tGrunemann.\n\nShe tightens again.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWho?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tTom Grunemann. He wrote you some\n\tletters.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(innocently)\n\tGee.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tHe was a research engineer at the\n\tTuscarora Laboratories in\n\tPennsylvania. He disappeared from\n\tthere last April.

Silence. She\nexamines them with care, then appears to soften a\nlittle; even smiles slightly.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tYou're not police or FBI; you're\n\tjust a private investigator?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tMm.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tAnd you just want to ask me a few\n\tquestions?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tMm.\n\nShe smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back\nout, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes).\nKlute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to\nknock again, decides not to -- turns and descends\nthe stairs.\n\nBREE\n\nBree listens through the door to his departing foot\nsteps. They fade from hearing. She hastens to\nassemble her properties.\n\nEXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY\n\nKlute comes out door and descends the stairs at the\nsame even pace -- he walks into the vacant store\nbelow.\n\nINT. BASEMENT STORE - DAY\n\nIt had once been a Boutique that sold happy\nclothes. There are some psychedelic posters and a\nfew remnants of its former identity. Klute's\nsuitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter.\nThe ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he\nenters. He seems out of place and out of scale. A\ncase containing a tape recorder stands on the\nfloor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes,\nand a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberately\nresumes his settling in. From the paper bag he sets\naside an electric FAN, then lifts out from the\nshopping bag a cheap tin ALARM CLOCK and begins\nwinding it.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nBree has shifted position to a window, is looking\ndown at the street. She sees - and we hear - SOUND\nOF BUS APPROACHING, distantly. She grabs her\nproperties, whips out the door.\n\nEXT. ON DOOR OF BROWNSTONE - DAY\n\nBree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans\nquickly out in one direction then the other (in\ncase Klute has been waiting in ambush on the\nsidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB --\nmakes it, pulls herself aboard --\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute has been watching from his window. We hear\nthe BUS PULLING AWAY. He turns back, plugs in the\nelectric fan. Then hoists the TAPE RECORDER,\nunsnaps the cover. We see clearly what it is.\n\nINT. AGENCY OFFICE - DAY\n\nBREE is showing her notebook to an AGENT. He leans\nforward courteously, occasionally stroking his\nforehead with his fingertips -- a nice man with a\nheadache.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t-- and I take acting classes with\n\tLee Tainter --\n\n\t\t\tAGENT\n\t-- Lee, yes --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t-- and I was in two of his workshop\n\ttype productions, Uncle Vanya and\n\tthe girl in Five Characters --\n\t\t(indicates picture)\n\t-- here -- and then of course I\n\thave the modeling and the\n\tdemonstrator work, the trade-fair\n\twork -- but naturally I feel ready\n\tfor something more, well you know,\n\tsustain --\n\n\t\t\tAGENT\n\tWell, thanks very much for coming\n\tin.\n\nShe starts for the door -- he's already turning\naway -- then ducks back, hands him one of her\nGlossies, laughing prettily at her own\nforgetfulness.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(beautifully -- the\n\t\tbusiness)\n\tThank you very much.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nBREE comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out,\nthe call completed, checks the list of those\nremaining, sets forth again. We hear TRASK'S VOICE\nOVER, very quick, very clipped.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK (V.O.)\n\tMan, just a poor pretty little\n\thooker, like to be an actress --\n\nINT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU - DAY\n\nCLOSEUP photograph of dead man. It is replaced with\nseries of photgraphs of dead men.

BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nCamera is looking up through lighted window outside\nat BREE on phone.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh hon, I just don't know. I'm\n\ttrying to stay out of it.\n\nEXT. KLUTE APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA pans down from BREE's window to KLUTE's\nwindow at the bottom revealing KLUTE at tape\nrecorder. The TAPE RECORDER is going, its light\nwinking. KLUTE holds headset against one ear, makes\na note or two. We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S\nVOICES, UNDER, FILTERED.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL'S VOICE\n\t-- comes in with these other yulds\n\tmaybe two or three times a year,\n\tand five big ones baby, just one\n\tevening.\n\n\t\t\tBREE VOICE\n\tMarta, thanks, and I'd love to\n\tparty with you hon, but --\n\nKlute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far\nunder, INDISTINGUISHABLE), makes a note, and thumbs\nopen the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is\nnear the end. We establish a pile of ALREADY\nRECORDED TAPES. We CUT BACK TO --\n\nINT. BREE APARTMENT: BREE ON PHONE - NIGHT\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWell try to get someone else Marty\n\tand if I change my mind -- sure\n\thon, bye.\n\nShe hangs up, starts away. The PHONE RINGS AGAIN.\nShe tries to ignore it. It persists. She finally\nturns back to answer it, and we CUT TO --\n\nINT. CASTING OFFICE - AD AGENCY - DAY\n\nCAMERA STARTS on huge photo montage of the Family\nof Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls\nsitting on a bench below. They are dwarfed by the\nenormous picture. Each one clutches an almost\nidentical portfolio of pictures in her lap. Camera\npans down row of portfolios until it stops at BREE \n- impatiently waiting her turn. WE CONTINUE THE\nTELEPHONE VOICES OVER, WILD TRACK STYLE. The MAN'S\nVOICE is thick with drink, and emotion. First the\nclick, then --\n\n\t\t\tBREE VOICE\n\tBree Daniel --\n\n\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE\n\tOh God baby, oh God I really love\n\tyou.\n\n\t\t\tBREE VOICE\n\tThat's nice; who is this?\n\n\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE\n\tI really love you baby, you know\n\tthat?\n\nA CLICK, and the MAN'S VOICE CONTINUING, trailing\ninto helpless sobs --\n\n\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)\n\tHello? Hello? Oh my God, hello?\n\nEXT. STREET: BREE\n\nBree comes out from the building (note possible\ncostume change; not necessarily consecutive\naction), checks off on her list continues on her\nway -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES.\nStarting with a CLICK and --\n\n\t\t\tBREE VOICE\n\tBree Daniel.\n\n\t\t\t2ND MAN'S VOICE\n\t\t(nicely)\n\tBree -- Frank Hanley, you remember,\n\tFayetterville?\n\n\t\t\tBREE VOICE\n\tOh yeah, hi Frank, sure.\n\n\t\t\t2ND MAN'S VOICE\n\tWell I'm in town, like to see you.\n\n\t\t\tBREE VOICE\n\tWell Frank that's awful nice but\n\tI'm out of action, sort of, you\n\tknow --\n\nWe FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD,\nCONTINUING, as --\n\nBREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE,\nat corner, unseen by her and apparently in\nsurveillance of her. Then he too turns out of\nframe, and we CUT TO --\n\nINT. PENN STATION - DAY\n\nCAMERA is looking down at an enormous gift package\non a platform. There is a sound of a recorded\nfanfare and with the pull of a string the package\nis opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL\nCONVERTIBLE. People applaud and the car starts to\nrevolve. At the wheel of the car sits BREE. We CUT\nto a shot through the windshield of car --\n\nBREE'S POV\n\nA sea of staring faces revolves around her. We\ncross fade with SPANGLER VOICE OVER (as if\nrecalling a case record).\n\n\t\t\tSPANGLER (V.O.)\n\tBree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty\n\teight, good physical health, no\n\tnarcotics record, presenting an\n\tunusually strong personality some\n\tways, high intelligence, a high\n\tbracket call girl.\n\nEXT. WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA\n\nSPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench\neating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper\nand sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously\na man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him.\nAcross from them some prisoners are taking their\nexercise. Through the metallic netting that\nsurrounds them, we see the skyline of New York\nCity. It only dramatizes more the sense of being\ncaged.\n\n\t\t\tSPANGLER\n\t-- Usual case history -- this isn't\n\ta medical confidence, it's all of\n\tthem -- broken family, lonely,\n\tconfused, crummy childhood, early\n\tpromiscuity, formal prostitution\n\tbeginning in her teens, income\n\ttwenty-five to thirty thousand a\n\tyear.\n\t\t(notes Klute's reaction)\n\tOh they don't keep the money: they\n\tget rid of it, they get pimps. Why?\n\t\t(stabs at record)\n\tWhy do you want to know all this?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI want to know how Tom Grunemann\n\tgot mixed up in it.\n\n\t\t\tSPANGLER\n\tNot unusual.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tDid she talk about him to you?\n\n\t\t\tSPANGLER\n\tAbout his letters -- that's all she\n\tremembered. Quite violent material,\n\tI'd say, obsessive, a quite sick\n\tman. But that's not unusual either.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tHas she talked with you since\n\tprison?\n\n\t\t\tSPANGLER\n\tNo. She had every good intention of\n\tit -- coming to me as a private\n\tpatient, getting out of the life,\n\tdevoting herself to an acting\n\tcareer.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI think she's trying that.\n\n\t\t\tSPANGLER\n\tOh sure they try. The idea of a\n\tbetter life.  But they don't really\n\tknow much about life: They get\n\tconfused -- or scared or frustrated\n\tor bored -- they pop back to the\n\tone thing they can handle.\n\tThe trick. The trick. Men in bed.\n\tNot men in general, not life, not\n\tlove, not even real sex -- it\n\tavoids all that. Just the trick,\n\tthe transaction.\n\nINT. PENN STATION - DAY\n\nPOV world revolving around BREE through windshield\nof car. The circular motion slows down and then\nstops. Cut to BREE getting out of car and walking\noff platform. She looks a bit shaky. She is stopped\nby one of the spectators.\n\n\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t(tapping her)\n\tWe had a bet on - if you were real\n\tor not. I won.\n\nShe looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone\nbooth.\n\nINT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(on phone)\n\tMarta --\n\nINT. CHURCH DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT\n\nWe are in the interior of what was once a church\nand is now a discotheque. Interior is painted\npurple; the record player stands on the altar over\nthe crowd. Pews are massed around the dance floor.\nStained glass windows are lighted from behind and\nare circled with light bulbs that flash on and off.\nFor all of its obviously bizarre visual quality,\nthere is a sense of relaxation. It is a late night\ngathering place of many who belong to the sexual\nunderworld of the city.\n\nBREE and the OTHER GIRL advance to a pew. A MAN\nsitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a THIRD\nGIRL. BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly:\nshe and BREE sit down, join in conversation.\n\nPULL BACK SLOWLY -- other pews, other girls and a\nfew men, the sisterhood -- To --\n\nBAR AREA IN BACK (WHAT ONCE MUST HAVE BEEN THE\nVESTIBULE OF THE CRURCH)\n\nAmong the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and\na sprinkling of hopeful Johns and curiosity\nseekers. The camera picks a familiar face: CABLE.\nHe watches BREE with a mixture of amusement and\ncontempt. A GIRL comes over to him and tries to\nproposition him. They appear to be discussing\nprice. Just as she thinks it is set, he walks away.\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a\nlarge piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a\nwall. CAMERA PANS over various pictures and pieces\nof evidence KLUTE has pinned up in an attempt to\nmake some sense from the puzzle of TOM GRUNMIANN's\ndisappearance. CAMERA PANS over to KLUTE sitting on\ncot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle. There\nis a heated TV dinner in front of him.\n\nThe TAPE RECORDER reels start turning (sound\npowered), the recording light starts winding (as\nBREE, above, dials). KLUTE pays it scant attention \n- he can catch up with the news anytime. He sits\nmanfully in front of the TV dinner, starts peeling\nback the foil --\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - NIGHT\n\nShe holds the phone, is answered. Her voice more\nnatural, a little shy, a little covert.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tHi. Bree.\n\t\t(is greeted)\n\tHi. Well I could come over tonight \n\t- if you'd like -- if there's no\n\tone else.\n\t\t(laughs diffidently)\n\tI really want to just talk to you.\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT\n\nThe tape-recorder continues turning and winking as\nthe conversation upstairs continues. KLUTE looks at\nTV dinner. He reaches for the headset of the\ntaperecorder, holds it loosely against one ear. He\nexhibits a measure of new interest. The TAPE\nRECORDER stops running. He immediately rewinds, and\nstarts listening through it again. We CUT TO --\n\nEXT. GARMENT DISTRICT - NIGHT\n\nLarge, dark buildings -- a DIM-LIGHTED WINDOW\nshowing at an upper floor of one -- the street\notherwise by and large deserted. A TAXI draws in, a\nFIGURE IN EVENING DRESS (Bree) gets out, approaches\nthe building, glances around, either secretly or\napprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets\nanswering CLICKS, enters the dark hallway of the\nbuilding, starts upstairs.\n\nEXT. ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT\n\nKLUTE shifts into view, looking in the direction\nBree's gone, a little puzzled all in all. He\ndoesn't immediately follow; he waits.\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT\n\nWe look past RACKS OF CLOTHING, as BREE arrives up\nthe dark stairway into dark rooms -- the scene,\nmysterious, a little sinister. She seems fearful of\nit herself, advances slowly, looking around, calls \n-\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tHi? -_\n\nANGLE PAST MR. FABER, TO BREE\n\nMr. Faber is SILHOUETTED for a moment, standing,\nwatching her, from along an alleyway of garments.\nShe sees him, is startled then relieved.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tOh --\n\nHe moves toward her.\n\nREVERSE ANGLE, TO MR. FABER\n\nMr. Faber is a man of 65 or so, rather handsome,\nand for this occasion very spruce, very erect, very\nnattily turned out. Bree complains cheerfully.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tYou scared me, Mr. Faber.\n\nHe smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of\nher evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of\nexpertise).\n\n\t\t\tMR. FABER\n\tGood material, not too good cut.\n\tI'd do better for you.\n\nThen he turns, lifts down a WOMAN'S DRESS CAPE,\ncarrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede\nhim --\n\nCORNER OF CUTTING ROOM\n\nA dim pool of light here. A private area here,\nsectioned off by rows of garments. A couch, rug,\ncoffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers\nto take their ease. BREE and MR. FABER enter. Her\nmanner is suddenly elegant, assured, regal; his\nbefits a man of the world. He fits the cloak around\nher shoulders and gestures to the couch; she sits.\nHe pours a glass of wine for her, for himself. She\nspeaks with a neat continental accent -- doing it\nfairly well, really -- a member of the\ninternational set.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh thank you.\n\nHe sits in the chair opposite, sips his wine.\n\n\t\t\tMR. FABER\n\tEnjoy.\n\t\t(then)\n\tWell --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(diffident)\n\tIt's good to see you. Well -- could\n\twe do it first and then just talk?\n\n\t\t\tMR. FABER\n\tSure dear, yes.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWell -- well I'm just back. And --\n\tI must tell you -- something quite\n\twonderful.\n\n\t\t\tMR. FABER\n\t\t(intently)\n\tYes?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tAnd Cannes was quite fun, quite;\n\tand we played baccarat and\n\tchemindefer and there was a nice\n\tlittle Italian marquis quite\n\tenthusiastic for me -- but a young\n\tman can be so silly --\n\n\t\t\tMR. FABER\n\tMm.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tAnd then one night -- at the gaming\n\ttables -- well I just saw him. A\n\tstranger -- looking at me -- and I\n\tknew suddenly that all my life I'd\n\tbeen --\n\nShe hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of\nthe cape. Faintly --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\t-- May I? It's so --\n\n\t\t\tMR. FABER\n\t\t(quickly)\n\tPlease --\n\nShe stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on\nthe couch. But she doesn't sit again -- begins to\nmove here and there about the enclosure, her hands\nwandering about her dress and body -- an erotic\nrestlessness.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tNot young; he wasn't young -- gray\n\tat the temples, he -- well actually\n\the looked like you.\n\n\t\t\tMR. FABER\n\t\t(tensely)\n\tYes?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tAnd nobody could tell me who he was\n\t-- an exiled prince or a mercenary\n\tor a bullfighter or -- but I felt\n\tit stirring inside me, this -- this\n\twild, pagan feeling --\n\nEXT. GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT\n\nKLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him\na while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock.\nHe eases door open, moves inside --\n\nINT. CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM: BREE - NIGHT\n\nBREE is farther along in her narrative, more\nfervent in manner. MR. FABER sits at the edge of\nhis seat, ducking his head now and then in\npleasure, but making no move to molest her.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tAnd next day at the beach -- our\n\tbeach pavilion -- I saw him again,\n\this eyes burning into me. I was\n\thelpless. Without his even speaking\n\tto me, without his even touching, I\n\tknew that somehow -- somehow --\n\nShe casts away an accessory garment. Mr. Faber\nburns her with his eyes --\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT\n\nKLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs,\nprowls along the aisles of clothing, looking --\nsees --\n\nPOV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR. FABER\n\nKlute sees Mr. Faber first -- clearly a senior\ncitizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some\nprivate dream. Then BREE drifts into view -- stands\n-- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles,\nposes -- drifts out of view again --\n\nKLUTE\n\nKlute watches in that direction a moment longer. In\nhis expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience --\nbut rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure\nof disgust. Not his affair. He turns away from it,\ninto camera, and --\n\nEXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\nNear the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's\napartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts\nangrily, miserably --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWhyn't you just cut out?\n\nWe WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get\nit. He turns, opens door to his room below. She\ncomes slowly down steps.\n\nINT. KLUTE'S ROOM - DAY\n\nShe steps in the door, looks slowly around at his\nvarious appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over\nthe mirror, etc. -- and then, the TAPE RECORDER and\nthen the STACK OF TAPE BOXES. Softly, venomously --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh you bastard.\n\nBut then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of\nfact hooker --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tIs it the shakedown hon? You picked\n\ta loser, I just don't have it.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNo, I'm look --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(vehemently again)\n\tIf I was taking calls full time\n\twould I be living in this kip? I'd\n\tbe back on Park Avenue; I could\n\tsupport the whole National Guard!\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(gestures upward)\n\tCould I ask some questions?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOr you'll get me shoved back in the\n\tbrig you mean; another month with\n\tthe bull-dykes.\n\nShe seems to have expressed it; the balance of\npower. She turns, goes out, heads upstairs. Klute\nunhurriedly takes up his folder of notes, then\nfollows.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nBree disposes her belongings. Klute moves to table.\nThere is a group of plants on the table that long\nsince died of neglect. He notices them and the\ndisorganization of the room without comment, opens\nhis folder, rummages for the photographs. Then,\nexasperatedly --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tLook, I told the police everything:\n\tI don't even remember the schlub!\n\nKlute doesn't respond. Klute sets out a photograph\nfor her to look at.\n\nINSERT: PHOTOGRAPH TOM GRUNEMANN\n\nKLUTE, BREE\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tThey showed me that one. I\n\tunderstand it's Grunemann, but I\n\ttold them, I just don't remember.\n\nKlute tosses down a second photograph.\n\nINSERT: SECOND PHOTOGRAPH\n\nTom Grunemann, Elaine Grunemann, two daughters.\n\nBREE, KLUTE\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(cool)\n\tA family sort of man.\n\nKlute grunts, meaning 'yes'. She echoes his grunt,\nmeaning we don't know what. He tosses another --\n\nINSERT: WIDE PHOTOGRAPH - COMPANY PICNIC\n\nAn everybody-over-here, fellow-employees, sort of\npicture. (Including the figures of Streiger and\nCable among many others, male and female.) The\nusual impedimenta -- picnic baskets, balls, bats, a\nheld sign: 'Tole-American'. KLUTE'S FINGER\nindicates --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (V.O.)\n\t-- Tom, again.\n\nKLUTE, BREE\n\nShe looks at the picture briefly, at him\nquestioningly.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tCompany outing or picnic or\n\tsomething like that.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tIsn't that sweet.\n\t\t(then)\n\tWell it could be any one of them\n\tbubi; I get to see them all.\n\nShe separates from Klute, around the table (but\nremains standing, restless). Klute puts photo\naside, prepares to take notes, as she pleads --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tLook -- please -- will you just try\n\tto get it from my side? A year ago.\n\tI was in the life fulltime. I was\n\tliving on Park with leather\n\tfurniture and a million dresses.\n\tThen they dropped on me, the fuzz,\n\tthey caged me -- they started\n\tasking me about a man, some man,\n\tI'm supposed to have seen a year\n\tbefore that. Two years ago, two. He\n\tcould be in Yemen!\n\nShe waits for Klute to respond -- he doodles\npermissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tA name. Grunemann. Nothing. And\n\tthey showed me pictures like this\n\tand they meant nothing. Then they\n\tasked me, well had I been getting\n\tletters, from someone out there in\n\tCabbageville --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t-- Tuscarora --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tAll right, yes, I had been. Those\n\tsick, wild letters -- I'm watching\n\tyou, gonna follow you, gonna punish\n\tyou, kill you et cetera. Well, they\n\tsaid, all right that's Grunemann.\n\tSo try to remember when you and he \n\t- when -- well I don't know, there\n\twas that dumper once, he sounded\n\tlike that dumper --\n\t\t(explains)\n\tDumpers; they get their kicks\n\tbeating you up. A man hired me\n\tonce, then tried to really kill me \n\t- that'd be about two years ago.\n\nWithout warning she wheels to the open windows, and\nshouts out full-voiced -- both startling and\nsomewhat intriguing Klute --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(shouts)\n\tOK Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free\n\tkid, I got the gumdrops.\n\nTurns around again, to Klute. Cheerfully --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tYou remind me of my uncle.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWhat?\n\t\t(then --)\n\tWhat do you remember about that --\n\tdumper?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tNothing. Except he wasn't kidding.\n\tUsually it's a fakeout, you\n\tprobably know. They pretend to tie\n\tyou up, and you wear a dress with a\n\tcloth belt and they pretend to whip\n\tyou or you --\n\t\t(beat)\n\tHell it's their money. I'll hang\n\tfrom the shower rod and whistle\n\tMaytime. Except this guy was really\n\ttripped out on it; he --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tBut you can't say that Dumper was\n\tTom Grunemann.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tI can't say he was anybody!\n\nA brief pause. Klute sorts his notes. She may take\nit that he's packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow.\nFor an instant we see the undefended girl\nunderneath --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tSo -- OK -- that's all?\n\nThen again she changes manner -- remembering a\npractical problem, approaching it as a matter-of\nfact hooker.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tWell could I have them back now\n\thon? -- those tape recordings\n\tyou've got downstairs -- OK? -- and\n\tif you want you can have a good\n\ttime and I'll have a good time and--\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWhat about everything since?\n\nShe draws back again. Up to now she's been\nreasonably on top of things. Starting now we see\nher driven toward the things she'd really rather\nnot talk about -- and increasingly more shaken.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(prompts)\n\tEverything that's happened since\n\tTom Grunemann disappeared. The\n\tphone calls and the --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tJust phone calls, right? They ring,\n\tyou answer, they don't say\n\tanything, just blank. Kids getting\n\tkicks.

I mean there is\n\tnothing that proves --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWhat about the other things you've\n\treported? --\n\t\t(consulting notes)\n\t-- being followed on the --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(interrupts -- awkwardly)\n\tLook -- I'm sorry -- I've led\n\teverybody wrong. I mean yes, I get\n\tthose feelings, but that's just me,\n\tthat's just feelings.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tI'm sure this will amuse you;\n\tI'm scared of the dark. And\n\tsometimes I get shook up, I hear\n\tpeople or -- well, I'll come out in\n\tthe morning and think someone's\n\tbeen prying at my mailbox, or\n\tthere's a little -- trash outside\n\tmy door and I wonder if someone\n\tleft it there for -- do you see? --\n\tthings other people wouldn't even\n\tnotice. Well that's not real, it's\n\tjust nerves; it's got nothing to do\n\twith --\n\nThe PHONE RINGS. She startles. Then approaches with\nsome difficulty -- but then answers with complete\ncalm in her Smith-girl voice.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tBree Daniel.\n\t\t(listens. Brightly)\n\tOh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted?\n\t\t(listens)\n\tOh, well, thank you very much but\n\tmaybe the next time you're in town?\n\t\t(listens)\n\tWell I just love Ted and I'd love\n\tto meet you -- you have a very nice\n\tvoice -- but I just --\n\t\t(listens, grows impatient)\n\tWell I'm having a chat with a very\n\tnice cop.

Pimps?\n\t\t(a beat)\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(patient)\n\tYou're very square. Pimps don't get\n\tyou dates, cookie; they just take\n\tthe money.\n\nKlute takes up the slip of paper previously given\nhim by Trask. In the same manner as before --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI have some names the police gave\n\tme. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell\n\tme what --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(trembling)\n\tLook, I'm sure this'll amuse you\n\ttoo.

I'n he cute?\n\nBree leads on to where --\n\nPAST KLUTE, BREE TO TRINA\n\nTRINA sits alone at a rear table -- anything but a\nwhore in appearance -- a quietly beautiful,\nimmaculately dressed woman of about thirty.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tTrina this is Klute. I told you\n\tabout him.\n\n\t\t\tTRINA\n\tOh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both\n\tjoin me?\n\t\t(as they sit)\n\tAnd how do you like our fair city?\n\tThere's so much here don't you\n\tthink? The museums and the books\n\tand the foreign films -- Bree, have\n\tyou seen the Godard film?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tUh uh.\n\n\t\t\tTRINA\n\tOh you've got to. He does such fun\n\tthings with imagery. And I've been\n\treading The Fall --\n\t\t(to Klute, enunciating\n\t\tcarefully)\n\t-- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo --\n\tit's the same thing, you know the\n\timagery --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(patiently)\n\tTrina honey, he just wants to find\n\tArlyn Page.\n\nTrina undergoes a change of demeanor. Flatly --\n\n\t\t\tTRINA\n\tWhy? She's a junkie.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(prods gently)\n\tShe was with you after she left\n\tFrank.\n\n\t\t\tTRINA\n\tWell she's not now.\n\t\t(then quavering --)\n\tI did everything for Arlyn. I loved\n\tArlyn I took her right into my\n\tapartment, my own sweet apartment\n\ton First. But she wouldn't stay off\n\tit -- the junk -- and I wept and I\n\tpleaded and I held her in my arms -\n\tand she started taking things, my\n\tthings, and selling them for horse.\n\tMy clothes.\n\tWe could've had everything\n\ttogether, everything -- and then\n\tthe bitch sold\n\tmy mink!\n\nINT. ANOTHER LATE NIGHT SPOT - NIGHT\n\nWe dolly with KLUTE & BREE as they walk in front of\na row of tables. This night spot is totally black\nexcept for a series of huge slide projections on\nthe wall in back of the tables. The slides, which\nchange every few seconds are elegant\nrepresentations of the beautiful people living the\ngood life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN\n& COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR. The customers sitting\nin the darkness below provide a direct contrast to\nthe pictures in back. The silhouette figures of\nBREE & KLUTE stop at a table seating three people,\ntwo call girls and a pimp. CAMERA moves in.\n\n\t\t\tFIRST GIRL\n\tArlyn Page?\n\n\t\t\tSECOND GIRL\n\tYou'll never catch up; she's\n\tgrooved out.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tGil?\n\nThe pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures\n--\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI'm not looking for her personally \n\t- someone she might know about.\n\n\t\t\tPIMP\n\t\t(shrugs; to Bree)\n\tTry Janie Dale.\n\nINT. JANIE DALE'S PENTHOUSE\n\nIt is a very small penthouse. KLUTE & BREE stand in\nthe small living room waiting for JANIE DALE. There\nare two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting\naround the living room. One sits at an upright\npiano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.\nAnother one sits on a couch talking to a Wall\nStreet Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTE\nfinds himself staring down into a pile of\npornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE is\namused at his discomfort.\nJANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phone\nin the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to\nthe girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bit\nlike Lauren Bacall.\n\n\t\t\tJANIE DALE\n\t\t(to girl on couch)\n\tIt's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland.\n\tHe wants to know when he can fly in\n\tand clean up the apartment and see\n\tyou. I told him I have all the\n\tcleaning equipment and that he can\n\tcome anytime, but it's up to you.\n\nGIRL on couch rises.\n\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tYou know he wants us to be\n\tdominant.\n\n\t\t\tJANIE DALE\n\tTell him that he'd better have his\n\tass in here by one o'clock on\n\tMonday afternoon or you won't let\n\thim clean the bathroom floor, and\n\ttell him the price has gone up\n\ttwenty bucks -- Old Dutcn\n\tCleanser's not as cheap as it used\n\tto be.\n\nShe shrugs and turns to KLUTE & BREE.\n\n\t\t\tJANIE DALE (CONT'D)\n\tYou wanted to know about Arlyn,\n\thoney? I had to let her go dear.\n\tArlyn stopped being reliable.\n\t\t(explains to Klute)\n\tI deal with a high type client,\n\tbusiness people, you understand? I\n\tcan't send them someone that's all\n\tthe time half zonked out.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tDo you know where she went?\n\n\t\t\tJANIE DALE\n\tTry Momma Reese.\n\nTHIS IS A CHEAPER APARTIENT THAN JANIE DALE'S\n\nThe girls look cheaper, and the customers, rather\nthan Wall Street lawyers and brokers, look more\nlike out of town salesmen who stay at local motor\ninns.\n\nMOMMA REESE is older than JANIE DALE, heavier and\nwith no pretense at chic. She indicates that she\nhas not seen ARLYN in some time.\n\n\t\t\tMOMMA REESE\n\tTry Bill Azure. If you can find\n\thim.\n\nINT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING\n\nThis is a hangout where black and white pimps wait\nto meet their whores after their night of street\nwalking. This streetwalker world is far removed\nfrom the world of the call girl or the world of\nJanie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at\nthe bar taking bet on whose girls have made the\nmost money that night. CAMERA then goes on to\nreveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure\nrepresents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin. \n\nWe catch only part of their dialogue.\n\n\t\t\tAZURE\n\t-- a couple weeks then she'd drift\n\toff a couple of weeks, you know\n\twhat I mean?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tHave you heard from her recently?\n\n\t\t\tAZURE\n\tShe liked me all right but she had\n\twhat she liked better, you know\n\twhat I mean?\n\nWe START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tHave you heard from her recently?\n\n-- and CUT TO --\n\nINT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE\n\n\t\t\tPROPRIETRESS\n\t-- She'd come in and I'd let her\n\thave something. Why not; she'd been\n\ta good customer, a beautiful\n\tperson, a beautiful beautiful\n\tperson.\n\nAgain we fade sound a little before picture, then\nCUT TO --\n\nEXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE,\nSTREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT\n\nOutside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th\nAvenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES\nUNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and\nconsults another. They seem to know of Arlyn --\nhaven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --\n\nEXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAY\n\nA shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs.\nVasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same\ntime that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent.\n\n\t\t\tMRS. VASEK\n\tThe whore, yeah. I threw out.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tDo you know where she went from\n\there?\n\n\t\t\tMRS. VASEK\n\tLive like animals. Her and the man.\n\tOut.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(reacts)\n\tWas she living with a man?\n\nWe see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE\n\nEXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAY\n\nWe still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is\na genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along\nstreet. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute\nwaiting for her to catch up.\n\nEXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWhat's the matter?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(glances about)\n\tWhat the hell do you think's the\n\tmatter.\n\t\t(then suggests)\n\tI could wait for you someplace.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tIf Arlyn Page is living with Tom\n\tGrunemann --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(eagerly)\n\t-- Then you don't need me.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tBut if it's someone else I do.\n\nHe starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow.\n(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their\nmanners now - a reluctant collaboration.)\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tYou sure pull a lot of mileage out\n\tof a hundred dollars.\n\n-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses\nstreet diagonally toward a half-framed house.\n\nINT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY\n\nA downshot from second floor level toward the entry\nway where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a\nmatch to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree\nclimb through stench and litter to the second floor\n-- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the\nsounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has\nbeen sawed out of the door itself, removing handle\nand lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates,\ndecides against knocking, pushes in.\n\nINT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nThe retching sounds are coming from the connecting\nroom. No one visible here. A very few barren pieces\nof furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from the\nnext room --\n\n\t\t\tARLYN (O.S.)\n\tCappy?\n\nARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first,\nthen Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against\na wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her\nface. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow,\nlooking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework\nof purple where her veins have pulped together.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tArlyn? Honey?\n\t\t(then)\n\tLook, it's all right.\n\nFrom the connecting room a MAN'S VOICE (Berger's)\ncalling out hoarsely.\n\n\t\t\tBERGER (O.S.)\n\tIs it Cappy? Cappy? --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tArlyn, it's all right.\n\nBERGER hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe\ncarrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling, speaks\nbefore he sees them.\n\n\t\t\tBERGER\n\tCappy, I got a radio!\n\nHe stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute.\nThen turns, plunges out of view again. Arlyn breaks\nafter.\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tNo --\n\nWe hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices from\nthe connecting room (as she reassures him). Bree\nlooks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?): he\nshakes his head. Pause, then ARLYN reenters,\nwrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting\nthem out -- her only purpose.\n\n\t\t\tARLYN (CONT'D)\n\tBree -- honey - please, we're\n\twaiting for someone.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tArlyn, he just wanted to ask some\n\tquestions -- something you could\n\thelp us about.\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tCan't you see I'm strung out?\n\t\t(cries out)\n\tPlease, we're waiting for it --\n\the's got to have it!\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWe'll go. Just something you could\n\ttell us, first.\n\nArlyn seems to accept the bargain. He indicates to\nBree to proceed, stands away a little. Arlyn covers\nher elbow with one hand. Bree manages as best she\ncan.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tHoney, a couple of years ago, with\n\tJane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a\n\tDumper --\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tPlease, if he sees you, he won't\n\tcome!\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tArlyn, just tell me, did Jane have\n\ta dumper, one of her regular Johns?\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tWhat about him? Yes.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tDid he come around often?\n\nKlute hands Grunemann's picture to Bree: Bree shows\nit to Arlyn. Arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly,\nweakly --\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tNo. He was an older man hon. The\n\tdumper was older.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tDo you remember his name? What can\n\tyou tell me about him?\n\nWe hear FOOTSTEPS - UNDER, DIMLY - mounting the\nstairs. Bree notices them first, Klute persisting\nwith Arlyn --\n\n\t\t\tBERGER (O.S.)\n\t\t(shouts desperately)\n\tArlyn, get them out.\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tPlease, I am begging you.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tIt's important.\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tThat's not the Dumper, that's all!\n\tHe was an older man!\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tCan you give me any more\n\tdescription than that?\n\nArlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him toward\nthe door, intending to reassure --\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tCappy? --\n\n-- as the pusher, CAPPY, steps in. All of this is\nvery quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices.\nCAPPY takes one look at Klute --\n\n\t\t\tARLYN (CONT'D)\n\tIt's all right, they're all right --\n\n-- turns and runs.\n\n\t\t\tBERGER (O.S.)\n\tCappy? -- Cappy?\n\nCappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGER\nplunges out from the connecting room, still\ncarrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing --\n\n\t\t\tBERGER (CONT'D)\n\tCappy it's all right! I got a radio\n\t-- don't run, don't --\n\nWe hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside,\nthe sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks and\nraces after: Klute and Bree follow.\n\nINT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAY\n\nWe see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. As\nArlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up\nonto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries.\nArlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls\nhis face against her, croons to him, soothes and\ntends him.\n\n\t\t\tARLYN\n\tOh baby -- no it's all right -- oh\n\tmy baby baby baby --\n\nKlute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute\noffers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously.\n\n\t\t\tARLYN (CONT'D)\n\tGet out!\n\t\t(to Berger, again)\n\tDon't cry my baby; I'll find him,\n\tI'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry.\n\t\t(to Klute savagely,\n\t\tincoherently)\n\tLeave us alone! Get out and get out\n\tand leave us alone!\n\t\t(to Berger)\n\tMy honey, my baby, my baby --\n\nWe DISSOLVE TO --\n\nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND\nKLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE\n\nCAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of\nBREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to\nspeed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the\ntunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the\nfigure of a woman with life screaming past her out\nof control.\n\nINT. SUBWAY\n\nSUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits\nwith KLUTE staring at the open door and then\nwithout warning - gets up and runs off the train.\nThe door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train.\n\nSUBWAY EXIT\n\nSHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in\ndarkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits\nthe sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to\nbe out of the darkness.\n\nEXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA pans from night view of New York City to\nKLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to\ncomprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM\nGRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the\nmysteries of the behavior of BREE.\n\nSKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nAlongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment\nlights up. He looks through the skylight and sees\nBREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking\nto somebody, and then he sees that she is talking\nto FRANK LIGOURIN.\n\nKLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits\nand pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He\nsees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of\nparody of loving that he saw between ARLYN &\nBERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he\nleaves.\n\nINT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY\n\nThe pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S\noffice is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized\nas the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring\nwith BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the\none as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside\nKLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is\nthe total image of the executive in control.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tShe wouldn't be reliable anyhow --\n\ta narcotics addict.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI believed her, Pete.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tHe's right you know. Waiting for\n\tthe pusher, she'd tell you\n\tanything.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI believed her: the Dumper was not\n\tTom Grunemann.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tAll right, suppose it wasn't Tom\n\tGrunemann; where does that get you?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(smiles ruefully)\n\tIt's where it doesn't get me. I've\n\tgot nothing left that connects to\n\tanything.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tThen, close the case.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI better keep looking.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tWhere, how?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(the best he can offer)\n\tI could try Arlyn Page again. She\n\tsaw much more of the Dumper than\n\tBree Daniel.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou just finished telling me she\n\thad nothing to offer. Not Tom, you\n\tsaid, the Dumper was clearly not\n\tTom.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tIt's got to make sense some way.\n\nCABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her\nwatch significantly.\n\n\t\t\tSECRETARY\n\tMr. Cable -- they are meeting in\n\tMr. Camara's office.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm\n\tsorry.\n\nThey rise, dismissed. He sorts a paper or two,\ncontinues to Klute.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tI'm flying back out to Pennsylvania\n\tFriday; I'll fill them in on\n\tthings.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tHow is it back there?\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI think you're homesick.\n\t\t(reflects)\n\tI'll be out at my camp over the\n\tweekend. Nice right now, that touch\n\tof fall in the air, that skim of\n\tfrost in the early mornings, very\n\tpeaceful.\n\t\t(briskly again)\n\tJohn, I'll be back here again\n\tThursday; I'll be in touch.\n\tLieutenant, thank you.\n\nKLUTE and TRASK depart.\n\nCABLE closes the door and returns to his desk. He\npulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his\ndesk, rewinds it and turns it on. We hear a\nplayback of the previous scene with KLUTE and\nTRASK. He stands at the window listening with some\nsatisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE\nrevealed keeps him in control of the situation.\n\nEXT. WINDOW - CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nThe CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing\nat the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE\nthrough the window. The window is 30 or 40 stories\nhigh. The wide angle lens almost makes the building\nlook like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a man\nsuspended in space.\n\nEXT. WIDE SHOT: DOCKS - DAY\n\nA TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavy\nENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entire\nsequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the\nhead of the dock. We see several figures on the\nrear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this\ndistance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITH\nKLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dock\nto tug-deck.\n\nEXT. TUGBOAT DECK: GROUP - DAY\n\nTRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, but\ndoesn't greet him. His attention, like the others,\nis directed downward and\n\noff-scene (to the surface of the water actually,\njust outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWO\nUniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS.\nAnd we hear, along with the throbbing of the\nengines, a stirring about of the water and a\npeculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the\nengines -- which we can't at first identify.\n\nKlute joins the group, watches.\n\nSPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant\nneoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD\nLIB, UNDER --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\t\t(toward Klute)\n\tThey were bringing a freighter down\n\tthrough Kill Van Kull; propellers\n\twashed it up on top.\n\nSUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached\nwith short ropes. He complains --\n\n\t\t\tSUGARMAN\n\tWhy didn't you bring it up on deck?\n\n\t\t\tDECKHAND\n\tWould you bring it up on deck?\n\nThey slip the basket downward, out of frame (into\nthe water).\n\n\t\t\tDECKHAND (CONT'D)\n\t\t(to other)\n\tMickey, get something. Get the eels\n\toff.\n\n\t\t\tSPENCE\n\t\t(calmly)\n\tThey'll drop off theirselves when\n\tshe comes out.\n\nWe CUT TO -\n\nBERGER - DAY\n\nWe see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat\ncabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with his\nhands bunched in front of his mouth. We identify\nthe noise which may have puzzled us before -- his\nSOBBING.\n\nDOWNSHOT: SURFAICE OF WATER, BASKET, BODY\n\nWe catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being\nlifted, just before it breaks the surface of the\nwater.\n\nFAVORING KLUTE\n\nKlute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing of\nthe body. SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slide\nthe bag around it. TRASK kneels down to make a\nbrief examination -- straightens again. To Klute --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tIt'll go to the Examiner. But I\n\tdon't see nothin that means nothin.\n\nWe MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a few\nfeet along deck. Here he stands. Then SUGARMAN\nmoves into view holding a clipboard. Routinely --\n\n\t\t\tSUGARMAN\n\tYou help us with ID? We can't get\n\tnothin from him.\n\nHe indicates the direction of Berger. Klute\nexamines the clipboard data.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tArlyn Page was probably an alias.\n\tShe went by the names Terry Arlyn\n\tand June Price. She may have been\n\tfrom Pittsburgh, someone told me. I\n\tcan give you a list of people who\n\tknew her, if that would help to --\n\n\t\t\tSUGARMAN\n\tNo point, thanks.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tIs he claiming the body?\n\n\t\t\tSUGARMAN\n\tUh uh, that'd mean funeral\n\texpenses.\n\nHe spits, moves back in the direction of the group;\nKlute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his\ndirection. Brokenly --\n\n\t\t\tBERGER\n\tMan could you help me?\n\nKlute doesn't understand his purport, reacts\ninstantly, sympathetically --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tYeah, what?\n\n\t\t\tBERGER\n\tYou know, help me out. That's my\n\tbaby there, dead. I got to get up.\n\nKlute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger\ninsists --\n\n\t\t\tBERGER (CONT'D)\n\tMan you don't know what that does\n\tto me, my baby dead --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t-- You've got to get up.\n\n\t\t\tBERGER\n\tYeah.\n\nKlute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very\nsharply, off the tugboat.\n\nEXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute walks a longer distance this time, sits down\non one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we\nsee what might be a profound awe and grief at all\nthese things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more.\n\nEFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven\naway and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out\nagain.\n\nTRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling,\nlooks at him speculatively. Silence. Then --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tThat's how the other one died, you\n\tknow. In the water.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(nods)\n\tI looked it up.\n\nThen -- (we are assuming a complete understanding\nhere between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What\nTrask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful?\nDo we both suspect the same man?)\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tWell?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tYeah.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nIt is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamas\ncurled up in her bed. There are some magazines\nscattered around the bed and the television set is\non an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in the\nbed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut\nbutter with the knife sticking out of the jar on\nthe floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE has\nspent most of the day in bed. She looks like an\nunkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she does\nnot answer it. The phone no sooner stops than the\ndoor bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bed\nand goes to the door. She looks through the spy\nhole and sees Klute's face.

KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nThe empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on\n(dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then\nsits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot\npropped up on it.\n\nFOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, but\ndoesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it,\nenters. There are tear-tracks down her face, but\nshe's no longer crying. She tries to smile, tries\nto explain her wants. Then with the unhurried,\ngraven composure of absolute desperation, she sits\non the edge of the bed.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tIf I asked you something, would you\n\tnot laugh? -- asked you to look at\n\tsomething?\n\nShe pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on\nher arm - a freckle. He peers at it then at her\npuzzledly.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(apologetic)\n\tI thought it was maybe changing\n\tshape or something.\n\nKlute looks at it again. Judiciously --\n\nHe shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. She\ncompares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries to\nsmile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and moves\nabout. Her manner in general is totally unguarded,\nhonest, undramatic, searching.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tLook -- I hate everybody; and I'm\n\tsorry for everybody; and I'm scared\n\tall the time.\n\nHe only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' --\nan invitation to leave. But she won't be driven\naway. More urgently, helplessly:\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tLook, I don't know either. It's\n\tlike the only thing I know how to\n\tdo -- I feel safe.\n\nShe's left the door a little ajar. He widens it for\nher.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tIt's been a full day.\n\nShe pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut.

But then:\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t--- Bree ---\n\nStanding still, she starts again to cry -- and\nbravely to keep the crying to herself. The child\nbereft. He contends with himself, then crosses to\nher, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. A\ncompletely asexual gesture at this point, a giving\nof comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows.

He has pulled a blanket\naround her shoulders. The transaction is still not\novertly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt.\nHe rubs his cheek against her forehead.

KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT\n\nKlute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach.\nBree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers\nabout his back.

KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN)\n\nKlute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with\nher head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in\nthis shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to\nwake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for\nsomething beside the bed. Her eyes open\nimmediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying\ngently to press her back.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tGo back to sleep.\n\nBut she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls\nonto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more\nseparate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've\nseen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the\npossible Bree. She observes:\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tI'm still scared.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tI mean different but still.\n\t\t(frowns)\n\tLook, I made it very clear from the\n\tstart, you're a yokel, you don't\n\texcite me, you don't even interest\n\tme, and so I only have one question\n\twhich is what the hell are you\n\tdoing in my bed?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tMy bed.\n\nShe grins, then starts to reach for him, still\nreceptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang,\nturns her head away sharply.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh!\n\nHe looks at her with concern, but only caresses\nher. She manages to explain --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tI am scared. The things I do. The\n\tthings I could do to you.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tMm.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tNo, not just 'mm'.

This is the municipal storehouse.\n\nINT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY\n\nThe abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us\nin almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We are\nin a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to the\ndarkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous\nobjects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces\nof furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - the\nremnants of the lives of the plundered, the\ndestroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolen\nproperty, some evidence for homicide cases, and\nsome the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed\ndead.\n\nA CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civil\nservant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR\n\nKlute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up\nthe elevator shaft through the open cage we see a\nseries of doors hanging over space seeming to lead\nnowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of a\ndream of being lost in a black limbo.\n\nKlute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor\nand walk down the long very low corridor past rows\nof locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at one\nand opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like room\nfilled with banks of files from floor to ceiling.\nThe Custodian counts to himself --\n\n\t\t\tCUSTODIAN\n\tFour -- five -- what number'd I\n\tsay?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tFour ninety-seven, Jane McKenna\n\nCustodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection.\nReaches for paper Klute's holding.\n\n\t\t\tCUSTODIAN\n\t-- And I keep the authorization,\n\tplease.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI thought there'd be more.\n\nKlute pokes through a small collection of personal\neffects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot,\nfaded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful\nremnants of Jane McKenna's life. Klute closes the\ndrawer, and the front of the drawer is marked\nMcKENNA, JANE?\n\nOver the visual material of Klute's trip through\nthe warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits\nand pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (V.O.)\n\tAll right. Loneliness.\n\t\t(space)\n\tWell -- separated. From other\n\tpeople. Forgotten.\n\t\t(space)\n\tWell, as if I can be here, I can go\n\tthrough the motions, right?

He hasn't time to pursue --\nshouts again --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tGo down in my room and wait.\n\nThen he turns back into the apartment.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nA DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV,\nconnecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a\nFLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs\nenter frame and flip the garment into a collecting\nbox and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight\nand the scene has been invaded by POLICE\nTECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a\nfingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of\nfixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are\ntalking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking\nthrough a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled.\nOver the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of\nmaterial in the dossier. It contains photographs of\nCable and his life from childhood to the present -\nincluding pictures of him with his mother and\nfather - she a very dominant looking lady and he a\nvery passive looking man;\nalso graduation pictures and pictures with his\nformer wife taken when he was still a very young\nman. They are the personal images of a life time.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\t\t(to Klute)\n\tBut if Cable killed Grunemann why\n\twould he get you hired to look for\n\tGrunemann?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tBecause he knew I couldn't leave\n\tthe case alone. And this way at\n\tleast he'd keep track of it. And\n\tme.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tWhat about Grunemann's letters to\n\tthe girl, everything like that?\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tCable's letters, Cable's phone\n\tcalls. Cable's everything else.\n\tHe's been a Dumper a long time. He\n\tjust passed off his own peculiar\n\thabits on the other man -- it kept\n\tthings goin'.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tOK, pretend I believe you. Tell me\n\thow you get an indictment.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tCan't. Yet. Oh we got everythin'\n\telse: first rate evidence Cable\n\ttyped those dumper letters to Bree\n\tDaniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute\n\tfound a couple in her personal\n\tremains. We got dates of Cable's\n\ttrips here coincidin' with phone\n\tcalls to Bree Daniel, also the\n\tdates of death of McKenna and Page.\n\tWe got some hints of his personal\n\thistory. His father, unsuccessful\n\tsalesman, committed suicide when he\n\twas 13. His mother pinned all her\n\thopes on her son. He won a national\n\tscience youth award at the age of\n\teight. They had no money, but she\n\thired special tutors for him in the\n\tsummer time. She saw a good thing.\n\tHe graduated from high school at 14\n\t-- college at 16 -- no friends --\n\tThe kids in his class thought of\n\thim as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at\n\t18 -- married at age 21 to his then\n\temployer's daughter. The marriage\n\tlasted 4 weeks. Her father had it\n\tannulled. She says he was impotent.\n\tWorld War II he got in bad trouble\n\tabout a German girl, no details. We\n\tthink we know why he killed\n\tGrunemann -- he found out Cable was\n\ta dumper; Cable couldn't take that.\n\tWe think we know why he killed\n\tMcKenna -- she wanted to blackmail\n\thim for it. All fine. But we got no\n\tbody, no direct witnesses, we can't\n\tgo any-damn-where.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tThat's the reason i told him we had\n\tno evidence Tom was still alive. We\n\twanted to shake him into another\n\tphone call or another letter. It\n\tdidn't work out just that way.\n\nThe Technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart.\nThe first Technician scoops the torn up photographs\ninto another collecting box. Trask retrieves the\ncompany outing photograph.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tGov, want to leave me that one. How\n\tcome he got to play with this one,\n\tanyway.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI left them here. I was doing some\n\twork here.\n\nTrask eyes Klute for a moment, as if a querying his\nrelationship with Bree. Klute is clearly\nunresponsive. Trask resumes.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tIt's damn lucky you didn't have the\n\tdossier on Cable here.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNobody's seen that.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tIf we get anything from the lab,\n\twe'll have it by noon. And just\n\tthink -- all he really had to do\n\twas write us a letter.\n\n\t\t\tROSS\n\tSounds to me you better shake him\n\tagain. Put him in a spot he has to\n\tdo something more -- but this time\n\tgive him a time and a place to do\n\tit.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tHe called this morning from\n\tTuscarora. Asked me to meet him at\n\t3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's\n\ton his way to Chicago.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tHe sure chalks up a lot of flight\n\ttime.\n\nKlute starts gathering his papers we CUT TO --\n\nINT. STAIRWELL: BREE - DAY\n\nBree coming up the stairs meets the Technicians\ncoming down -- stands aside to let them pass --\nstarts up again and comes face to face with Klute.\nOn her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- a\nshyness mixed with defiance -- but Klute's manner\nis arduous. She smiles nervously, asks --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tAh, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tThose were police laboratory\n\tpeople, they've been over the\n\tapartment.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(mock delight)\n\tOh zippidy-doo, they'll find my\n\tfingerprints.\n\t\t(then)\n\tCan I go in? I need some stuff.\n\nHe nods; she starts by. Then --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWhere'd you spend last night?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWith Trina.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI called Trina.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tMaybe I wasn't there when you\n\tcalled.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tBree, what's actually happened? It\n\twasn't that bad.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(cuts in harshly)\n\tHow do you know how bad it was?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWhy couldn't you stay here with me?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tBecause I didn't want to be\n\ttouched! I didn't think you'd get\n\tthat!\n\nPause. Then, evenly --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tTrask wants to talk with you.\n\nShe starts on, then turns back toward him -- rather\npleadingly --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tHey -- look officer -- I can\n\texplain everything. It was just --\n\tyou know, everything all of a --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tTrask wants to talk with you.\n\nShe continues on up; Klute continues down.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nEntering without greeting Trask (his manner is not\nuncivil but simply neutral, unreacting, Cop-like)\nshe quickly gathers up a few properties, a change\nof shoes.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tMiss Daniel, be sensible, you find\n\tanother place till we get things\n\tcleaned up.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(brightly)\n\tOh well that shouldn't take you\n\tmore than another, oh, two and a\n\thalf or three years, should it?\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tA few more days. We know who did\n\tthis.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tSo do I.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tNo, not Grunemann. He's dead. The\n\tman that killed him -- also prob'ly\n\tJane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.\n\nShe spins around -- mute -- terrified.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(manages)\n\tArlyn and Jane commited suicide. He\n\tsaid they commited suicide.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tNow there's a picture I'd like you\n\tto --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tYou said someone killed them, you\n\tsaid you know who, you said that.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tWell we're pretty --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWhy isn't he locked up?\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tWe don't want to just lock him up;\n\twe want a conviction, we wanted him\n\tto do something more.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tIs that why Klute didn't tell me?\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tI guess he figured it was better.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWhat was better? I made better\n\tbait?\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tNo, that's not --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tIs that what he set me up for?\n\tEverything he's told me from the\n\tbeginning? -- don't worry, don't --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\t\t(coldly)\n\tFrom the beginning I don't know why\n\tthe hell he's messin with you. If\n\the was me he'd know better. If he\n\twas even a city boy he'd know\n\tbetter. You're a whore Miss Daniel,\n\tthat's the truth of it, right? Now\n\tsomethin I'd like you to look at.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tI don't have to look at anything. I\n\tdon't have --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tHere please.\n\nHe coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company\nouting picture. (We see the rip extending up\nthrough the image of Tom Grunemann in the front\nrow.)\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh no.\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tLike for you to look for the man.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tGrunemann? I've looked at him a --\n\nTrask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of\nGrunemann, indicates with the other hand --\n\n\t\t\tTRASK\n\tNo. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just\n\tlook around -- I said look for the\n\tDumper.\n\nWe see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows\nof faces. Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh! --\n\n-- and WE CUT TO --\n\nINT. DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAY\n\nCable welcomes Klute. His outer manner is warm,\nvoluble, congratulatory --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tSorry we had to meet here. But I'm\n\tpressed for time.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWell there's a couple --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI read your report. I had to go\n\talong with it -- the idea of this\n\tbeing a wild goose chase, Tom being\n\tnowhere around --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWell as a matter of --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI've been up country, you know my\n\tsummer place, my camp. I don't even\n\thave a telephone there. This\n\tmorning they sent a messenger out,\n\tthat you'd been trying to call me.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI'm on my way to Chicago. Very\n\timportant meeting tonight. Well --\n\tany new developments?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tYeah, two things Pete, that --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou said Trask was arranging\n\tlaboratory work. Police laboratory.\n\tAnything from that?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tYeah. It wasn't Tom.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI'm sorry. I don't understand.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tIt wasn't Tom that broke in the\n\troom.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tIt has to be Tom. You said he\n\tripped up his own pictures, he --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNot Tom. Whoever it was left a kind\n\tof souvenir, I told you, in her\n\tclothing. Semen. The laboratory got\n\ta blood group reading from that.\n\tThe man was blood type 0; Tom was\n\tan AB.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\t\t(slowly)\n\tSome mistake perhaps that --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNo. No mistake Pete. It doesn't\n\tprove who it was -- but proves it\n\twasn't Tom.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou must be discouraged.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(prosaically)\n\tNot too bad. This brings back that\n\tDumper in the picture.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tThat who?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tDumper, the man Bree Daniel\n\tmentioned and Arlyn Page knew and\n\tJane McKenna knew.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou said he was no possible\n\tconnection with Tom. The Page girl\n\ttold you that, not Tom.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tSomeone's been doing all these\n\tthings.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou were hired to look for Tom, not\n\tsomeone.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tPete, I've got a chance to buy Jane\n\tMcKenna's black book.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tCall-girls generally keep a book,\n\tyou know, a list of their clients.\n\tSometimes, if a girl retires,\n\tshe'll even sell it worth good\n\tmoney. Jane McKenna had a black\n\tbook; when she died it was stolen.\n\tI've been after it a long time.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou were hired to look for Tom.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI'm meeting a man tomorrow night.\n\tHe wants to meet me on East-River\n\tDrive -- he wants five hundred\n\tdollars for the book. Can you get\n\tthat for me Pete?\n\nSometime -- right along about now -- it privately\ncomes to Cable that Klute may know everything and\nthat he, Cable, may be being trapped.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI can't follow you.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWill the Company put up five\n\thundred dollars to get Jane\n\tMcKenna's list of clients?\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tNo. It's ridiculous. This has\n\tnothing to do with Tom Grunemann.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(shrugs, stolidly)\n\tIt probably has the Dumper's name.\n\tIt might give us some kind of new\n\tlead.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tI want a look at it anyhow.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tKlute, the Company's interest is\n\tTom Grunemann. Solely and\n\texclusively. You say you can't find\n\tTom; all right, I'll see that\n\tyou're paid off; the case is\n\tclosed.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tAll right, but I'm going to see\n\tthat list.\n\nHELICOPTER FLIGHT is announced over loud speaker\nand Cable and Klute walk onto field.\n\nEXT. HELICOPTER FIELD\n\nPeople are boarding helicopter.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tWhy would they deal with you? You\n\tdon't know these people.\n\nKlute is momentarily at a loss -- not a question\nhe'd prepared for -- improvises.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNo, but Bree does. She's\n\tnegotiating for me. Bree Daniel.\n\nCable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI can talk it over; possibly I can\n\tget the money. When are you meeting\n\tthe man?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tTomorrow evening, nine. East River\n\tDrive and 73rd Street.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tSuppose I meet you there a half\n\thour before.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tJust send me a money order.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tNo, I'd -- like to be in on it.\n\nATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the\nhelicopter.\n\nKlute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a\ngoodbye gesture.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWell --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tTomorrow. See you tomorrow night.\n\nINT. HELICOPTER\n\nCable sits down next to window. The helicopter\nbegins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium close\nshot of Cable against the helicopter window. The\nhelicopter ascends in front of a very tall office\nbuilding made up of endless glass squares. A\ntelephoto lens brings the glass squares of the\nbuilding directly against Cable's head and\nshoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is\nalmost levitating by himself. As one floor after\nanother disappears behind him we see an almost\nmanic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on\ntop of things once more.\n\nEXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY\n\nWe bring Klute along street, and into the\nBrownstone.\n\nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY\n\nKlute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment --\nknocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tBree?\n\nNo answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turns\nback, unlocks the door himself, enters.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nThe room is still disordered. Bree and Frank\nLigourin look at him, silently. Bree has been\nassembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with\nher. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles a\nlittle -- almost apologetically.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI'm always getting surprises.\n\nBree doesn't answer. She sets the armload of\ndresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to\nget others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then\n--\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\tI don't want you to do this.\n\nHe still doesn't extract an answer. She returns\nwith other dresses.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\tPlease. I said I don't want you to\n\tdo this.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(tight, small)\n\tTrask said I should move. Let's not\n\tmake a thing of it.\n\nHe continues to look at her; she continues to\ngather possessions. Then trying to smile, to deal\nwith it casually --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tLook, too much is going on here.\n\tI'm moving in with another girl,\n\tthat's all. Just for a while.\n\n\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t(helpfully)\n\tThat's right. This other girl's got\n\ta very big apartment, big, plenty\n\tof room.\n\t\t(then)\n\tLook, it's not necessarily how it\n\tlooks, right? It's --\n\nHe thinks better of continuing. Klute looks from\nhim back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing his\nwords -- unable to speak any faster.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tNo. Please. Not with this son of a\n\tbitch.\n\nFrank rises, both nervous and offended -- but\ndealing with Klute as between civilized men.\nSmiling.\n\n\t\t\tFRANK\n\tKlute, let's handle it like\n\tgrownups? I mean we're all grown up\n\tnow, right?\n\t\t(ventures forward)\n\t-- we all respect each other, you\n\tknow what I mean? -- I respect you,\n\tBree respects you -- you could say,\n\tit just didn't work out between you\n\tand she. But you got to respect her\n\ttoo -- you know, her best\n\tinterests, best for her --\n\nKlute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to\nbeat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side of\nFrank's face, as he struggles away. Bree is\nscreaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. He\nthrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break away\nthrough the still-open door. Klute pursues.\n\nINT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAY\n\nFrank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in\nthe doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tNo!\n\nKlute is restrained -- restrains himself. Frank has\nfaced around on the stairs, still bleeding\nextravagantly from his torn scalp. Earnestly --\n\n\t\t\tFRANK\n\tHey, I'm gonna get you dropped.\n\nKlute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away\ndown the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and\nrunning -- Klute faces sharply around into the\napartment.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nPAST KLUTE TO BREE. She is running away from him\nagain, to a corner of the apartment, fumbling at a\nsewing basket. He starts in, after her.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\t\t(indistinctly)\n\tPlease --\n\nTWO SHOT\n\nShe swings about as he overtakes her, holding a\npair of scissors -- simply and transcendently\nterrified. She strikes at him, slashing his\nforearm. He and she stand in absolute silence. He\nlooks down at the stain of blood spreading through\nthe fabric of his jacket sleeve. Then he turns out\nof the room and down the stairs.\n\nEXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY\n\nKlute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his\nown apartment. A passerby stops him for directions\nand doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve.\nKlute goes into his apartment.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY\n\nBree is in the middle of dialing the phone. Her\nhands are shaking; she misdials -- holds down the\nreceiver for a moment then starts again.\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute stands in silence for a moment or two -- then\ntakes rather more note of his forearm. (Not\nurgently but practically; it behooves him to stop\nbleeding.) He turns toward the bathroom, pulling\nhis jacket off with the other hand.\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY\n\nBree speaks to the phone, trying to make a simple\npoint, trying to keep her voice even.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t-- until he gets back.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tYes I heard you, I understand that.\n\tI said I'm going to come over, I'll\n\twait until he gets back.\n\nShe hangs up before the other party can object in\ndetail -- takes up her purse and goes out, not even\nclosing the door behind her.\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHROOM: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute has knotted a hand-towel around his forearm,\nnow uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight.\nThen -- intending to clean up -- he takes up a\nwashcloth, reaches for the faucet --\n\nEXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY\n\nBree comes out of door - goes down steps -\nhesitates in front of Klute's apartment struggling\nwith the question of whether to knock. CAMERA pulls\nback to reveal we are watching her through the\nwindshield of a car in the parking lot across the\nstreet. CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the\nback of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching\nher. Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stops\nherself and walks down the street. Cable's head\nmoves out of the shot. We hear the sound of the car\ndoor opening and closing. Through the windshield we\nsee Cable cross in front of the car and start to\nfollow Bree down the street.\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHRO0M: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute finishes mopping up. SOUND OF TELEPHONE. He\nturns back out of the bathroom and answers it.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tHello?\n\t\t(listens, then soberly - )\n\tTrask, I don't get that.\n\nEXT. STREET: BREE - DAY\n\nBree is about a quarter block away from the\nBrownstone now, hurrying. She waves in the\ndirection of a cab, misses it, continues on. We CUT\nTO --\n\nEXT. STREET: CABLE - DAY\n\nCable stands looking after her, hesitates over\nchoice of action, decides to follow.\n\nEXT. STREET: FIGURES: PAST BREE TO CABLE - DAY\n\nWe establish the distance between them -- Cable 100\nor so feet behind her, unnoticed by her,\nmaintaining about the same pace, not -- at this\npoint -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting for\nless populated surroundings) We CUT BACK TO --\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute continues his phone conversation, short\nspoken.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tWho told you, his secretary?\n\t\t(listens)\n\tHas someone checked his hotel? He\n\talways stays at the --\n\t\t(then)\n\tI'll look around, I'll call you\n\tback.\n\nHe hangs up. First he checks out the windows (but -\nif we want to be accurate - from mid room, without\ndirectly approaching the windows themselves). Then\nhe secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds the\njacket itself over his arm to conceal it, as a\nmatter of public decorum), and goes on out.\n\nINT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY\n\nKlute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits\nan absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A\nman -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here\nsomewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the\nlikely places -- first of all the lower hallway,\nthen the stairwell itself, moving steadily\nunalarmedly up.\n\nAt the top he notes -- but still without main\nconcern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tBree --\n\nINT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY\n\nHe enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite\nthoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT\nBACK TO --\n\nEXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY\n\nBree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of\nthose temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her,\nnearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE.\n\nINT. STAIRWELL - DAY\n\nKlute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his\nroom, takes up the phone. Through the still-open\ndoor we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO --\n\nINT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY\n\nBree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She\nmay have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an\nhour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one\nhanded, without even lifting it from the coffee\ntable, with an absolute lack of interest, a\nmechanical gesture.\n\nWe hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where\nwe are watching Bree sit.\n\n\t\t\tLELA (O.S.)\n\tMrs. Daniel --\n\nWIDER - TWO SHOT\n\nBree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the\nSecretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her.\n\n\t\t\tLELA\n\t-- I have to close up now. Leave\n\tyour name and number with his\n\tmessage service, Mrs. Daniel, and\n\twhy don't you just go home and wait\n\tuntil he --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tLELA\n\tWell I have to close up now.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tLook -- could I use your phone?\n\n\t\t\tLELA\n\tYes indeed.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tLook. I almost killed my -- I\n\talmost killed someone.\n\n\t\t\tLELA\n\t\t(the same tone,\n\t\tcompletely)\n\tWell I'm certain Doctor Spangler\n\twill want to talk with you; excuse\n\tme.\n\nBree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move\nwith the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's\ninner office and switches out the lights\n(establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we\nhear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (O.S.)\n\tIs Mr. Faber there?\n\t\t(beat)\n\tMr. Faber Senior.\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER'S OFFICE: FABER - DAY\n(NIGHT)\n\nMr. Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up.\n\n\t\t\tFABER\n\tYes?\n\t\t(then, glancing about)\n\tBree?\n\nINT. SPANGLER (OUTER) OFFICE: BREE ON PHONE - DAY\n(NIGHT)\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(haltingly)\n\t-- I'm -- I just have to talk to\n\tsomeone. I'm just a little way\n\tacross town --\n\nFABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE)\n\n\t\t\tFABER\n\tYes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half\n\tan hour, sure, yes.\n\nHe hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of\ntriumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie.\nThen it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of\nhimself -- he leans forward against his desk and\nrubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO \n-\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nKLUTE on phone.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tTrina, will you call me if you hear\n\tfrom, her? Will you check other\n\tpeople she might call? Yeah, if it\n\twasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou.\n\nHe hangs up, immediately starts to dial again, then\npauses to check a list he's laid out by the\ntelephone. While he's doing this, his PHONE RINGS.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\tYeah?\n\t\t(then)\n\tNothing yet, Trask; I'm going down\n\tthe list. I've tried Spangler's\n\toffice and Spangler's home; I just\n\tget his message service. I'll keep--\n\t\t(interrupted -- listens --\n\t\tthen -- grimly)\n\tI may have steered Cable that way.\n\tI told him Bree was dealing for me,\n\tfor Jane McKenna's book. Have you\n\tfound any --\n\nHe is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words\non his end of things -- nods once --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\tYeah.\n\n-- and depresses the receiver just long enough to\nclear the connection, and starts dialing again --\nWe CUT TO --\n\nINT. STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nQuitting time. As Bree enters from street level,\nemployees are coming down the stairs, pushing past\nher. She continues up on until at one point -- one\nmore officious or more communicative than the\nothers informs her --\n\n\t\t\tFOREMAN\n\tLady, it's closing up there.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tFOREMAN\n\tWe're closing up, quitting time,\n\tFabers.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(unsurely)\n\tI have an appointment with Mr.\n\tFaber.\n\n\t\t\tFOREMAN\n\tOh, yeah.\n\nHe lets her pass, glances after her like the\nothers, continues on his way.\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY\n(NIGHT)\n\nBree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still\nothers press past her on their way down -- and\ncomes more or less directly up against the thickset\nRECEPTIONIST. She is packing her purse, preparing\nto depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree --\nwho sees no way to avoid the issue.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tI have an appointment with Mr.\n\tFaber.\n\n\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\tIn there.\n\t\t(turns, bawls)\n\tMr. Faber --\n\nBree goes on nervously in the direction indicated,\ntoward --\n\nA CORNER OF OFFICES: NATHAN FABER\n\nNATHAN stands bending over a bench with back to\ncamera, conferring with another man as Bree\napproaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactly\nlike his father. We hear the Receptionist's VOICE\nrepeating --\n\n\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(CONT'D)\n\tMr. Faber --\n\nAs Bree nears him, he straightens and turns -- a\nmuch younger man. Bree stops short, recognizing the\nerror.\n\n\t\t\tNATHAN\n\tYes?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tI'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior.\n\n\t\t\tNATHAN\n\t\t(calmly)\n\tMy father went home about fifteen\n\tminutes ago; he wasn't feeling too\n\tgood.\n\nShe has already started away. He calls after her\nevenly --\n\n\t\t\tNATHAN (CONT'D)\n\tCan I help you?\n\nShe looks back quickly, smiles nervously --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tIt wasn't important.\n\nBut we hold on him for a moment as she continues\nout of scene -- until he turns away to other\nmatters. Then --\n\nRECEPTION AREA: RECEPTIONIST, BREE\n\nBree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tDid Mr. Faber leave a message for\n\tme or anything? Mr. Faber Senior?\n\tBree Daniel.\n\n\t\t\tRECEPTIONIST\n\tOh, I thought that was for\n\ttomorrow.\n\nThe Receptionist riffles through a stack of\nassorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and\npromptly takes her way off. Out. Bree starts to\nopen the envelope then and there -- but OTHERS\ncontinue to move past her. She seeks a more private\nplace.\n\nROWS OF GARMENTS\n\nBree shelters herself out of sight from everyone\nelse -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT\nVOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense of\nother presences.\n\nWe see her open the envelope --\n\nCLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPE\n\nShe finds nothing inside but money -- bills\ntotaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for a\nmessage, finding nothing. It comes to her slowly\nthat she's been paid off and avoided. She bites her\nlips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding --\n\nRECEPTIONIST AREA\n\n-- back to the reception area again. (By now this\nimmediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight\nof a figure or two at scene-start, moving through\nthe background, and continue to hear an occasional\nNOISE or VOICE O.S.)\n\nBree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a\npencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer,\nstarts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back\nto Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takes\nup a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tBree Daniel. Has he called in yet?\n\tWell if he does, I'm at --\n\t\t(reads phone)\n\t-- two seven eight, three one\n\thundred, and I guess I can wait\n\there five minutes; then I'll try\n\tfrom somewhere else.\n\t\t(impatiently)\n\tJust tell him Bree Daniel; he knows\n\twho.\n\nShe hangs up, goes back to readdressing the\nenvelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her\ndirection. She glances up apologetically.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tMr. Faber, I just wanted to leave\n\tthis for your father, and I\n\twondered if you'd --\n\nShe pauses --\n\nANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE\n\nCable hastens toward her along a lane of garments.\nIn this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying\nfigure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the\ngesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a\nquieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended\nas a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tSomeone --\n\n-- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO\n--\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nKlute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into\nthe phone (dealing evidently with an ethically\nskittish message service at the other end).\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tDid she leave a number?\n\t\t(beat)\n\tThis is a police call; don't make\n\tme take time to prove it. Did she\n\tleave a number? What is the number?\n\t\t(beat)\n\tWhat is the number? --\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nCable and Bree. They are at some remove from the\nsite of Cable's first appearance; there are other\nevidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that of\nslightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an\nattempt now and then to smile. Bree watches his\nevery slight gesture, quivers to make a break for\nit, tries throughout to buy time.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tCan't we talk together reasonably,\n\tjust -- ordinarily?\n\t\t(beat)\n\tI know you're expecting some kind\n\tof -- extravagant behavior, but\n\tbelieve me -- do you believe me? --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tYes -- all right --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\t-- We can talk --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t-- Yes.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tAll right, then, an ordinary\n\tmatter. I'm a quite well off man, I\n\thave a -- position to respect. I\n\twould feel personally uncomfortable\n\tto be connected with a -- certain\n\tkind of woman, I'm sure you\n\tunderstand. Do you? Well I'd like\n\tto buy Jane McKenna's book.\n\nHe looks at her discerningly. She seems not to have\nfollowed his exposition. He tries patiently to\nclarify it.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tHer black book, Jane McKenna's, her\n\tlist of -- of persons. I was told\n\tyou're negotiating for it on behalf\n\tof --\n\nThe PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles.\nIt has been put on night-ring, to sound all over\nthe loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- the\nmost bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of\nresponse to it. It rings and rings as he talks and\ntalks -- in the same expository tone as before,\nwithout raising his voice. It drowns out most of\nhis words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of\nall the following -- but he seems not to hear it\nany more than the clamor of other things torturing\nhis soul.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tThat was what Klute told me -- you\n\twere negotiating for him to buy\n\tthat list. And I'm in a position to\n\tpay a good deal more for it than he\n\tcan. Do you understand? I'd like\n\tyou to acquire it on my --\n\t\t(beat)\n\tMiss Daniel, do you not understand?\n\t\t(beat)\n\tMiss Daniel, I can't tell whether\n\tyou understand me.\n\t\t(beat - still reasonably)\n\tIs this something Klute just\n\tinvented? Is this a trap for me,\n\tMiss Daniel; does Klute know about\n\tme?\n\nHe turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension\nphones situated around the loft) -- though up to\nnow he's given no evidence of even hearing the\nringing. He just stands holding the phone for a\ntime, then lowers it back on the receiver. With a\nsort of absolute quiet --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tYou have no idea what I'm talking\n\tabout.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tYes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I\n\tcould make a phone call.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tNo, you're frightened, you're\n\tpretending. Well -- Klute knows\n\tabout me then. Does everybody know,\n\tcan you tell me?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tYes.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tThen it doesn't matter what I do\n\tany more, does it?\n\nPause. Then he shudders slightly.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tYou people know nothing about pain.\n\nWe CUT TO --\n\nEXT. STREETS - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nWe see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along\nstreet. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts\nthe next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of\nit. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klute\nmashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACK\nTO --\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nMLS, the two FIGURES: CABLE, BREE. They are\nsomewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down\nfrom one of the arched windows of the loft, while\nBree remains in place. She is a prisoner, we can\nsuppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyes\ncontinually shifting, her mind calculating her\nchances -- but he hasn't molested her. He bears her\nno animus at this point. His manner is rather\nquiet, undetermined. He feels some relief that the\nthing is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlement\nabout what to do (with either her or himself) now.\nHe returns toward her.\n\nCLOSER: BREE, CABLE\n\nNearing her again, he gestures several times,\napologetically, seeking words.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tI've got no idea what I shall do.\n\nHe happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tI'm not going to hurt you,\n\tabsolutely, I'm not.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWill you let me go then?\n\nHe seems not to have heard the request. He sits for\na moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity.\n(Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip\nher shoes off, in hopes of running.)\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tIt puzzles me so badly. I've done\n\tterrible things but I can't\n\tconsider myself a terrible man.\n\tI've killed three people and I'd\n\tstill want to say it was accident,\n\tdo you see?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(tries again, slowly)\n\tIf you'll let me go I could tell\n\tthem what --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\t\t(unhearing, resumes)\n\tTom Grunemann discovered me -- we\n\twere here on business together, he\n\tdiscovered me with Jane McKenna.\n\tThen I suppose it was the -- the\n\tcontempt I saw in his face and the\n\tcertainty that sooner or later he'd\n\tuse it against me. Within the\n\tCompany. I endured that as long as\n\tI could, do you see?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tI'm sorry, I'm just frightened.\n\tYes.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tExcuse me Miss Daniel?\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tI said yes, I see.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\t\t(doubtingly)\n\tOh no, I don't think --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tTell me. I'll listen.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tI just want you to tell me.\n\nHe rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in,\ncredulous, grateful, wondering --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou're willing to listen? You want\n\tme just to keep talking?\n\nHe hits her.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tThat's what you do, isn't it; you\n\tmake a man feel accepted.\n\tThat's what you all do. Your stock\n\tin trade a man's weakness.\n\nHe hits her again.\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\tWhy don't you ask for mercy? My\n\tGod, what mercy has anyone given\n\tme?\n\nINT. ELEVATOR - KLUTE ASCENDING - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nEXT. GARMENT BUILDING ROOF (DIRECTLY ABOVE FABER\nLOFT) - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nKlute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way\nacross the roof. Man in hotel window across street\nholding drink - watches him with amused curiosity.\nKlute spots entrance to stairway.\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nKlute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber\nloft. He slips inside. He hears THE SOUNDS OF THE\nBEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact\nsounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted,\nundramatic). He maneuvers through lanes of\ngarments, trying to gain a line of sight. He\nunderstands what's going on, strains to intervene,\nbut can't disclose himself. At a point, he drops to\nhands and knees, slides underneath the garment\nracks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gain\nposition. We intersperse his progress with further\nBree-Cable fragments, as for instance --\n\nFRAGMENT: CABLE, BREE\n\n\t\t\tCABLE\n\tYou're a person of no value, you\n\thave no value --\n\nKLUTE, SHIFTING CLOSER\n\nKlute works his way steadily closer -- under\nsteadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit and\nbeating continue as SOUNDS, O.S. Even close at hand\nthe noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of\nfootsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather than\ndistinct. Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE\nclearly enough to make out words --\n\n\t\t\tCABLE (CONT'D)\n\t-- Is that contempt? Is it?\n\t\t(then)\n\tNo, I'm the one who feels contempt.\n\n-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree.\n\nKlute tries to gain aim --\n\nP.O.V. TO BREE, CABLE\n\n-- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are\ntoo steadily in motion.\n\nKLUTE\n\nKlute moves on -- moves on -- gains position --\nsprings.\n\nCABLE\n\nCable catches the sound, whirls, screams --\n\nP.O.V. TO KLUTE\n\nKlute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol \n- contends for it again, knocks it loose again.\nEFFECT -- under -- SIRENS.\n\nCABLE, KLUTE\n\nCable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another\nstep -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against\none of the windows, exploding it outward with him,\nboth frame and glass.\n\nEXT. WIDE SHOT: BUILDINGS - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nWe see the body tracing its quick path down the\ndark side of the building.\n\nEXT. DOWNSHOT FROM LOFT TO STREET (KLUTE'S P.O.V.) -\nDAY (NIGHT)\n\nEXT. BASE OF BUILDING: CABLE'S BODY - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nThe sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER.\n\nINT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE, BREE - DAY (NIGHT)\n\nKlute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree\nkneels on the floor. He hunkers down.\nIn a gentle-enough VOICE, but matter-of-factly\nwithal -- as if to a child --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tCome on.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tCome on.\n\n(Note: also shoot in MSL, without dialogue, with\nSIRENS O.S. full up.) Then we CUT TO --\n\nINT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nKLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as\nhe carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds\nit into his suitcase on the table. We hear the\nfamiliar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He\nlets her in, keeps on about his business. His\nexpression is sober; hers is quite tentative.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tHi.\n\nHe doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in,\nsits on the table, swings her heels, watches him\npack. His arm impairs him. At length --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tI got a call from Ross this\n\tmorning. Cable owned a plot of\n\twoodland -- he'd go there on\n\tweekends. They found Tom\n\tGrunemann's body buried there.\n\tThey've notified his wife.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh.\n\t\t(pause; then sharply --)\n\tWell it wasn't us city people that\n\tdid it -- your fine rosy-cheeked\n\tcountry boy.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tMm.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tYou're going back?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE\n\tMm.\n\nPause. She compresses her lips, slips down from the\ntable, starts smartly out of the room.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\tWait.\n\nShe returns and sits on the table again, waits. But\nKlute doesn't seem about to say anything more --\ngoes on packing.\n\n\t\t\tBREE \n\tWell suppose I hadn't come\n\tdownstairs. Would you just have\n\tfolded up and sneaked away?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\t\t(slowly)\n\tNo. I was going to come up. I\n\twanted to ask you to marry me.\n\t\t(pause)\n\n\t\t\tBREE \n\tYou wanted to, or you are?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\tI am.\n\n\t\t\tBREE \n\tYou could at least look at me!\n\nHe complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie.\nBut now she finds she has to look away. Somewhat\nbrokenly --\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tLook -- yes. I mean thanks, but --\n\tdon't you think we better be\n\trealistic?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\tAbout what?\n\n\t\t\tBREE \n\tLook at me. I'm pretty and sort of\n\tclever and very well intentioned,\n\tand dear God I'd tear your heart\n\tout!\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\tI don't think so.\n\nHe resumes packing, continues through the\nfollowing.\n\n\t\t\tBREE \n\tHow can you not think so? You know\n\tthe things I can do.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\t\t(unclearly)\n\tThey don't scare me any more.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\tDoesn't scare me. I think we could\n\thandle it.\n\nThereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on\npacking, as she comes at the thing from various\nsharp angles. \n\n\t\t\tBREE \n\tPlease, I'm a city person. I'm sure\n\tit's just as good as here but I'm a\n\tcity person, that's all, I am!\n\t\t(pause)\n\tHell I know what it's like.

I'm\n\thonestly, honestly just --\n\nHe has almost finished packing -- returns toward\nthe suitcase with the tin CLOCK and electric FAN,\ntries to fit them in as conversation continues.\n\n\t\t\tBREE (CONT'D)\n\tLook, why should it be yes or no?\n\tCan't we keep it going and see? I\n\tmean we can keep in touch and visit\n\teach other and see. People do that,\n\tthat's realistic.\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\tOK.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\t\t(bitterly)\n\tYou don't believe that either, do\n\tyou? Why can't you see my side?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\tCan you use these?\n\nHe sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY\nTICKING clock. She holds it in her lap, numbly.\nHe's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving in\ngood order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it\nstiffly down from the table. She remains sitting.\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tCan I carry something for you, to\n\tthe car?\n\t\t(he shakes his head)\n\tWill you kiss me?\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE \n\tNo. I'm sore.\n\nHe moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles --\n\n\t\t\tKLUTE (CONT'D)\n\tWell --\n\nShe smiles back. He goes. We hear the entryway door\nopening and closing.\n\nShe slips down off the table. We CUT TO --\n\nEXT STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY\n\nKlute is, let's say, about seventy feet on his way\nwhen she appears at the front door, calls after\nhim.\n\n\t\t\tBREE \n\tHey.\n\nHe turns around and stops. He walks slowly back to\nher.\n\nCLOSER: BREE, KLUTE\n\nHe arrives in proximity to her. Then the following\nevents in more or less the following order:\n\nHe looks at her inquiringly. She responds by\nsitting down, plunk, on the grubby front step of\nthe Brownstone.\n\nHaving stood for some time -- during which she has\noffered only twitching motions of her hands -- he\nsets down the suitcase.\n\nHaving set down the suitcase, but derived no\nanswer, he reaches out one arm, and leans against\nthe building front.\n\nShe nearly arrives at the level of statement.\nFretfully, indecisively --\n\n\t\t\tBREE\n\tOh heck --\n\t\t(pause)\n\tOh heck --\n\nThen, as a man not to be dallied with, he picks up\nthe suitcase again. She looks at him strickenly,\nbut it doesn't precipitate her into speech.\n\nHe puts it down again.\n\nAnd then -- then, after all, goddamit, he reaches\nout, grabs her wrist, and simply hauls her along,\nsuitcase in one hand, Bree in the other.
