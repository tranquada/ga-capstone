XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE)\n\n          Window, very small in the distance, illuminated.\n\n          All around this is an almost totally black screen.  Now, as \n          the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a \n          postage stamp in the frame, other forms appear; barbed wire, \n          cyclone fencing, and now, looming up against an early morning \n          sky, enormous iron grille work.  Camera travels up what is now \n          shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on the \n          top of it - a huge initial \"K\" showing darker and darker against \n          the dawn sky.  Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale \n          mountaintop of Xanadu, the great castle a sillhouette as its \n          summit, the little window a distant accent in the darkness.\n\n                                     \n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          A SERIES OF SET -UPS, EACH CLOSER TO THE GREAT WINDOW, ALL \n          TELLING SOMETHING OF: \n\n          The literally incredible domain of CHARLES FOSTER KANE.\n\n          Its right flank resting for nearly forty miles on the Gulf \n          Coast, it truly extends in all directions farther than the eye \n          can see.  Designed by nature to be almost completely bare and \n          flat - it was, as will develop, practically all marshland when \n          Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly \n          uneven, with its fair share of rolling hills and one very good-\n          sized mountain, all man-made.  Almost all the land is improved, \n          either through cultivation for farming purposes of through \n          careful landscaping, in the shape of parks and lakes.  The \n          castle dominates itself, an enormous pile, compounded of several \n          genuine castles, of European origin, of varying architecture - \n          dominates the scene, from the very peak of the mountain.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          GOLF LINKS (MINIATURE)\n\n          Past which we move.  The greens are straggly and overgrown, \n          the fairways wild with tropical weeds, the links unused and \n          not seriously tended for a long time.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE IN:\n\n          WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE)\n\n          Of the Hagenbeck type.  All that now remains, with one \n          exception, are the individual plots, surrounded by moats, on \n          which the animals are kept, free and yet safe from each other \n          and the landscape at large.  (Signs on several of the plots \n          indicate that here there were once tigers, lions, girrafes.)\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          THE MONKEY TERRACE (MINIATURE)\n\n          In the foreground, a great obscene ape is outlined against the \n          dawn murk.  He is scratching himself slowly, thoughtfully, \n          looking out across the estates of Charles Foster Kane, to the \n          distant light glowing in the castle on the hill.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          THE ALLIGATOR PIT (MINIATURE)\n\n          The idiot pile of sleepy dragons.  Reflected in the muddy water - \n          the lighted window.\n\n          THE LAGOON (MINIATURE)\n\n          The boat landing sags.  An old newspaper floats on the surface \n          of the water - a copy of the New York Enquirer.\"  As it moves \n          across the frame, it discloses again the reflection of the \n          window in the castle, closer than before.\n\n          THE GREAT SWIMMING POOL (MINIATURE)\n\n          It is empty.  A newspaper blows across the cracked floor of \n          the tank.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          THE COTTAGES (MINIATURE)\n\n          In the shadows, literally the shadows, of the castle.  As we \n          move by, we see that their doors and windows are boarded up \n          and locked, with heavy bars as further protection and sealing.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE IN:\n\n          A DRAWBRIDGE (MINIATURE)\n\n          Over a wide moat, now stagnant and choked with weeds.  We move \n          across it and through a huge solid gateway into a formal garden, \n          perhaps thirty yards wide and one hundred yards deep, which \n          extends right up to the very wall of the castle.  The \n          landscaping surrounding it has been sloppy and causal for a \n          long time, but this particular garden has been kept up in \n          perfect shape.  As the camera makes its way through it, towards \n          the lighted window of the castle, there are revealed rare and \n          exotic blooms of all kinds.  The dominating note is one of \n          almost exaggerated tropical lushness, hanging limp and \n          despairing.  Moss, moss, moss.  Ankor Wat, the night the last \n          King died.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          THE WINDOW (MINIATURE)\n\n          Camera moves in until the frame of the window fills the frame \n          of the screen.  Suddenly, the light within goes out.  This \n          stops the action of the camera and cuts the music which has \n          been accompanying the sequence.  In the glass panes of the \n          window, we see reflected the ripe, dreary landscape of Mr. \n          Kane's estate behind and the dawn sky.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN -\n\n          A very long shot of Kane's enormous bed, silhouetted against \n          the enormous window.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          INT. KANE'S BEDROOM - FAINT DAWN - SNOW SCENE.  \n\n          An incredible one.  Big, impossible flakes of snow, a too \n          picturesque farmhouse and a snow man.  The jingling of sleigh \n          bells in the musical score now makes an ironic reference to \n          Indian Temple bells - the music freezes -\n\n           \n\n                                    KANE'S OLD OLD VOICE\n                        Rosebud...\n\n          The camera pulls back, showing the whole scene to be contained \n          in one of those glass balls which are sold in novelty stores \n          all over the world.  A hand - Kane's hand, which has been \n          holding the ball, relaxes.  The ball falls out of his hand and \n          bounds down two carpeted steps leading to the bed, the camera \n          following.  The ball falls off the last step onto the marble \n          floor where it breaks, the fragments glittering in the first \n          rays of the morning sun.  This ray cuts an angular pattern \n          across the floor, suddenly crossed with a thousand bars of \n          light as the blinds are pulled across the window.\n\n          The foot of Kane's bed.  The camera very close.  Outlined \n          against the shuttered window, we can see a form - the form of \n          a nurse, as she pulls the sheet up over his head.  The camera \n          follows this action up the length of the bed and arrives at \n          the face after the sheet has covered it.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n          FADE IN:\n\n          INT.

Then there is lightning which reveals \n          a squalid roof-top on which the sign stands.  Thunder again, \n          and faintly the sound of music from within.  A light glows \n          from a skylight.  The camera moves to this and closes in.  \n          Through the splashes of rain, we see through the skylight down \n          into the interior of the cabaret.  Directly below us at a table \n          sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          INT. \"EL RANCO\" CABARET - NIGHT -\n\n          Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink \n          she started to take above.

THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -\n\n          An excruciatingly noble interpretation of Mr. Thatcher himself \n          executed in expensive marble.  He is shown seated on one of \n          those improbable Edwin Booth chairs and is looking down, his \n          stone eyes fixed on the camera.\n\n          We move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on \n          which the monument is founded.  The words, \"Walter Parks \n          Thatcher\" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon.  \n          Immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium \n          shot, the person of Bertha Anderson, an elderly, manish \n          spinnster, seated behind her desk.  Thompson, his hat in his \n          hand, is standing before her.  Bertha is on the phone.\n\n                                    BERTHA\n                               (into phone)\n                        Yes.

THE VAULT ROOM - THATCHER MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY -\n\n          A room with all the warmth and charm of Napolean's tomb.\n\n          As we dissolve in, the door opens in and we see past Thompson's \n          shoulders the length of the room.  Everything very plain, very \n          much made out of marble and very gloomy.  Illumination from a \n          skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and \n          classical despair.  The floor is marble, and there is a \n          gigantic, mahogany table in the center of everything.  Beyond \n          this is to be seen, sunk in the marble wall at the far end of \n          the room, the safe from which a guard, in a khaki uniform, \n          with a revolver holster at his hip, is extracting the journal \n          of Walter P. Thatcher.  He brings it to Bertha as if he were \n          the guardian of a bullion shipment.  During this, Bertha has \n          been speaking.\n\n                                    BERTHA\n                               (to the guard)\n                        Pages eighty-three to one hundred \n                        and forty-two, Jennings.\n\n                                    GUARD\n                        Yes, Miss Anderson.\n\n                                    BERTHA\n                               (to Thompson)\n                        You will confine yourself, it is \n                        our understanding, to the chapter \n                        dealing with Mr. Kane.\n\n                                    THOMPSON\n                        That's all I'm interested in.\n\n          The guard has, by this time, delivered the precious journal.  \n          Bertha places it reverently on the table before Thompson.\n\n                                    BERTHA\n                        You will be required to leave this \n                        room at four-thirty promptly.\n\n          She leaves.  Thompson starts to light a cigarette.  The guard \n          shakes his head.  With a sigh, Thompson bends over to read the \n          manuscript.  Camera moves down over his shoulder onto page of \n          manuscript.\n\n          Manuscript, neatly and precisely written:\n\n          \"CHARLES FOSTER KANE\n\n          WHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT, FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY DEATH, \n          I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY OPINION \n          OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE, ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN COMPLETELY \n          FORGOTTEN, WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY.

Now -\n\n          Camera pulls back, the frame of the window appearing, and we \n          are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse.  Mrs. Kane, aged \n          about 28, is looking out towards her son.  Just as we take her \n          in she speaks:\n\n                                    MRS.

He is 26 and, as \n          might be expected, a very stuffy young man, already very \n          expensive and conservative looking, even in Colorado.\n\n                                    MRS.

We ran it in every paper.\n\n                                    THOMPSON\n                               (after a pause)\n                        I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so \n                        well of Susie's art anyway.\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                               (looks at him very \n                               soberly)\n                        He thought she was great, Mr. \n                        Thompson.  He really believed that.  \n                        He put all his ambition on that \n                        girl.  After she came along, he \n                        never really cared for himself \n                        like he used to.  Oh, I don't\n                        blame Susie -\n\n                                    THOMPSON\n                        Well, then, how could he write \n                        that roast?  The notices in the \n                        Kane papers were always very kind \n                        to her.\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                        Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell \n                        you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard \n                        man to figure out.  He had that \n                        funny sense of humor.  And then, \n                        too, maybe he thought by finishing \n                        that piece he could show Leland he \n                        was an honest man.  You see, Leland \n                        didn't think so.  I guess he showed \n                        him all right.  He's a nice fellow, \n                        but he's a dreamer.  They were \n                        always together in those early \n                        days when we just started the \n                        Enquirer.\n\n          On these last words, we\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -\n\n          The front half of the second floor constitutes one large City \n          Room.  Despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of \n          it is actually getting into the room because the windows are \n          small and narrow.  There are about a dozen tables and desks, \n          of the old-fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters.  \n          Two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, \n          obviously serve the city room executives.  To the left of the \n          platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum.\n\n          As Kane and Leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on \n          the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight \n          occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new \n          arrivals.  Carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises \n          and starts toward them.\n\n                                    CARTER\n                        Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the \n                        \"Enquirer.\"  I am Herbert Carter.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Thank you, Mr Carter.

Except to get out a newspaper.\n\n          There is a terrific crash at the doorway.  They all turn to \n          see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance.  A roll of bedding, a \n          suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Oh, Mr. Bernstein!\n\n          Bernstein looks up.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        If you would come here a moment,\n                        please, Mr. Bernstein?\n\n          Bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.\n                        Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.\n\n                                    CARTER\n                               (frigidly)\n                        How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?\n\n                                    KANE\n                        You've got a private office here, \n                        haven't you?\n\n          The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance \n          with parts of the bedstead and other furniture.

KANE'S OFFICE - LATE DAY -\n\n          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll-top desk in the Sanctum, \n          is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal \n          at the same time.  Carter, still formally coated, is seated \n          alongside him.  Leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, \n          detached, amused.  The furniture has been pushed around and \n          Kane's effects are somewhat in place.  On a corner of the desk, \n          Bernstein is writing down figures.

They \n          both stand looking out.  Leland joins him on the other side.  \n          Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky.  Leland's \n          head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - \n          camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their \n          eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.  \n          Bernstein is still smoking a cigar.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          Front page of the \"Enquirer\" shows big boxed editorial with \n          heading:\n\n          MY PRINCIPLES - A DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE\n\n          Camera continues pulling back and shows newspaper to be on the \n          top of a pile of newspapers.  As we draw further back, we see \n          four piles, and as camera contines to pull back, we see six \n          piles and go on back until we see a big field of \"Enquirers\" - \n          piles of \"Enquirers\" - all 26,000 copies ready for distribution.\n\n          A wagon with a huge sign on its side reading\n\n          \"ENQUIRER - CIRCULATION 26,000\"\n\n          passes through foreground, and we wipe to:\n\n          A pile of \"Enquirers\" for sale on a broken down wooden box on \n          a street corner, obviously a poor district.  A couple of coins \n          fall on the pile.\n\n          The stoop of a period door with old-fashioned enamel milk can \n          and a bag of rolls.  Across the sidewalk before this, moves \n          the shadow of an old-fashioned bicycle with an enormous front \n          wheel.  A copy of the \"Enquirer\" is tossed on the stoop.\n\n          A breakfast table - beautiful linen and beautiful silver - \n          everything very expensive, gleaming in the sunshine.  Into a \n          silver newspaper rack there is slipped a copy of the \"Enquirer\".  \n          Here, as before, the boxed editorial reading MY PRINCIPLES - A \n          DECLARATION BY CHARLES FOSTER KANE, is very prominent on the \n          front page.\n\n          The wooden floor of a railroad station, flashing light and \n          dark as a train behind the camera rushes by.  On the floor, \n          there is tossed a bound bundle of the \"New York Enquirer\" - \n          the Declaration of Principles still prominent.\n\n          Rural Delivery - a copy of the \"Enquirer\"s being put into bins, \n          showing state distribution.\n\n          The railroad platform again.  We stay here for four images.  \n          On each image, the speed of the train is faster and the piles \n          of the \"Enquirer\" are larger.  On the first image, we move in \n          to hold on the words \"CIRCULATION - 31,000.\"  We are this close \n          for the next pile which reads 40,000; the next one which reads \n          55,000, and the last which is 62,000.  In each instance, the \n          bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the moving \n          train behind the camera is increased.\n\n          The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a \n          descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New \n          York in the 1890's; wheels on cobblestones and horses' hooves; \n          bicycle bells; the mooning of cattle and the crowing of roosters \n          (in the RFD shot), and in all cases where the railroad platform \n          is used - the mounting sound of the railroad train.\n\n          The last figure \"62,000\" opposite the word \"CIRCULATION\" on \n          the \"Enquirer\" masthead changes to:\n\n          EXT. STREET AND CHRONICLE BUIDING - DAY -\n\n          Angle up to wall of building - a painter on a cradle is putting \n          the last zero to the figure \"62,000\" on an enormous sign \n          advertising the \"Enquirer.\"  It reads:\n\n          THE ENQUIRER  THE PEOPLE'S NEWSPAPER  CIRCULATION 62,000\n\n          Camera travels down side of building - takes in another building \n          on which there is a sign which reads:\n\n          READ THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  CIRCULATION 62,000\n\n          Camera continues to travel down to sidewalk in front of the \n          Chronicle office.  The Chronicle office has a plateglass window \n          in which is reflected traffic moving up and down the street, \n          also the figures of Kane, Leland and Bernstein, who are munching \n          peanuts.\n\n          Inside the window, almost filling it, is a large photograph of \n          the \"Chronicle\" staff, with Reilly prominently seated in the \n          center.  A sign over the photo reads: EDITORIAL AND EXECUTIVE \n          STAFF OF THE NEW YORK CHRONICLE.  A sign beneath it reads: \n          GREATEST NEWSPAPER STAFF IN THE WORLD.  The sign also includes \n          the \"Chronicle\" circulation figure.

A band strikes up a lively ditty \n          of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very \n          magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the \n          chorus costumes of the day.  The rest of this episode will be \n          planned and staged later.  Its essence is that Kane is just a \n          healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time.\n\n          As some of the girls are detached from the line and made into \n          partners for individual dancing -\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n          DISSOLVE IN:\n\n          THE \"ENQUIRER\" SIGN:  THE ENQUIRER  AMERICA'S FINEST  \n          CIRCULATION 274,321\n\n          Dissolve just completes itself - the image of Kane dancing \n          with a girl on each arm just disappears as camera pans down \n          off the Temple Bldg. in the same action as the previous street \n          scene.  There is a new sign on the side of the building below.  \n          It reads:\n\n          READ THE ENQUIRER GREATEST STAFF IN THE WORLD\n\n          Camera continues panning as we\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          A montage of various scenes, between the years 1891-1900.\n\n          The scenes indicate the growth of the \"Enquirer\" under the \n          impulse of Kane's personal drive.  Kane is shown, thus, at \n          various activities:\n\n          Move down from the sign: READ THE ENQUIRER  GREATEST STAFF IN \n          THE WORLD to street in front of saloon with parade passing \n          (boys going off to the Spanish-American War)-  A torchlight \n          parade with the torches reflected in the glass window of the \n          saloon - the sound of brass band playing \"It's a Hot Time.\"  \n          In the window of the saloon is a large sign or poster \"REMEMBER \n          THE MAINE\"\n\n          INSERT:  Remington drawing of American boys, similar to the \n          parade above, in which \"Our Boys\" in the expeditionary hats \n          are seen marching off to war.\n\n          Back of observation car.

A reproduction of \n          Kane and Teddy shaking hands as above is very prominent in the \n          frame and almost hogs the entire front page.

A number of elderly swells are jammed \n          into a hallway.

We see, among others, \n          Mr. Thatcher himself (as Ben Hur) ribbon around, his bald head \n          and all.  At the conclusion of this tableau, the image freezes \n          and we pull back to show it reproduced on the society page of \n          the \"New York Enquirer.\"\n\n          Over the \"Enquirer\"'s pictorial version of the Beaux Art Ball \n          is thrown a huge fish - then coffee grounds - altogether a \n          pretty repulsive sight.\n\n          The whole thing is bundled up and thrown into a garbage can.\n\n          Extreme close-up of the words: \"OCCUPATION - JOUNALIST.\"\n\n          Camera pulls back to show passport open to the photograph page \n          which shows Kane, registering birth, race, and nationality.  \n          Passport cover is closed, showing it to be an American passport.\n\n          EXT.

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AT BERNSTEIN'S DESK - NIGHT\n\n          The light in the window in the former shot was showing behind \n          the letter \"E\" of the Enquirer sign.  Now the letter \"E\" is \n          even larger than the frame of the camera.  Rain drips \n          disconsolately off the middle part of the figure.  We see \n          through this and through the drizzle of the window to \n          Bernstein's desk where he sits working under a blue shaded \n          light.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n          DISSOLVE IN:\n\n          Same setup as before except that it is now late afternoon and \n          late in the winter of the year.  The outline \"E\" is hung with \n          icicles which are melting, dripping despairingly between us \n          and Mr. Bernstein, still seated at his desk - still working.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          Same setup as before except that it is spring.  Instead of the \n          sad sounds of dripping rain or dripping icicles, we hear the \n          melancholy cry of a hurdy-gurdy in the street below.  It is \n          spring and through the letter \"E\" we can see Bernstein working \n          at his desk.  Pigeons are gathering on the \"E\" and on the sill.  \n          Bernstein looks up and sees them.  He takes some crumbs from \n          his little homemade lunch which is spread out on the desk before \n          him, carries them to the windows and feeds the pigeons, looking \n          moodily out on the prospect of spring on Park Row.  The birds \n          eat the crumbs - the hurdy-gurdy continues to play.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          The same setup again, it is now summer.  The window was half-\n          open before .. now it's open all the way and Bernstein has \n          gone so far as to take off his coat.  His shirt and his \n          celluloid collar are wringing wet.  Camera moves toward the \n          window to tighten on Bernstein and to take in the City Room \n          behind him, which is absolutely deserted.  It is clear that \n          there is almost nothing more for Bernstein to do.  The hurdy-\n          gurdy in the street is playing as before, but a new tune.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          A beach on Coney Island.\n\n          Bernstein in a rented period bathing suit sits alone in the \n          sand, reading a copy of the \"Enquirer.\"\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n          DISSOLVE IN:\n\n          INT. CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -\n\n          The whole floor is now a City Room.  It is twice its former \n          size, yet not too large for all the desks and the people using \n          them.  The windows have been enlarged, providing a good deal \n          more light and air.  A wall calendar says September 9th.\n\n          Kane and Bernstein enter and stand in the entrance a moment.  \n          Kane, who really did look a bit peaked before, is now clear-\n          eyed and tanned.  He is wearing new English clothes.  As they \n          come into the room, Bernstein practically walking sideways, is \n          doing nothing but beaming and admiring Kane, quelling like a \n          mother at the Carnegie Hall debut of her son.  Seeing and \n          recognizing Kane, the entire staff rises to its feet.\n\n                                    KANE\n                               (referring to the \n                               staff; with a smile)\n                        Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                        Sit down, everybody - for heaven's \n                        sake!\n\n          The order is immediately obeyed, everybody going into business \n          of feverish activity.\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                        So then, tonight, we go over \n                        everything thoroughly, eh?  \n                        Especially the new papers -\n\n                                    KANE\n                        We certainly do.

The Society Editor, a middle-aged spinster, sees him \n          approaching and starts to quake all over, but tries to pretend \n          she isn't aware of him.  An envelope in her hand shakes \n          violently.  Kane and Bernstein stop at her desk.\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                        Miss Townsend -\n\n          Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein \n          with a stranger.\n\n                                    MISS TOWNSEND\n                        Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                        This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.\n\n          Miss Townsend can't stick to her plan.  She starts to rise, \n          but her legs are none too good under her.  She knocks over a \n          tray of copy paper as she rises, and bends to pick it up.\n\n                                    KANE\n                               (very hesitatingly \n                               and very softly)\n                        Miss Townsend -\n\n          At the sound of his voice, she straightens up.  She is very \n          close to death from excitement.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        I've been away for several months, \n                        and I don't know exactly how these \n                        things are handled now.  But one \n                        thing I wanted to be sure of is \n                        that you won't treat this little \n                        announcement any differently than \n                        you would any other similar \n                        announcement.\n\n          He hands her an envelope.  She has difficulty in holding on to \n          it.\n\n                                    KANE\n                               (gently)\n                        Read it, Miss Townsend.

Bernstein looks after him, then at the paper.  \n          Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope.  A piece \n          of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.\n\n                                    MISS TOWNSEND\n                               (reading)\n                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton \n                        announce the engagement of their \n                        daughter, Emily Monroe Norton, to \n                        Mr.  Charles Foster Kane.\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                               (starts to read it)\n                        Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Moore Norton\n                        announce -\n\n                                    MISS TOWNSEND\n                               (fluttering - on \n                               top of him)\n                        She's - she's the niece of - of \n                        the President of the United States -\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                               (nodding proudly)\n                        know.

He kisses her full on \n          the lips before he sits down.  She acts a bit taken aback, \n          because of the public nature of the scene, but she isn't really \n          annoyed.  As the barouche starts off, she is looking at him \n          adoringly.  He, however, has turned his head and is looking \n          adoringly at the \"Enquirer.\"  He apparently sees Bernstein and \n          Miss Townsed and waves his hand.\n\n          INT.

That \n                        was because he had the power to \n                        express them, and Charlie lived on \n                        power and the excitement of using \n                        it -  But he didn't believe in\n                        anything except Charlie Kane.

CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - SET FOR \"THAIS\" -\n\n          The camera is just inside the curtain, angling upstage.  We \n          see the set for \"Thais\" - the principals in place - stage \n          managers, stage hands, etc., and in the center of all this, in \n          an elaborate costume, looking very small and very lost, is \n          Susan.  She is almost hysterical with fright.  Maids, singing \n          teacher, and the rest are in attendance.  Her throat is sprayed.  \n          Applause is heard at the opening of the shot, and now the \n          orchestra starts thunderously.  The curtain starts to rise -\n          the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up \n          Susan's body and hits her face.  She squints and starts to \n          sing.  Camera continues on up with the curtain, up past Susan, \n          up the full height of the proscenium arch and then on up into \n          the gridiron into a world of ropes, brick walls and hanging \n          canvas - Susan's voice still heard - but faintly.  The camera \n          stops at the top of the gridiron as the curtain stops.  Two \n          typical stage hands fill the frame.  They are looking down on \n          the stage below.  Some of the reflected light gleams on their \n          faces.  They look at each other.  One of them puts his hand to \n          his nose.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n          DISSOLVE IN:\n\n          INT. LELAND'S OFFICE - CHICAGO ENQUIRER - NIGHT -\n\n          Leland, as in the same scene in the Bernstein sequence, is \n          sprawled across his typewriter, his head on the keys.  The \n          paper is gone from the roller.  Leland stirs and looks up \n          drunkenly, his eyes encountering Bernstein, who stands beside \n          him (also as in the previous scene).\n\n                                    BERNSTEIN\n                        Hello, Mr. Leland.\n\n                                    LELAND\n                        Hello, Bernstein.\n\n          Leland makes a terrific effort to pull himself together.

Leland's eyes follow the sound.  Slowly he \n          registers Kane in the City Room beyond.  This is almost the \n          same shot as in the previous Bernstein story.\n\n          INT.

It's about 8 o'clock \n          at night.  With a large, man-sized handkerchief pressed to her \n          cheek, she is in considerable pain.  The street is wet - after \n          a recent rain.\n\n          She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can \n          stand it no longer.  She stops, opens a bottle of Oil of Cloves \n          that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs \n          her gums.\n\n          She walks on, the pain only a bit better.  Four or five houses \n          farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway - \n          a shabby, old four-story apartment house.  She turns toward \n          the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps.\n\n          As she does so, Kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost \n          bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her.  His shoulder \n          bumps hers and she turns.  As she does so, Kane, forced to \n          change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which \n          covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk.  The plank rises up and \n          cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.\n\n                                    KANE\n                               (hopping up and \n                               down and rubbing \n                               his knee)\n                        Ow!\n\n          Susan, taking her handkerchief from her jaw, roars with \n          laughter.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        It's not funny.\n\n          He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.

SUSAN'S ROOM - NIGHT -\n\n          It's in moderate disorder.  The Mansbach gas lights are on.  \n          It's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're \n          entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast.\n\n          There is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few \n          personal belongings on the chiffonier.  These include a \n          photograph of a gent and lady, obviously Susan's parents, and \n          a few objets d'art.  One, \"At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game \n          at Coney Island,\" and - perhaps this is part of the Japanese \n          loot - the glass globe with the snow scene Kane was holding in \n          his hand in the first sequence.\n\n          Susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over \n          her arm.  Kane is waiting for her.  She doesn't close the door.\n\n                                    SUSAN\n                               (by way of \n                               explanation)\n                        My landlady prefers me to keep \n                        this door open when I have a \n                        gentleman caller.\n                               (starts to put the \n                               basin down)\n                        She's a very decent woman.\n                               (making a face)\n                        Ow!\n\n          Kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the \n          chiffonier.  To do this, he has to shove the photograph to one \n          side of the basin.  Susan grabs the photograph as it is about \n          to fall over.\n\n                                    SUSAN\n                        Hey, you should be more careful.\n                        That's my ma and pa.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        I'm sorry.

It is slippery, however, \n          and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it \n          falls to the floor.  Susan laughs as he bends over.\n\n                                    KANE\n                               (starting to wash \n                               his hands)\n                        You're very easily amused.\n\n                                    SUSAN\n                        I always like to see the funny \n                        side of things.

Looking at you, I forget \n                        all about my toothache.\n\n          Her face distorts in pain again.\n\n                                    SUSAN\n                        Oh!\n\n                                    KANE\n                        I can't stay here all night chasing \n                        your pain away.\n\n                                    SUSAN\n                               (laughs)\n                        I know...  But you do look so silly.\n\n          Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot \n          open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Where's the towel?\n\n                                    SUSAN\n                        On the chiffonier.

The curtain is down.  We see the same tableau as \n          before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive \n          principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.  \n          As the dissolve commences, there is the sound of applause \n          (exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes itself, \n          the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of the \n          music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone, terribly \n          alone.  The curtain rises.  The glare of the footlights jump \n          into the image.  The curtain is now out of the picture and \n          Susan starts to sing.  Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, \n          containing the anxious face of the prompter.  Beyond that, out \n          in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with his \n          task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer.  \n          Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms \n          for a couple of rows, and then deep and terrible darkness.\n\n          Closeup of Kane's face - seated in the audience - listening.\n\n          Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a voice \n          from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind of \n          thing that often happens in a theatre -\n\n                                    THE VOICE\n                        - really pathetic.\n\n          Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence, but \n          hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well as \n          Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume.\n\n          Closeup of Susan's face - singing.\n\n          Closeup of Kane's face - listening.\n\n          There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people applauding \n          as little as possible.  Kane still looks.  Then, near the \n          camera, there is the sound of about a dozen people applauding \n          very, very loudly.  Camera moves back, revealing Bernstein and \n          Reilly and other Kane stooges, seated around him, beating their \n          palms together.  The curtain is falling - as we can see by the \n          light which shutters down off their faces.\n\n          The stage from Kane's angle.\n\n          The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it.  Still, the \n          polite applause dying fast.  Nobody comes out for a bow.\n\n          Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily.  Suddenly he starts to \n          applaud furiously.\n\n          The stage from the audience again.\n\n          Susan appears for her bow.  She can hardly walk.  There is a \n          little polite crescendo of applause, but it is sickly.\n\n          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard, his eyes \n          on Susan.\n\n          The stage again.\n\n          Susan, finishing her bow, goes out through the curtains.  The \n          light on the curtain goes out and the houselights go on.\n\n          Closeup of Kane - still applauding very, very hard.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          INT.

He pushes open a door.  \n          At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a wireless \n          operator named Fred.

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU - NIGHT -\n\n          The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near \n          the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.  From inside \n          can be heard a terrible banging and crashing.  Raymond hurries \n          into scene, opens the door and goes in.\n\n          INT. SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -\n\n          Kane, in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage, is \n          literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures, hooks and \n          all off the wall, smashing them to bits - ugly, gaudy pictures - \n          Susie's pictures in Susie's bad taste.  Off of occasional \n          tables, bureaus, he sweeps Susie's whorish accumulation of \n          bric-a-brac.\n\n          Raymond stands in the doorway watching him.  Kane says nothing.  \n          He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength, \n          still wordlessly, tearing the room to bits.  The curtains (too \n          frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a single \n          gesture, and from the bookshelves he pulls down double armloads \n          of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor and \n          dashes it across the room.  Finally he stops.  Susie's cozy \n          little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him.\n\n          He stands for a minute breathing heavily, and his eye lights \n          on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his notice.  \n          Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with \n          the snowstorm in it.  He yanks it down.  Something made of \n          china breaks, but not the glass ball.  It bounces on the carpet \n          and rolls to his feet, the snow in a flurry.  His eye follows \n          it.  He stoops to pick it up - can't make it.  Raymond picks \n          it up for him; hands it to him.  Kane takes it sheepishly - \n          looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the corridor.\n\n          INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSAN'S BEDROOM - XANADU -\n\n          Kane comes out of the door.  Mrs. Tinsdall has been joined now \n          by a fairly sizable turnout of servants.  They move back away \n          from Kane, staring at him.  Raymond is in the doorway behind \n          Kane.  Kane looks at the glass ball.\n\n                                    KANE\n                               (without turning)\n                        Close the door, Raymond.\n\n                                    RAYMOND\n                        Yes, sir.\n                               (he closes it)\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Lock it - and keep it locked.\n\n          Raymond locks the door and comes to his side.  There is a long \n          pause - servants staring in silence.  Kane gives the glass \n          ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Raymond -\n                               (he is almost in a \n                               trance)\n\n                                    RAYMOND\n                        Yes, sir -\n\n          One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up.  Kane \n          shakes the ball again.  Another flurry of snow.  He watches \n          the flakes settle - then looks up.  Finally, taking in the \n          pack of servants and something of the situations, he puts the \n          glass ball in his coat pocket.  He speaks very quietly to \n          Raymond, so quietly it only seems he's talking to himself.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Keep it locked.\n\n          He slowly walks off down the corridor, the servants giving way \n          to let him pass, and watching him as he goes.  He is an old, \n          old man!\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          INT. KANE'S CHAPEL - XANADU - LATE AFTERNOON -\n\n          As the dissolve completes itself, camera is travellling across \n          the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kane's father and \n          mother - (marked: James Kane - 18- TO 19-; Mary Kane - 18- TO \n          19-;) - past a blank crypt, and then holding on the burial of \n          Kane's son.  A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes \n          are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt.  \n          Kane stands nearby with Raymond, looking on.  The men strain \n          and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor.  The men now \n          place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words:\n\n          CHARLES FOSTER KANE II.\n\n          1907 - 1938\n\n                                    ONE OF THE WORKMEN\n                        Sorry, Mr. Kane, we won't be able\n                        to cement it till tommorrow.

Kane \n          raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall.  It is \n          a little to one side of Junior's grave, directly over the blank \n          place which will be occupied by Kane himself.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Do you like poetry, Raymond?\n\n                                    RAYMOND\n                        Can't say, sir.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Mrs. Kane liked poetry -\n\n          Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone \n          indeed - not to say off his trolley.\n\n                                    RAYMOND\n                        Yes, Mr. Kane.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Not my wife - not either of them.\n\n          He looks at the grave next to his son's - the grave marked \n          \"MARY KANE.\"\n\n                                    RAYMOND\n                               (catching on)\n                        Oh, yes, sir.\n\n                                    KANE\n                               (looking back up at \n                               the wall)\n                        Do you know what that is?\n\n                                    RAYMOND\n                               (more his keeper \n                               than his butler \n                               now)\n                        It's a wall you bought in China, \n                        Mr. Kane.\n\n                                    KANE\n                        Persia.

THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -\n\n          The magnificent tapestries, candelabra, etc., are still there, \n          but now several large packing cases are piled against the walls, \n          some broken open, some shut and a number of objects, great and \n          small, are piled pell mell all over the place.

Somewhere in the back, one of the vast Gothic windows \n          of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the scene, \n          rustling the papers.\n\n          In the center of the hall, a Photographer and his Assistant \n          are busy photographing the sundry objects.

He was the most honest \n                        man who ever lived, with a streak \n                        of crookedness a yard wide.  He \n                        was a liberal and a reactionary; \n                        he was tolerant - \"Live and Let \n                        Live\" - that was his motto.  But \n                        he had no use for anybody who \n                        disagreed with him on any point, \n                        no matter how small it was.  He \n                        was a loving husband and a good \n                        father - and both his wives left \n                        him and his son got himself killed \n                        about as shabbily as you can do \n                        it.  He had a gift for friendship \n                        such as few men have - he broke \n                        his oldest friend's heart like \n                        you'd throw away a cigarette\n                        you were through with.  Outside of \n                        that -\n\n                                    THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN\n                        Okay, okay.\n\n                                    GIRL\n                        What about Rosebud?  Don't you \n                        think that explains anything?\n\n                                    THOMPSON\n                        No, I don't.  Not much anway.  \n                        Charles Foster Kane was a man who \n                        got everything he wanted, and then \n                        lost it.  Maybe Rosebud was \n                        something he couldn't get or lost.  \n                        No, I don't think it explains\n                        anything.  I don't think any word \n                        explains a man's life.  No -  I \n                        guess Rosebud is just a piece in a \n                        jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece.\n\n          He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his \n          watch.\n\n                                    THOMPSON\n                        We'd better get along.  We'll miss \n                        the train.\n\n          He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little \n          sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit Thatcher \n          with at the opening of the picture.  Camera doesn't close in \n          on this.  It just registers the sled as the newspaper people, \n          picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great \n          hall.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n          INT. CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT -\n\n          A large furnace, with an open door, dominates the scene.  Two \n          laborers, with shovels, are shovelling things into the furnace.  \n          Raymond is about ten feet away.\n\n                                    RAYMOND\n                        Throw that junk in, too.\n\n          Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated.  It is mostly \n          bits of broken packing cases, excelsior, etc.  The sled is on \n          top of the pile.  As camera comes close, it shows the faded \n          rosebud and, though the letters are faded, unmistakably the \n          word \"ROSEBUD\" across it.  The laborer drops his shovel, takes \n          the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace.  The flames \n          start to devour it.\n\n          EXT. XANADU - NIGHT -\n\n          No lights are to be seen.  Smoke is coming from a chimney.\n\n          Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the \n          picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages.  It moves finally \n          through the gates, which close behind it.  As camera pauses \n          for a moment, the letter \"K\" is prominent in the moonlight.\n\n          Just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture \n          the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing.  On the fence \n          is a sign which reads:\n\n          \"PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING\"\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                     THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizen Kane\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Herman J.
