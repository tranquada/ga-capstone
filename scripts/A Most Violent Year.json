It is early morning and still almost\r\n          dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and\r\n          is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with\r\n          his morning jog.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY\r\n</b>                         \r\n          It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck\r\n          sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into\r\n          a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with\r\n          the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug\r\n          boats.\r\n                         \r\n          JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously\r\n          scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in\r\n          the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered\r\n          past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its\r\n          way to the dock in front of the tanker truck.\r\n                         \r\n          JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting\r\n          hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the\r\n          broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to\r\n          the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of\r\n          the head and no words.\r\n                         \r\n          They connect the hose and start a large generator as it\r\n          begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the\r\n          horizon again as the sun begins to come up.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME\r\n</b>                         \r\n          ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is\r\n          freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that\r\n          he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch\r\n          his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the\r\n          neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath\r\n          he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings.\r\n<b>                          3\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA\r\n</b>          The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make\r\n          up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks\r\n          into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT.

He finally approaches the\r\n          toll booth and pays.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          JULIAN\r\n</b>           Good morning.\r\n                         \r\n          JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it\r\n          Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a\r\n          smile.\r\n          He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the\r\n          other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic\r\n          is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we\r\n          see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the\r\n          cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps.\r\n                         \r\n          The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and\r\n          very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He\r\n          shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the\r\n          door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the\r\n          passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing\r\n          masks. It's very brazen.\r\n                         \r\n          Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS\r\n          SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then\r\n          pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway.\r\n                         \r\n          LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with\r\n          the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road\r\n          staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain-\r\n          link gate with a small sign that says \"STANDARD HEATING OIL:\r\n          WE SET THE STANDARD\". The DISPATCHER opens the gate.\r\n<b>                          4\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each\r\n          other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit.\r\n          ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a\r\n          beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a\r\n          streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not\r\n          want to cross this woman.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           Ready?\r\n<b>                          ANNA\r\n</b>           Yes.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           You look very nice.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANNA\r\n</b>           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           You sure?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANNA\r\n</b>           Yes.\r\n                         \r\n          ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large\r\n          empty briefcases.\r\n                         \r\n          He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large,\r\n          unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the\r\n          parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is\r\n          holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands\r\n          them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and\r\n          then both sign the document.\r\n                         \r\n          The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands\r\n          him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with\r\n          cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of\r\n          the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now-\r\n          heavy cases to ABEL.\r\n                         \r\n          ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the\r\n          truck. He turns to ANNA.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Don't do anything stupid.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           We don't have any more money so\r\n           what else could I do.\r\n                         \r\n          She gives a small smile.

He gives a nod\r\n          to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse,\r\n          and he begins to open the front gate.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

He\r\n          looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands\r\n          looking into the neighboring site.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

ANDREW\r\n          is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid\r\n          fifties. He is smart but tired. The oversized briefcase in\r\n          his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture\r\n          that direction. The large oil-holding tanks loom above them.\r\n          The place is rusting and could use some work.\r\n                         \r\n          As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an\r\n          illegal transaction about to go down.\r\n<b>                          ANDREW WALSH\r\n</b>           So how are we this morning?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           (gives a smile and nod)\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANDREW WALSH\r\n</b>           Well I woke up feeling very good\r\n           about this.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           Really?\r\n                         \r\n          They both take a look at their watches.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           You've been telling me not to do\r\n           this for a year.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANDREW WALSH\r\n</b>           Well we are going all in... so now\r\n           I love it.\r\n                         \r\n          Gives him another slight smile.

They\r\n          tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off\r\n          like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being\r\n          inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into\r\n          some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view.\r\n          It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East\r\n          River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the\r\n          true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his\r\n          watch.\r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT. 1981 MERCEDES 500 SEC\r\n</b>                         \r\n          ABEL drives away from New York City.

So with all this\r\n           information that you have gained...\r\n           We are just asking if you have any\r\n           idea who has been doing this to us?\r\n                         \r\n<b>           A.D.A.

The dog finally comes\r\n          down the stairs.\r\n                         \r\n          ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but\r\n          then the dog starts growling again and looking out the\r\n          windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the\r\n          front door but the dog refuses to go out.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Go. Oh come on.

A BURGLAR, in all black, comes\r\n          blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he\r\n          goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the\r\n          shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs\r\n          towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster\r\n          than we expect.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

They stare at each other.\r\n                         \r\n          A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face.

He tries\r\n          to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly\r\n          fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that\r\n          forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN\r\n          to protect THUG #2.

With each bump that the truck goes over the noise\r\n          inside the dumpster is deafening. As the KID comes to his\r\n          senses he tries to stand up. As he does, we see that the\r\n          sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the\r\n          interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on.\r\n          He is trapped.\r\n                         \r\n          Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to\r\n          a stop. It idles for a minute then begins backing up. It\r\n          stops. A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end\r\n          of the dumpster begins rising. As it gets higher and higher\r\n          our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide\r\n          towards the low end. As he does he sees that the end that he\r\n          is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing\r\n          open. Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't\r\n          hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening.\r\n                         \r\n          As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the\r\n          edge of a cliff of some sort. He falls probably 10-12 feet,\r\n          into a pile of garbage. As he gathers himself and tries to\r\n          stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill.

Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he\r\n          looks exhausted.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           Hey.\r\n                         \r\n          She looks up with a small but sweet smile.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANNA\r\n</b>           Hi.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           How's it coming?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANNA\r\n</b>           I've made it to 1975.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           That was a good year.\r\n                         \r\n          ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally\r\n          support that claim.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Well it was for me...how is it?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANNA\r\n</b>           I'm not sure yet... but it's not as\r\n           bad as they are saying it is...\r\n           Turns out I kinda knew what I was\r\n           doing.\r\n                         \r\n          They give each other a slight smile.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           How'd you do?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ABEL\r\n</b>           I got us a three more days... and\r\n           one piece... from Saul.

He does not know how it has come to\r\n          this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across\r\n          deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning.\r\n                         \r\n          As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed\r\n          sections of Queens, he just never stops. With each step his\r\n          fear turns to... anger.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

He starts to almost cry,\r\n          but then it again becomes something else. His survival\r\n          instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become\r\n          of it.

It now turns into a high speed chase as the\r\n          driver steps on it.\r\n                         \r\n          They race down a ramp into a railyard. ABEL chases the truck\r\n          as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned\r\n          tunnel. The truck races into the tunnel and ABEL follows. The\r\n          truck is throwing up a dust storm and ABEL has a difficult\r\n          time seeing where he is going but he keeps up.\r\n                         \r\n          The roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and ABEL'S car\r\n          are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the\r\n          tunnel.\r\n                         \r\n          The light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through\r\n          the dust but we can't see the truck. As ABEL comes into the\r\n          light he has to SLAM on his brakes because the TRUCK has\r\n          flipped over in front of him.\r\n                         \r\n          As he gets out of his car he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO jumping down\r\n          from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard. ABEL\r\n          looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the DRIVER has\r\n          been killed. There is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck\r\n          and ABEL looks and thinks. He then picks up the gun and\r\n          chases after LOUIS SERVIDIO.\r\n                         \r\n          In the distance he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO leave the yard and\r\n          head up into an elevated subway station.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.
