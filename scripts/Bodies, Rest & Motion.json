She adds the \n               wrapped glass to a box.\n\n               She hears the SOUND of a CAR DOOR SLAMMING, looks up, then \n               returns to her packing. She reaches behind herself into the \n               trash, pulls out the blender, and begins to wrap it.\n\n               At the SOUND of the FRONT DOOR opening, followed by a curious \n               METALLIC CLUNKING, she stands and hurries through the swinging \n               door to the living room.\n\n               INT.
