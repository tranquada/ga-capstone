Let's go.\r\n\r\n      Jules pulls Seth away. Evan and Helen start walking in the\r\n      opposite direction.\r\n\r\n      As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back\r\n      and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave.\r\n      A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as\r\n      though they're never going to see each other again.\r\n\r\n      INT.
