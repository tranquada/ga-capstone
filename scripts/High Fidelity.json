Charlie was out of my Class: \n                         too pretty, too smart, too witty, \n                         too much.  What am I?  Average.  A \n                         middleweight.  Not the smartest guy \n                         in the world, but certainly not the \n                         dumbest.  I've read books like The \n                         Unbearable Lightness of Being, \n                         Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time \n                         of Cholera, and understood them, I \n                         think -- they're about girls, right? -- \n                         just kidding -- but I don't like \n                         them very much.  My all time top \n                         five favorite books are Johnny Cash's \n                         autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil \n                         Stevenson, Zen and the Art of \n                         Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser \n                         Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't \n                         know, probably something by Kurt \n                         Vonnegut.  I look through the New \n                         Yorker when my neighbor's done with \n                         it, and I'm not averse to going down \n                         to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles \n                         films, although on the whole I prefer \n                         American films.  Top five being Blade \n                         Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first \n                         two Godfathers which we'll count as \n                         one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.  \n                         I'm okay looking, average height, \n                         not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if \n                         I can call it that, is to combine a \n                         whole load of averageness into one \n                         compact frame.  You might say there \n                         were millions like me, but there \n                         aren't, really: Alot of guys have \n                         impeccable music taste but don't \n                         read, alot of guys read but are really \n                         fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to \n                         women but have stupid beards, alot \n                         of guys have a Woody Allen sense of \n                         humor but look like Woody Allen.  \n                         Some drink too much, some drive like \n                         assholes, some get into fights, or \n                         show off money, or do drugs.  I don't \n                         do any of these things, really.  If \n                         I do okay with women it's not because \n                         of the virtues I have, but because \n                         of the ugly flaws I don't have... \n                         So.  Charlie and I didn't match.  \n                         After her I was determined to never \n                         get out of my league again.\n\n<b>               INT.

From inside he hears a GUITAR, playing a tune \n               that becomes familiar not only to Rob, but to us.  When a \n               strong, lilting female VOICE begins to sing, we hear what it \n               is: \"Baby I Love Your Way,\" by Peter Frampton.\n\n               Rob smiles at first, but begins to darken as the verse \n               continues.

Rob's expression begins to shift from the \n               melancholy to something else altogether.  Marie is beautiful, \n               and Marie has touched his heart.  Rob navigates toward her \n               though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen.

I \n                         didn't know she was pregnant.  Of \n                         course I didn't.  She hadn't told me \n                         because I had told her I was... sort \n                         of... seeing somebody else.  We \n                         thought we were being very grown-up, \n                         but we were being preposterously \n                         naive, childish even, to think that \n                         one of us could fuck around and then \n                         own up to it while we were living \n                         together.  So -- I didn't find out \n                         about it 'til way later.  We were \n                         going through a good period and I \n                         made a crack about having kids and \n                         she burst into tears.  I made her \n                         tell me what it was all about, and \n                         she did.  I felt guilty and so I got \n                         angry.  She told me that at the time \n                         I didn't look like a very good long-\n                         term bet.  That it was a hard decision \n                         and she didn't see any point in \n                         consulting me about it...

You know that, don't \n                         you?  I left because we weren't \n                         exactly getting along, and we weren't \n                         talking about it.  And I suddenly \n                         realized that I like my job, and I \n                         like what my life is could be turning \n                         into, and that I'm getting to a point \n                         where I want to get my shit together \n                         and I can't really see that ever \n                         happening with you, and yeah, yeah, \n                         I sort of get interested in someone \n                         else, and that went further than it \n                         should have, so it seemed like a \n                         good time to go.  But I have no idea \n                         what will happen with Ian in the \n                         long run.

He crosses to them and breaks \n               through to her.\n\n<b>                                     ROB\n</b>                         I'm sorry.\n\n               He breaks away from her and slips out the front door.\n\n<b>               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining \n               torrents and big sheets.  Rob emerges from the front door of \n               Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, \n               hands thrust into his pockets.  The rain almost immediately \n               soaks him.\n\n<b>               EXT. ANOTHER STREET\n</b>\n               In the distance, Rob runs toward us.  As he gets to us we \n               move with him down the street.  He is drenched.  We hear the \n               rain, and his ragged breath.  Headlights appear behind him \n               and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine \n               gets louder.  Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks \n               desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small \n               brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the \n               black wet earth.\n\n               The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows \n               deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and \n               staring up at the sky.  Off-camera the car engine catches \n               up, and a door opens and shuts.  He sighs and shuts his \n               eyes...\n\n               He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well, \n               staring down at him.  It is difficult to distinguish rain \n               from tears.\n\n<b>                                     LAURA\n</b>                         Are you going to lie in that flower \n                         bed all night?\n\n<b>                                     ROB\n</b>                         Uh...

A hand reaches in, and begins to \n               draw the slides down, quieting the music.\n\n               Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst \n               the instruments.  The place is packed with people, and \n               everyone seems to be having a great time.\n\n               Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off \n               when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him \n               and mocks a bulimic act.  Rob gives him the finger.  He sees \n               Laura, and she beams at him.  He comes to the front of the \n               stage, and taps a microphone.\n\n<b>                                     ROB\n</b>                         Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.  \n                         I hope you have a good time.  And I \n                         hope you like the record.  The one \n                         by the Kinky Wizards.  The record \n                         that we're having this record release \n                         party for.\n                              (hoots from the crowd)\n                         Thanks.

Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura.  \n               Barry and his crew mount the stage.  Rob takes a big gulp of \n               beer.\n\n<b>                                     ROB\n</b>                              (to Laura)\n                         I'm an idiot.

He and the band all wear suits and ties.\n\n<b>                                     BARRY\n</b>                         Thanks for the enthusiastic intro, \n                         Rob.  We're not called Sonic Death \n                         Monkey anymore, though, ladies and \n                         gentlemen.  We might be on the verge \n                         of becoming the Atavistics, but we \n                         haven't decided yet.  But tonight, \n                         we are...

Barry is transformed -- \n                         shuffling footwork, a wide smile, \n                         and when the intro winds up, an almost \n                         perfect falsetto.  The crowd goes \n                         nuts, filling the floor.  Rob is \n                         stunned, begins to smile.  Laura \n                         takes his hand and leads him out \n                         into the crowd...\n\n<b>               THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>High Fidelity</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Nick Hornby\" title=\"Scripts by Nick Hornby\">Nick Hornby</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=D.V.
