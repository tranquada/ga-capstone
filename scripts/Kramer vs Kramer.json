Look, during the last five \n                         years we were married, I had... I \n                         was getting more and more... unhappy, \n                         more and more frustrated. I needed \n                         to talk to somebody. I needed to \n                         find out if it was me, if I was going \n                         crazy or what.

I don't \n                         know, very threatened. I mean, \n                         whenever I would bring up anything \n                         he would act like it was some kind \n                         of personal attack. Anyway, we became \n                         more and more separate... more and \n                         more isolated from one another. \n                         Finally, I had no other choice, I \n                         had to leave. And because of my ex-\n                         husband's attitude \u0096 his unwillingness \n                         to deal with my feelings, I had come \n                         to have almost no self-esteem...\n                              (with feeling)\n                         At the time I left, I sincerely \n                         believed that there was something \n                         wrong with me \u0096 that my son would be \n                         better off without me.

And that \n                         just because I needed some creative \n                         and emotional outlet other than my \n                         child, that didn't make me unfit to \n                         be a mother.\n\n<b>                                     GRESSEN\n</b>                              (to the judge)\n                         Your honor, I would like to place in \n                         evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's \n                         therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore \n                         Freedman of La Jolla, California.\n\n               And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick \n               sheaf of papers.

Well, I guess \n                         most of what she said was probably \n                         true. There were a lot of things I \n                         didn't understand \u0096 a lot of things \n                         I would do different if I could. \n                         Just like I guess there are a lot of \n                         things Joanna wishes she could \n                         change... But we can't. Some things, \n                         once they are done, can't be undone. \n                         Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe \n                         she does. So do I. But the way it \n                         was explained to me, that's not the \n                         issue. The only thing that's supposed \n                         to matter here is what's best for \n                         Billy... When Joanna said why \n                         shouldn't a woman have the same \n                         ambitions as a man, I suppose she's \n                         right. But by the same token what \n                         law is it that says a woman is a \n                         better parent simply by virtue of \n                         her sex? I guess I've had to think a \n                         lot about whatever it is that makes \n                         somebody a good parent: constancy, \n                         patience, understanding... love. \n                         Where is it written that a man has \n                         any less of those qualities than a \n                         woman? Billy has a home with me, \n                         I've tried to make it the best I \n                         could. It's not perfect. I'm not a \n                         perfect parent.\n                              (unconsciously echoing \n                              something Joanna \n                              said earlier)\n                         I don't have enough patience. \n                         Sometimes I forget he's just a little \n                         kid...

It got to \n                         where I couldn't tell anybody about \n                         Billy \u0096 I couldn't stand that look \n                         in their faces when I said he wasn't \n                         living with me. Finally it seemed \n                         like the most important thing in the \n                         world to come back here and prove to \n                         Billy and to me and to the world how \n                         much I loved him...
