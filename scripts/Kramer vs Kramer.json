She dresses \n               well, works out religiously at Jack LaLanne's and goes to a \n               therapist twice a week. She is also given to acting the lay \n               analyst with her friends. Thelma is generous with her advice, \n               sharing the wealth so to speak. With all of this she is kind, \n               loyal and a loving friend. At the moment, however, she is \n               all business.\n\n                                     THELMA\n                              (looking around, \n                              suspiciously)\n                         All right.

Your mom loves you very \n                         much. The reason she left didn't \n                         have anything to do with you.\n                              (pause, this is very \n                              painful)\n                         Look, I don't know if this will make \n                         any sense to you, okay? But I'll try \n                         and explain. You see the reason your \n                         mom left was because... Well, I guess \n                         it was because I kept trying to make \n                         her into a certain kind of person... \n                         Make her be the way I thought a wife \n                         was supposed to be.

And now, \n                         when I think about it, I can see she \n                         tried very hard to be like I wanted \n                         \u0096 very hard. And when she couldn't, \n                         then she tried to tell me about it. \n                         Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I \n                         thought that if I was happy, that \n                         meant she was happy too. Only she \n                         wasn't. The truth is, the only reason \n                         she didn't leave a lot sooner was \n                         because she loves you so much.

SPENCER, the Advertising Director. At the moment, \n               Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his \n               hand talking to a very pretty young woman. Ackerman approaches \n               him, whispers something in his ear. Spencer shakes his head \n               and points to his watch. Ackerman says something else and \n               finally, with a look of weary resignation, Spencer excuses \n               himself from the pretty young woman and follows Ackerman \n               back to his office.

I tried to talk to Ted \u0096 my ex-\n                         husband \u0096 about it, but he wouldn't \n                         listen. He refuses to discuss it in \n                         any serious way. I remember one time \n                         he said I probably couldn't get a \n                         job that would pay enough to hire a \n                         baby-sitter for Billy.\n\n                                     GRESSEN\n                         Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed \n                         at the present time?\n\n                                     JOANNA\n                         Yes, I work for Jantzen as a \n                         sportswear designer.\n\n                                     GRESSEN\n                         And what is your present salary?\n\n                                     JOANNA\n                         I make thirty-one thousand dollars a \n                         year.\n\n               REACTION \u0096 TED\n\n               Stunned.\n\n                                     GRESSEN\n                              (switching tactics)\n                         Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?\n\n                                     JOANNA\n                              (emphatically)\n                         Yes.

Look, during the last five \n                         years we were married, I had... I \n                         was getting more and more... unhappy, \n                         more and more frustrated. I needed \n                         to talk to somebody. I needed to \n                         find out if it was me, if I was going \n                         crazy or what. But every time I turned \n                         to Ted \u0096 my ex-husband, he couldn't \n                         handle it. He became very... I don't \n                         know, very threatened. I mean, \n                         whenever I would bring up anything \n                         he would act like it was some kind \n                         of personal attack. Anyway, we became \n                         more and more separate... more and \n                         more isolated from one another. \n                         Finally, I had no other choice, I \n                         had to leave. And because of my ex-\n                         husband's attitude \u0096 his unwillingness \n                         to deal with my feelings, I had come \n                         to have almost no self-esteem...\n                              (with feeling)\n                         At the time I left, I sincerely \n                         believed that there was something \n                         wrong with me \u0096 that my son would be \n                         better off without me. It was only \n                         when I got to California and started \n                         into therapy I began to realize I \n                         wasn't a terrible person. And that \n                         just because I needed some creative \n                         and emotional outlet other than my \n                         child, that didn't make me unfit to \n                         be a mother.\n\n                                     GRESSEN\n                              (to the judge)\n                         Your honor, I would like to place in \n                         evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's \n                         therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore \n                         Freedman of La Jolla, California.\n\n               And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick \n               sheaf of papers. Then, turning his attention back to Joanna:\n\n                                     GRESSEN\n                         Mr. Kramer, why did you set up \n                         residence in New York?\n\n                                     JOANNA\n                         Because my son is here. And his father \n                         is here. As a mother, I don't want \n                         my child to be separated from his \n                         father.\n\n                                     GRESSEN\n                         Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court \n                         why you are asking for custody?\n\n               There is a pause, then:\n\n                                     JOANNA\n                         Because he's my child... Because I \n                         love him. I know I left my son, I \n                         know that's a terrible thing to do. \n                         Believe me, I have to live with that \n                         every day of my life. But just because \n                         I'm a woman, don't I have a right to \n                         the same hopes and dreams as a man? \n                         Don't I have a right to a life of my \n                         own? Is that so awful? Is my pain \n                         any less just because I'm a woman? \n                         Are my feelings any cheaper? I left \n                         my child \u0096 I know there is no excuse \n                         for that. But since then, I have \n                         gotten help. I have worked hard to \n                         become a whole human being. I don't \n                         think I should be punished for that. \n                         I don't think my son should be \n                         punished for that. Billy's only six. \n                         He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't \n                         need his father, but he needs me \n                         more. I'm his mother.\n\n               There is a beat of silence, then:\n\n                                     GRESSEN\n                         Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

Well, I guess \n                         most of what she said was probably \n                         true. There were a lot of things I \n                         didn't understand \u0096 a lot of things \n                         I would do different if I could. \n                         Just like I guess there are a lot of \n                         things Joanna wishes she could \n                         change... But we can't. Some things, \n                         once they are done, can't be undone. \n                         Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe \n                         she does. So do I. But the way it \n                         was explained to me, that's not the \n                         issue. The only thing that's supposed \n                         to matter here is what's best for \n                         Billy... When Joanna said why \n                         shouldn't a woman have the same \n                         ambitions as a man, I suppose she's \n                         right. But by the same token what \n                         law is it that says a woman is a \n                         better parent simply by virtue of \n                         her sex? I guess I've had to think a \n                         lot about whatever it is that makes \n                         somebody a good parent: constancy, \n                         patience, understanding... love. \n                         Where is it written that a man has \n                         any less of those qualities than a \n                         woman? Billy has a home with me, \n                         I've tried to make it the best I \n                         could. It's not perfect. I'm not a \n                         perfect parent.\n                              (unconsciously echoing \n                              something Joanna \n                              said earlier)\n                         I don't have enough patience. \n                         Sometimes I forget he's just a little \n                         kid...

And I did... And \n                         I won.
