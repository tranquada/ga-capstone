MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN\n\n\n\n\nPUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM\nCLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second\nbefore the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a\nglass of water on her bedside table and drinks it.\nClimbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs\n(wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30,\nsharp and prettier than she knows.\n\n\n\n\nINT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING\n\nMiranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on,\ngoggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the\nwater. Something unsettling about this sound. Something\nslightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A\nperson on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the\nperfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like\ngraphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She\nemerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself\nin a towel.\n\n\n\n\nINT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING\n\nMiranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.\n\n\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING\n\nMiranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial\nanalysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast.\nMiranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case\nfile. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the\nnewspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.\n\n\n\n\nEXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING\n\nMiranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.\nDoug kisses his wife and hops out.

As such, and given the\n             severity of the charges you face, I\n             consider him the most qualified person\n             to assist your recovery. Now, if\n             you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is\n             not a patient man.\nStonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling\nlike an idiot.

Irene disperses the crowd.\nConsuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her\nmanner says she just wants to get back to her duties.\nExcitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they\nwere doing.\nMiranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something\ncatches her eye: Pete watching her from his office\nwindow.

She\ngrabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He\nreaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and\nmakes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying\nturtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles.\nMiranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands.\nDoug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over\nher head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA.\nMiranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in\nthe mirror over the mantel and stares --\nWE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda\nstares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For\nan instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there,\nbeckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left\nstudying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE\naround her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood\non her clothes, axe still in her hands.

(A Biblical icon in\nwhich a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.)\nTime stands still for a mesmerizing moment --\nWhen the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to\nreality.

She\nwatches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming\nback to her body and realizing what she's done, she\nslowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the\ntub. Crying. Shaking.     She shuts her eyes as hard as\nshe can to make it all go away, and we --\n\n                                    FADE TO BLACK.\n\n\n\n\n\nBLACKNESS\n\nSilence.

MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT\n\n\n\n\nMiranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic\nlight. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from\nthe POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of\nthe RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes,\nlooks this way and that, then closes them again.\nShe is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard\nbefore. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP\nOPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall.\nSquinting to cover every inch of the room.\nAnd now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner.\nRoughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed\nand slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined.\nShe wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it.\nShe gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING\nLOUDER as she reaches the shadow --\nShe stretches out her hand and finally touches...\nNOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling\nstupid.\n\n                        MIRANDA\n\n          This is not going to work. I'm\n          sick of being watched, and I know\n          this place well and it doesn't\n          smell this bad.\nShe paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.\n\n                        MIRANDA\n\n          I'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm\n          alive -- this is not some\n          afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called\n          paranormal activity can be\n          debunked a million different ways.\n          So whatever you are, whatever it\n          is I'm making up here -- I'm\n          letting you go, I'm setting you\n          free. I'm the wrong person. And\n          I need to sleep. I'm not afraid\n          and I don't believe and I'm fully\n          aware that this is all in my mind\n          -- fiction -- a concocted\n          alternate reality -- and I\n          acknowledge it. And now I'm done\n          with it. I'm going to sleep now.\nThe moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has\npsyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost.

FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nMiranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling\nthe door with her fingers, feeling along the wall --\nstill making sure she isn't dreaming this.\nShe looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of\nneon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily.\nNobody there. But when she looks down the other way she\nsees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So\nquick we're not sure we saw it for sure.\nMiranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction.\nAt night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling\nquality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her\nhead at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells.\nShe turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when\nMiranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing\nright across from:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE NURSES' STATION\n\nWhere two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes\npast them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.\n\n\n\n\nANOTHER CORRIDOR\n\nThis one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden\nsound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at\ntheir late night show. Momentarily distracted, she\nalmost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall.\nShe holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a\n\nSANITATION CLOSET.\n\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                      53.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\nShe looks for something, a tool. Discards a pair of\nbrushes and finds a small screwdriver. Pockets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAIRS\n\nMiranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay\nclear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area.\nShe waits at the landing, times it just right -- and\nscurries to the next floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS\n\n\nACTION\n\nKnowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace\nas she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner\nand stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his\nrounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to\nher office.\nShe pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the\nlock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as\nfast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes\na few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and\nclumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against\nthe floor.\nMiranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She\nbends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for\nbalance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all\nalong. She simply forgot to check.\n\n\n\n\nINT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE\n\nMiranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her\ncomputer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a\nSURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view\nof the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a\nsmoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on.\nShe switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she\nwaits for it to boot up.\n\n\n\n\nON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR\n\nThe JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards\nMiranda's office corridor --\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       54.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\nMiranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the\ncomputer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She\ntries opening drawers but they're all locked. She\nremembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath\nthe couch, uses it to block the light.\nComputer powered up, she runs an online search for\n\"RACHEL PARSONS.\" Waits as the info appears --\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n                     (to self)\n             Alright. What happened to you?\n\n\n\n\nON COMPUTER SCREEN\n\nVarious listings: The archive news of her funeral,\nsomething about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about\nteen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits \"PRINT.\"\nShe checks the surveillance monitor again:     the janitor\nnow mops right outside her door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nON PRINTOUT\n\nThe heading says \"WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?\"\nA quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of\nthree local girls who have died. Rachel's name and\nPHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and\nAndrea White.\nMiranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance\nmonitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him\ndisappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the\nscreen is empty.\nBut just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there.\nStaring straight at her. Makes us jump.\n\n\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER\n\nRetracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the\nstairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera.\n\n\n\n\nINT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\nAs she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her\nway. She detours down another corridor and hides from\nview. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the\nstaircase.\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    55.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\nAnd now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside\nthe room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to\nthe small glass pane on the door and peers inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. ROOM 237\n\nIt takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but\nnow we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some\nsort of struggle.\nMiranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a\nflash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle.\nAnd now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim\nlight we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling.\nJust for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the\nbed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS\n\nFRAME.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\nMiranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to\nensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in.\n\n\n\n\nINT. ROOM 237\n\nChloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin\nmarked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck\nin her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open\nbut it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or\nsobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his\nT-shirt.\nAs he discards it we see that it is yellow.\n\n\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\nDisturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor\nisn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup\nin hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.\n\n                          JANITOR\n\n             Hey!\nMiranda turns and runs.\n\n\n\n\nINT. FEMALE WARD STAIRS\n\nMiranda bolts down the stairs.

FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR\n\n\n\n\nMiranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency\nexit door all the way at the end.\nTWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase,\nshouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their\ncells, awakened by the COMMOTION.\nMiranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as\nshe gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty\nfeet, fifteen, ten --\nWhen a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT\nappears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid\ncrashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers\nleft against the wall but the man easily tackles her and\npins her down.\nThe orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find\nher screaming, hysterical. They hold her down --\n\n                         MIRANDA\n\n           It's him! It's him! Jesus\n           Christ, it's him!\nThe man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea\nwhat she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic\nwoman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and\nwe --\n\n                                          FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\n\nFADE IN:\n\n\n\n\n\nINT.

Freaked.\nShe's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --\n\n                          MIRANDA\n\n            No.\nThe CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key\nbut suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and\nnotices the key is gone.\n\n                          MIRANDA\n\n            Why are you doing this to me?\nA dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more\nstartled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the\nmiddle of the street.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      69.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n\n\n\nMiranda opens her car door and walks down the empty\nstreet to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.\nWe watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The\nmoment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the\nglare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda\njumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened\nby a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.\nShe watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in\nher throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the\npesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.\nBOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround\nthe area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS\nfastened around the insulators of a thick power line.\nFrom here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.\nAnd now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming\nloose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some\ninvisible force --\nMiranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP\nand turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE\nWIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings\nstraight towards the paralyzed Miranda --\nShe looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,\nback up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to\na crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The\nwire hits the water and the monumental charge sends\nSPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like\nlightning.\nA silent, sudden beat.   That was as close as close gets.\n\n                        MIRANDA\n\n                  (fighting tears)\n          What do you want from me?\nNo sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing\nover her shoulder, seemingly demented:\n\n                        MIRANDA\n\n          What is it you want me to do?!!\nA moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the\nmiddle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING\nabruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the\nsound.\nIt's the front gate to her house. And now the front door\nSWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.\n\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       70.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\nClearly Rachel wants her back in the house.\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n             I can't.\n                     (softly)\n             Please, please don't make me go\n             back in there.\nBut even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards\nit. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the\nroad. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost\nelectrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate\nyet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.\n\n\n\n\nINT. SIMON'S CAR\n\nMiranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here.\nShe's never asked a ghost for permission before:\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n             Bear with me, I'm just parking it\n             out of the way so it won't look\n             suspicious in the middle of the\n             road -- okay.\nShe STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE\n\nMiranda stands in her living room, staring at her\nhandiwork. Frozen with dread.\nThe blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains.\nThe upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk\noutline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the\nshattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied\nfootprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc.\nThe faded writing on the wall:       \"NOT ALONE.\"\nMiranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's\nsupposed to be looking for.\n\n                            MIRANDA\n\n                     (piecing it together)\n             Not alone.

Is there some sign here she\nshould be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and\nimmediately doubles over in pain --\n\n                            MIRANDA\n\n             Shit.\nShe looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck\nright through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin.\nBlood already seeping from the nasty cut --\n\n\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\nMiranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out\nthe piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She\ngrabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the\ncut.\nAnd now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears\nthe hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel.\nInside the room with her --\nMiranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror\nmove? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds\nperfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have\nSTOPPED. A silent beat.\nShe turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing\nas the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful.\nAnd now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes\nher look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like\nthe night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked\narms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola.\nShe stares.     Mesmerized.    The sound of FLAMES GROWING\n\nLOUDER.\n\n\n                             MIRANDA\n\n             No.   No.   No...\nMiranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the\nimage reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if\nthe two versions of her are literally walking towards\neach other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces\nmere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the\nmirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.\n\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                     72.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\nMiranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt.\nThe skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically\nimpossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again --\nthe image is gone.\n\n\n\nIt is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself\nstaring at in the mirror is the reflection of something\njust behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far\ncorner of the room.\nShe turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY\nLISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks\nit up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank-\nrepossessed property.\nThe address is in Willows Creek.\nHer brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel\nwanted her to see. She stares at it.\nPUSH IN ON the picture as we --\n\n                                     MATCH CUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN\n\nA \"FOR SALE\" sign still flapping in the wind.   The first\nfew rays of light break through the dawn sky.\nMiranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it\nFILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.\nShe studies the house before walking up the drive. We\nwatch her peek through windows and walk around back,\nlooking for something. What exactly, we don't know.\n(Neither does she.)\nShe makes her way back to the starting point and fixes\nher stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't\nlooked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. BARN\n\nDark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING\nto FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's\njust the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large\nroom, perplexed. There is something about this place.\nSomething she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning\nher.\nWith a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front\ndoor when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops\nher. She moves to it.\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       73.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\nAnd here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow\ngap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A\npadlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both\nwalls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy\npadlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall\nand opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only\na few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness\nbeyond, but can't see a thing.\nHesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides\nherself into the claustrophobic slot.\nShe moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face\nbrushes against something hanging in the air. She stops,\nstartled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light\nbulb.\nShe tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow\nto see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of\nher. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY\nCREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below.\nFeels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs\ndown.\n\n\n\n\nINT. SECRET BASEMENT\n\nMiranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness.\nWhatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb\nupstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall\nfor a switch. Nothing.\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n                     (to self)\n             It's not shrink-appropriate to be\n             afraid of the dark, right?\nAbruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key-\nchain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast\nspace. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient\nourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's\nreflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.\n\n                          MIRANDA\n\n             Hello?\nShe takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on\nthe floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half-\nlight we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles\nthrough it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds\na wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next\nto the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named\n\n\"TRACY MARIE SEAVER.\"\n\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    74.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n             Is there anybody here?   Hello?\nThe lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it\nclick off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped\na ragged T-shirt around it for insulation.\nMiranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can\nmake out the metallic thing that reflected light before.\nIt is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are\nseveral heavy chains.\nLike a meat rack.\nAnd now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and\nsees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down,\ntied around the hands and ankles.\nMedical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the\ngirl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter\naway.\n\n                            MIRANDA\n\n             Go away!   Fuck off!\n(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so\nthat we go from midnight black to wavery light in an\nalmost strobe-light effect:)\nShe checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's\nadrenaline at full tilt --\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n             C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --\nShe strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the\ngirl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly,\nclinically.\nThe strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the\nimmediate surroundings:   household tools strewn about;\nwire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n             Wake up, Tracy, wake up --\nNothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.\nThe skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the\ngirl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too\nlate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          75.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. BARN - LATER\n\n\n\n\nMiranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and\nthrows up. The bright light outside blinding her\nmomentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to\nregister --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PATROL CAR\n\nparked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER\ncautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up\nand notices her.\nMiranda hesitates. Nowhere to run.      The officer waves.\nHis name is TURLINGTON.\n\n                         OFFICER TURLINGTON\n\n          Howdy there.\nHe says this while already strolling over.

His left hand\nresting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it\nseems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.\n\n                        MIRANDA\n\n          Yes -- I -- I just pulled over.

That was unexpected.\nHe steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes\nher head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the\ntrigger --\n\n                           SHERIFF RYAN\n\n             You sure about this?\nHe stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his\nhead. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's\nopen cell, weighing his options at triple speed --\n\n                           SHERIFF RYAN\n\n             You need me alive for your story\n             to stick. Be logical now. You\n             know you can't kill me.\nHe takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills\na BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays\nbackwards and lands with a crash.\n\n                           MIRANDA\n\n             Logic is overrated.\n\n\n\n\nINT.

So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back\nof his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold\nwhisper, they stand up on their ends.\n\n\n\nPete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now\nopen. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door.\n\n\n\n\nINT. RECOVERY ROOM #1\n\nPete looks oddly around the room.\n\n                           PETE\n\n             Anybody in here -- ?\nAs he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room.\nUnseen by him, of course.

He leads the men down the corridor and\nunlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are\ndutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open.\nThe men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.\n\n\n\n\nINT.
