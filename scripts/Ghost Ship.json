She stands on a \n\trusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean \n\tby a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. \n\tIt is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which \n\tmeans a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-\n\twest.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way \n\tforward.\n\n<b>\tEXT.

The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific \n\tNorthwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her \n\ttrue calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts \n\tand a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be \n\tconsidered pretty.\n\n\tShe clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches \n\tto a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto \n\tthe cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the \n\tbow beneath her.

She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down \n\twhere several vent ducts lead in different directions below \n\tit.\n\n<b>\tEXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tMurphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a \n\tpassageway.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tMurphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.\n\n<b>\tINT.

CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when \n\tsomething can be heard ahead of her. She stops.\n\n\tFOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back \n\tinto the shadows, holding there.\n\n\tThe footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the \n\tother end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.\n\n\tEpps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at \n\tthe other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch \n\tslowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN \n\tTHE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving \n\ttoward it.\n\n\tAs she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, \n\tswaying slightly with the movement of the ship.\n\n\tA CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps \n\tinto view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot \n\tricochets off the metal around her.\n\n\tShe scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings \n\tdown from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.\n\n<b>\tAT THE BOTTOM\n</b>\n\tEpps gets up, runs.\n\n<b>\tWITH MURPHY\n</b>\n\tMurphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.\n\n<b>\tINT.

CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking \n\ton at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS \n\tIN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the \n\tship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, \n\tas though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.\n\n\tShe steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it \n\tbecomes absolutely deafening.\n\n\tThe ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move \n\tand the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back \n\tand forth.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tMurphy slows and finally stops.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tA few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING \n<b>\tGROWS STILL LOUDER.\n</b>\n\tEpps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, \n\twhen the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing \n\tout of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate \n\tof the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH \n<b>\tWITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.\n</b>\n\tEpps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through \n\tthe Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a \n<b>\tHORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious \n\trock promontory of a small island.\n\n<b>\tINT.

CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tMurphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end \n\tof the passage. He begins backing away.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps is forced under as the water in the hull is already \n\thalf way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING \n<b>\tEXERTION.\n</b>\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tMurphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo \n\tcompartment.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, \n\ttools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead \n\tas the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.\n\n\tEpps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under \n\tthe water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she \n\twas.\n\n<b>\tWITH EPPS\n</b>\n\tEpps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and \n\tthe bulkhead.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  \n\tMurphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in \n\this pockets.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is \n\ttrapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.\n\n<b>\tABOVE THE WATER\n</b>\n\tThe level of the water has now almost completely reached the \n\tdeck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last \n\tingot and makes his way for the exit.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  \n\tShe swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at \n\tthe stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the \n\tmurky water.\n\n\tSeveral more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the \n\twater. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  \n\tThey are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.\n\n\tAs they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  \n\tIt is Katie.\n\n\tShe reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her \n\thand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.\n\n\tThe girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she \n\tfinds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the \n\tbreech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.\n\n\tKatie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks \n\tback at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the \n\tlight of the surface.\n\n<b>\tEXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the \n\tChimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully \n\tawash.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tMurphy staggers through the flooded passage.\n\n<b>\tEXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged \n\tand the stern beginning to rise.\n\n\tEpps sees another small island some distance off. She begins \n\tswimming toward it.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tWater runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the \n\ttop.\n\n<b>\tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.\n\n<b>\tINT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tA river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with \n\tdifficulty.\n\n<b>\tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself \n\tup.\n\n<b>\tEXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tWater rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top \n\tdeck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under \n\tas he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft \n\tportion rising above him as the bow sinks.\n\n<b>\tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps collapses on the rocks.\n\n<b>\tEXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tAs the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under \n\tmomentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward \n\tsmoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the \n\tcurrent from the rushing water pulling him toward it.\n\n<b>\tEXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.\n\n<b>\tEXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tAs the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that \n\tpulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he \n\tis pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the \n\tsmokestack's opening.\n\n\tThe ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of \n\tthe stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, \n\twithout success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke \n\tstack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing \n\twater.\n\n<b>\tEXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY\n</b>\n\tEpps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on \n\tat the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she \n\tgoes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.\n\n\tShe turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the \n\tChimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts \n\tand waves her arms.\n\n<b>\tEXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time \n\tdropping a survival pack.\n\n\tThe Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical \n\tnow, slipping further and further under.\n\n\tEpps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.\n\n<b>\tEXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the \n\tCAMERA PUSHING IN TO \"CHIMERA\" as the name comes to the water, \n\tthen slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, \n\tMOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, \n\tthere is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the \n\tocean.\n\n<b>\tFADE TO BLACK\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t THE END\n</b>\n\nAdditional <a href=\"ghost_ship_info.txt\">Info</a>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Ghost Ship</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Mark Hanlon\" title=\"Scripts by Mark Hanlon\">Mark Hanlon</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Ghost Ship Script.html#comments\" title=\"Ghost Ship comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:06:16.678560"}
