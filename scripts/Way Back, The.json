Then the Gobi desert is flowing\r\n          beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives\r\n          way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we\r\n          are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and\r\n          onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of\r\n          utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny\r\n          shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald\r\n          rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing\r\n          lights.

BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3\r\n\r\n           A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two\r\n           tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal\r\n           stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A\r\n          dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 \r\n          to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear\r\n          scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in\r\n          prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian\r\n          territories, still ear something of their national \r\n          costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners\r\n          from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages\r\n          drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of\r\n          types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving\r\n          and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each\r\n          other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men\r\n          are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or\r\n          'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that\r\n          has put them here.\r\n          Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a\r\n          group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.\r\n          These men look healthier, and are further distinguished\r\n          by their tattoos.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            2.\r\n\r\n                         3 CONTINUED: 3\r\n          These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular\r\n          criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters\r\n          of the block.\r\n          Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily\r\n          tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth.

He separates his cards with\r\n          the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid \r\n          plays, VALKA is left coat-less. \r\n          Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players,\r\n          the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just\r\n          entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder,\r\n          SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other\r\n          ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes\r\n          three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes\r\n          them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN.\r\n\r\n                         BOHDAN\r\n          For the bread.\r\n\r\n                         VALKA \r\n          For the bread, and the sausage, \r\n          bastard! \r\n          BOHDAN enjoying himself. \r\n\r\n                         BOHDAN \r\n          Throw in that crappy shirt you're \r\n          wearing and I might be tempted. \r\n          Smiles from the gang.

He sits bare-chested, a\r\n          tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking\r\n          across at STALIN on his right.

Following behind is a lorry, carrying\r\n          six guards, supplies for their recent journey, and a camp\r\n          stove.\r\n\r\n          8 EXT. CAMP GATES - DAWN 8\r\n\r\n          As they approach one of the prisoners looks up to an arch\r\n          stretching across the gates - a hand-painted sign in\r\n          Russian subtitled: 'LABOR IS HONOR, GLORY, NOBILITY, AND\r\n\r\n          HEROISM'.\r\n          The prisoner is JANUSZ, early twenties and he exchanges a\r\n          look with the man beside him, TOMASZ, about the same age. \r\n          ANOTHER ANGLE shows a line of prisoners, five abreast,\r\n          marching toward them on their way to work. They have\r\n          their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns\r\n          pass each other the contrast between the half-starved,\r\n          ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of\r\n          the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we\r\n          are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse\r\n          some of those already established - they include BOHDAN,\r\n          and VALKA, and further back - SMITH and KHABAROV. As\r\n          they pass they look across to JANUSZ and TOMASZ, both\r\n          Polish, and behind them to VOSS, a tall young Latvian\r\n          with a mop of white-blonde hair. Behind VOSS - ZORAN, a\r\n          blanket over his three-piece suit. Beside him, another\r\n          Pole - KAZIK, at seventeen, the youngest in the group.\r\n\r\n          9 EXT.

He walks\r\n          with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new\r\n          camp construction.

A couple of guards sort\r\n          through their belongings, pocketing the odd item.\r\n          JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut.\r\n          JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on\r\n          replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed-\r\n          wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a\r\n          section of the old wall falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n          14 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, THE ZONE - NIGHT 14\r\n\r\n          The prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the\r\n          side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful\r\n          eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of\r\n          thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no\r\n          bowl, so he uses his hat.\r\n          JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window.\r\n          Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners\r\n          feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a\r\n          hand on the shoulder of the man in front.\r\n\r\n          VOSS (TO JANUSZ)\r\n\r\n                         (IN ENGLISH)\r\n          Night blindness.

He lays his shovel aside and hurries\r\n          after him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          27.\r\n\r\n          33 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 33\r\n\r\n          JANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls\r\n          to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the\r\n          ground.\r\n\r\n          JANUSZ'S VISION - DAY \r\n           Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones.\r\n          He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path.\r\n          Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a\r\n          hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate.\r\n          His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the\r\n          path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones,\r\n          then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A\r\n          pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the\r\n          wall.\r\n\r\n          34 INT./EXT.

SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back\r\n          to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands\r\n          around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH\r\n          bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to\r\n          JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its\r\n          effect.\r\n\r\n                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)\r\n          It can be done.\r\n\r\n                         SMITH\r\n          What can be done? \r\n\r\n                         JANUSZ\r\n          He knows a way through the wire.\r\n          SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point-\r\n          Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          28.\r\n\r\n                         34 CONTINUED: 34\r\n\r\n                         JANUSZ (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (A WHISPER)\r\n          He has a plan.\r\n\r\n                         SMITH\r\n          Who?\r\n\r\n                         JANUSZ\r\n          His name is Khabarov.\r\n          Now SMITH understands.\r\n\r\n                         SMITH\r\n          The actor.\r\n\r\n                         JANUSZ\r\n          You know him?\r\n\r\n                         SMITH\r\n          He has no intention of escaping.\r\n\r\n                         JANUSZ\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         SMITH\r\n          He's aliar.

KAZIK \r\n           stumbles, and is helped to his feet by VOSS. He limps on \r\n           to the barrack a hand resting for support on VOSS' \r\n           shoulder. JANUSZ is preoccupied and he hesitates at t he \r\n           door, turns, and looks back. After a moment staring at \r\n           the ground he hurries inside. \r\n\r\n          36 INT.

KHABAROV scuttles back inside the barracks.\r\n          JANUSZ hesitates a moment, then follows.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            31.\r\n\r\n          A38 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT A38\r\n\r\n           In the last minutes before lights out the would-be\r\n           escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other \r\n           items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and \r\n           BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and\r\n           most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades\r\n           more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries \r\n           to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in \r\n           poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK \r\n           does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is \r\n          doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS\r\n          whispers to him.\r\n\r\n                         VOSS\r\n          You can't see, can you?\r\n          A look of panic crosses the boy's face.\r\n\r\n                         KAZIK\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPERS)\r\n          Don't leave me behind!\r\n          VOSS conflicted.\r\n\r\n                         KAZIK (CONT'D)\r\n          Promise me, Andrejs!

I'll die\r\n          here.\r\n          JANUSZ and SMITH sit in a darkened corner working on\r\n          LAZAR. They want to know how to get through the wire.\r\n          He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from\r\n          his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the\r\n          deal, just as the light flickers and goes out plunging\r\n          the barracks into darkness.\r\n\r\n          AB38 EXT. THE CAMP - NIGHT AB38\r\n\r\n          Several shots of the wind driven snow whipping about the\r\n          buildings.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            32.\r\n\r\n          38 INT. BARRACKS - LATER THAT NIGHT 38\r\n\r\n          The wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea\r\n          as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The\r\n          sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans,\r\n          hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm.\r\n          CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS,\r\n          KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ,\r\n          catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'.\r\n          KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected\r\n          sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at\r\n          the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be\r\n          attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving\r\n          about near him, a look of terror on his face.\r\n\r\n          LATER,\r\n          JANUSZ lies on his back listening to the storm. A\r\n          movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his\r\n          throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his\r\n          cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still.\r\n\r\n                         VALKA\r\n          There are no secrets here.\r\n\r\n                         JANUSZ\r\n          What do you want?\r\n\r\n                         VALKA\r\n          The game goes against me. Small\r\n          debt - lose fingers. Big debt, \r\n          they take head. Me, big debt.\r\n          But one thing I never gamble is my\r\n          Wolf.\r\n          He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the\r\n          blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade.\r\n\r\n                         VALKA (CONT'D)\r\n          In forest you need knife to \r\n          survive. Without? A miracle.\r\n          He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear.\r\n\r\n                         VALKA (CONT'D)\r\n          You need a knife, and I need\r\n          miracle to get me out of here.\r\n          With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers\r\n          and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n\r\n          39 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAWN 39\r\n\r\n          Heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward\r\n          the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight\r\n          isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards.\r\n          They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and\r\n          baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs\r\n          into the gap, then following them toward the distant\r\n          forest.\r\n\r\n          40 EXT. FOREST, SIBERIA - DAWN 40\r\n\r\n          Then seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and\r\n          out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them,\r\n          as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with\r\n          JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt,\r\n          occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his\r\n          feet fast enough to keep up with the others.\r\n          JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the \r\n          moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before \r\n          plunging on Southward. \r\n\r\n                         41 FURTHER ALONG 41 \r\n          They top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their\r\n          breath. The snow continues to fall but JANUSZ will allow \r\n          no rest and moves off without a backward glance. \r\n\r\n                         42 FURTHER STILL 42\r\n           JANUSZ is out in front when SMITH stops, resting his \r\n           hands on his knees, gulping for air.

A\r\n          merchant ship hurried toward big\r\n          rocks, lightening in the sky, the\r\n          waves as high as house-tops.\r\n          Very, very cold, brrr! The ship\r\n          smashed onto the rocks, the\r\n          sailors cried in fear, called out\r\n          to God, but they all drowned. All\r\n          but one, Mr. Robinson Crusoe. He\r\n          woke to find himself all alone on\r\n          a desert island. For many years\r\n          he lived without any human\r\n          companions, until one day he saw\r\n          something shocking! What was it?\r\n          A human footprint. He was no\r\n          longer alone. But was the\r\n          stranger friend or foe? Another\r\n          ship wrecked sailor? Or, a\r\n          cannibal?\r\n          All turn as a flicker of flame begins at the base of the \r\n          kindling. While JANUSZ blows at the flame, MR.

Then\r\n          everyone is making a contribution - adding a few leaves,\r\n          or tiny twigs, like offerings, as the fire grows and\r\n          spreads.\r\n\r\n          AB51 EXT.

A HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 221\r\n\r\n          The camera moves toward a gate in a hedge. The click of\r\n          the latch as it opens. A downward view of the\r\n          flagstones. The front door, the camera pans left. The\r\n          loose brick. A hand into frame removes a key from behind\r\n          the brick. Into the lock of the door, the door pushed\r\n          open.\r\n\r\n          222 INT. HOUSE, POLAND - DAY 222\r\n\r\n          A WOMAN sitting by a window. She's in her early\r\n          seventies, and she looks up expectantly on hearing the\r\n          door closing in the hallway. At the entrance to the room\r\n          appears a young man in Polish cavalry uniform - YOUNG\r\n          JANUSZ, as he was just before the war. He smiles at his\r\n          wife. Cut back to the seat by the window to see his\r\n           pretty YOUNG WIFE, as she was back in 1939. YOUNG\r\n           JANUSZ, smiling broadly, crosses toward her. Cut back to\r\n          his WIFE of 1989 - on her face there are lines of\r\n           suffering which fade as she smiles up at him. She's\r\n           waited a long time for him to come home. On JANUSZ now\r\n           as he sits opposite her, and for the first time we see\r\n          him as he is in 1989 - also in his early seventies.\r\n           Without a word he reaches across the table and takes her\r\n          hand in his.\r\n\r\n          FADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nWay Back, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Peter Weir\u00a0\u00a0Slavomir Rawicz\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:38:14.486896"}
