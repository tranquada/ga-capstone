MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET\n\n             We see an Italian village at the height of the plague.  Funeral \n             processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up...  \n             the stench of death all around.\n\n             TITLE:  EUROPE. THE DARK AGES\n\n             Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse.  He is weary but \n             not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts.  \n             He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back.  \n             He enters the inn.\n\n             INT. INN - SAME TIME\n\n             The inn is dark and almost empty.  A couple of patrons drink \n             silently at tables.  Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID, \n             dark-haired and lazy.  She scratches at her shoulder, on which \n             we see a birthmark.  The knight approaches the bar, throws \n             money down.\n\n                                       KNIGHT\n                            A tankard of ale, wench.\n\n             The barmaid pours him a cup of ale.  He drinks deep, stands a \n             moment.\n\n                                       KNIGHT\n                                (continuing)\n                            Some plague we're having, huh?\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n             The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his \n             room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the doorway, \n             places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a moment, then \n             breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  He laughs a \n             bit, resignedly, and closes the door.\n\n             A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, \n             grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his \n             head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is gray, and \n             peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.\n\n                                       KNIGHT\n                            Oh, my god...\n\n             The vampire licks his lips.\n\n             He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into \n             the middle of the small room.  The knight struggles but is no \n             match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's \n             neck.  The knight screams.\n\n             ANGLE ON DOOR\n\n             It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.\n\n             The vampire turns like a frightened animal.  In the doorway \n             stands the barmaid, a SLAYER.  In her hand is a wooden stake.\n\n             The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner.  \n             The Slayer and the vampire come at each other.  The Slayer \n             spins and kicks; the vampire flies back.  Snarling, he comes \n             back at the slayer.  They struggle; he slips free and is out \n             the door.\n\n             For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor.  \n             The knight watches her.  She seems to be making a decision -- \n             perhaps even knows what is going to happen.\n\n             She runs at the window.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME\n\n             The vampire comes running out the front door.  Before he is a \n             few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through \n             the upstairs window and lands on him.  They both hit the ground, \n             and she plants the stake right in his heart.\n\n             After a moment, we hear a voice:\n\n                                       AMILYN (O.S.)\n                            The lord giveth, and the lord taketh \n                            away.  Ashes, ashes...\n\n             She looks up.\n\n                                       AMILYN\n                                (continuing)\n                            ... All fall down\n\n             There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in \n             the otherwise deserted street.  At the front, maybe ten feet \n             away, is AMILYN.\n\n             Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King.  \n             His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery.  He \n             ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.\n\n             Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King.  His skin is deep white, \n             and smooth.  He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any \n             era.  He is practically upon her before he speaks.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            You must forgive Amilyn.  He tends \n                            to drool before supper.\n\n             She turns.  He smiles, almost lovingly.\n\n                                       SLAYER\n                            Lothos...\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            You people will never learn.\n\n             She swings at him but he grabs her arm.  Amilyn laughs \n             obnoxiously.  Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings \n             her to him in a loving embrace.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                                (continuing)\n                            We can't be stopped.  This is our \n                            world now.\n\n             He pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her head \n             hits the back of her legs.  Lightning flashes.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. ENGLISH CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n             Lightning flashes outside the window.  It is torrenting rain.  \n             An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or so.  They \n             are both obviously noble of birth.\n\n                                       GIRL\n                            I can't!\n\n                                       MAN\n                            You know you must.  There is only \n                            one.  Now you are that one.  It is \n                            time.\n\n                                       GIRL\n                            Why?  Why me?\n\n                                       MAN\n                            She has died.  You are the next to \n                            be called.  Why do you think you \n                            were sent to me?  Trained as you \n                            were?  You bear the mark.\n\n             He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder, \n             identical to the barmaid's.\n\n                                       MAN\n                                (continuing)\n                            The mark of the Coven.\n\n                                       GIRL\n                            I don't understand.\n\n                                       MAN\n                            Ever since Adam and Eve first left \n                            the garden, he followed: the serpent.  \n                            Satan.  He sends his legion in the \n                            shape of men, to feed on us, to \n                            breed his Hell on our earth.  They \n                            are a plague upon us.\n\n             The man unravels a satchel of cloth.  From it he pulls an \n             elaborately carved wooden stake.\n\n                                       MAN\n                                (continuing)\n                            But as long as there have been \n                            vampire, there has been the Coven; \n                            the line of Slayers.  Ones with the \n                            strength and the skill to kill them, \n                            to find them where they gather and \n                            stop the swell of their numbers.  \n                            One dies, the next is called.\n\n                                       GIRL\n                            I'm just a girl.\n\n                                       MAN\n                            You are much more.\n\n             He hands her the stake.  She feels the fit.\n\n                                       MAN\n                                (continuing)\n                            One dies, the next is called...\n\n             As she grips the stake more tightly, an awareness and sense of \n             power sees to fill her.  She lifts the stake over her head.\n\n             CLOSEUP - A HAND\n\n             The hand is lifted high, but it is not the girl's.  It holds \n             not a stake, but a pom-pom.\n\n             EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY\n\n             Opening CREDITS OVER:\n\n             A football game in progress.  The stands are pretty full, the \n             crowd enthusiastic.  The hemery football stadium is just that; \n             a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass.\n\n             On  the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY. \n             She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very \n             gracefully athletic.  She obviously enjoys what she is doing, \n             and she's good at it.\n\n             With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her best \n             friends.  Beside them the COACH, yelling at the players.  The \n             scoreboard reads HEMERY VS. SETON.\n\n             On the field are JEFFREY, wide receiver (and Buffy's boyfriend), \n             ANDY, quarterback, and GRUELLER, the huge left tackle.\n\n             Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard \n             loss.\n\n                                       COACH\n                            Come on, do the play!

Fill that hole!  They \n                            were all over me!  Okay.  Let's run \n                            twenty-two.  Grueller, close the \n                            pocket, watch out for thirty-five.  \n                            Thompson, run the post, right, wide \n                            out.  Jeffrey, go up the middle and \n                            run around like a chicken.\n\n             They clap and break.  As they line up, Jeffrey looks over at \n             Buffy.  She smiles at him.  He winks, very suave.\n\n                                       BUFFY AND CHEERLEADERS\n                            Jeffrey!  Jeffrey! \n                            He's our man!  \n                            If he can't do it \n                            We don't want it!\n\n             On the hike, Andy drops back and looks for a receiver.  Jeffrey \n             runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a chicken), waving \n             his arms until Andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a \n             touchdown.\n\n             The crowd goes wild -- particularly Buffy, who does an \n             impressive standing backflip.  Nicole looks at her, impressed.  \n             Buffy smiles at her, giddy.\n\n                                       COACH\n                                (looking around)\n                            Is that good?

Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and \n             KIMBERLY can bee seen making their way through it.  They are \n             all dressed very similarly:  bright colors, a lot of white and \n             pink.  Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired.  Esprit.  \n             All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good days work.\n\n             TITLE:  CALIFORNIA.

STREET - NIGHT\n\n             Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind \n             Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home.  They're really \n             bombed now.  They are somewhere in the hills now, and they \n             come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley.  A \n             waist-high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth.  \n             They stand below a thick, green tree.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            I'll have it running in a week.  \n                            It's be beauty.  It just needs new \n                            shocks, you know, break pads, an \n                            engine, and some wheels.  It'll be \n                            totally cherry.\n\n             Pike finishes the bottle, eats the worm, and chucks the BOTTLE \n             over the side.  There is a moment before they hear it SHATTER.\n\n                                       BENNY\n                            When you get your car together, \n                            man, let's bail.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            You think?

Hundreds of beans.\n\n             Benny wavers, catches hold of Pike.\n\n                                       BENNY\n                            I think I'm gonna ralf.\n\n             He leans over the side of the wall, hangs his head down.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            Don't worry, Benny.  I'm here for \n                            you.\n\n             Pike falls over backwards.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                                (continuing)\n                            I'm here for you, Ralf.\n\n             Pike passes out.\n\n             CLOSEUP - BENNY\n\n             Still waiting to throw up.  The figure approaches slowly from \n             behind him.  The figure is a few feet away from him when a \n             hand shoots down from above and grabs Benny's face.\n\n             ANGLE - IN THE TREE\n\n             Amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls Benny up to face him.  Amilyn \n             has changed his manner of dress drastically.  He wears a \n             motorcycle jacket and sunglasses.  His hair is punked out.  \n             Benny is in shock, as Amilyn holds him easily by his shirt \n             collar.\n\n                                       AMILYN\n                            You wanna go for a ride?\n\n             Amilyn leans back -- all the way back, falling back out of the \n             tree and pulling Benny with him.  We see them fall out past \n             the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it.\n\n             It is Merrick, the man from the mall.  He runs to the side of \n             the wall, looks over.  The two are already lost in the dark \n             mist.  Merrick turns around, looks about him.  He digs in his \n             pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly.  \n             While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on \n             the railing.  Stake and cross in hand, he stands by Pike looking \n             out at the night.\n\n             ANGLE - THE PICTURE\n\n             It is a ten year old girl about to blow out the candles on her \n             birthday cake.  The cake reads, \"Happy Birthday, Buffy\".\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             EXT.

She starts doing a routine, tentatively.  \n             Then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, flies \n             into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels.  \n             She rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and lands, a perfect \n             ten, about three inches from Merrick.\n\n             She screams in surprise, steps back.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            God, where the hell did you come \n                            from?

OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - SAME TIME\n\n             Cassandra stands waiting for Buffy.  The sun is down, darkness \n             increasing.  She looks at her watch and gives up, heads for \n             her car.  Her key in the door, she hears a RUSTLING behind \n             her.  Looks slowly around.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME\n\n             Buffy sits fidgeting.  Playing with her fingernails.  Merrick \n             stays in the position, listening.\n\n             A low, almost inaudible MOAN come from under the ground.  Buffy \n             sits up straight, holds the cross to her.  The MOAN becomes \n             louder, almost a scream.  The SOUND is followed by the SOUND \n             of FINGERS SCRAPPING wood -- of WOOD SPLINTERING -- of digging.  \n             The moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat more \n             articulate.\n\n             Buffy and Merrick wait.\n\n             ANGLE - THE GRAVE\n\n             Finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in \n             the open air.  The moan becomes a triumphant HISS.  The fingers \n             clutch at the ground.\n\n             ROBERT BERMAN pops halfway out of his grave like a jack-in-the-\n             box, his face dirty and dead-white.  He sees Buffy in front of \n             him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, stretching as \n             to a mother's tit.\n\n             Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the \n             stake.  Buffy watches, immobilized.\n\n             A pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy.  \n             They grab her and pull her to the ground.  Next to her face, \n             the face of another vampire, a YOUNG WOMAN, emerges grinning \n             from the crumbling earth.\n\n             Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free.\n\n             Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws \n             him off, and pulls himself out of the grave.  Merrick falls to \n             the ground, and his stake goes flying.\n\n             Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running \n             away, but the girl grabs her.  Buffy remembers the cross in \n             her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead.  It \n             burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the ground.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            'Bye now.\n\n             Buffy runs.\n\n             ANGLE - MERRICK AND ROBERT\n\n             They are struggling, several feet away.  Robert grabs Merrick \n             by the shoulders and picks him up, preparing to bite him.  A \n             stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his back by \n             Buffy.  He falls and dies.\n\n                                       MERRICK\n                            Where's the other one?\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            She --\n\n             It leaps at her, screaming.  She throws it off, as Merrick \n             produces another stake and throws it to her.  Buffy sticks it \n             in the vampire's heart.  She dies, screaming, her face still \n             smoking, blood spurting onto Buffy.\n\n             Buffy looks at herself.  At the blood.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             EXT. FRONT OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n             Merrick walks Buffy to the door.

Buffy looks a sight, and stands uncomfortably \n             in front of her mother for a moment.\n\n                                       BUFFY'S MOM\n                            Do you know what time it is?\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Uum... around ten?\n\n             Mom taps her watch, annoyed.\n\n                                       BUFFY'S MOM\n                            I knew this thing was slow.\n\n             She crosses out of the room.\n\n                                       BUFFY'S MOM\n                                (continuing)\n                            You pay a fortune for something...\n                                (calls out)\n                            Honey, come on, we're gonna be late.\n\n             Her mother gone, Buffy lets out a small sigh -- of relief or \n             frustration, it is not clear.  She heads upstairs.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n             Buffy stands at the sink, washing her shirt.  She tries to get \n             the blood off with fierce intensity.  She is near tears.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n             She sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas, the blankets \n             pooled around her.  She cannot sleep.  Finally, she lies back \n             on the pillow.\n\n             Lothos is beside her.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY\n\n             Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for \n             last night's wear.  Gary Murray comes up next to her, looking \n             at his watch pointedly:  she's late for class.  He moves on.  \n             Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her.\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look \n                            beat.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I do?  I guess I do.\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            Where were you last night?  I called \n                            your house like four times.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I went to sleep.  I think I have \n                            the flu or something.\n\n             Jeffrey backs away from her.\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            I can't get sick.  You know -- \n                            training and all.  I'm gonna be \n                            late.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            'Bye.\n\n             Jeffrey moves off to class.  Buffy walks on a bit.  She bumps \n             into Nicole.\n\n                                       NICOLE\n                            Hey, Buffers.

No.  She never showed.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - CLOSEUP OF CASSANDRA'S FACE\n\n             She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out.  She blinks \n             stupidly, looks around.  She is lying by a pool of what looks \n             to be dark water in a large cave.  Torches burn around her.\n\n             She tries to get up and finds it difficult.  She pulls herself \n             up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face.\n\n             It's blood.\n\n             She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands.  She \n             does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first.\n\n             It's Lothos.  He wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, \n             the style maybe Nineteenth Century.  No blood seems to touch \n             him as he rises.  He looks at Cassandra with an almost sleepy \n             lust.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            I find it restorative, sleeping in \n                            the life-blood of so many.  To feel \n                            their souls coursing about me.\n\n                                       CASSANDRA\n                            What's happening?  What do you want?\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                                (smiling)\n                            So very much.\n\n                                       CASSANDRA\n                            My parents have money...\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place \n                            is everything you said it was, \n                            Amilyn.\n\n             Cassandra turns.  Amilyn stands behind her, grinning.  He \n             hisses, bares his fangs at Cassandra.\n\n                                       CASSANDRA\n                            What... are you?\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            Are we so strange?  So alien to \n                            you?  I've seen this culture, the \n                            wealth, the greed, the waste... \n                            it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect \n                            place to spread my empire.  Honestly, \n                            Eastern Europe was so dead, the \n                            Communists just drained the blood \n                            out of the place.  It's livened up \n                            a bit in the past few years, but \n                            it's nothing compared to this.... \n                            this Mecca of consumption.  The \n                            city of Angels.\n\n             He steps right up to her.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                                (continuing)\n                            What are we?  We are man, perfected.  \n                            We exist to consume.\n\n             On the world \"to consume\" we see Amilyn mouthing the words \n             with Lothos, his eyes to the ceiling.  He's heard this a hundred \n             times.\n\n                                       AMILYN\n                            So?  Do we change this one, or do \n                            we just drain her?\n\n             Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet.\n\n                                       CASSANDRA\n                            Here, look.  My gold card.  It's \n                            your.  I'll never report it.\n\n             Amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            She has a certain quality, this \n                            one...\n\n             Amilyn bites the card.\n\n                                       AMILYN\n                            I don't think this is gold.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            Not as single-minded as the others, \n                            not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful.  \n                            She's useless.\n\n                                       CASSANDRA\n                            No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really.  \n                            Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn.  \n                            I'm useful.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            Really?\n\n                                       CASSANDRA\n                            Swear to God.\n\n             He rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as blood \n             gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, dies.  He \n             hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            I wish you wouldn't mention him...\n\n             Slowly Cassandra slides down the wall, her eyes glazing over.  \n             As she descends we see, stenciled on the wall, \"Hemery High \n             School.

Sunlight pours in through \n             the large windows, practically caked with dust.  Old crates \n             are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or \n             two.  Merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper.\n\n             Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile \n             of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag.  This \n             is definitely not her turf.  She runs her finger along a crate, \n             picks up a world of dust.  She holds up her finger at Merrick.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Fire the help.

The vampires \n                            find a community and they feed on \n                            it, make it their own.  You were \n                            difficult to trace, and I think the \n                            process has gone a lot further than \n                            I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads \n                            a community into some kind of \n                            paranoid frenzy.

He palms it, \n             hands behind his back.\n\n             In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her.  She catches \n             it, reflexively, inches from her face.  Stops dead.

Pike looks at the \n             window for a second, then bolts out of his room.  He runs to \n             the front door, frantically hooks the chain.  Benny appears at \n             the door's little window, banging and scraping the glass.\n\n                                       BENNY\n                            I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!

DESERTED STREET - NIGHT\n\n             Buffy walks slowly down the street, trying to appear nonchalant, \n             but looking about her a lot.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Sure is cold.  What a dark night.  \n                            Nice night for a walk.\n\n             She whistles some, keeps walking.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            'Feelings, la la la la feelings'...  \n                            Boy, I'm helpless.\n\n             She passes an alley and there is a RUSTLING amid the garbage \n             cans.  She moves slowly down the alley toward the noise.  She \n             is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the cans \n             and down a drain.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            Yeucch.\n\n             Behind her, another SOUND.  She turns slowly.  At the entrance \n             to the alley stands a vampire.  They stare at each other, some \n             thirty feet away.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            Hello...\n\n             She moves back a step.  The vampire takes a step.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            What do you want?\n\n             It floats rapidly at her, hissing.  Buffy looks about her \n             frantically, trapped.  It hits her at top speed and she \n             instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it \n             against the wall at the end of the alley.  As it hits, Buffy, \n             still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and throws it \n             directly at its heart.  The stake punctures the startled \n             creature's chest.  Before he can so much as grab it, Buffy \n             throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all the way home \n             with her foot.  The vampire screams, sinks to the ground.\n\n             Buffy turns, triumphant.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            Toaster-caked him!\n\n             CLOSEUP - A STOPWATCH\n\n             A hand stops it.  It is Merrick, who steps into the alley and \n             stares at Buffy.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             EXT. OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n             The two exit Merrick's car, an old Dodge Dart.  As they talk, \n             they make their way into the warehouse.  Buffy looks out for \n             trouble while Merrick unlocks the door.  This is obviously \n             their routine.\n\n                                       MERRICK\n                            He was slow.  Very simple.

Pike \n             straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes INTO \n             THE FRAME, we see there are two more behind him.  They are \n             both high-school age, fresh like Bessel and Benny.  They all \n             approach, slowly.\n\n             Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                                (continuing)\n                            This is for the money, baby.  Make \n                            me proud.\n\n             He turns the key again and the car ROARS to life.  The \n             headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike pops \n             the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires.  They \n             both go flying, hurt but not killed.\n\n             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR\n\n             Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and \n             Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car.  \n             Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly \n             punches through the roof, grabbing at him.  He fights off the \n             hand and tries to control the speeding car.\n\n             It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park.  The \n             car careens along.\n\n             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR\n\n             Amilyn ride it, laughing.\n\n             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR\n\n             Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it.  Still \n             fighting, he aims at the branch.  It gets closer.\n\n             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR\n\n             Amilyn looks up.\n\n             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR\n\n             They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD.  The \n             arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap.\n\n             The car hits another tree dead on.  Pike slams into the steering \n             wheel.  The guitar case flies right through the windshield and \n             lands on the grass.\n\n             Pike pulls himself slowly from the car.  He is bleeding, but \n             not badly.  Just shaken.  He hears a low, seething WAIL from a \n             few yards back and turns around.  Amilyn is getting shakily to \n             his feet.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            Oh, give me a break.\n\n             Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, \n             clutching what's left of his arm.\n\n             One of the other vampires nears him.  Pike tries to run and \n             his knees buckle.  He lands on them right next to the guitar \n             case.  As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the \n             case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head.  He hits \n             him again.  The vampire bats away the guitar and grabs Pike.  \n             Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.\n\n             A blasting kick in the head from Buffy.  The vampire is flung \n             to one side, falls.  He starts up at Buffy and she nails him \n             with a stake.  Pike stares at her.  She pulls a walkie-talkie \n             from her pocket.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (into walkie-talkie)\n                            I'm on the east side, near the \n                            playground...  all right.\n\n             She puts the walkie-talkie back.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            Hi.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            Hi there.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Is that your car?\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            It was.  I think it's pretty much \n                            ready for the --\n\n             The last vampire hits Pike from behind.  Without missing a \n             beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off.  She \n             and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves \n             before she buries the guitar neck in its chest.  It falls.\n\n             Merrick runs up.  He is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker.  \n             He is more modern than he was before, but subtly.  He sees the \n             decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.\n\n                                       MERRICK\n                            Interesting.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I kind of had to improvise.\n                                (to Pike)\n                            Sorry about your guitar.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            That's okay.  Umm, listen, I'm \n                            not.... I have to fall down now.\n\n             Pike's eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into Buffy's \n             arms.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. BOILER ROOM - CLOSEUP ON AMILYN - NIGHT\n\n             Thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and snarling, \n             banging his one fist on the boiler tank.  It booms hollowly.  \n             Lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            What's wrong with you!?!\n\n                                       AMILYN\n                            My arm!

The tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of \n             it, but it still isn't good.\n\n                                       AMILYN\n                                (forlornly)\n                            I look horrible.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            The other two -- the new ones.  \n                            Where are they?\n\n                                       AMILYN\n                            I don't know.

Unbelievable.  Vampires.\n\n             Buffy hands Pike the water and they move back into the living \n             room.  Pike curls up in an armchair by the window.

It's not bleeding much any more, but it's fairly \n             impressive.  Pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with \n             her shirt.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                                (continuing)\n                            Hey, jeez are you okay?

BUFFY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n             Buffy lays her dress on the bed.  We cannot see exactly what \n             it looks like.\n\n             She stuffs some blood-stained clothes into a duffel bag along \n             with some stakes.  She tosses the bag in the closet.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             EXT. THE GYM - PROM NIGHT\n\n             Dozens of limos pull up.  Kids pour inside.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. THE GYM - NIGHT\n\n             The party is underway.  Streamers everywhere, tables by the \n             windows.  Couples dance, a D.J spins the tunes.  There is a \n             setup in one corner for taking prom pictures.  The kids are \n             all very elegant and hip.  Every shade of black is represented.\n\n             ANGLE - PUNCH BOWL\n\n             Nicole and Kimberly stand by the punch bowl, chatting.  They \n             are both wearing slinky little black dresses.\n\n             ANGLE - THE DOOR\n\n             There are two: at one end, leading to the house (it's closed) \n             and one leading outside.  Gary Murray stands by the outside \n             door, on guard, as students enter.  He is looking disdainfully \n             at Andy and holding a flask he has confiscated.\n\n                                       ANDY\n                            Well, it came with the tux.\n\n             Buffy enters the gym.  She is wearing a long white strapless \n             gown.  It is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd.  \n             Over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress.  She \n             enters hesitantly, looking around her for Jeffrey.  She passes \n             Andy, who is moving away from Gary Murray.\n\n                                       ANDY\n                            Buffy!  Looking tasty.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?\n\n             But Andy has moved on.  Buffy works her way through the crowd \n             to the punch bowl, sees Nicole and Kimberly.  They stop \n             whispering real quick.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            Hi, guys.\n\n                                       NICOLE\n                            Hi.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The \n                            limo never showed, I thought he \n                            might be here.\n\n             Nicole and Kimberly look at each other significantly.\n\n                                       NICOLE\n                            I haven't seen him tonight.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Oh.\n\n             She picks up a glass of punch.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            I'm glad you guys are here.

What, didn't you bring your \n                            new friends?\n\n             Buffy is startled by this attack.  Nicole giggles.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I guess you guys are mad at me.  \n                            I'm sorry.  I've been really --\n\n             Jeffrey suddenly appears between them.  Jennifer is on his \n             arm.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                                (continuing)\n                            Jeffrey!  There you are.  I --\n\n             She stops, as everybody assesses the situation.  Buffy is \n             shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt.  Jeffrey is uncomfortable.  \n             Jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment.  Kimberly is in \n             serious giggle, Nicole a bit more restrained, checking it out.\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            Buffy, what are you doing here?\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I thought we were meeting here.\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            I'm here with Jenny.\n\n             -- who is practically hyperventilating, pulling at his arm \n             like a dog on a leash.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I don't understand.\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's \n                            going on.  It's not working out at \n                            all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, \n                            I've got needs, too.  I told you \n                            about all this.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            No, you didn't.  When?\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            Didn't you get my message?\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            You broke up with my machine?\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            You weren't home.  Like always.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            You left me a message?\n\n                                       JEFFREY\n                            I'm out of here.  Jenny.\n\n             At the mention of her name Jenny jumps, and in her haste to \n             get away, she bumps into Buffy's arm, spilling bright red punch \n             on Buffy's chest.  She flees, Jeffrey in tow.  They leave the \n             gym.  Kimberly finds it all pretty funny.  Nicole is silent.\n\n             Buffy turns away, toward the wall.  A soft BALLAD come on over \n             the SPEAKERS.  Tears are forming in Buffy's eyes, as she wipes \n             futilely at her dress.  Finally she turns, looks toward the \n             door.\n\n             BUFFY'S POV\n\n             Pike is there, walking in on his own.  He wears a leather jacket \n             and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced \n             Doc Martins.  He looks great.\n\n             He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            I crashed your party.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Pretty shallow of you.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            That's me.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I'm glad you came.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            Yeah, you look like you're having a \n                            swell time.\n\n             Pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on \n             Buffy's dress.  He looks about him a bit, then without \n             hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains.  \n             Buffy smiles at him.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                                (continuing)\n                            Will I get the shit kicked out of \n                            me if I ask you to dance?\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            I don't actually think Jeffrey's \n                            gonna notice.\n\n             They begin slow dancing, not too close.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                            Yeah, well, you're the one I'm afraid \n                            of.\n\n             They dance for a while, closer and closer.\n\n                                       PIKE\n                                (continuing; gee-whizzically)\n                            You know, you're not like the other \n                            girls.\n\n             Buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in \n             his ear.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Yes, I am.\n\n             We see couples dancing, kissing... Gary Murray watching them.\n\n             ANGLE - KIMBERLY\n\n             Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches Buffy \n             dance disdainfully.\n\n                                       KIMBERLY\n                            I can't believe it.\n\n             The window SHATTERS by her head, a vampire's hand reaching for \n             her.  She screams, starts back.\n\n             Other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around.  A couple \n             of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from \n             the other side.\n\n             Gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the \n             situation.  They vaguely herd to the middle of the room.\n\n             ANGLE - BUFFY AND PIKE\n\n             Looking around, assessing the situation.\n\n             ANGLE - OUTER DOOR\n\n             A STUDENT runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.\n\n                                       BLOODY STUDENT\n                            They're out there!

Then one of the students starts \n             toward the body.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Don't go near the door.\n\n             Buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening \n             as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through \n             the mist.\n\n             Buffy steps back as three 17-year-old vampire come to the door.\n\n                                       1ST VAMPIRE\n                            It's party time.\n\n                                       BUFFY\n                            Don't worry!

Pike turns from the dying vampire and is face to face \n             with Benny.\n\n             Pike is frozen for a moment.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             EXT.

The vampires \n             are several feet behind her, some twenty of them.\n\n             The door is locked.  She smashes it in with her shoulder.  \n             Runs inside.\n\n             A few vampires are about to follow Buffy into the building \n             when a hand is suddenly raised before them, stopping the.  \n             Slowly they start fading back.\n\n             It is Amilyn.  He smiles at the other vampires, and raises his \n             fingers to his lips.\n\n             Shhhh....\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT. THE GYM - CLOSEUP ON A TABLE - SAME TIME\n\n             Pike is slammed down onto it, Benny's face inches from his.  \n             \"Teen Angel\" has been replaced by some hard rock.\n\n                                       BENNY\n                            Isn't this great, Pike?

Finally got those bitches \n                            on the run.\n\n             He hoists Pike up and backhands him in the jaw, sends him flying \n             against a wall.  Pike shakes his head as Benny comes at him \n             again, no longer smiling.\n\n                                       BENNY\n                                (continuing)\n                            Of course I'm angry!

Pike is \n             getting shakily to his feet.  Blood trickles down his forehead.\n\n                                       BENNY\n                                (continuing)\n                            I was gonna change you, man.

Pike \n             passes an overturned table, the stubs of its broken legs \n             sticking up at the ceiling.\n\n                                       BENNY\n                            Never die.  Never get kicked around, \n                            never get busted.\n\n             Benny grabs him with hateful force.

Benny is thrown slightly by this.\n\n             Still holding him, Pike pitches onto the table, driving the \n             leg-shard through Benny's back.  Pike still holds Benny as he \n             twitches and screams, dying.  Finally, he lets go, gets up.  \n             He looks a little dazed, a little lost.  A window shattering \n             far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus, and he goes to \n             help.\n\n             ANGLE - KIMBERLY\n\n             Sitting by a wall, tiny and silent amid the carnage.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT.

The stake flies out of her hand.  It \n             lands on a desk by the window.\n\n             Buffy does not land nearly as well, crashing into a pile of \n             desks and twisting her leg badly.

His \n             strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke.  \n             Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power \n             that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n             INT.

Lothos crashes through the trap door \n             behind her, ugly and crazed.  He picks her up, floating a good \n             two feet off the ground.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            You bitch!\n\n             He hurls her the length of the room.  She hits a locker, which \n             opens, spilling out someone's notebook.  The binder falls open, \n             inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within.\n\n             Buffy looks, by this time, like shit.  She props herself up as \n             best she can, looks about her.  There is nothing wooden, nothing \n             sharp, within reach.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                                (continuing)\n                            You would challenge me?\n\n             Andy charges Lothos from behind.  Pike tries to stop him, but \n             is too late, as Lothos grabs him by the face without even \n             looking at him.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                                (continuing; to Buffy)\n                            I'll rip the flesh from your stinking \n                            bones!\n\n             Squeeze Andy's head until we hear something crack.  Lets him \n             drop.  Looks around at the cowed students.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                                (continuing)\n                            I am a God!

Furious, he charges Buffy, his feet just skimming \n             the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon her...\n\n             She spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion.  She \n             thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like Superman \n             stopping a train, palm at his chest.\n\n             Silence.  Buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus \n             of his face.\n\n             Lothos stops, almost wide-eyed, as he looks down at his chest.\n\n             Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and \n             a #2.\n\n             He steps back, staring at Buffy.  The expression on his horrible \n             face seems to have changed to one almost of respect.  Her look \n             is unfathomable.\n\n             Lothos smiles, graciously.\n\n                                       LOTHOS\n                            It doesn't... hurt... as much as I \n                            had imagined.\n\n             He falls gently to the ground.  He's dust before he hits it.\n\n             Silence.  One by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into the \n             night.\n\n             ANGLE - PIKE\n\n             Kneeling by Andy's body.  He gets up, and walks toward what's \n             left of Lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot.  In the \n             background we see Gary Murray, running out after a vampire.\n\n                                       GARY MURRAY\n                            Just a minute, you!  I'm not finished \n                            with you!\n\n             Pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it.\n\n             Everybody is looking at Buffy.  She stares back at the students \n             who cast her out.  Turns and walks out.  Pike follows her.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n             EXT.

We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees, \n             hills in the background.\n\n             Buffy leads the way.  She is confident, at ease.  She wears a \n             large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward.  Skirt \n             and sneakers.  Casual, cool, but disarming.
