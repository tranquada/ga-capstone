MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET\n</b>\n             We see an Italian village at the height of the plague.  Funeral \n             processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up...  \n             the stench of death all around.\n\n<b>             TITLE:  EUROPE. THE DARK AGES\n</b>\n             Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse.  He is weary but \n             not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts.  \n             He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back.  \n             He enters the inn.\n\n<b>             INT. INN - SAME TIME\n</b>\n             The inn is dark and almost empty.  A couple of patrons drink \n             silently at tables.  Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID, \n             dark-haired and lazy.  She scratches at her shoulder, on which \n             we see a birthmark.  The knight approaches the bar, throws \n             money down.\n\n<b>                                       KNIGHT\n</b>                            A tankard of ale, wench.\n\n             The barmaid pours him a cup of ale.

INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n             The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his \n             room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the doorway, \n             places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a moment, then \n             breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  He laughs a \n             bit, resignedly, and closes the door.\n\n             A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, \n             grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his \n             head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is gray, and \n             peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.\n\n<b>                                       KNIGHT\n</b>                            Oh, my god...\n\n             The vampire licks his lips.\n\n             He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into \n             the middle of the small room.  The knight struggles but is no \n             match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's \n             neck.  The knight screams.\n\n<b>             ANGLE ON DOOR\n</b>\n             It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.\n\n             The vampire turns like a frightened animal.  In the doorway \n             stands the barmaid, a SLAYER.  In her hand is a wooden stake.\n\n             The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner.  \n             The Slayer and the vampire come at each other.  The Slayer \n             spins and kicks; the vampire flies back.  Snarling, he comes \n             back at the slayer.  They struggle; he slips free and is out \n             the door.\n\n             For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor.  \n             The knight watches her.  She seems to be making a decision -- \n             perhaps even knows what is going to happen.\n\n             She runs at the window.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>             EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME\n</b>\n             The vampire comes running out the front door.  Before he is a \n             few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through \n             the upstairs window and lands on him.  They both hit the ground, \n             and she plants the stake right in his heart.\n\n             After a moment, we hear a voice:\n\n<b>                                       AMILYN (O.S.)\n</b>                            The lord giveth, and the lord taketh \n                            away.

At the front, maybe ten feet \n             away, is AMILYN.\n\n             Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King.  \n             His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery.  He \n             ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.\n\n             Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King.  His skin is deep white, \n             and smooth.  He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any \n             era.  He is practically upon her before he speaks.\n\n<b>                                       LOTHOS\n</b>                            You must forgive Amilyn.

Amilyn laughs \n             obnoxiously.  Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings \n             her to him in a loving embrace.\n\n<b>                                       LOTHOS\n</b>                                (continuing)\n                            We can't be stopped.

He digs in his \n             pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly.  \n             While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on \n             the railing.

The car has stalled at an intersection.  \n             Pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down as he listens to \n             the rasping ENGINE.\n\n<b>                                       PIKE\n</b>                            Come on, come on.

Pike finally \n             hears the SCRAPING OF HIS FEET as he approaches the car.  Pike \n             straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes INTO \n             THE FRAME, we see there are two more behind him.  They are \n             both high-school age, fresh like Bessel and Benny.  They all \n             approach, slowly.\n\n             Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.\n\n<b>                                       PIKE\n</b>                                (continuing)\n                            This is for the money, baby.  Make \n                            me proud.\n\n             He turns the key again and the car ROARS to life.  The \n             headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike pops \n             the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires.  They \n             both go flying, hurt but not killed.\n\n<b>             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR\n</b>\n             Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and \n             Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car.  \n             Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly \n             punches through the roof, grabbing at him.  He fights off the \n             hand and tries to control the speeding car.\n\n             It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park.  The \n             car careens along.\n\n<b>             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR\n</b>\n             Amilyn ride it, laughing.\n\n<b>             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR\n</b>\n             Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it.  Still \n             fighting, he aims at the branch.  It gets closer.\n\n<b>             ANGLE - ON TOP OF THE CAR\n</b>\n             Amilyn looks up.\n\n<b>             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR\n</b>\n             They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD.  The \n             arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap.\n\n             The car hits another tree dead on.  Pike slams into the steering \n             wheel.  The guitar case flies right through the windshield and \n             lands on the grass.\n\n             Pike pulls himself slowly from the car.  He is bleeding, but \n             not badly.  Just shaken.  He hears a low, seething WAIL from a \n             few yards back and turns around.  Amilyn is getting shakily to \n             his feet.\n\n<b>                                       PIKE\n</b>                            Oh, give me a break.\n\n             Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, \n             clutching what's left of his arm.\n\n             One of the other vampires nears him.  Pike tries to run and \n             his knees buckle.  He lands on them right next to the guitar \n             case.  As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the \n             case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head.  He hits \n             him again.  The vampire bats away the guitar and grabs Pike.  \n             Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.\n\n             A blasting kick in the head from Buffy.  The vampire is flung \n             to one side, falls.  He starts up at Buffy and she nails him \n             with a stake.  Pike stares at her.  She pulls a walkie-talkie \n             from her pocket.\n\n<b>                                       BUFFY\n</b>                                (into walkie-talkie)\n                            I'm on the east side, near the \n                            playground...  all right.\n\n             She puts the walkie-talkie back.\n\n<b>                                       BUFFY\n</b>                                (continuing)\n                            Hi.\n\n<b>                                       PIKE\n</b>                            Hi there.\n\n<b>                                       BUFFY\n</b>                            Is that your car?\n\n<b>                                       PIKE\n</b>                            It was.

Without missing a \n             beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off.  She \n             and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves \n             before she buries the guitar neck in its chest.  It falls.\n\n             Merrick runs up.  He is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker.  \n             He is more modern than he was before, but subtly.  He sees the \n             decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.\n\n<b>                                       MERRICK\n</b>                            Interesting.\n\n<b>                                       BUFFY\n</b>                            I kind of had to improvise.\n                                (to Pike)\n                            Sorry about your guitar.\n\n<b>                                       PIKE\n</b>                            That's okay.
