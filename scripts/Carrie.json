It's the\r\n\r\n<b>   EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) \u00ad DAY\r\n</b>\r\n1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned,\r\n   spotless \u00ad a vision of small town normalcy and virtue.\r\n\r\n   This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems\r\n   to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to\r\n   have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.\r\n\r\n   We hear a woman's voice:\r\n\r\n                                 MARGARET (o.s.)\r\n                          Carrie! Carrie\r\n\r\n   The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue,\r\n   which initially involves:\r\n\r\n<b>2. STELLA HORAN \u00ad DAY\r\n</b>\r\n   An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy\r\n   white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.\r\n\r\n   The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body \u00ad luxuriant, taking it in\r\n   inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming\r\n   from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard.\r\n\r\n<b>3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE \u00ad STELLA\r\n</b>\r\n   As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half-\r\n   grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door.\r\n\r\n<b>                                VOICE (O.S.)\r\n</b>                          What are those?\r\n<b>                                                                                                    2\r\n</b>\r\n<b>4. STELLA'S POV \u00ad CARRIE WHITE\r\n</b>\r\n  A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-\r\n  white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a\r\n  pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella\r\n  through the hedge.\r\n\r\n<b>                                STELLA\r\n</b>                         Hiya, Carrie.

But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she\r\n    too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge.\r\n\r\n    She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.\r\n\r\n<b>                                   STELLA\r\n</b>                           Now, honey, that's just silly.

The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets\r\n  out a bloodcurdling scream:\r\n\r\n<b>                            MARGARET\r\n</b><b>                  CAARRIEETTAAA!!!\r\n</b>\r\n<b> 8 CARRIE, STELLA\r\n</b>   Both frozen by this terrible sound\r\n\r\n<b> 9 STELLA'S POV \u00ad CLOSER ON CARRIE\r\n</b>\r\n  As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks\r\n  quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she\r\n  seems to smile \u00ad or is she about to cry?\r\n\r\n  And then, she's gone \u00ad running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the\r\n  White house as fast her legs can carry her.\r\n\r\n<b>10.

It's utterly silent for a\r\n  moment.\r\n\r\n  And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White\r\n  house \u00ad an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs\r\n  that she's sorry, that she forgot.\r\n\r\n<b>                               STELLA\r\n</b>                         Mother!\r\n                               (louder)\r\n                         Mother!\r\n<b>                                                                                                     5\r\n</b>\r\n<b>11.

Only the Horans no longer live here. No\r\n  one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From\r\n  the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago.\r\n\r\n<b>23 EXT. TOWN STREETS \u00ad DAY\r\n</b>\r\n  Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her\r\n  house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out,\r\n  an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us\r\n  about this possibility, there is MUSIC.\r\n\r\n<b>24 BOBBY ERBETER\r\n</b>\r\n  About five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on\r\n  a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels.\r\n<b>                                                                                                    9\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>                                  BOBBY\r\n</b>                          Hey, fart-face!

Supervising the game is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm-up suit and holding a\r\n whistle awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously watching for the ball\r\n to come her way. It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily.\r\n When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce:\r\n\r\n<b>                       COLLINS\r\n</b>                Okay, now.

And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes\r\n over the net toward Carrie. It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her\r\n success. The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier.\r\n\r\n The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie. Carrie almost\r\n trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.\r\n\r\n Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line \u00ad straight into the net.\r\n\r\n Another chorus of groans, with remarks like \"Wouldn't you know!\" and \"Dumbo!\"\r\n reinforcing them.

She is soaping herself. In a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders,\r\n  moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles.

It is almost steaming as she steps in.\r\n\r\n   Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean.\r\n\r\n   Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself off briefly, puts on her robe, and turns off the\r\n   bathroom light. What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to focus on Carrie.\r\n\r\n<b>326 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n   Carrie returns to her room. She is clean now; her wet hair hangs. A feeling of despair about\r\n   her or perhaps she is emptied out.\r\n\r\n   Carrie almost mouths:\r\n\r\n<b>                       CARRIE\r\n</b>                   Momma...\r\n\r\n   It is a little child's voice and there is no answer.\r\n\r\n   She goes out into the hallway.\r\n\r\n<b>327 INT.

Once again, she mouths the words:\r\n<b>                                                                                            121\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                      CARRIE\r\n</b>                  Momma...\r\n\r\n   Something \u00ad a movement? An instinct? -- makes her turn. She sees:\r\n\r\n<b>328 MARGARET\r\n</b>\r\n   Coming toward her.\r\n\r\n<b>329 CARRIE\r\n</b>\r\n   She flings out her arms and cries out:\r\n\r\n<b>                        CARRIE\r\n</b>                  Oh, Momma!\r\n\r\n   And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick\r\n   movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach.\r\n\r\n   Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand.\r\n\r\n   Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs.\r\n\r\n<b>330 ANGLE DOWN STAIRS\r\n</b>\r\n   On Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n<b>331 MARGARET\r\n</b>\r\n   Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.\r\n\r\n<b>   MARGARET\r\n</b>   It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'\r\n\r\n<b>332 CARRIE\r\n</b>\r\n   Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted.

She raises the knife and\r\n   starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her.\r\n\r\n<b>                          MARGARET\r\n</b>                  I should have killed you when you were born.\r\n\r\n<b>                      CARRIE\r\n</b>                  Momma, I love you.

Carrie flexes, and a serving fork \u00ad dangling from a hook on\r\n   the way \u00ad suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and\r\n   another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret.\r\n\r\n   Margaret collapses.\r\n\r\n   Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother.\r\n\r\n   And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling\r\n   her screams.\r\n\r\n<b>                        CARRIE\r\n</b>                  You.

Boxes in the midst of\r\n   being packed.\r\n\r\n   Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving. She\r\n   sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. And she\r\n   comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now. They\r\n   have a momentary hypnotic effect on her.\r\n\r\n   The phone RINGS, startling her. She rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first\r\n   or second ring.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELEANOR\r\n</b>                          (hushed voice)\r\n                  Hello?

Sleeping too much, I guess, but Schneider says that's to be\r\n                  expected after what she's gone through. He says she's young enough\r\n                  to forget it in time. Knock wood.\r\n\r\n   As Eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera conveys her tension. Half of her\r\n   is listening and talking to Betty; the rest of her mind is on Sue upstairs. With good reason.\r\n   Because:\r\n<b>                                                                                               126\r\n</b>\r\n<b>343 EXT.

And a FOR SALE sign.\r\n\r\n   We PAN over next door where the White house used to stand. It, too, is vacant but utterly\r\n   bald \u00ad there's been no time for anything to grow here. There is another FOR SALE sign put\r\n   up by Born Realty.\r\n\r\n<b>344 SUE SNELL\r\n</b>\r\n   looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring\r\n   at the lot.

We come closer on the sign\r\n   which now starts appearing a bit odder \u00ad less like a simple FOR SALE sign and more like a\r\n   grave marker.\r\n\r\n   And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk\r\n   on the sign:\r\n\r\n<b>                    CARRIE WHITE IS BURNING IN HELL FOR HER SINS\r\n</b>\r\n   And below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's notion of one final joke:\r\n\r\n<b>                                       JESUS NEVER FAILS\r\n</b>\r\n<b>346 SUE\r\n</b>\r\n   as she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carrying next to the marker. She proceeds to try\r\n   to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly.\r\n\r\n   She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower. Suddenly, a second\r\n   hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown.\r\n\r\n   A bloody hand.\r\n\r\n   A hand from the Earth itself.\r\n\r\n   Carrie's hand\r\n\r\n   It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist.
