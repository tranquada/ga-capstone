Cohen & Stephen King\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   FADE IN:\r\n\r\n   From an absolutely glistening WHITE \u00ad an image which first appears to be a\r\n   brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid\r\n   matter, less of a mystery. It's the\r\n\r\n   EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned,\r\n   spotless \u00ad a vision of small town normalcy and virtue.\r\n\r\n   This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems\r\n   to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to\r\n   have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.\r\n\r\n   We hear a woman's voice:\r\n\r\n                                 MARGARET (o.s.)\r\n                          Carrie! Carrie\r\n\r\n   The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue,\r\n   which initially involves:\r\n\r\n2. STELLA HORAN \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n   An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy\r\n   white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.\r\n\r\n   The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body \u00ad luxuriant, taking it in\r\n   inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming\r\n   from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard.\r\n\r\n3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE \u00ad STELLA\r\n\r\n   As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half-\r\n   grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door.\r\n\r\n                                VOICE (O.S.)\r\n                          What are those?\r\n                                                                                                    2\r\n\r\n4. STELLA'S POV \u00ad CARRIE WHITE\r\n\r\n  A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-\r\n  white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a\r\n  pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella\r\n  through the hedge.\r\n\r\n                                STELLA\r\n                         Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.\r\n                                (turning down the radio)\r\n                         How long have you been there?\r\n\r\n                               CARRIE\r\n                               (not smiling; pointing with her finger)\r\n                         What are those?\r\n\r\n  Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing\r\n  her breasts \u00ad white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit \u00ad not out of any particular\r\n  modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.\r\n\r\n                                STELLA\r\n                         Those are my breasts, honey.\r\n\r\n                                 CARRIE\r\n                                 (a beat; then solemnly)\r\n                         I wish I had some.\r\n\r\n                                STELLA\r\n                         You will. `Course you'll have to wait a\r\n                         couple of years, but \u00ad\r\n\r\n                               CARRIE\r\n                               (a fact)\r\n                         No I won't.\r\n\r\n                               STELLA\r\n                         Why, sure you will.\r\n\r\n                                CARRIE\r\n                                (emphatic)\r\n                         No, I won't.\r\n                                (glancing behind her)\r\n                         Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't.\r\n                                                                                                   3\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  STELLA\r\n                                  (at something of a loss)\r\n                   Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?\r\n\r\n5    CARRIE\r\n    Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door.\r\n    She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is:\r\n\r\n                                      CARRIE\r\n                   ...dirtypillows.\r\n\r\n                                      STELLA\r\n                   What?\r\n\r\n                                 CARRIE\r\n               Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them\r\n               `cuz she was bad when she made me.\r\n\r\n6   STELLA\r\n\r\n    Incredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she\r\n    too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge.\r\n\r\n    She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.\r\n\r\n                                   STELLA\r\n                           Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen \u00ad you must be real\r\n                           hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and\r\n                           get us some lemonade, would you like that?\r\n\r\n7   CARRIE\r\n\r\n    Clearly torn \u00ad tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror \u00ad as if she expected the\r\n    earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head.\r\n\r\n                                      STELLA\r\n                           C'mon.\r\n                                    (offering her hand)\r\n                           It'll be our secret.\r\n\r\n    Carrie \u00ad now really scared \u00ad shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge.\r\n                                                                                                    4\r\n\r\n                                    CARRIE\r\n                         I can't!\r\n\r\n                                STELLA\r\n                         Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and \u00ad\r\n\r\n  And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house.\r\n  Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably\r\n  MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets\r\n  out a bloodcurdling scream:\r\n\r\n                            MARGARET\r\n                  CAARRIEETTAAA!!!\r\n\r\n 8 CARRIE, STELLA\r\n   Both frozen by this terrible sound\r\n\r\n 9 STELLA'S POV \u00ad CLOSER ON CARRIE\r\n\r\n  As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks\r\n  quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she\r\n  seems to smile \u00ad or is she about to cry?\r\n\r\n  And then, she's gone \u00ad running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the\r\n  White house as fast her legs can carry her.\r\n\r\n10. STELLA\r\n\r\n  Stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a\r\n  moment.\r\n\r\n  And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White\r\n  house \u00ad an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs\r\n  that she's sorry, that she forgot.\r\n\r\n                               STELLA\r\n                         Mother!\r\n                               (louder)\r\n                         Mother!\r\n                                                                                                     5\r\n\r\n11. THE HORAN HOUSE\r\n\r\n  As MRS. HORAN \u00ad in an old housedress with the hem falling down in the back \u00ad rushes out\r\n  to answer to her daughter's call.\r\n\r\n                                 MRS. HORAN\r\n                          What in the name of God? What's the matter?\r\n\r\n                                  STELLA\r\n                                  (frantic)\r\n                          I don't know... Carrie was just talking to me,\r\n                          and Mrs. White started screaming and...\r\n\r\n12. THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\n  The sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot. Again, it should appear like a huge\r\n  glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less distinct\r\n  babble of another:\r\n\r\n                                  MARGARET (v.o.)\r\n                          I told you to stay away from there, I told you....\r\n\r\n                                 CARRIE (v.o.)\r\n                          I'm sorry, Momma.\r\n\r\n                                   MARGARET (v.o.)\r\n                          ...to stay away from that girl, that whore...\r\n\r\n                                  CARRIE (v.o.)\r\n                          Please, Momma!\r\n\r\n                                  MARGARET (v.o.)\r\n                          ... of Babylon!\r\n\r\n  Which continues over:\r\n\r\n13. TWO SHOT \u00ad STELLA AND MRS. HORAN\r\n\r\n  Their eyes riveted on the house \u00ad trying, squinting to see through the sun's terrible glare.\r\n\r\n                                 STELLA\r\n                          Don't you yell at her like that! Stop that!\r\n\r\n                                 MRS. HORAN\r\n                          That poor sweet child...\r\n                                                                                                    6\r\n\r\n                               STELLA\r\n                         Mother, we've got to do something!\r\n\r\n                                 MRS. HORAN\r\n                         What?\r\n\r\n                                 STELLA\r\n                         Call the police? Mother, call the police!\r\n\r\n                                MRS. HORAN\r\n                                (not about to interfere; hopeless)\r\n                         The child...\r\n\r\n  At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo; we should be able to pick out phrases\r\n  in this cacophony as Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for forgiveness;\r\n  as Carrie's frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot, that she's sorry. And then\r\n  suddenly the screaming stops and it's quiet \u00ad dead quiet.\r\n\r\n14 THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\n  As it becomes more distinct, visible. There's a low WHISTLING sound, and then what\r\n  appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof.\r\n\r\n  Another, slightly larger one appears a second or two later. And then another, and another,\r\n  and...\r\n\r\n15 TIGHTER TWO SHOT \u00ad STELLA AND MRS. HORAN\r\n\r\n  squinting, blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like marbles.\r\n\r\n16 THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\n  as it's pelted with what are now even larger stones \u00ad WHISTLING, SCREAMING in the air\r\n  like miniature bombs.\r\n\r\n  Stones from a perfectly blue summer day.\r\n\r\n  Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs.\r\n\r\n  One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn. CRASHING, CRACKING\r\n  SOUNDS as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing, leaving holes.\r\n\r\n  The effect is that of a drum being bombarded.\r\n                                                                                                 7\r\n\r\n\r\n17. TWO SHOT \u00ad MRS. HORAN AND STELLA\r\n\r\n  Frozen to the spot: Mrs. Horan with her hands over her ears, her screams blending with the\r\n  SOUND of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout\r\n  screaming:\r\n\r\n                                 MARGARET'S VOICE\r\n                          Stop that! Stop that!\r\n\r\n  Stella is clutching Mrs. Horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms \u00ad a\r\n  healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this\r\n  nightmarish moment.\r\n\r\n18 THE HOUSE\r\n\r\n  As still larger stones hail from the sky.\r\n\r\n  And then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started, they stop.\r\n\r\n19 TWO SHOT \u00ad THE WOMEN\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter standing next to her, transfixed on\r\n  the lawn. Once again, it's quiet.\r\n\r\n20 THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\n  As one final stone \u00ad this one the size of a mere pebble \u00ad falls from the roof and plops onto\r\n  the lawn.\r\n\r\n  The image grows lighter and lighter. All the color seems to bleach out, turning the screen\r\n  once again into an incredible, silently blazing white.\r\n\r\n  MAIN TITLES.\r\n\r\n21 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE \u00ad MORNING\r\n\r\n  Now some years later \u00ad and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the\r\n  front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the\r\n  doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs\r\n  behind her.\r\n                                                                                                   8\r\n\r\n\r\n  She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress \u00ad much too long, not so much out of style as utterly\r\n  without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we\r\n  glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes.\r\n\r\n  As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear:\r\n\r\n                                   MARGARET'S VOICE\r\n                         Carrie!\r\n\r\n  Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house.\r\n\r\n                               CARRIE\r\n                         Yes, Momma.\r\n\r\n                               MARGARET'S VOICE\r\n                         You come straight home from school.\r\n\r\n  A moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but:\r\n\r\n                                CARRIE\r\n                                (sweetly)\r\n                         I always do, Momma.\r\n\r\n  Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening.\r\n\r\n22. EXT WHITE HOUSE \u00ad ANOTHER ANGLE\r\n\r\n  As Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of\r\n  which she passes by where the Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No\r\n  one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From\r\n  the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago.\r\n\r\n23 EXT. TOWN STREETS \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n  Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her\r\n  house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out,\r\n  an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest.

In fact, he turns, clasps his hands\r\n  over his head, to the delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off;\r\n  he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it.\r\n\r\n30 FROMM\r\n\r\n                              FROMM\r\n                       Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a\r\n                       touchdown...

Is that the beautiful you mean?\r\n\r\n   The class is snickering. Carrie throws a despairing glance toward Tommy. Tommy looks at\r\n   her, and away, embarrassed. Carrie looks down at her desk, almost burying herself.\r\n\r\n                        FROMM\r\n                That isn't exactly a criticism, Miss White.\r\n                        (looking around)\r\n                Anyone else?\r\n                        (no one else)\r\n                Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White\r\n                          to say something!\r\n\r\n   Tommy looks toward Carrie, with something suggesting compassion.\r\n   Then he looks toward Fromm, and he is muttering something.

VOLLEYBALL COURT \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n Two teams of girls, among them NORMA WATSON, HELEN SHYRES, CORA and\r\n RHONDA WILSON (sisters although not identical twins), CHRIS HARGENSEN and SUE\r\n SNELL. Supervising the game is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm-up suit and holding a\r\n whistle awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously watching for the ball\r\n to come her way. It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily.\r\n When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce:\r\n\r\n                       COLLINS\r\n                Okay, now. This is game point.\r\n\r\n This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team\r\n as Carrie).\r\n\r\n                      RHONDA\r\n                      (giving the score)\r\n                Twenty \u00ad Twenty.\r\n\r\n The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley\r\n it back and forth over the net. And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes\r\n over the net toward Carrie. It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her\r\n success. The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier.\r\n\r\n The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie. Carrie almost\r\n trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.\r\n\r\n Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line \u00ad straight into the net.\r\n\r\n Another chorus of groans, with remarks like \"Wouldn't you know!\" and \"Dumbo!\"\r\n reinforcing them. Chris storms back toward Carrie.\r\n\r\n                      CHRIS\r\n                      (low, harsh)\r\n                You eat shit!\r\n\r\n Miss Collins blows her WHISTLE.\r\n\r\n                                                                                          CUT TO:\r\n                                                                                                 13\r\n\r\n\r\n37 INT SHOWER ROOM \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n  Steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual\r\n  showers. They banter little barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family plaints,\r\n  talk of college \u00ad all of which we hear from separate stalls.\r\n\r\n  One by one the showers are turned off, the girls stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps,\r\n  toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. Steam hangs in the air.\r\n  So do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting.\r\n\r\n  `...Tommy says he hated it on me... My sister's husband picks his nose... So does your\r\n  sister... too cheap to spend a penny... we'll go after school... I'm going with Billy, we'll\r\n  meet you... Friday night...'\r\n\r\n  We PICK UP Miss Collins as she steps among the girls, spies Carrie still standing under the\r\n  shower. She claps her hands together once, smartly.\r\n\r\n                          COLLINS\r\n                 What are you waiting for, Carrie?\r\n                          (as Carrie looks at her)\r\n                 Bell in five minutes.\r\n\r\n                          CARRIE\r\n                 Oh uh?\r\n\r\n  As Collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward their lockers, Carrie is left alone\r\n  in her shower stall. She is soaping herself. In a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders,\r\n  moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles. Her hand goes\r\n  out of frame, below her stomach. Slowly, it emerges back into frame \u00ad full of blood. And\r\n  just as she and we see this, so do the girls.\r\n\r\n                        CHRIS\r\n                 Peer-iod! Peer-iod!\r\n\r\n  Carrie stares at her dumbly.\r\n\r\n  The other girls are quick to take up the chant. Chris leads them.\r\n\r\n                        GIRLS\r\n                 Peer-iod! Peer-iod!

For a while, like counterpoint, he chants overlap; then the\r\nnew chant emerges solely:\r\n\r\n                        GIRLS\r\n                Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!

Carrie just stares at it.\r\n\r\n                        NORMA\r\n                She thinks they're for lipstick.\r\n\r\nBehind her, another girl pretends to throw up.\r\n\r\nShrieks of laughter. Another tampon strikes Carrie. Another. The girls are bombarding her\r\nwith tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on\r\nthe wall. As they bombard Carrie:\r\n\r\n                        GIRLS\r\n                Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up....\r\n\r\nWe isolate Sue Snell at the moment she joins in the chant, and watch her beginning to be\r\ncaught up in what can only be described as a fury.\r\n\r\nCarrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and louder.\r\n\r\nThe door is flung open by Collins.\r\n\r\n                        COLLINS\r\n                                                                                               15\r\n\r\n                What is this?\r\n\r\nAnd she takes it in. She jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows! The sound is\r\nlouder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't).\r\n\r\nAnd there is sudden silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COLLINS\r\n                       (to girls)\r\n                Get out!

Eleanor stands there, completely exasperated but retaining her politeness\r\n like a steel, middle-class glove. She accompanies Margaret to the door and the latter leaves.\r\n Eleanor is about to close the door, stops, seeing:\r\n\r\n71 EXT SNELL HOUSE \u00ad FROM DOOR \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n  Sue is coming toward the door.

Like always.\r\n\r\n    HOLD ON Sue, staring at the tracts on the table (or perhaps out the window as Margaret\r\n   leaves). A long beat, then:\r\n\r\n                                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n72 CARRIE\r\n\r\n    Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street.\r\n   She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe \u00ad her plain dress and school books\r\n   on the narrow bed.\r\n\r\n    She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of \"Seventeen\" \u00ad absorbed in the\r\n   mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men.\r\n   An escape of sorts.\r\n\r\n   And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's\r\n   decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i.e. high school pennant) that Margaret would\r\n   allow in exchange for her own prices \u00ad a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an\r\n   equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various\r\n   religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall.\r\n\r\n73 ANGLE \u00ad FEATURING CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Caught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick\r\n   Madison Avenue mind. And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's\r\n   about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to\r\n   see:\r\n\r\n74 EXT THE STREET \u00ad MARGARET\r\n\r\n   As this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. Another woman like this would be\r\n   coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black.\r\n\r\n75 CLOSEUP \u00ad CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Her heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier \u00ad a scared little girl\r\n   now encased in the body of an adolescent.\r\n\r\n   As she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat,\r\n   Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we hear\r\n   the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea.\r\n                                                                                                  28\r\n\r\n  And then the telephone RINGS \u00ad only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver. It's just as\r\n  Carrie dreaded \u00ad it's the school \u00ad and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear\r\n  Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice \u00ad not\r\n  yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity \u00ad she calls up the stairs:\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET'S VOICE\r\n                 I know you're listening. Come downstairs.\r\n\r\n  And defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the:\r\n\r\n76 HALLWAY, STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, FOLLOWING CARRIE\r\n\r\n  As she hurries down toward her mother and into:\r\n\r\n77 INT WHITE KITCHEN \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n  Where Margaret is standing by the stove, her back to her in stony silence.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 Hello, Momma.\r\n\r\n  No response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether\r\n  strange little kitchen \u00ad a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art \u00ad Margaret is a rock.\r\n                                                                                                29\r\n\r\n  Carrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk. Yet she\r\n  recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready. They've\r\n  been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie breaks.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n                 Who was it that called?\r\n                       (no response)\r\n                 What did they say?\r\n\r\n78 MARGARET\r\n\r\n  Point one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn't respond immediately. Then she turns\r\n  from the stove.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                        (softly)\r\n                 You're a woman now.\r\n\r\n                      CARRIE\r\n                 Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared...\r\n\r\n  Margaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She puts on rimless glasses, then\r\n  opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her\r\n  face:\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                 `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam.

He is really puzzled. He steals a look at Sue. He starts\r\nto put his arm around her; she moves a little, subtly but clearly. Tommy stares off into space\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n                       TOMMY\r\n               I never thought about her.

Of course she knows. And he is beginning to understand.\r\n\r\nTommy looks straight ahead again. He is starting to think. It's not all that easy.\r\n\r\n                      TOMMY\r\n                      (almost under his breath)\r\n               Carrie White?\r\n\r\nIt does come out as a question.\r\n\r\n                                                                                DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                                                                                             39\r\n\r\n91 INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n  Margaret is at the sewing machine. She is either listening to a reasonable facsimile of\r\n  Kathryn Kuhlman preaching on the radio, or instead, to an old Victrola which plays\r\n  Tennessee Ernie Ford's \"Let the Lower Lights Be Burning.\" A Black Forest cuckoo clock,\r\n  providing a sense of lapsed time.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly the treadle on the sewing machine depresses itself. The needle begins to dip up and\r\n  down; the bobbin whirs and jerks.\r\n\r\n  Margaret turns around to see:\r\n\r\n92 CARRIE\r\n\r\n  She is standing in the entrance of the living room. Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm,\r\n  almost too calm.\r\n\r\n93 MARGARET\r\n\r\n  A touch of fear in her eyes. But:\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                  Go to bed.\r\n\r\n94 CARRIE\r\n\r\n  She crosses over to her mother, kisses her lightly on the (unmoving) head.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                  Good night, Momma.\r\n\r\n  Carrie goes to the stairs.\r\n\r\n95 UP THE STAIRS\r\n\r\n  With Carrie.\r\n\r\n96 UPPER HALLWAY\r\n\r\n  Carrie goes into her room.\r\n                                                                                                     40\r\n\r\n97 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n  Carrie turns on a light. She undresses slowly, wearily. And then she stops and looks at\r\n  herself in the mirror. A close, tired inspection. Her eyes seem hollow, haunted. Carrie\r\n  doesn't like what she sees; she doesn't like herself.\r\n\r\n  Flex. Slowly cracks appear in the mirror, spiderwebs.\r\n\r\n  Flex. The mirror cracks wider.\r\n\r\n  And flex: the mirror shatters, crashes to the dresser in pieces, loudly; some of the pieces fall\r\n  on the floor.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                 Carrie! Carrie? Carrie!\r\n\r\n  A moment of utter panic \u00ad now what?\r\n\r\n98 HALLWAY STAIRS\r\n\r\n  As Margaret strides up them, past the landing, and tries the knob on Carrie's door. It's\r\n  locked. She rattles the knob. But to no avail. Then:\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                 Carrie! Carrie, open this door!\r\n                         (a beat; nothing)\r\n                 Carrie!\r\n\r\n  Another beat; then:\r\n\r\n                         CARRIE'S VOICE\r\n                         (sweetly)\r\n                 It's open, Momma.\r\n\r\n  Margaret tries the knob again, and it is, indeed, open.\r\n\r\n99 INT CARRIE'S ROOM\r\n\r\n  Where Carrie is kneeling by her bed, now in her flannel nightgown, praying.\r\n\r\n                       MARGARET\r\n                 What was that noise?\r\n\r\n                         CARRIE\r\n                                                                                                    41\r\n\r\n                  Nothing, Momma.\r\n\r\n   Margaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, no mistake about it. But there it\r\n   is \u00ad whole again as her reflection in it testifies. Margaret walks over to it, rearranges the\r\n   plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on the dresser.\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                  Go to bed.\r\n\r\n   She leaves the doorway and we return to Carrie, who smiles sweetly. And then:\r\n\r\n   Flex.\r\n\r\n   The door slams closed.\r\n\r\n100 INT.

Just who I've been looking for!\r\n\r\n   Sue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile. Chris slides into the booth across from\r\n   her and thrusts her John F.

INTERSECTION \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   As a '61 Chevy leaves a sizeable patch of rubber on the street as it GRINDS to a hard stop,\r\n   just barely halting before it almost went through a red light and collided with the traffic\r\n   already in the intersection.\r\n\r\n134 INT. THE CHEVY\r\n\r\n   which belongs to the aforementioned BILLY NOLAN \u00ad a character whose life and brains\r\n   stopped around the time he saw \"Rebel\" on television. He's Chris's boyfriend, and a huge\r\n   cross swings around his neck. Right now, he's utterly amused by his harrowing driving, and\r\n   turns to Chris who ignores him, still brooding over her afternoon losses. Billy takes a huge\r\n   toke from a joint and hands it to her; she ignores that too, and proceeds to busy herself\r\n   applying makeup in the visor window. So Billy looks out his window and strikes up some\r\n   banter with a fellow cruiser idling beside them at the light. The light changes, and Billy peels\r\n   out \u00ad an action with throws Chris backwards onto the seat.\r\n\r\n                        CHRIS\r\n                   Goddamnit, Billy!\r\n\r\n   He just laughs as he weaves through traffic.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n                         (continuing)\r\n                   Slow down!\r\n                         (as he pays no heed)\r\n                   Slow down, you stupid shit!\r\n\r\n                          BILLY\r\n                   Scared, Chuckie?\r\n\r\n                        CHRIS\r\n                   No. You'll kill us, you stupid shit!\r\n\r\n   Billy lazily slaps her, speeds up.\r\n                                                                                         54\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n                  Don't call me that.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n                  Stupid shit.\r\n\r\n   He slaps her again.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n                         (continuing; under her breath)\r\n                  Stupid shit.\r\n\r\n                       BILLY\r\n                       (disgustedly)\r\n                  Oh wow!\r\n\r\n   He slams on the brakes, and pulls into:\r\n\r\n135 EXT.

Then, after some time, he leans over and kisses her. She lets him. He kisses her\r\nagain, and she responds. He goes at it. And she squirms away.\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n                         (continuing)\r\n                Hell is this?\r\n\r\n                       CHRIS\r\n                I want you to do something.\r\n                                                                                             56\r\n\r\n                         BILLY|\r\n                 What?\r\n                        (eagerly)\r\n                 Yeah, what?\r\n\r\n                        CHRIS\r\n                 I want you to do something for me.

Billy is\r\n   beginning to writhe; he moves in on her, but she holds him off, playing him like a puppet.\r\n\r\n                          CHRIS\r\n                          (continuing)\r\n                 Billy, I hate Carrie White.\r\n\r\n   CUT TO:\r\n\r\n137 TELEVISION SCREEN\r\n\r\n   On which we see the opening, helicopter-credit-sequence from \"Duel at Diablo.\" The\r\n   television is in:\r\n\r\n138 INT. SNELL LIVING ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Where the movie's SOUND continues uninterrupted for a bit over an incredible silence\r\n   between Tommy and Sue. They are sitting on a couch.

WHITE HALLWAY \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n  Margaret slowly opens the door to Carrie's room and enters. Light filters in from the street.\r\n  Carrie is lying in bed, motionless, asleep.\r\n\r\n  Margaret crosses the room quietly. She leans over the bed. On the table next to it is the\r\n  glow-in-the-dark statue \u00ad not in its usual place on the dresser. Carrie's face, in the soft light,\r\n  seems very innocent.\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                         (low)\r\n                 Carrie, did you pray?\r\n\r\n  No answer.\r\n\r\n  Margaret bends over Carrie. And with surprising tenderness, she kisses Carrie's forehead.\r\n\r\n  The she straightens up quickly, as though she has violated herself, and leaves the room.\r\n\r\n  Carrie opens her eyes. She pulls a book out from under the covers; then she stares at the\r\n  Madonna-child figurine, it begins to glow brighter and brighter, illuminating the room. It's\r\n  bright enough to read by now, and we leave Carrie expanding her education and:\r\n\r\n                                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n140 INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n  As Carrie examines a shelf of books with titles like \"Cosmic Consciousness\" and R.D.\r\n  Ogilve's \"Hidden Powers of the Mind.\" She decides on the latter just as a voice startles her:\r\n\r\n                           TOMMY'S VOICE\r\n                 Carrie?\r\n\r\n                           CARRIE\r\n                 Ohuh?\r\n\r\n  She stares at him and quickly covers the binding of the book with her hand, covering the title.\r\n  He looks as startled as she does.\r\n\r\n                       TOMMY\r\n                 How're you doing?\r\n\r\n                           CARRIE\r\n                           (after a beat; almost inaudibly)\r\n                 Okay.\r\n                                                                                                58\r\n\r\nIt's harder than he thought it would be; just trying to make small talk is agonizing. But try it,\r\nhe does:\r\n\r\n                      TOMMY\r\n               I thought you had gym this period.\r\n\r\nAll she can do is shake her head.

Check and stalemate. Which brings him to:\r\n\r\n                      TOMMY\r\n               Umm... if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want\r\n               to go with me?\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n               What?\r\n\r\n                      TOMMY\r\n               The Prom...\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word, Carrie walks down the aisle of book shelves.

But he's oblivious of any looks now, any snickering \u00ad all he wants is to catch up with\r\nCarrie.\r\n\r\nWhich he does; he manages to touch her arm, and it's a weird moment, this contact.

Tommy stands there helpless, sensing just how much of a big deal it is. Seeing that\r\nshe's on the verge of tears, he's feeling even worse, and all he can say is:\r\n\r\n                        TOMMY\r\n               Sorry.\r\n\r\nBut it's too little, and too late.

THE WHITE HOUSE \u00ad AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n    The sun is shining \u00ad perhaps the next day, a day later. The house is a picture postcard \u00ad under\r\n    it, we hear the sweet, muffled sound of \"Amazing Grace.\" It's just loud enough for us to hear\r\n    it \u00ad joyous, triumphant.\r\n\r\n                                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n160A. INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM \u00ad AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n    Margaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix.\r\n\r\n    The sampler, however, sits in her lap \u00ad unfinished, unminded. She's virtually catatonic.\r\n\r\n    \"Amazing Grace\" \u00ad a sweet, contemporary rendition \u00ad is on the Webcor. A pleasure after\r\n    Kathryn Kuhlman.\r\n\r\n    Carrie sits at the sewing machine, finishing work on the pattern for her prom dress. She\r\n    removes the material from the sewing machine, which we now see is a lush crushed velvet.\r\n\r\n                          MARGARET\r\n                   Red. I might have known it would be red.\r\n\r\n    The cuckoo clock is TICKING, TICKING.\r\n\r\n    Carrie stares at Margaret, then turns the sewing machine off. She looks back at Margaret,\r\n    then turns her attention to the machine, her eyes sparkling.\r\n\r\n    Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself.\r\n\r\n    The needle starts to bob up and down, up and down, up and down... WHIRRING, jerking.\r\n\r\n    The side wheel spins. And then stops.\r\n\r\n                          CARRIE\r\n                          (softly)\r\n                   Only clearing the thread, Momma.\r\n\r\n    She smiles. Then rises and goes to start up the stairs to her room.\r\n\r\n    Margaret looks after her. Hate. And fear.\r\n\r\n                           MARGARET\r\n                           (abruptly)\r\n                   It's Satan.\r\n                                                                                                79\r\n\r\nCarrie pauses.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n                       (wearily; pitying)\r\n                 Oh, momma.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                 He has given you a power.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 Momma, it doesn't have anything to do with Satan.

You must give it up. You must never use it.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 I'm going to do my homework, Momma.\r\n\r\nAnother step up the stairs, stopping as Margaret hurls after her.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                 There's going to be a judgement!\r\n\r\nThere's nothing more to say. Carrie walks up to the stairs, and we:\r\n\r\n                                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                                                                                                    80\r\n\r\n\r\n161 INT. GYMNASIUM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Very dark, shadowy, deserted. The night before the prom. Silence, then a SCRAPING sound\r\n   of a:\r\n\r\n162 WINDOW\r\n\r\n   Being jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face \u00ad just whose isn't clear yet. The\r\n   slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears. Chris is right\r\n   behind him.\r\n\r\n163 LONG SHOT \u00ad THE GYM\r\n\r\n   As a flashlight is shined upwards \u00ad at the criss-crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper; at\r\n   banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular \u00ad\r\n   the huge wall mural and the chalked-in spot where the King and Queen of the Prom will be\r\n   crowned.\r\n\r\n 164 TWO SHOT \u00ad BILLY AND CHRIS\r\n\r\n   DOLLYING right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area \u00ad past the numerous\r\n   tables set up for the prom-goers, past the twin bandstands. Billy is carrying the ice chest,\r\n   Chris the flashlight.\r\n\r\n 165 ANOTHER ANGLE\r\n\r\n   As they arrive behind the stage. Billy puts the chest down and takes out a pair of Playtex\r\n   rubber gloves, snaps them on. Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine.\r\n\r\n166 CHRIS' POV \u00ad BILLY\r\n\r\n   Looking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a ladder which takes him up to a\r\n   narrow platform overlooking the stage area.\r\n\r\n167 CLOSEUP \u00ad CHRIS\r\n\r\n   Shining the flashlight to guide Billy, her face flushed with excitement.\r\n\r\n168 BILLY\r\n\r\n   As he disappears behind a short draw curtain which obscures the girders over the stage.\r\n\r\n169 CHRIS\r\n                                                                                             81\r\n\r\nunable to see him, suddenly feeling very alone.\r\n\r\n                       CHRIS\r\n               What's it like up there?\r\n                       (no response)\r\n               Billee?\r\n                       (no answer; genuinely scared)\r\n               Billy!\r\n\r\nAnd just at that moment, a piece of crepe paper floats into the FRAME and lands in Chris's\r\nhair. She jumps, utterly unnerved. She looks up to see Billy staring down at her from the\r\nplatform, grinning.\r\n\r\n                      BILLY\r\n               Boo.\r\n\r\n                      CHRIS\r\n               You stupid shit.\r\n\r\n                       BILLY\r\n                       (still in good humor)\r\n               Nice talk.\r\n\r\n                      CHRIS\r\n               Hurry up. Do you hear me, just hurry up.\r\n\r\n                     BILLY\r\n                     (blackface)\r\n               Yes'um. Yes'um.

The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage \u00ad\r\n  scored throughout with happier and happier MUSIC \u00ad will also feature some of our lesser\r\n  characters.\r\n\r\n  Among other things, we will see:\r\n\r\n             A) THE GYM \u00ad as last-minute arrangements are made \u00ad more crepe paper hung,\r\n         party favors put on tables, etc.;\r\n\r\n             B) CARRIE \u00ad in a town store as she shops for makeup;\r\n\r\n            C) NORMA WATSON \u00ad under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a\r\n         manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted;\r\n\r\n             D) TOMMY \u00ad picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist;\r\n\r\n             E) CARRIE \u00ad at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't\r\n         see), a happy look on her face;\r\n\r\n            F) THE GYM \u00ad as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage\r\n         wall;\r\n\r\n             G) SUE \u00ad having dinner with her parents\r\n\r\n            H) THE TWINS \u00ad in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on\r\n         enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously;\r\n\r\n            I) ERNEST \u00ad the class president \u00ad making sure the microphone on the stage\r\n         works;\r\n\r\n             J) THE BAND \u00ad among them, The Beak, setting up;\r\n\r\n             K) SANDRA STENCHFELD, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act;\r\n\r\n            L) A DOOR \u00ad which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them\r\n         several inches taller than their depressed-looking dates;\r\n\r\n             M) GEORGE AND FRIEDA \u00ad he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as\r\n         Freida's parents take a Polaroid of this night to remember;\r\n\r\n            N) THE GYM \u00ad with the adult chaperones \u00ad teachers, administrators \u00ad standing\r\n         around, looking for something to do.\r\n                                                                                                    83\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is now the night of the Prom \u00ad just minutes before it officially begins, we end this montage\r\n  and:\r\n\r\n                                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n171 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n  Carrie sits in front of that same mirror, but this time, there's a different attitude. And a\r\n  different girl, which pleases her. She looks different, very different, from before. She's\r\n  dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the SHOT is ANGLED in such a way\r\n  that we don't see it. In any case, it is not prim. She is wearing some makeup. She looks...\r\n  well, there has been a transformation.\r\n\r\n  In the background, the door is opened by Margaret.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n                 Come in, Momma.\r\n\r\n  Margaret advances into the room.\r\n\r\n  Carrie opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of tiny tea roses.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n                 Do you want to pin it on, Momma?\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                 I can see your dirtypillows. Everyone will.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 Breasts, Momma, breasts. Every woman has them.\r\n\r\n  Carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even Margaret, will spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this\r\n  scene \u00ad and all that follow for a considerable period of time \u00ad has an edge of unreality to it.\r\n  It's all been diffused a bit \u00ad a fairy tale through Carrie's eyes. What would look bad or tacky\r\n  looks acceptable; what looked good before now looks spectacular.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                 Take off that dress.\r\n\r\n                         CARRIE\r\n                 No.\r\n                                                                                                84\r\n\r\n                      MARGARET\r\n               We'll burn it together, we'll pray for forgiveness.\r\n\r\n                     CARRIE\r\n               No, Momma.\r\n\r\nThe Black Forest CUCKOO CLOCK sings out downstairs. It's eight o'clock.\r\n\r\n                      MARGARET\r\n               He's not coming.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n               Stop it, Momma. I'm nervous enough.\r\n\r\nMargaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard, leaving a red mark. She looks toward\r\nCarrie.\r\n\r\nCarrie is pinning the tea roses on herself.\r\n\r\nMargaret hooks her right hand into a claw, rips at her cheek, leaving a thin line of blood.\r\n\r\n                      CARRIE\r\n               Stop hurting yourself, Momma. That's not going to stop me either.\r\n\r\nMargaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist.\r\n\r\n                     CARRIE\r\n               Go away, Momma.\r\n\r\n                     MARGARET\r\n               You know I'm right. He'll laugh at you. They'll all laugh at you.\r\n\r\n                      CARRIE\r\n               No. It'll be okay.\r\n\r\nBur she's rattled, and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room.\r\nCosmetics on the bureau, the florist box, the glow-in-the-dark statue. But it's sheer will at\r\nthis point. It's after eight, and there's no sign of Tommy.\r\n\r\n                       MARGARET\r\n               It's not too late. You can stay here with me.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n               No.\r\n                                                                                                85\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                 I'll answer the door and say you're sick, I'll say \u00ad\r\n\r\n                     CARRIE\r\n                 Momma, sit on the bed.\r\n\r\n  Flex.\r\n\r\n  Margaret is pushed back on the bed. Horrified, she rises again.\r\n\r\n                          MARGARET\r\n                 I'll say that you changed your mind, I'll say \u00ad\r\n\r\n  Flex.\r\n\r\n  Margaret is thrust back on the bed.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                 `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'\r\n\r\n  The words stop. But Margaret's eyes are fixed on Carrie, as Carrie leans toward her. Carrie's\r\n  voice is soft and compassionate.\r\n\r\n                         CARRIE\r\n                 You'll say nothing, Momma. You are going to have to learn that\r\n                 I'm not like you, not anymore.\r\n\r\n  The BUZZER downstairs sounds. Carrie goes to her window and sees:\r\n\r\n172 CARRIE'S POV \u00ad TOMMY\r\n\r\n  at the front door, the overhead light shining on his hair, making it glisten. He looks very\r\n  handsome.\r\n\r\n173 CARRIE\r\n\r\n  She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to Margaret:\r\n\r\n                          CARRIE\r\n                 I'll be home early, Momma.\r\n\r\n  The BUZZER downstairs sounds again.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                 There's going to be a judgement!\r\n                                                                              86\r\n\r\n                         CARRIE\r\n                 Momma, you will be quiet until I'm gone.\r\n                         (beat; then, at the door)\r\n                 I love you, Momma.\r\n\r\n  And she's gone, down the\r\n\r\n174 STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, TO THE FRONT DOOR \u00ad TRACKING\r\n\r\n  Carrie who opens the door.\r\n\r\n175 ANGLE ON TOMMY\r\n\r\n  Well, we know he's beautiful. And he's looking at Carrie. He didn't know:\r\n\r\n176 CARRIE \u00ad TOMMY'S POV\r\n\r\n  He didn't know she could be beautiful. And she is.\r\n\r\n177 TOMMY AND CARRIE\r\n\r\n  He reaches out his hand.\r\n\r\n                           TOMMY\r\n                 Hi.\r\n\r\n  Carrie takes his hand.\r\n\r\n178 EXT. WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n  Hand in hand, Carrie and Tommy walk down the path toward his car.\r\n\r\n  They are observed by:\r\n\r\n179 MARGARET\r\n\r\n  at the window of Carrie's room.\r\n\r\n180 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n  Margaret leaves the window as we HEAR Tommy's car drive off.\r\n\r\n  She goes out of the room.\r\n                                                                                                  87\r\n\r\n181 TRACKING MARGARET\r\n\r\n   Down the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen. Almost the same path that Carrie\r\n   trod, but trod so differently. While Carrie's pace had been light, nervously expectant,\r\n   Margaret's is slow and heavy.\r\n\r\n182 INT. WHITE KITCHEN \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Margaret crosses to one of the drawers.\r\n\r\n   She reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light.\r\n\r\n                                                                                           CUT TO:\r\n\r\n183 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   The school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars are pulling in, among them,\r\n   Tommy's Ford.\r\n\r\n184 INT. TOMMY'S CAR\r\n\r\n   as Tommy turns off the ignition. Carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars.\r\n   Tommy watches her taking it all in.\r\n\r\n                           CARRIE\r\n                  It's like a dream.\r\n\r\n                        TOMMY\r\n                  You can still change your mind, you know.\r\n\r\n   She turns to him and realizes he's teasing her.\r\n\r\n                          CARRIE\r\n                  Easier said than done.\r\n\r\n                           TOMMY\r\n                           (grinning)\r\n                  C'mon.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                  No. Please \u00ad not yet.\r\n\r\n                         TOMMY\r\n                  Scared?\r\n                                                                                                     88\r\n\r\n                          CARRIE\r\n                  Yes.\r\n                        (beat)\r\n                  Can we sit here another minute?\r\n\r\n   Tommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is miserable \u00ad she's happy to be with\r\n   Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to dance the first\r\n   time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n                  Tommy...\r\n                       (and then out it comes)\r\n                  Maybe... maybe this was a mistake.\r\n\r\n                          TOMMY\r\n                  Hey, it won't be so bad.\r\n\r\n   She tries to smile at him. It's not very persuasive.\r\n\r\n                          TOMMY\r\n                  Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see.\r\n                          (beat; she's trying to believe him)\r\n                  Don't be nervous. Besides...\r\n                          (a little self-mocking)\r\n                  I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.\r\n\r\n   And that's just enough \u00ad he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh.\r\n\r\n                                                                                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n185 INT. GYM\r\n\r\n   where the prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an energetic version of \"Harlem\r\n   Nocturne.\" From Carrie's POV it's all magic \u00ad explosions of pastel color, everyone looking\r\n   like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness.\r\n\r\n   Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in\r\n   as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the\r\n   stage wall \u00ad full of celestial moon, stars and rockets \u00ad a VOICE bellows out behind her.\r\n\r\n                        VOICE\r\n                  Hey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer.\r\n                                                                                              89\r\n\r\n186 GEORGE DAWSON\r\n\r\n  The source of the salutation and Tommy's best friend. He bounds INTO FRAME, wearing a\r\n  T-shirt with a painted black tie under his dinner jacket. His girlfriend, Frieda Jason, tags\r\n  behind.\r\n\r\n                        TOMMY\r\n                  When did you come out of the treetops, Bomba?\r\n\r\n                          GEORGE\r\n                  Ross, if I'd known you were going to look this good, I'd have\r\n                  asked you instead of Frieda.\r\n\r\n  The two boys immediately go into a mock fight. Frieda comes up to Carrie.\r\n\r\n                         FRIEDA\r\n                  Don't let it bother you. If they destroy each other, I'll dance with you.\r\n\r\n  Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward silence.\r\n\r\n                        FRIEDA\r\n                  Hey, where'd you buy your dress? I love it.\r\n\r\n                         CARRIE\r\n                         (shyly)\r\n                  I made it.\r\n\r\n                         FRIEDA\r\n                         (unaffected surprise)\r\n                  Made it? No shit.\r\n\r\n  Carrie hesitates; realizes Frieda is quite sincere.\r\n\r\n                         CARRIE\r\n                  No shit.\r\n\r\n  Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up. Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye\r\n  on Carrie. He shrugs \u00ad it's working, goddammit \u00ad and he stuffs his hands into his dinner\r\n  jacket.\r\n\r\n187 ANOTHER ANGLE \u00ad THE GYM\r\n\r\n  Carrie and Frieda, Tommy and George right behind them, head for their tables.\r\n                                                                                     90\r\n\r\n                    FRIEDA\r\n              The mural's nice.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n              Yes.\r\n                      (confiding)\r\n              I'm really nervous.\r\n\r\n                     FRIEDA\r\n              S'okay.

The water, however, has\r\n   reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted \u00ad his arm bursting into flame,\r\n   unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on\r\n   land.\r\n                                                                                                 115\r\n\r\n289 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Watching this; another flex, and:\r\n\r\n290 FROMM\r\n\r\n   Is propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward into the cyc, his flaming arm\r\n   igniting it. A celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames. It prevents any of the students\r\n   from using the back exit.\r\n\r\n291 THE STUDENTS\r\n\r\n   Watching, riveted with horror, some of them screaming, others frozen to the spot as the cyc\r\n   CRACKLES. Utter pandemonium.\r\n\r\n292 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Her face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart pounding. She spots:\r\n\r\n293 THE LIGHTING T-BAR\r\n\r\n   hanging over the bandstand.\r\n\r\n294 THE DOORS\r\n\r\n   as the prom-goers press against the opaque glass, straining to get out.

We see the flaming cyc on the\r\n   stage collapse forward. The light bar begins to shake. Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS\r\n   \u00ad just short of Collins' head \u00ad as far as its wires carry it.\r\n\r\n300 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Watching all this \u00ad a giggle (or is it a sob?) emerging from deep within her.\r\n\r\n   Another flex.\r\n\r\n301 THE LIGHT BAR\r\n\r\n   starts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, back and forth \u00ad it hits the ceiling,\r\n   igniting it and the decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling.\r\n\r\n302 BENEATH THE STAGE \u00ad CHRIS AND BILLY\r\n\r\n   seeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar.\r\n\r\n   The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames\r\n   prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see\r\n   their chance to escape. They burst out from under the stage as:\r\n\r\n303 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late.\r\n   They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do.\r\n\r\n304 THE GYM \u00ad FEATURING THE LIGHT BAR\r\n\r\n   As it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her\r\n   green chiffon dress back into a wall.\r\n\r\n   Helen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical.\r\n\r\n   Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on\r\n   the windows so they can escape.\r\n\r\n   Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows. All this\r\n   to no avail. End SPLIT SCREEN.\r\n                                                                                                 117\r\n\r\n305 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   As she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor. She spots the cord going\r\n   under the stage first, and realizes just how the trick was engineered... that Billy and Chris did\r\n   it.\r\n\r\n306 THE STUDENTS\r\n\r\n   Moving aside as Carrie walks through them \u00ad an endless series of blurred, hysterical faces.\r\n\r\n307 WIDE SHOT \u00ad THE GYM\r\n\r\n   As Carrie makes it to one set of double doors, flexes them open, and exits.\r\n\r\n308 EXT. GYM \u00ad HALLWAY\r\n\r\n   As Carrie exits, the doors swinging shut. Behind her, through the windows, we see a wall of\r\n   fire collapse behind her.\r\n\r\n   She passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically. And as Carrie exits, Sue runs into this\r\n   inferno of fire to find Tommy. And then the town WHISTLE BLOWS... and BLOWS. It\r\n   overlaps onto:\r\n\r\n                                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n309 EXT. TOWN STREETS \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Carrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly\r\n   car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless. She goes down\r\n   a hill, and then, from:\r\n\r\n310 ANOTHER ANGLE \u00ad THE HILL \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   as a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie. And then shortly afterward, out of\r\n   nowhere, Billy's Chevy \u00ad it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her.\r\n\r\n311 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Turns around and sees it coming toward her.\r\n\r\n312 INT. THE CHEVY\r\n\r\n   Chris screaming \"Get her!

It just misses her.\r\n\r\n316 INT. THE CHEVY\r\n\r\n   Billy is livid, turning around to see Carrie in the back window.\r\n\r\n                       BILLY\r\n                  Goddamnit!\r\n\r\n                             CHRIS\r\n                  Billy!!!\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n                  Shut up! Just shut up!\r\n\r\n   But the car is headed for an embankment. Billy realizes this and starts pumping the brakes.\r\n   But the car's accelerating, not responding to Billy's efforts to slow it down.\r\n\r\n317 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Her head pounding, flexing.\r\n\r\n318 INT. CHEVY\r\n\r\n   As Billy attempts to turn the wheel; it, too, has turned traitor \u00ad it won't turn.\r\n\r\n   They're heading right for the embankment. Billy's eyes are bugging out, Chris is screaming\r\n   as:\r\n\r\n319 THE CHEVY\r\n\r\n   Plows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times. It then bursts into a sheet of\r\n   flames.\r\n                                                                                              119\r\n\r\n320 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Watching this explosion turn into a conflagration. We see the fire reflected in her puffy,\r\n   exhausted face \u00ad brighter and brighter as we HEAR the sound of the WHISTLE merging with\r\n   SOUND OF SIRENS, and:\r\n\r\n                                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n321 EXT WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   The house is totally dark. Not even a porch light. In the distance, perhaps, the glow from the\r\n   burning gymnasium.\r\n\r\n   A figure is moving toward the house.\r\n\r\n   It is Carrie.\r\n\r\n322 AT DOOR\r\n\r\n   Carrie tries the front door. It is unlocked. She opens it partially.\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n                       (small voice)\r\n                   Momma?

WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   With the closing of the door, Carrie turns on a light. She looks around.

She mounts the stairs,\r\n   goes along the narrow hallway to her room.\r\n\r\n324 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Carrie turns on the lights, closes the door.\r\n\r\n   She stares at the Madonna-child figurine on the bureau.\r\n\r\n   Then, slowly, she removes her blood-stained clothing, letting it lie in a heap.\r\n\r\n   Clutching a robe, she goes into the bathroom.\r\n\r\n325 INT. BATHROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Carrie turns on the shower, waits for it to get hot. It is almost steaming as she steps in.\r\n\r\n   Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean.\r\n\r\n   Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself off briefly, puts on her robe, and turns off the\r\n   bathroom light. What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to focus on Carrie.\r\n\r\n326 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Carrie returns to her room. She is clean now; her wet hair hangs. A feeling of despair about\r\n   her or perhaps she is emptied out.\r\n\r\n   Carrie almost mouths:\r\n\r\n                       CARRIE\r\n                   Momma...\r\n\r\n   It is a little child's voice and there is no answer.\r\n\r\n   She goes out into the hallway.\r\n\r\n327 INT. HALLWAY \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Carrie goes to the head of the stairs. Once again, she mouths the words:\r\n                                                                                            121\r\n\r\n                      CARRIE\r\n                  Momma...\r\n\r\n   Something \u00ad a movement? An instinct? -- makes her turn. She sees:\r\n\r\n328 MARGARET\r\n\r\n   Coming toward her.\r\n\r\n329 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   She flings out her arms and cries out:\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                  Oh, Momma!\r\n\r\n   And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick\r\n   movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach.\r\n\r\n   Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand.\r\n\r\n   Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs.\r\n\r\n330 ANGLE DOWN STAIRS\r\n\r\n   On Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n331 MARGARET\r\n\r\n   Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.\r\n\r\n   MARGARET\r\n   It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'\r\n\r\n332 CARRIE\r\n\r\n   Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. She begins to crawl\r\n   backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the\r\n   stairs.\r\n\r\n                        MARGARET\r\n                  And now the devil has come home.\r\n                                                                                                122\r\n\r\n                      CARRIE\r\n                      (whimpering)\r\n                  Momma, it's not right.\r\n\r\n   Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n333 INT. KITCHEN \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n   Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen,\r\n   just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of\r\n   the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while.\r\n\r\n   Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut.\r\n\r\n   Margaret is coming toward the kitchen.\r\n\r\n   Carrie flexes again \u00ad to hold the door shut.\r\n\r\n   But it's no use \u00ad Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and\r\n   starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her.\r\n\r\n                          MARGARET\r\n                  I should have killed you when you were born.\r\n\r\n                      CARRIE\r\n                  Momma, I love you. Please help me!\r\n\r\n                         MARGARET\r\n                  Sin never dies.\r\n\r\n   There's nothing else to be done. Carrie flexes, and a serving fork \u00ad dangling from a hook on\r\n   the way \u00ad suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and\r\n   another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret.\r\n\r\n   Margaret collapses.\r\n\r\n   Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother.\r\n\r\n   And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling\r\n   her screams.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                  You. You tricked me.\r\n                                                                                       123\r\n\r\n                        SUE\r\n                 No.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 Get out.\r\n\r\n                       SUE\r\n                 We were just trying to...\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 Get out.\r\n\r\nAnd then something hits the roof, rattling. A small sound. A stone.\r\n\r\nThen another.\r\n\r\nThen a third.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 Get out! Get out!\r\n\r\nThe stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail.\r\n\r\nSue is rooted to the spot, terrified.\r\n\r\n                        CARRIE\r\n                 Get out, get out, get out!\r\n\r\nThe stones are coming down harder. All sound as one or two of them break through the roof,\r\nrattle on the floor below.\r\n\r\n                      CARRIE\r\n                 GET OUT!\r\n\r\nA stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nCarrie flexes.\r\n\r\nAnd Sue stumbles backwards toward the door.\r\n\r\nFlex.\r\n\r\nSue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.\r\n                                                                                                124\r\n\r\n333A EXT. WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n     Stones are crashing on the house.\r\n\r\n     Sue is hurtled out of the house.\r\n\r\n  334 INT. KITCHEN\r\n\r\n     As a couple of larger stones crash into the room, Carrie heads for the closet.\r\n\r\n  335 EXT. WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n     Sue, rising from the ground, see stones crashing into the house.\r\n\r\n     She begins to run away.\r\n\r\n  336 INT. WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n     Carrie walks toward the closet; the figure of Jesus is illuminated \u00ad welcoming her? She goes\r\n     into the closet.\r\n\r\n     She closes the door.\r\n\r\n     Stones crash down, obliterating the scene.\r\n\r\n  337 EXT. WHITE HOUSE \u00ad NIGHT\r\n\r\n     Sue stops running. She turns to look at the White house.\r\n\r\n  338 WHITE HOUSE \u00ad SUE'S POV\r\n\r\n     The stones are flattening the house. The house is being pounded into the ground.\r\n\r\n  339 SUE\r\n\r\n     Terror and disbelief. Nightmare.\r\n\r\n  340 THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\n     The rain of stones stops.\r\n\r\n     Silence.\r\n\r\n     Then the house begins to sink \u00ad slowly, slowly, slowly \u00ad into the ground.\r\n                                                                                                125\r\n\r\n   And the ground is swallowing up the house.\r\n\r\n   And covering it until \u00ad nothing remains. Not a trace.\r\n\r\n                                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n341 EXT. SNELL HOUSE \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n   Some time later \u00ad a week, perhaps two weeks after the nightmares of Prom Night.\r\n\r\n342 INT. SNELL HOUSE\r\n\r\n   A home in the course of losing its family. White sheets cover furniture. Boxes in the midst of\r\n   being packed.\r\n\r\n   Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving. She\r\n   sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. And she\r\n   comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now. They\r\n   have a momentary hypnotic effect on her.\r\n\r\n   The phone RINGS, startling her. She rushes to answer it in the kitchen, catching it on the first\r\n   or second ring.\r\n\r\n                          ELEANOR\r\n                          (hushed voice)\r\n                  Hello? Oh, thank God it's you, Betty. I don't think I could have\r\n                  handled one more reporter.\r\n                          (she appears to hear a noise upstairs)\r\n                  Just a sec, dear.\r\n                          (she comes into the living room and looks toward the upstairs)\r\n                  Sue?\r\n                          (a little louder)\r\n                  Sue?\r\n                          (no answer, she returns to the phone)\r\n                  Sorry, Betty, I just wanted to make sure the phone didn't wake her.\r\n                  We're all a bit edgy.\r\n                          (beat)\r\n                  Better. Sleeping too much, I guess, but Schneider says that's to be\r\n                  expected after what she's gone through. He says she's young enough\r\n                  to forget it in time. Knock wood.\r\n\r\n   As Eleanor's side of the conversation continues, the camera conveys her tension. Half of her\r\n   is listening and talking to Betty; the rest of her mind is on Sue upstairs. With good reason.\r\n   Because:\r\n                                                                                               126\r\n\r\n343 EXT. EMPTY LOT \u00ad DAY\r\n\r\n   Where the Horan house used to stand, now vacant. Strewn with beer cans, overgrown with\r\n   grass and weeds and wildflowers. And a FOR SALE sign.\r\n\r\n   We PAN over next door where the White house used to stand. It, too, is vacant but utterly\r\n   bald \u00ad there's been no time for anything to grow here. There is another FOR SALE sign put\r\n   up by Born Realty.\r\n\r\n344 SUE SNELL\r\n\r\n   looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring\r\n   at the lot. She's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot.\r\n\r\n345 THE WHITE LOT \u00ad SUE'S POV\r\n\r\n   as she slowly walks toward it. Underwater, almost floating. We come closer on the sign\r\n   which now starts appearing a bit odder \u00ad less like a simple FOR SALE sign and more like a\r\n   grave marker.\r\n\r\n   And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk\r\n   on the sign:\r\n\r\n                    CARRIE WHITE IS BURNING IN HELL FOR HER SINS\r\n\r\n   And below it, in a second vandal's handwriting, some idiot's notion of one final joke:\r\n\r\n                                       JESUS NEVER FAILS\r\n\r\n346 SUE\r\n\r\n   as she kneels down, putting the wreath she's carrying next to the marker. She proceeds to try\r\n   to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand; it smudges badly.\r\n\r\n   She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower. Suddenly, a second\r\n   hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown.\r\n\r\n   A bloody hand.\r\n\r\n   A hand from the Earth itself.\r\n\r\n   Carrie's hand\r\n\r\n   It clutches a horrified Sue by the wrist. Tightly. A vice.\r\n                                                                                                127\r\n\r\n   Sue begins screaming uncontrollably. The hand is trying to pull her into the ground. Her\r\n   screams turn into howling.\r\n\r\n                                                                                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n347 SUE\r\n\r\n   Still screaming. But now in her room, waking from what is, indeed, a bad nightmare.\r\n   Upright in bed, screaming her head off, her face covered with perspiration.\r\n\r\n   Eleanor Snell rushes into the room to the bed, embraces her hysterical daughter.\r\n\r\n                            ELEANOR\r\n                  It's all right, it's all right, darling.\r\n\r\n                        SUE\r\n                  Mother?\r\n\r\n   And we come in close on Sue's stricken face as her mother holds her, calming her, cradling\r\n   her. Closer still on Sue's eyes. She closes them, and we go to:\r\n\r\n                                                                                          BLACK\r\n\n\n\n\nCarrie\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Lawrence D.
