He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and \ncloses the lid.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLULA\n</b>\t\tDon\u0092t do this, Sailor, please.\n\nSailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the \ncar.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSAILOR\n</b>\t\t\t(to Pace)\n\t\tOiga, amigo.

Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks \ndown her face.\n\nECU of Lula\u0092s eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and \ndown her cheeks as in Sailor\u0092s dream.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSAILOR\n</b>\t\tYou been doin\u0092 fine without me, peanut. \n\t\tThere ain\u0092t no need to make life \n\t\ttougher\u0092n it has to be.\n\nHe picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks \naway.  She lets him go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>160. EXT.

They circle around \nhim, coming in closer for the kill.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSAILOR\n</b>\t\tWhat do you faggots want?\n\nThat\u0092s all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend \nhimself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood \nbegins to pour from his swelling nose.\n\n\n<b>162A. EXT.

The gang still stands around him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGANG MEMBER\n</b>\t\tYou had enough, asshole?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSAILOR\n</b>\t\tYes, I have...

Behind them is a \ngiant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes \naway.  Lula\u0092s gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  \nIt is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, \nbut now she knows what it is.  It is Pace\u0092s happy, smiling eyes looking \nup at the two of them in love.\n\nSailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lula\u0092s eyes and sings \u0093Love \nMe Tender.\u0094 \n\nThe people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a \nfeeling of love and happiness in their hearts.\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>THE END\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Wild At Heart</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Lynch\" title=\"Scripts by David Lynch\">David Lynch</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Wild At Heart Script.html#comments\" title=\"Wild At Heart comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:20:23.022404"}
