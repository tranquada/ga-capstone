On his bedside\r\n          table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an\r\n          Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open\r\n          shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light.\r\n          The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even\r\n          though it's eyes are open. Jack's about to reach into the\r\n          box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches\r\n          it off. After a moment he switches it back on again.\r\n<b>\r\n</b><b>                         \r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>          INT.

The room feels empty and depressing.\r\n          He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into\r\n          the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player.\r\n          Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He\r\n          turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music's\r\n          unbearably loud but Paul just stands there. Numb.\r\n<b>\r\n</b><b>                         ON PAUL\r\n</b>          The music's strangely distorted now.

O.S.\r\n          we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty\r\n          faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares\r\n          at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head.\r\n          The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing\r\n          her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush.\r\n          Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely\r\n          larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain\r\n          objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She\r\n          notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley.\r\n          The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised.\r\n          The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna\r\n          with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to\r\n          the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow\r\n          to normal size.\r\n          Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel\r\n          trolley now towers high above her. The massive\r\n          instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects\r\n          cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a\r\n          solid wall of DARKNESS.\r\n<b>\r\n</b><b>          FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS\r\n</b>          the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark\r\n          space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep\r\n          Room behind her.\r\n<b>\r\n</b><b>                         PREP ROOM\r\n</b>          Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick\r\n          blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then...\r\n          ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's\r\n          wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna\r\n          struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper\r\n          into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.\r\n<b>\r\n</b><b>                         \r\n</b><b>\r\n</b><b>          INT.

A\r\n          drop of blood falls on Paul's white shirt. It unfurls\r\n          like a flower.
