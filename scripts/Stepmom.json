He wiggles in\n\ther arms as she struggles to change his clothes.  Just as she gets\n\this bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs\n\twhen we hear a loud KNOCKING at the kitchen door.  Holding a half\n\tnaked Ben in her arms, Rachel looks up at...\n\n\tJACKIE HARRISON.  An immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel-\n\tligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme\n\tdisapproval.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE AND BEN\n</b>\t\tMommy!\n\n\tAnnabelle and Ben RACE into their mother's arms like little angels.\n\tJackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at Rachel.

He\n\tstops banging her glasses case, starts banging the plane.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tWhy does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants?\n\t\tDoesn't she have underpants of her own?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tI noticed a whopping pile of laundry\n\t\tsitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's\n\t\tunderpants are in there -- Now where are\n\t\tyour lunches?\n\n\tAs if by rote, they hold out their lunches.  One is a plastic Vons\n\tbag and the other a crumpled Macy's bag.  She collects them and\n\thands Ben and Annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tAnnabelle sucked her thumb last night.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tI NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!\n\n\tAnd SLUGS him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\t<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to\n\t\tsay 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling.\n\t\tUse your words.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tI hate when you say that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tThank you.

PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY\n</b>\n\tBlack and white FILLS the frame.  Like a checkerboard.  We PULL\n\tBACK and realize we are seeing a group of PENGUINS waddling against\n\ta black and white backdrop.  We see a WHITE WAITRE'D in a BLACK\n\tTUXEDO holding glasses on a tray.  A BLACK MODEL, IMAN, in a WHITE\n\tDRESS glides through it all.\n\n\tIn the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just\n\tentered and starts expertly directing the action.  She calls out to\n\ther assistant, COOPER.  Perpetually hip.

The music BLARES just\n\tthen, and a penguin JUTS forward and NIPS the model.  The FLASH of\n\tthe camera.  We FREEZE for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just\n\ttook.  An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin\n\tCOLLIDING with a maitre'd who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem\n\tto be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously.

INDOOR RIDING RING - TWILIGHT\n</b>\n\tHuge indoor space.  Wood-sided walls, dirt floor.  High corrugated\n\tmetal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters.  A little GIRL,\n\tunder the keen eye of her TRAINER, puts her mount through its\n\tpaces.  In the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body.  It's\n\tlate, no one else around.  TRACK now...\n\n\t...down a walkway.  Toward the stables.  A barn cat is crouched,\n\tstalking prey.  We hear a soft voice, speaking.  One we know...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tIt was like telling her...\n\n\tSee him now.  Standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\t...that I didn't love her anymore...\n\n\tSee the horse, still steaming.  Standing patiently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\t...if I could be sure I'd always\n\t\tstay.\n\n\tCircling the horse now, we see Annabelle's back.  She is slowly\n\tbrushing out the sweat mark.  Where the saddle used to be.  Her\n\tmovements are stiff, mechanical.  The soft voice continues...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tShe said, 'This thing you call a\n\t\tpartnership.

Because she will not cry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tThat's the kind of person your mom is.\n\t\tShe's the best.\n\n\tAnnabelle says nothing.  She drops to her knees.  Begins to clean\n\tout one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick.  The only sound\n\tagainst the stillness.\n\n\tAnd her father watches.  His heart pounding.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tI complained a lot, baby.  We couldn't\n\t\ttravel, we'd lost our privacy, our\n\t\tchance to do things on the spur of the\n\t\tmoment.

If the kids weren't around.\n\n\tCrouches down.  Very close to his child.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tI said.  I love them more than\n\t\tanything.  But sometimes...

Turns her faces away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tShe said she could never feel that\n\t\tway, not for one single second.\n\n\tSo he leans closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tShe didn't want to be with someone.\n\t\tWho could.\n\n\tSilence.

Looking in those eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tI don't want to be wrong anymore.\n\n\tI don't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tI want to say I'm sorry, because I am.\n\t\tAnd let you hate me.

Strokes her hair.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tThat moment will come.  And your\n\t\theart is going to whisper, 'here\n\t\tit is'\n\n\tWinds his fingers.  Around her hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tAnd you'll come through.\n\n\tShe stares in his eyes.  And dead straight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tIf I miss it, daddy?

Tonight, she waits alone.  Watching the\n\tentrance.  Nursing her drink.  And then...\n\n\t...Rachel comes into the place.  Spots Jackie across the room.\n\tWeaves her way through the tables.\n\n\tAnd she is there.  Slipping into her seat.  Not knowing what to\n\tsay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tThanks for coming out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tNeutral ground.  What's up?\n\n\tJackie stares evenly.  Her chin rests across the back of her\n\tknuckles.  She looks tired, but okay.  Fueled by adrenaline.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tLuke called.  He says you're\n\t\tchecking out.  Of the Heartbreak\n\t\tHotel.\n\n\tThe waitress appears.

How many more times will she\n\tget to do this?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\t\t(a murmur)\n\t\tSo what do you think we're gonna\n\t\ttalk about?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\t\t(straight back)\n\t\tYou dying.\n\n\tShe nods.  Her smile is right there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tThe secret of it.  That only\n\t\tmagicians.  Can ever understand.\n\n\tHis eyes brighten.  The sadness pushed aside.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tSee, when we die.  Our body goes\n\t\taway.  Our body.  But <u>we</u>...we are\n\t\tnot our body, are we?\n\n\tHe doesn't know.  Maybe he thought we were.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tIf a soldier loses his legs in a\n\t\twar.  Is he the same guy?  Sure\n\t\the is.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tBut you can still see him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tHalf.  Of him.\n\n\tThis is so fucking hard.  But her eyes stay dry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tDying.  Is where the <u>whole</u> body\n\t\tgoes away.  So you can't see <u>any</u>\n\t\tof it.  <u>But</u>...\n\n\tRests her hand tenderly.  On his hair.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tWhat do magicians know?\n\n\tLeans forward.  Here's the secret...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tJust because you can't see it.\n\t\tDoesn't.  Mean.  It's gone.\n\n\tDoes it?  And Ben smiles.  He is inside the secret.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tThe world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But\n\t\tonly the magician.  Knows better.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tSo where are you?\n\n\tShe was waiting for this.  For a long time.  She wraps her hand\n\taround his fist.  And puts their hands against his heart.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tRight here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u>\n\t\tthe magician.  Shhhh.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tCan I talk to you?  When you're\n\t\tthere.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tAlways.  Always.  And you won't\n\t\thear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll\n\t\tknow.

Nose to nose.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tIt's worth a lot.  Will you keep it?\n\n\tHe answers.  With a kiss.\n\n<b>\tINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n\tLuke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle.  Ben\n\truns in, falls on his knees by the puzzle.  Without looking at\n\tAnnabelle, he tells her...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\t\tYour turn.  It wasn't bad.\n\n\tAnnabelle looks straight to her dad.  There is a moment, a silence,\n\tthat no one else could ever understand.  She leans to him and\n\twhispers...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tHere it is?\n\n\tHis eyes water.  He takes her in his arms.  Whispers close to her\n\tear, only the words...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUKE\n</b>\t\tHere it is.\n\n\tShe smiles at hi.  Fear gone, filled with resolve.  Gives him a\n\tkiss.  Rises, to...\n\n\t...follow Rachel down the hall.  Rache wraps an arm around her big\n\tgirl.  No words, except a murmured...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tYou can do this.\n\n\tVoice cracking.  She's not as good at it as this girl's mother.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tYou can do anything.\n\n\tAt the door.  Open it, and...\n\n<b>\tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n\t...Annabelle enters alone.  The door closes behind her.  Her eyes\n\tlock with her mother's.  No words.  Annabelle's eyes filled with\n\ttears, and Jackie's arms...\n\n\t... REACH out, and Annabelle RUNS to them.\n\n\tThey hold each other.  For a forever moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tI don't want to say goodbye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tDon't. Take me with you.\n\n\tAnd Annabelle looks up.  Tears on her face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tThank God.  I got to see you.\n\t\tGrown up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tI'm not.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\t\t(very softly)\n\t\tLet me be the judge of that.\n\n\tAnd Annabelle climbs onto the bed.  Their hands never stop touching\n\teach other.  Saying I love you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tThere's an amazing thing when a\n\t\twoman has a daughter.  One day you\n\t\tlook up, and you see...a sister.\n\t\tSomeone.  You can say.  Anything to.\n\n\tAnything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tI wrote a whole lot of letters.  To\n\t\teach of you.  And the envelope says\n\t\twhen to open it.  Like, which\n\t\tbirthday.  Or...when you get your\n\t\tdriver's permit.  First time you see\n\t\tRome.  Things like that.\n\n\tThings like that.  Annabelle is beginning to lose it now.  So\n\tJackie says only...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tKeep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until\n\t\the's old enough to not open them all\n\t\tat once.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tUntil he's old enough to read.\n\n\tTears on Annabelle's face.  Her mom wonders...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tAre you afraid for me?  Where\n\t\tI'm going.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tYes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tDon't be.  I'm going.  Where we\n\t\tall go.  Now how can that be bad.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tI'll miss you so much.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tGood.  That's very good.\n\n\tShe nods, yes it is.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tWhat you're grown-up enough to\n\t\tknow.  Is that people.  Can do\n\t\t<u>two</u> things at once.  Okay?\n\n\tShe brushes at her baby's tears.  Then tastes her wet fingertips.\n\tMmmn, surprisingly good.  Annabelle sort of smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tYou can miss me.  And.  Take me\n\t\twith you.\n\n\tHold the child's face.  In her hands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tWhen you're in trouble.  Have me\n\t\tthere.  When you fall in love.\n\t\tHave me there.  You can.\n\n\tSaid with such absolute assurance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tThat's how we go on, you know.\n\t\tForever.  Because someone takes\n\t\tus along.\n\n\tAnnabelle swallows hard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tOn your wedding night.  When your\n\t\tbabies are born.  I want to be\n\t\tthere.  Will you take me?\n\n\tA straight question.  It needs an answer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n</b>\t\tAlways, always.  Always.\n\n\tA sigh.  A shared smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tYou made my life wonderful.\n\n\tYou.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n</b>\t\tTake that with you, too.\n\n\tHold.  On Annabelle.\n\n<b>\tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING\n</b>\n\tThe presents are here now, they fill up the room, spill over the\n\tbed, where both children sprawl.\n\n\t...Ben RIPPING the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine,\n\tAnnabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to\n\thang it in the Louvre.  She holds a tank top up to her chest, for\n\ther Mom's approval.  Jackie's not sure.  Rachel handing up more\n\tboxes, Luke in charge of bagging trash...\n\n\tBen's white dove, flying free around the room, zipping and diving.\n\tNo one cares.  It's Christmas.\n\n\tHOLD.  Hold.  And CROSSFADE TO...\n\n<b>\tEXT. CHAPEL - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tFamily and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly-lit\n\tchapel into a snowy night.  They are saying goodbyes, kissing one\n\tanother, going to their cars.  And saying her last goodbye...\n\n\t...Rachel turns to Luke.  Whispers, close to his ear.  He looks at\n\ther for a beat, then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car, as...\n\n\tRachel goes back into the chapel.  Alone.\n\n<b>\tINT. FUNERAL PARLOR\n</b>\n\tThe room is nearly dark.  One soft spot plays on a simple CASKET.\n\tNo canned organ music, no sound at all.  As Rachel enters.\n\n\tShe goes to the casket.  Stares down at it for a beat.  And just\n\tabove a whisper...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tSee, I told you I'd do this.\n\n\tOnly...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tOnly.  Now I don't know what to say.\n\n\tHer hand reaches out.  A finger absently traces the edge of the\n\twood.  It seems a gesture of unconscious affection.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tYou'd have written it down, so you\n\t\twouldn't blow it.\n\n\tA slight smile.  Here's where the love shows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tMaybe we should change places.\n\n\tNods slightly.  Maybe we should.  She takes a step back now, to a\n\twaiting chair.\n\n\tSits.  Her hands folded in her lap.  Thinks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tWell.  We were less than friends, I\n\t\tguess.  And more.\n\n\tMore.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tWe were never...girlfriends, we\n\t\tnever dished.  That wasn't.  What\n\t\twe had.\n\n\tNo apology there.  It's just the truth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tWe had some battles, man, they\n\t\twere...world class, huh?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd I don't regret a one of them.\n\n\tSad little shrug.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tI miss them.\n\n\tThinking.  Of how much more she'll miss.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tWe've got our secrets, we have.\n\t\tAnd I'll keep 'em if you will.\n\n\tCrosses her arms.  Lost in the moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tBut I wish we had one more night.\n\t\tIn that little bar, remember?\n\t\tRemember that toast?  Sure, you do.\n\n\tHer voice wavers.  But the eyes are dry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tKnow what?  I forgive me, too.\n\t\tSee?  <u>You're</u> the magician.\n\n\tA murmur...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tDon't worry, partner, I've got\n\t\tyour back.  We're covered.\n\n\tIt's what she came to say.  CROSSFADE TO...\n\n<b>\tINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tLights and music and laughter.  They're in black tie tonight.  It's\n\ta wedding party.  Up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is\n\tfinishing a toast, and as everyone ROARS and CLAPS...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEST MAN\n</b>\t\t...so TO THE BRIDE!  Thank GOD\n\t\tshe's more than he deserves!\n\n\tEverybody shouts THE BRIDE.  Everybody drinks champagne.\n\n\tAnd the bride stands up. In her white gown.  In her hand, an\n\tenvelope.  She goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers,\n\tthe calls of SPEECH!, to die down.\n\n\tLeans to the mike.  Flushed and happy.  And, oddly, nervous.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tNow I know the tradition, so\n\t\tthis isn't a toast.  At least...\n\t\tnot for me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tThe guest list is 114.  But we\n\t\tall know there's one more here,\n\t\ttonight.  Because...\n\n\tLooks down the table at her children.  Dressed to kill.  Enjoying\n\tthe party.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\t...my two sidekicks there always\n\t\tbring her along.  Wherever they go.\n\n\tRight?  Right.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tSo Jackie and I were sitting\n\t\taround.  On New Year's Eve.  And\n\t\tshe said, 'You're not gonna talk\n\t\tat my funeral, are you?'\n\n\tAnd now.  It is quiet indeed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tAnd I said, 'I've never been to\n\t\ta funeral.  I'm not sure I'll know\n\t\thow to act...'\n\n\tHer sweet smile.  Keeps the mood right.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\t'...but I'll prob'ly sneak into\n\t\twhere you are.  Just before it's\n\t\tover...'\n\n\tNods to herself.  Fights back the feeling of that moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\t'...say something.  Just to you.\n\t\tGet the last word in, when you\n\t\tcan't talk back.'\n\n\tThere is laughter in this room.  Gentle, loving.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tSo she says, 'No way.'\n\n\tHolds up the envelope.  Holds it tight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tShe wrote this.  She sealed it\n\t\tup, I didn't see it.  She made\n\t\tme promise to read it.  At the\n\t\twedding.\n\n\tAnd slowly, Luke begins to CLAP.  And others join.  And when it\n\tstops...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tI told her she'd better make it\n\t\tdirty, or make it funny.  Because...\n\t\tno way...on my wedding...\n\n\tNo way in hell.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\t...could she make me cry.\n\n\tAPPLAUSE.  They are loving it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tShe says, 'It's a deal'.\n\n\tThe band plays an impromptu FLOURISH.  Rachel begins to carefully\n\ttear open the envelope...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tNow, if it's too raunchy, we may\n\t\thave to excuse the kids...\n\n\tSHOUTS from everyone, ESPECIALLY the children.\n\n\tShe has it open.  She looks at it.\n\n\tAnd everything.  Stops.\n\n\tThe world watches her sway, watches her eyes fill as she stares at\n\tthe small card in her hand.  She can't believe this...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\t\t(mouths to herself)\n\t\tYou promised.\n\n\tThe tears are welling.  Everyone SCREAMS for her to read it.  She\n\tleans to the mike, shaking her head...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tIt's...no big thing, really...\n\t\tit's just...five words, it's...\n\n\tThe place goes happily UP FOR GRABS.  A joyful RIOT of demand.\n\tTears STREAMING now, Rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded\n\tbag.  As she puts the card inside, we alone can read the words...\n\n<b>\tMY BABIES.
