RACHEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n\tA billowy white screen.  An alarm clock BLARES.  As MAIN TITLES\n\tBEGIN, the lovely sleeping face of RACHEL KELLY rolls into frame.\n\tThen out of it.  Alarm keeps BLASTING.  Back she comes, pulling the\n\tsheets OVER her head.  Motionless now, as we hear...\n\n\t... the DEAFENING SILENCE of the alarm shutting off.  A beat.\n\tRachel SITS BOLTS UPRIGHT.  LEAPS out of the room.  From the back\n\twe see that she's dressed only in a pair of men's boxers.\n\n\tShe makes it halfway down the hall, does a U TURN back into the\n\tbedroom, frantically YANKS a robe hanging from the door, taking the\n\twall hook WITH her.  She FLINGS her robe on as she RUNS down the\n\thall, wall hook STICKING OUT of her back.  BURSTING INTO...\n\n\tINT. BEN'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tBen!  You overslept again damn it!\n\n\tThe room looks like a 6 (but I'm almost 7) year old exploded.\n\tPosters of MAGICIANS on all the walls.  Rachel darts about the room\n\tmismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tGet Up Get Up Get Up!\n\n\tThe LUMP under the cover doesn't move.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tBen you're late.  I'm serious.  I'm\n\t\twearing a very serious face.  Don't\n\t\tmake me start counting ONE...\n\n\tNo movement.  Rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair,\n\tand out comes a magician's bouquet of FLOWERS.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tTWO.\n\n\tShe pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt --\n\tit's an endless MAGICIAN'S HANDKERCHIEF.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tDon't make me say three I'm about to\n\t\tsay three.\n\t\t\t(a beat, then)\n\t\tThree!\n\n\tShe RIPS the covers off and a blow-up DINOSAUR sleeps in Ben's\n\tplace.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tBen I'm not kidding around.  You make\n\t\tyourself appear this instant!\n\n\tA WHITE BUNNY saunters across her toes.  Rachel SCREAMS -- then\n\tgathers her wits and searches under the bed -- under the bureau --\n\tshe opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou might think this is funny but this\n\t\tis actually NOT funny.\n\n\tUnseen by Rachel, six-year-old BEN sits, perched on the highest\n\tcloset shelf, knees under his chin, holding his breath.  His eyes\n\tgleeful as Rachel frantically closes the closet door.\n\n\tINT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING\n\n\tRachel hops over the Bunny, navigates through strewn toys and books\n\tSTUBBING her baby toe.  She limps in agony past a big picture of\n\tthe kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a KEEP OUT\n\tEVERYONE! sign.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(bellowing)\n\t\tANNABELLE!  WAKE UP!\n\n\tANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n\tANNABELLE, 10 years old, sits on the edge of her bed, fuming, all\n\tof her limbs crossed.  She holds up a filthy purple tee shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tYou forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I\n\t\ttold you a hundred times it was Purple\n\t\tDay at school today.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI didn't forget.  I was up all night \n\t\tthinking about it and I concluded you're \n\t\ttoo special to look like everyone else.\n\t\t\t(she grabs an orangey \n\t\t\t red tee shirt)\n\t\tOrange Red.  That's your color.  Few \n\t\tcan carry it off.  Now please.  Help \n\t\tme find your brother.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tYou lost Ben?!\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tOf course not.  Does he look lost to \n\t\tyou?\n\t\t\t(big breath)\n\t\tBENNNNN!!!\n\n\tINT. SUBURBAN EXTREMELY WELL-STOCKED KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING\n\n\tRachel, smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke, FLINGS open\n\tpantry doors, closet doors -- looking for Ben -- attempting to put\n\tstone hard butter on toast at the same time.  She glances at the\n\tclock -- 7:55.  Oh dear.  Annabelle sits at the table, in a grumpy\n\torangey red mood.  Rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tNo.  I told you.  I like apple butter\n\t\tnot butter butter.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(hands her an apple)\n\t\tHere.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tNever mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(forgot)\n\t\tI'm almost done making it.\n\t\t\t(to the non-existent Ben)\n\t\tAlright Ben -- you deal with the tardy,\n\t\tyou write yourself a note, your daddy\n\t\ttold you he had an important case this\n\t\tmorning and he had to leave early and \n\t\twe were AAAAGGGGHHHH!\n\n\tShe has opened a cupboard with a Lazy Susan that turns revealing\n\tBEN sitting there.  Rachel screams AGAIN!\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tOh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're\n\t\tlate.  You're really late.  Now get out\n\t\there and have some cereal.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tFine!  Eat in the cupboard.\n\n\tShe hands him a bowl of sugared cereal -- puts two spoonfuls of\n\tinstant coffee in Barney cup, and sticks it under the faucet.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNo!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops\n\t\ton the bottom.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tFine.\n\n\tRachel grabs the bowl, turn it UPSIDE DOWN on the table reversing\n\tthe order of the cereal.  She SWEEPS it back in the bowl and\n\tquickly hands it back to him, the phone RINGS THROUGHOUT...\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tYou touched it.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tThen have a donut --\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAlright starve.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI'm gonna beep daddy at work.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tHe's badgering a witness.  Eat.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tBut you told us to starve.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(picking up phone)\n\t\tHello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's\n\t\talready there?...I'm out the door...\n\t\t\t(Ben flings a fruit loop\n\t\t\t at her)\n\t\tBen!  Knock it off!\n\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tIt's gonna go beautifully...\n\t\t\t(another fruit loop)\n\t\tDamn it Ben --\n\n\tRachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza, \n\tHoho's, and Chips.  She glances at the clock again -- 8:00.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tYou swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did\n\t\tyou remember my egg carton?  I told\n\t\tyou I needed my egg carton for seed\n\t\tplanting today.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAbsolutely Duncan I'm on top of\n\t\teverything.\n\n\tRachel takes the eggs from the fridge, and dumps them -- accidentally\n\tmissing the sink.  They SHATTER onto the floor.  She hands the empty\n\tcarton to Annabelle.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --\n\t\t\t(she hangs up, panicked)\n\t\tWe are late.  We are seriously late.  Which\n\t\tmeans Mister Ben we've got to get you \n\t\tdressed --\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNo!\n\n\tBen races away but Rachel LUNGES And CATCHES him.  He wiggles in\n\ther arms as she struggles to change his clothes.  Just as she gets\n\this bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs\n\twhen we hear a loud KNOCKING at the kitchen door.  Holding a half\n\tnaked Ben in her arms, Rachel looks up at...\n\n\tJACKIE HARRISON.  An immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel-\n\tligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme\n\tdisapproval.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE AND BEN\n\t\tMommy!\n\n\tAnnabelle and Ben RACE into their mother's arms like little angels.\n\tJackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at Rachel.  They LOCK\n\teyes.  Enough wattage to light up all of Manhattan.\n\n\tEXT. RACHEL'S LOFT, SOHO - MORNING\n\n\tJackie and the kids exit Rachel's building, onto a bustling Soho\n\tstreet.  The kids clamber into the double-parked Volvo wagon.\n\tJackie, still pissed, climbs behind the wheel.  Drives off.\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S VOLVO STATION WAGON - EARLY MORNING\n\n\tJackie drives the children down a tree-lined street in Englewood,\n\tNew Jersey.  Ben is banging Jackie's sunglasses case against the\n\twindow.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red\n\t\tand Blue make purple.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\t\t(yes she does)\n\t\tI don't care.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI know you don't, but if you had, chrom-\n\t\tatically you are in the purple family.\n\n\tJackie fishes through her purse.  Finds a toy airplane for Ben.  He\n\tstops banging her glasses case, starts banging the plane.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tWhy does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants?\n\t\tDoesn't she have underpants of her own?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI noticed a whopping pile of laundry\n\t\tsitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's\n\t\tunderpants are in there -- Now where are\n\t\tyour lunches?\n\n\tAs if by rote, they hold out their lunches.  One is a plastic Vons\n\tbag and the other a crumpled Macy's bag.  She collects them and\n\thands Ben and Annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tAnnabelle sucked her thumb last night.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!\n\n\tAnd SLUGS him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tNever say 'never' -- it's not fair to\n\t\tsay 'always' -- and no name calling.\n\t\tUse your words.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI hate when you say that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThank you.  Those were all words.  I\n\t\thate the planet Uranus.  Terrible name\n\t\tfor a planet.\n\n\tAnnabelle and Ben look up at her curiously.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI hate snails and blue cheese.\n\t\tEspecially together.  Hate.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI have lava.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(reflects)\n\t\tLava's hateable.  I never thought of\n\t\tthat.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI hate overly ripe bananas -- they make\n\t\tme want to throw up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tExcellent point.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tI hate wax lips and red ants and\n\t\tpretzels without salt...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and\n\t\tpeople who spit when they walk.\n\n\tJackie nods sagely.  Pulls up next to a school playground.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI hate to say goodbye.  Eskimo Kiss.\n\t\t\t(they rub noses)\n\t\tRussian Orthodox Wedding Kiss.\n\n\tThey bump foreheads and elbows.  Ben runs toward the kindergarten\n\tplayground; Jackie watches concerned as Annabelle climbs the steps.\n\tThe only orangey red dot in a sea of purple.\n\n\tEXT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, TRIBECA - MORNING\n\n\tTaxi pulls up to a converted warehouse.  Rachel BOLTS out, \n\tSPRINTING for the door.\n\n\tINT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY\n\n\tBlack and white FILLS the frame.  Like a checkerboard.  We PULL\n\tBACK and realize we are seeing a group of PENGUINS waddling against\n\ta black and white backdrop.  We see a WHITE WAITRE'D in a BLACK\n\tTUXEDO holding glasses on a tray.  A BLACK MODEL, IMAN, in a WHITE\n\tDRESS glides through it all.\n\n\tIn the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just\n\tentered and starts expertly directing the action.  She calls out to\n\ther assistant, COOPER.  Perpetually hip.  Perpetually young.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tCooper, back the fill off I don't have\n\t\tenough shadow...\n\n\t\t\t\tCOOPER\n\t\tYou've got a fruit loop in your hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou say that like I don't know that.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOOPER\n\t\tI once threw an entire bowl of jello\n\t\ton my stepmother's head --\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAnd when did that pass?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOOPER\n\t\tActually, never.  They'll always hate\n\t\tyou.  There's a gene for it.\n\n\tDUNCAN SAMUELS -- Rachel's boss, an elegant, edgy, Englishman\n\tinterrupts them.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUNCAN\n\t\tCongratulations.  Only forty minutes\n\t\tlate.  You're handling this promotion\n\t\treally well Rachel.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tDuncan.  My work is everything to me.\n\t\tThis'll never happen again.  Now stand\n\t\tback -- this session's gonna make you\n\t\tremember why you hired me even though\n\t\tI wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper\n\t\tlet's get these penguins dancing --\n\n\tDuncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness.  The music BLARES just\n\tthen, and a penguin JUTS forward and NIPS the model.  The FLASH of\n\tthe camera.  We FREEZE for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just\n\ttook.  An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin\n\tCOLLIDING with a maitre'd who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem\n\tto be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously.  It's an inspired photo.\n\n\tINT. SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - 2:30 THAT DAY\n\n\tJackie and LUKE HARRISON -- ruggedly handsome man, mid-forties,\n\tcharming, disarming, and smart as they come.  They sit side by side\n\ton a couch across from RUTH FRANKLIN, an Elementary School Counselor\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. FRANKLIN\n\t\tMr. and Mrs. Harrison, while change is\n\t\texhilarating for adults, it can be \n\t\tquite challenging for a child.\n\n\tLuke's beeper beeps.  He ignores it; focuses on Mr. Franklin.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI won't get that...It's fine.  Change.\n\t\twe were talking about change.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. FRANKLIN\n\t\tThe fact that you two are remarrying\n\t\tobviously has Annabelle overjoyed...\n\t\t\t(they look at her,\n\t\t\t dumbfounded)\n\t\tAnd she's very excited about your move to\n\t\tSwitzerland.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tShe said we're getting remarried?\n\n\tSuddenly -- a long bell rings -- Jackie STANDS UP, startled.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. FRANKLIN\n\t\tOnly a fire drill.  My concern is that\n\t\tAnnabelle seems apathetic towards her\n\t\twork knowing she's leaving before the\n\t\tend of the semester.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tMrs. Franklin we're not --\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tPlanning on getting --\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tRemarried.  There is no move.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. FRANKLIN\n\t\t\t(trying to appear unfazed)\n\t\tReally?  Well then my concern for --\n\n\tLuke's beeper BEEPS again.  They talk right over Mrs. Franklin...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAre you here?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI'm here.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBecause you don't really seem here.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI'm here.  I've got a case where they're\n\t\tthis close to sequestering the jury but\n\t\thave I answered the goddamn thing?!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSomething's up wi...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tYou think I didn't get that?\n\n\tShe cuts a look at Mrs. Franklin.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tExcuse him.  He never learned how\n\t\tto turn the darn thing off.\n\n\tAnd reaches.  Does it for him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. FRANKLIN\n\t\tI'm wondering if there's anything going\n\t\ton at home that could be intensifying\n\t\tAnnabelle's need to create this fantasy?\n\n\tLong pause.  Then suddenly they both start speaking AT ONCE.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI've been with someone for quite some\n\t\ttime, and didn't feel it was appropriate\n\t\tfor her to move in too quickly.  But\n\t\tafter a lot of thought and careful\n\t\tdiscussion with her -- and the kids I\n\t\tmight add -- she moved in last month.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSince our divorce Luke has seen a\n\t\tnumber of different women in three\n\t\tshort years and without a lot of\n\t\twarning for the kids, he's now living\n\t\twith a woman half his age --\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tRachel's not half my age.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWe're not discussing your age.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tWell, we're not discussing Rachel's\n\t\tage either.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThey want to be with you Luke, they go\n\t\tto your house to be with their father.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tJackie, they come to be part of my\n\t\tlife.  Rachel is part of that life.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. FRANKLIN\n\t\tMr. Harrison, I hear you talking about\n\t\tyour life, your needs, but are you\n\t\treally in touch with what Annabelle\n\t\tneeds?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(suddenly fierce)\n\t\tThis man would walk thru fire for\n\t\tAnnabelle, gladly, any day of the week.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tNapalm.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tExcept for last Thursday when Rachel\n\t\tforgot to pick them up --\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tJackie, she was five minutes late --\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. FRANKLIN\n\t\tI'm wondering if Annabelle is responding\n\t\tto the underlying hostility that exists\n\t\tbetween Rachel and Mrs. Harrison...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tOf course she's responding to it.  You\n\t\tthink it's easy for any of us?  You think\n\t\tit's easy for Jackie to watch her kids\n\t\tbeing looked after by someone who has\n\t\thalf the experience she does?  Of course\n\t\tshe's going to be hostile, irrational,\n\t\tand defensive.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThank you Luke.\n\n\tMrs. Franklin doesn't quite know what to say.  The bell RINGS.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tThank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?\n\t\t\t(they get up)\n\t\tThis has been very valuable for us.  And\n\t\tI'll have a serious talk with Annabelle\n\t\ttonight.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIt's Wednesday night.  She's at my\n\t\thouse.  I'll talk to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI'll call from work.  We can have a\n\t\tconference call.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou tried that last week and we were\n\t\ton hold forty-five minutes...\n\n\tAnd they're out the door.  You can hear the fight as it echoes down\n\tthe elementary school hallway.\n\n\tEXT. SCHOOL, ENGLEWOOD, NEW JERSEY - MOMENTS LATER\n\n\tJackie and Luke exit the pleasant suburban school.  Head for the\n\tparking area...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tYou ask me that counselor's making\n\t\ta mountain out of a molehill...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI'm worried.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tMe too.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tLuke, I need to switch next Friday for\n\t\tThursday, so why don't you take the\n\t\tweekend...\n\t\t\t(pointedly)\n\t\t...that way you'll be there, and I'll\n\t\tpick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tFine.  But I wanted to take the kids\n\t\tto work with me on Wednesday so I'll\n\t\ttake Wednesday, and you can pick up\n\t\tthat Thursday, Friday after soccer,\n\t\tand Saturday before riding.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tEasy enough.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tGood...Well...Take care.\n\n\tAs if on automatic pilot they move in to kiss each other goodbye\n\tthen stop.  Each takes a step back.  15 years of hellos and\n\tgoodbyes.  A beat.  A wave.  They head their separate ways.\n\n\tEXT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT\n\n\tEstablishing shot of Jackie's lovely home on its lovely street.\n\tOld trees.  Comfortable front lawns.  Safe and happy.  A place to\n\tgrow kids, dogs, probably walruses, even.  We PUSH toward the warm\n\tglow from within this home...\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT\n\n\tJackie setting the table.  Annabelle recording the moment with her\n\tomnipresent VIDEO CAMERA...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI didn't say that.  Why would I say\n\t\tthat?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWell Daddy and I were thinking that\n\t\tsometimes people tell a story about\n\t\twhat they wish would happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI don't want that to happen.  Why\n\t\twould I want that to happen?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWell you're telling your teachers and\n\t\tyour friends --\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tMass hysteria.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tMaybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tLook if the truth is you don't feel like\n\t\ttalking about this right now that's fine.\n\t\tBut don't look me in the eye with a big\n\t\tsmile on your face and lie to me.\n\t\tCause there are only so many lies you're\n\t\tallowed to tell before it starts showing\n\t\ton your face.

What are they feeling?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI have a snoop.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI didn't need you to take the blame\n\t\tfor me, I'm quite...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(simply)\n\t\tI didn't do it for you.  Believe me.\n\n\tAnd Jackie.  Finds that interesting.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(shrugs)\n\t\tShe already hates me.

They deserve first-\n\t\trate care.  Every minute.  Of every\n\t\tnight.  And every day.\n\n\tMore silence.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSo why did y...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI did it for her.\n\n\tStraight to her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tPoor kid has to believe in someone.\n\t\tEven if it's you.\n\n\tNothing friendly about it.  But Jackie hasn't come seeking\n\tfriendship.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI have an appointment this after-\n\t\tnoon.  I need someone to take them\n\t\tto the park.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWhat?  And have Federal agents jump\n\t\tout of the bushes with court orders?\n\t\tHow many years do you get in this\n\t\tstate for giving second-rate care to\n\t\tminors?\n\n\tHard looks.  All around.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tHowever many.  It's not enough.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday,\n\t\tI actually thought my boss was going\n\t\tto fire me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tFine, forget it.\n\n\tBut neither of them wants her to.  A Mexican Standoff.  Until\n\tJackie empties her huge purse on the counter.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new\n\t\tshoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's.\n\t\tKleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty\n\t\tseat covers for public restrooms...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWhy not just bring the whole toilet?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBen likes to be read to.

Jackie hands her a Post It.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tHere's their schedule for this after-\n\t\tnoon.  I'll meet you at the park at\n\t\tfive.

STUDIO CORRIDOR - MORNING\n\n\tJackie stands outside a door.  Deciding.  She knocks and enters...\n\n\t...Duncan's office.  He sits behind his desk, across from a client.\n\tBoth men looking up at this stranger.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tMr. Samuels?  Forgive the intrusion,\n\t\tI'm Jacqueline Harrison, and...\n\n\tThe sweetest smile she's got.  Which is pretty good.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t...well, I just wanted to thank you.\n\t\tFor your generosity.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUNCAN\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tGener...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t...my daughter had a terrible\n\t\temergency yesterday.  My husband and I\n\t\tcouldn't be reached, and...your Ms.\n\t\tKelly came to Annabelle's rescue.\n\n\tConfides...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI'd hate to think what might have\n\t\thappened.\n\n\tShakes her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tShe told me that you were so suppor-\n\t\ttive, even at great inconvenience to\n\t\tyour business, and...\n\n\tAn amazing smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIt's wonderful to see a successful\n\t\tman.  With that sense of priorities.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUNCAN\n\t\t\t(longer beat)\n\t\tWell...under the circumstances...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIf I can ever repay your kindness.  It\n\t\twould be my great pleasure.\n\n\tBacking out the door...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t...and your Ms. Kelly?  A remarkable\n\t\tyoung woman.\n\n\tThe client is beaming.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUNCAN\n\t\t\t(clearing his throat)\n\t\tWe think so.\n\n\tINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON\n\n\tCLOSE on Jackie, looking down.  She seems to be staring at\n\tsomething in her lap...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(quiet anger)\n\t\tI don't even know what that means.\n\t\tSpread.  That is very unclear.\n\n\t...but there is nothing there.  Her lap is empty.  Except for her\n\tunnaturally still hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (O.S., gently)\n\t\tI means we found some cells.  In your\n\t\tlymph nodes.  In three of them.\n\n\tThe hands come together.  Slowly, deliberately.  Stating to anyone\n\twho would watch that there is no panic here.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBut the other time.  You said you got\n\t\tit all.  So you could be wrong again.\n\t\tOne time, you say one thing, then...\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (O.S.)\n\t\tThe other time.  Was a year ago.\n\n\tThe air comes out of Jackie.  In a thin, slow, precise stream.\n\tEverything, her very breath.  Under complete control.\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (O.S.)\n\t\tThat was a tiny lump in the breast.\n\t\tWe radiated, we thought we had it\n\t\tall. We were hopeful.  But there\n\t\twere no guarantees.\n\n\tSilence.  Jackie's eyes stay on her folded, still, hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBut we can beat it.\n\n\tPULL BACK to see the small, neatly kept office.  DR. SWEIKERT is\n\t50, slender, elegant, kind.  The doctor you want when you're dying.\n\tJackie looks up to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tPeople beat it, don't they?  All\n\t\tthe time.\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. SWEIKERT\n\t\t\t(straight)\n\t\tEvery day.  More and more.\n\n\tJackie swallows.  The confirmation of hope has allowed some of the\n\tfear to show.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSo we'll...radiate some more?\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. SWEIKERT\n\t\tAt first.  Then, after awhile, some\n\t\tchemo.\n\n\tA blow.  Jackie absorbs this.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThat's necessary, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. SWEIKERT\n\t\tLet's take our best shot.\n\n\tJackie nods.  Staring at the woman.  Then, to break the spell...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI guess a no-hair day beats a\n\t\tbad-hair day.\n\n\tThe doctor smiles.  Jackie looks at her watch...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI have to get dressed.  My ex-husband\n\t\thas asked me to dinner.  God knows\n\t\twhy, he was very mysteri...\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. SWEIKERT\n\t\tHave you still never told him?\n\n\tA flash of the anger flickers.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhy would his worry?  Or my children's\n\t\tworry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the\n\t\tsit...\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. SWEIKERT\n\t\t\t(very soft)\n\t\tSooner than later.  You really need\n\t\tto.\n\n\tThat brings a silence.  A shading of defiance to Jackie's features.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou don't burden others needlessly.\n\t\tThat's how I was raised, Doctor.\n\n\tHold the look.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. SWEIKERT\n\t\tMaybe at dinner tonight.  Think\n\t\tabout it.\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S BATHROOM - DUSK\n\n\tJackie is getting dressed in front of the mirror, her eyes distant,\n\tin spite of her attempts at control.  Annabelle is watching her\n\tlike a hawk.  We see Ben in the BACKGROUND -- sawing the BABYSITTER\n\tALISE in half.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tWhy are you going to a French\n\t\trestaurant?\n\n\tThroughout, Annabelle is trying on Jackie's jewelry, making a pest\n\tof herself.  Jackie fights against rising irritation.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBecause it's quiet.  And he wants to\n\t\ttalk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in\n\t\thalf, it's bedtime...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tWhat are you gonna talk about?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(applying mascara)\n\t\tProbably you -- your brother -- school --\n\t\tThe solar system...The usual...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tThen why are you putting on mascara?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tI'm a little tired and it's just a\n\t\tpick-me-up.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tBut you only wore mascara when you and\n\t\tDaddy went on romantic dates...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWell Daddy and I are just friends\n\t\tnow, and that's no reason not to\n\t\twear mascara...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tOr blush.  You look pale.\n\n\tEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n\tA Country French place on the West Side.  Classy, but inviting.\n\n\tINT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n\tJackie and Luke sit across from each other in the lovely\n\trestaurant.  Jackie looks beautiful in the warm candlelight.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\t...Maybe you don't think three years\n\t\tis enough for a person to change\n\t\tbut...things are different now Jackie.\n\t\tI'm different.\n\n\tJackie feels her heart beginning to race.  They lock eyes for a\n\tmoment.  He unconsciously begins to eat off her plate.  He eats\n\ther chicken, and in the dance they've done a thousand times -- she\n\treaches for his uneaten vegetables.  The WAITER approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAITER\n\t\tWould you and your wife prefer\n\t\tstill or sparkling water?\n\n\tHe doesn't correct the waiter.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tStill, please.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(when the waiter leaves)\n\t\tAnnabelle showed me the new dress.\n\t\tShe's amazing in it.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tGetting so beautiful...she looks more\n\t\tlike you every day.\n\t\t\t(Luke downs Jackie's wine)\n\t\tJackie...I've really given this a lot\n\t\tof thought.  A great deal of thought...\n\n\tTheir eyes lock for a moment.  Here it comes...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI'm gonna marry Rachel.  I know you don't\n\t\tthink much of her but she's a special\n\t\tperson -- she really is.  And I love her.\n\t\tThis is a bridge we never wanted to cross\n\t\tbut it's not helping her or the kids if I\n\t\tdon't really commit to that.\n\n\tJackie stares at him stonefaced.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI didn't think a phone call was\n\t\tappropriate...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tTell me exactly how you're different\n\t\tfrom three years ago?  The music\n\t\tsounds kind of the same from where\n\t\tI'm sitting.\n\n\tHe shifts in his chair.  Wants this to sound as authentic as he\n\tfeels it...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a\n\t\tlife that's built around commitm...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tJust not to me.\n\n\tThe waiter returns with a bottle of red wine.  It's horribly quiet\n\tas he pours.  Waits, obtrusively.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tThank you, it's fine...\n\n\t\t\t\tWAITER\n\t\tWould you like to taste it?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tCan we please have less service, here?\n\n\tThe waiter leaves, taking his attitude with him.  Luke sighs...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tIt's going to be hard for the kids\n\t\twhen I tell them...I'd like you to\n\t\tbe there.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tTo make it easier for them or you?\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tIt's a huge moment in their life --\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou can't be an 'us' just when you\n\t\twant to.  You can't play that card\n\t\twhen it's convenient.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tWe...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWE are over.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tWE'RE still their parents for the next\n\t\thundred years.\n\n\tOn this, Jackie looks down at her hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tYou're still going to have to be\n\t\tdealing with me -- with us.  We should\n\t\ttell them together.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tNo.  You think this is going to help\n\t\tthe kids then you do it.  You're on\n\t\tyour own.\n\n\tINT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT\n\n\tJackie sits next to Luke on the couch -- looking lovingly towards the\n\tchildren, who sit across from them.  Annabelle is taping this...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThe great thing about life is that\n\t\tthings keep changing.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tRemember when Mommy and Daddy got\n\t\tdivorced?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnd we all went through that together?\n\n\tON Ben.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tJackie moves to Annabelle who won't put down the camera.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnnabelle...Rachel's not taking my place\n\t\tas your mother -- it's just Daddy's chance\n\t\tto be happy again.  Isn't that what we\n\t\tall want for each other?\n\n\tNo answers.  Jackie looks at this daughter she loves so much.  Pats\n\tthe seat beside her...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tCome.  Sit.\n\n\tSomething in the softening of the tone changes the atmosphere in\n\tthe room.  More real.  More like equals.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tLife is full of hard things.  And we\n\t\tcan't always have what we want, you\n\t\tknow that.\n\n\tDon't you?  Annabelle nods, cautiously.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBut we do have a choice.  To make it\n\t\tbetter.  Instead of worse.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tLike how?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tLike seeing the good side of Rachel.\n\t\tSo she'll see the good side of us.\n\n\tAnnabelle's stare is hard and questioning.  She didn't expect this.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBecause I'm looking ahead.  And you\n\t\tknow what I see...?\n\n\tAnnabelle doesn't.  But she sure is listening.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tTime will come.

RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n\tBarely any light in the empty kitchen.  PAN to see Ben, alone, in\n\this cape.  Carefully, he sets a cup of saucer atop a cloth napkin\n\tthat lies across the butcher block table.\n\n\tHe GRASPS the corners of the napkin.  He looks scared.  We get\n\twhat's about to happen.  As he...\n\n\t...YANKS the napkin, as FAST as he can, the cup and saucer, RATTLE\n\tand...\n\n\t...stay put.\n\n\tBen.  Is astounded.\n\n\tAnd then he looks up.  To a cabinet filled.

Rachel is juggling a\n\tcoffee and maybe nine cookies.  Drops one.  Picks it up.  Dusts it\n\toff.  Jackie is repelled, but has to smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSmall world.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tLuke's depo ran late.  I promised\n\t\tI'd take notes.\n\n\tTo prove it, she balances the cookies on her thighs, and produces a\n\tnotebook.  Looks around, and in a conspiratorial near-whisper...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tSo I have to tell you something\n\t\tin confidence...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou're a cross-dresser.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tThat.  And.  Annabelle is over\n\t\ther head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat'\n\t\tKovitsky.\n\n\tDoes a Groucho eyebrow move.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tShe hasn't mentioned this.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tShe was afraid you'd make a big\n\t\tdeal out of it.\n\n\tJackie is hurt.  Covers...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tMoi?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tToi.  They've been 'going out'\n\t\tfor two weeks.\n\n\tRachel breathless and happy.  Jackie attentive.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAs you may know, 'going out' in the\n\t\tsix grade doesn't mean shit.  They\n\t\tdon't actually go to a movie or\n\t\tanywhere, they don't even eat lunch\n\t\ttogether, it's just a declaration to\n\t\tthe world that they're...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t...going out, yeh.  I had kids of\n\t\tmy own, once.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAnyway.  He walks up to her on\n\t\tlunch yard today.  And tells her...\n\t\tpublicly...that they're 'breaking up.'\n\n\tJackie's mouth drops.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tOh, my God.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tRight.  Which is the whole point of\n\t\tthis 'going out' thing, so one of them\n\t\tcan dump the other one, and they can\n\t\timitate the whole passionate adult\n\t\tsoap opera tragedy, without ever\n\t\thaving to actually date.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tShe's devastated.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tDoesn't begin to describe it.\n\t\tI mean, you've got cancer, this\n\t\tis serious.\n\n\tRachel GRIPS Jackie's arm.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tShe spent an hour in the girls' bath-\n\t\troom, crying with eight of her closest\n\t\tfriends, who are sending the message\n\t\tto every boy in the grade that Brad\n\t\tKovitsky is yesterday's toast.\n\n\tDevours an entire cookie in one gulp.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tSo here's the point.  I pick her up\n\t\tfrom soccer, she tells me the whole\n\t\tmess, and asks me what to do.\n\n\tHow about that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnd you said...?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tBeats me.  Ask your mom.\n\n\tOh.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tSo she's gonna.  Tomorrow.\n\n\tLeans closer.  Whispers...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tDon't fuck this up.\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\tJackie and Annabelle are sitting at the kitchen counter with maybe\n\ttwenty hardboiled eggs.  They are cracking the shells gently, and\n\tcarefully peeling them.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWell, did you really think you'd\n\t\tmeet someone at eleven that you'd\n\t\tspend the rest of your life with?\n\n\tAnnabelle keeps her eyes on her eggs.  A craftswoman.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tNo, but I thought till Thursday.\n\n\tOh.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhat's Thursd...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tA debate.  Man's inhumanity to\n\t\twoman.

Annabelle looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tHe's not even there.  You don't\n\t\tsee him, you don't hear him, you're\n\t\tjust too much of a woman to bother\n\t\twith little boys.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tThis is a joke, right?\n\n\tJackie shakes her head.  Nope.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAll he wants is the attention.\n\t\tWhen he can't get to you, he'll try\n\t\tharder for a little while.  Then,\n\t\the'll give up.  It'll be no fun.\n\n\tThe kid blinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tYou think Rache would do that?\n\n\tTakes Mom back a bit.  Enough for her daughter to notice.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tIt's just she's younger.  Maybe\n\t\tshe remembers how to do this.\n\n\tJackie shrugs.  Maybe.  Annabelle studies her.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tThis'll work, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tOh, yeh.\n\n\tAnnabelle takes heart from her mom's confidence.

YARD - DAY\n\n\tAERIAL VIEW of Jackie, Annabelle, Tucker and assorted neighborhood\n\tlooky-loo kids from SEVENTY FEET in the air.  Everyone looks like\n\tTINY DOTS running around the lawn.  We realize that we are almost\n\tat the TOP of a giant EVERGREEN TREE.\n\n\tWe see a patch of red.  And now a blue stripe.  The wind reveals\n\tmore -- It's BEN CLIMBING to the very top of the tree.  The calling\n\tof his name becoming more and more faint in the distance -- His leg\n\tMISSES a branch -- causing a cluster of PINE CONES to FALL in front\n\tof Jackie -- she looks up screaming --\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBEEEENNNNNN!\n\n\tJackie's POV -- Ben crouched at the top of the evergreen -- as the\n\twind sways the tree perilously back and forth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tDon't move!\n\n\tSMASH CUT TO LATER, as...\n\n\tAn enormous CRANE moves through the sky.  Jackie holds tightly onto\n\tJESSICA, a diminutive five-foot-tall Firewoman, as they soar skyward\n\ttowards Ben.  A slightly condescending tone to...\n\n\t\t\t\tJESSICA\n\t\tThat's quite a grip you have there\n\t\tMa'am.  Do we have an issue with\n\t\theights?\n\n\tPatronized the wrong gal.  In a crisis.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(looking her up and\n\t\t\t down)\n\t\tI don't care if you're a dwarf,\n\t\tso long as you do your job.\n\t\tBEN!  I'M COMING!  STAY THERE!\n\t\tMOMMY'S COMING!\n\n\t\t\t\tJESSICA\n\t\tMa'am, my arm's going numb, maybe\n\t\tyou could loosen your grip just a\n\t\tlittle.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThat's absolutely out of the question.\n\t\tBEN!  I'M HERE!\n\n\tThe crane STOPS.  Ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees;\n\tthey SWAY from side to side like a METRONOME.\n\n\t\t\t\tJESSICA\n\t\tHello Ben.  Your mother says you're\n\t\treal good at disappearing --\n\n\tBen tries to climb a little higher -- Branches SNAP.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBen!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now\n\t\tstop climbing!\n\t\t\t(He keeps climbing)\n\t\tBen listen to me...\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tNo!

I have to tell him he's made\n\t\ta mistake.  He should take Grammy\n\t\tMartha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.\n\n\tJackie's heart breaks, unable to speak.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBen.  God doesn't like visitors.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tHow do you know?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAsk her, she's a heroic Fireperson.\n\t\tShe does this twenty times a day.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tOh.\n\n\tJessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb.\n\n\t\t\t\tJESSICA\n\t\tOh yeh.  It's in our official manual.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThat's right, Ben.  That's why Firemen\n\t\thave giant ladders and climb up\n\t\tand down poles.  They're like...\n\t\tmessengers... carrier pigeons...\n\t\tbetween heaven and earth.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tThat's good cause we need to hurry.\n\t\tMy mom doesn't have very much time\n\t\tleft.\n\n\t\t\t\tJESSICA\n\t\tThen you know what we should do?\n\t\tWe should go to the Fire Station\n\t\ttogether and ring the firebell to\n\t\tget God's attention.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tCause it's an emergency.\n\n\tBen opens his arms, teeters, and Jessica HAS him.  She reaches him\n\tout, and...\n\n\t...HANDS him to Jackie, alone in the cherry-picker.  Jackie GRASPS\n\tBen, pulling him FIERCELY to her arms in a death grip.\n\n\tFrom down below, the kids CHEER.  The worst is over.\n\n\tHOLD on Jackie, clutching her baby for dear life.  Knowing it isn't.\n\t\n\tINT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tJackie stands in the doorway watching her son -- her baby boy --\n\tsleeping.  She looks drawn, but even if her body would let her\n\tsleep she couldn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tGod...I will do anything...I will\n\t\tgo through any amount of pain you\n\t\tgive me.  If you'll just let me\n\t\tsee them grow up.\n\n\tA slow ragged breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIs that asking so damn much?\n\n\tShe leaves the room soundlessly.  Ben stirs.\n\n\tANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n\tAnnabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light.  Jackie\n\tappears, leaning down to rouse her gently.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnnabelle...wake up honey...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\t\t(sleepy)\n\t\tMom?  What's wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tNothing sweetheart.\n\n\tJackie sits on the edge of the bed, stroking Annabelle's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI got Ginny Weintraub to come stay\n\t\twith Ben.\n\n\tAnnabelle's puzzled look.  Why would you do that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tHow'd you like to go someplace\n\t\tspecial with me?  Right now.\n\n\tEXT. NORTH VALE STABLES - NIGHT\n\n\tThe light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see Jackie\n\tand Annabelle sitting on a horse.  Annabelle in front, Jackie with\n\ta strong hold on her.  Both have their nightgowns tucked into their\n\tjeans, coats over them.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tHold tight, sweetheart.\n\n\tShe KICKS the horse forward and they HEAD OFF toward the rolling\n\thills in the distance.  Jackie and Annabelle ride faster and faster\n\talong the trail.  Jackie has one arm firmly around Annabelle's\n\twaist and controls the horse with the other.  Jackie closes her\n\teyes for a moment, allowing the wind to wash over her.  The smells\n\tand sounds of the night seem to free her, give her strength.\n\tAnnabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight.\n\tJackie soon joins her, and the sounds of their laughter break the\n\tsilence of the night.\n\n\tThey come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the\n\ttears on Jackie's face.  Annabelle can't see, and stares out at the\n\tmoonlit valley before them.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI'm never, never going to forget this.\n\n\tAnnabelle snuggles back.  Happy.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tNever say never.\n\n\tJackie kisses the top of her baby's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou're old enough to learn the\n\t\tloophole.  You can say 'never,\n\t\tnever'.  If you mean it enough.\n\t\tTo say it twice.\n\n\tAnnabelle yawns.  So content in her mother's arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI'll remember.  Always, always.\n\n\tSo Jackie grips a little tighter.  Breathes a single word, just\n\tloud enough to hear...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tPromise.\n\n\tEXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DUSK\n\n\tRachel and Luke heading up the path to Jackie's door.  It is early\n\twinter.  Stark trees, a light snow on the ground.  Rachel pulls her\n\tcoat tighter around her.\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S FRONT DOOR - DUSK\n\n\tBen rumbling down the hall to the door.

Annabelle sits sullenly in front of\n\tthe TV.  Her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside\n\ther.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tHey, gorgeous, where's Big Mama?\n\n\tNo answer.  Annabelle worried about something.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tShe still packing for her trip?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI killed my math quiz, A-minus.\n\n\tThey slap FIVE.  Go through the ritual of a three-step black guy\n\thandshake.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAnd...other things?  At school?\n\n\tAnnabelle cuts a look in Luke and Ben's direction.  Please not in\n\tfront of the menfolk.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWe'll talk.  I'll go check\n\t\ton Mom.\n\n\tAnnabelle frowns at Mom's name.  Rachel strokes her.  Heads down\n\tthe hall...\n\n\tKnocks at the open door to Jackie's bedroom, where Jackie is\n\tcalmly, meticulously, laying out things beside her large open\n\tsuitcase.  She waves Rachel in, and keeps working.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(checking out the\n\t\t\t stuff)\n\t\tIt's gonna be cool, huh?\n\n\tBulky sweaters.  Wool things.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI can never figure weather.  Last\n\t\ttrip, I made all the wrong choices.\n\n\tRachel and we have a better angle now.  Jackie looks awful.  Drawn,\n\tweak, masking pain with obvious courage.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tBad day?\n\n\tRachel sits on the edge of the bed.  Jackie turns away, goes to her\n\topen chest of drawers.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tCan't complain.\n\n\tEven her voice is carefully under control.  Awkward, Rachel looks\n\taround the room.  A stack of photo albums, scrapbooks, open.  Works\n\tin progress.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tCan I look at the pictures?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIt's a mess, right now.

That Jackie sensed something.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tIt's not about the kids.\n\n\tLooks over.  Decides whether to ask...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tThat thing you said before.  Pushing\n\t\tthe guy sleeping next to you away.\n\t\tBecause of what you gave up for\n\t\tmotherhood...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIs that what he told you?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tHe won't discuss it.

You told her\n\t\tyou had doubts.\n\n\tHe looks around.  People are moving on.

JACKIE'S YARD - DAY\n\n\tRachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set.  She\n\tis pacing in a circle, looking like a kid waiting to see the\n\tprincipal.  Sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen.  She picks\n\ta bottle of beer off the grass.  Twists the top.  Settles awkwardly\n\ton the seat of the taller swing.\n\n\tHEAR the screen door open.  Bang shut.  Rachel takes a sip.  Before\n\tshe looks up...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(low, calm)\n\t\tNow we're going to have a fight,\n\t\tyou and I.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(barely audible)\n\t\tAre we.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnd I'm going to win.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(straight to her eyes)\n\t\tDon't be too sure.\n\n\tNo anger in Jackie at this moment.

Let's\n\t\tget to it.\n\n\tNot quite what Jackie expected.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou put filth in my child's mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAw.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou had her lie about that...\n\t\tthat fancy-boy model!\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWorked.

Closer.  Fierce.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tMine.  Is a little different.\n\n\tRight there.  At the swing.  In her face.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSee, in that crisis, I saw an\n\t\topportunity.  For some real growth.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tOh please.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tShut the fuck up.  I didn't go\n\t\tbehind your back.\n\n\tThe one scored.  Rachel sips her beer.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tDoing the right thing.  Knowing who\n\t\tyou are, inside.  Not caving to peer\n\t\tpressure, or lowering yourself to that\n\t\tlevel, steering your own course...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tShe wasn't steering her own course,\n\t\tshe was steering yours.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWell, that's what parenting is about,\n\t\tlittle girl.  They are pleading to\n\t\tknow how they are supposed to do it.\n\t\tAnd you sure as hell showed her.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnd there will come another moment.\n\t\tWhen the stakes are really there.\n\t\tAnd she will look back on this.  And\n\t\tremember how good it felt.  How easy\n\t\tit was.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAnd she'll fight back again.  God help\n\t\tme, what have I done.\n\n\tJackie's voice drops.  The softness makes it somehow more\n\tmenacing...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou've turned her into you.  And\n\t\tI may not get another chance.  To\n\t\tturn her back.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(suddenly fierce)\n\t\tThat's what it is.

Oh, yes you do.\n\n\tHER finger stabbing out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou didn't get morning sickness for\n\t\tseven months, you didn't breast feed\n\t\ttill your nipples fell off, you didn't\n\t\tspend every minute of every day\n\t\tthinking and planning and knowing that\n\t\tyour decisions were shaping the people\n\t\tthey were going to be...\n\n\tAnd now Rachel.  Has nothing to say.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou are gonna be taking Ben's training\n\t\twheels off.  You are the one my little\n\t\tgirl will confess her first love to.\n\t\tYou will see them married, you will\n\t\tplay with their babies, you fucking\n\t\tBITCH, I hate your GUTS!\n\n\tThe blast washes over Rachel.  And in the silence...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tNow you're talking sense.\n\n\tShe looks down at her beer.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAll year long, I've been watching how\n\t\tyou do this.  The worries, the sacri-\n\t\tfices, the signals you give them...\n\n\tThinks.  Really thinks.  Wants so much to say this right.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAnd I admire you.  More than you'll\n\t\tever believe.  And yet...this...\n\t\tthing...has been growing.  Inside me.\n\n\tLooks up.  Straight to her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tFor better or worse.

INDOOR RIDING RING - TWILIGHT\n\n\tHuge indoor space.  Wood-sided walls, dirt floor.  High corrugated\n\tmetal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters.  A little GIRL,\n\tunder the keen eye of her TRAINER, puts her mount through its\n\tpaces.  In the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body.  It's\n\tlate, no one else around.  TRACK now...\n\n\t...down a walkway.  Toward the stables.  A barn cat is crouched,\n\tstalking prey.  We hear a soft voice, speaking.  One we know...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE (O.S.)\n\t\tIt was like telling her...\n\n\tSee him now.  Standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\t...that I didn't love her anymore...\n\n\tSee the horse, still steaming.  Standing patiently.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\t...if I could be sure I'd always\n\t\tstay.\n\n\tCircling the horse now, we see Annabelle's back.  She is slowly\n\tbrushing out the sweat mark.  Where the saddle used to be.  Her\n\tmovements are stiff, mechanical.  The soft voice continues...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE (O.S.)\n\t\tShe said, 'This thing you call a\n\t\tpartnership.  The schedules, the\n\t\tchores, all the things we have to\n\t\twork out...'\n\n\tOur ANGLE CIRCLING to see at last Annabelle's face...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(softer)\n\t\t'...for the kids.'\n\n\tThe tears that stand in her eyes.

Because she will not cry.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE (O.S.)\n\t\tThat's the kind of person your mom is.\n\t\tShe's the best.\n\n\tAnnabelle says nothing.  She drops to her knees.  Begins to clean\n\tout one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick.  The only sound\n\tagainst the stillness.\n\n\tAnd her father watches.  His heart pounding.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tI complained a lot, baby.  We couldn't\n\t\ttravel, we'd lost our privacy, our\n\t\tchance to do things on the spur of the\n\t\tmoment.

Not knowing what to\n\tsay.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThanks for coming out.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tNeutral ground.  What's up?\n\n\tJackie stares evenly.  Her chin rests across the back of her\n\tknuckles.  She looks tired, but okay.  Fueled by adrenaline.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tLuke called.  He says you're\n\t\tchecking out.  Of the Heartbreak\n\t\tHotel.\n\n\tThe waitress appears.  Rachel too locked into the moment to notice.\n\tSo...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tShe likes a Stolie, no ice.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tDouble.\n\n\tAs the woman leaves...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhat's this about?  Because\n\t\twe fought?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tDon't flatter yourself.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI always liked that line.\n\n\tSigns.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI love Luke, I love the children.\n\t\tBut there is more to life than\n\t\teven love...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tNo, there isn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAnd I have looked down the road.\n\t\tAt what my life will be.  And I\n\t\tcan't handle it.\n\n\tJackie unblinking.  Focused, strong.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhat do you see?  Down that road.\n\n\tNo answer.  Then...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI never wanted to be a mom.  Then,\n\t\tsharing it with you was one thing.\n\t\tCarrying it alone, the rest of my\n\t\tlife...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIs scary.  But you want it.  Gimme\n\t\tsome truth here.\n\n\tThe Stolie arrives.  They wait a beat.  The waitress disappears.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWell, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome,\n\t\thuh?  You die young, you always look\n\t\tgolden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of\n\t\tburnishes the image, and...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tCome on, a wuss like me?  The stiff\n\t\twho wouldn't help her own daughter\n\t\tfight back?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tMaybe I was wrong on that one.\n\n\tThat sits there.  In its sincerity.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWell, maybe you weren't.\n\n\tAnd so does that.  Tears are forming in Rachel's eyes.  Here, in\n\tthis public place.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tLook, when I said I couldn't channel\n\t\tyou.  That didn't mean I wouldn't give\n\t\tmy right arm to do just that.\n\n\tShakes her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tMaybe I don't want to be looking over\n\t\tmy shoulder.  Every day for twenty\n\t\tyears.  Knowing someone else would\n\t\thave done it right.  The way I can't.\n\n\tJackie waits.  Thinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tTrade you a smoke.  For a secret.\n\n\tThe way she said that.  Something weighty behind it.  So Rachel\n\treaches into her purse.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou know, I lost Ben awhile back?\n\t\tIn a supermarket.\n\n\tRachel's hand freezes.  In mid-course.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou're lying.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI lost him.  I was panicked.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou are lying, you never lost that\n\t\tkid for 4 seconds, you could find him\n\t\tfrom a coma, there is no WAY!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(smiles)\n\t\tI was running around like a chicken\n\t\twith my head chopped off.  Doing my\n\t\timitation of you.\n\n\tRachel still not buying...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tBen never mentioned it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tHe only remembers I found him.  My\n\t\tpoint is, telling you this story would\n\t\thave been the kindest, most helpful\n\t\tthing I could ever have done for you.\n\n\tThe smile fades.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhy didn't I?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tUh.  You hate my guts?\n\n\tPassing the cigarettes over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWe were competing.  Even then.\n\n\tYes we were.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tInstead of being partners.  Watch-\n\t\ting each other's back.  Seeing things\n\t\twere covered.\n\n\tPulls out a smoke.  Offers the pack...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou're not scared you'll think you\n\t\tdon't measure up.  You're scared\n\t\tthey'll think it.  That's the JFK\n\t\tthing, yeh?\n\n\tRachel takes one.  Eye contact holding.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWith good reason.  They fucking\n\t\tworship you as it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhat do I have that you don't?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tEverything.  You're...the Earth\n\t\tMother incarnate...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou're the hip and fresh.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou ride with Annabelle...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou'll learn.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou know every story, every wound,\n\t\tevery memory, their whole life's\n\t\thappiness has been wrapped up in\n\t\tyou, every moment...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI have their past.\n\n\tSTRIKES the match.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou.  Have their future.\n\n\tRachel stunned.  By the simplicity of it all.  Slowly, she leans to\n\taccept Jackie's flame.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tDon't you get it?  You look down the\n\t\troad to her wedding.  You're in the\n\t\troom alone with her, fitting her veil,\n\t\tfluffing her dress.  Telling her no\n\t\twoman was ever that beautiful.\n\n\tTears now.  Standing in two pairs of eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnd your fear is.  She'll be\n\t\tthinking.  I wish Mom were here.\n\n\tJackie lights her own.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAnd mine is.  She won't.\n\n\tHer hand trembles as she takes a drag.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tNow that's enough fear for either\n\t\tone of us to kill the other.  And\n\t\tno jury in the world would convict.\n\n\tJackie raises her glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWe're guilty, girl.  Of being human.\n\t\tAnd we can't forgive ourselves.\n\n\tHolds it forward.  In a toast.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBut I forgive you.\n\n\tAnd slowly, Rachel lifts her own glass.  CLICKS it with Jackie's.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tDon't rush me.  I'm deciding.\n\n\tSLOW DISSOLVE TO...\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING\n\n\tWhite Christmas outside the window.  Richly trimmed tree, presents\n\teverywhere, carols softly playing.  The whole nine yards.  Luke and\n\tBen standing at a wrapped bird cage, where a dove is cooing inside.\n\tAnnabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed NURSE.\n\n\tRachel enters.  Kisses Annabelle's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI'm gonna check on Mom.\n\n\tGoes down the hall, every emotion in the world is playing across\n\ther face.  Into...\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM\n\n\tJackie lies on her death bed.  She is beautiful and near the end.\n\tDespite the IV tube, the monitor, she's gotten to serenity after\n\tall.  As close as any of us will ever get.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tHey, gorgeous.  Time for the\n\t\tpresents?\n\n\tJackie licks her lips.  Pretty dry.  Rachel takes a cotton lemon\n\tswab from the nightstand.  Tenderly, cleans Jackie's mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tNow Edna says you short-changed your\n\t\tlast meds.  You can do presents and be\n\t\tcomfortable at the same time, y'know.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(clears her throat)\n\t\tJust want to be a little sharper.\n\t\tFor a few minutes.\n\n\tA few minutes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSome things to say.  To the kids,\n\t\thuh?\n\n\tSmiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThen, bring in the presents.  We'll\n\t\thave big fun.\n\n\tRachel can't really bear this.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou know, there's nothing you\n\t\thave to say.  Because they know\n\t\tyour heart.  You don't have t...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tJust sit me up.  Nice and tall.\n\t\tBring Benjamin first.\n\n\tStaring at each other.  Then Rachel reaches her arms around\n\tJackie, and as gently as she can manage, lifts her to a full\n\tsitting position.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tScrapbook.\n\n\tRachel brings the big book.  Lays it on the bed.  And goes.\n\n\tJackie begins to turn the pages.  Her life with these children\n\tpassing before her eyes.  No tears.   No smile.  Just full\n\tattention.  Fingertips touch the one she was looking for, as...\n\n\tThe door OPENS.  Ben, hesitant, enters alone.  His mother's face is\n\tfine and strong and smiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tFind the bird cage?\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(standing there)\n\t\tRache says it's from you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWell, don't make him disappear\n\t\tbefore I see him.\n\n\tBen nods.  Okay, I won't.  She glances to the scrapbook...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tOh, look at this.\n\n\tAnd forgetting his uneasiness, he runs over, climbs ONTO the bed.\n\tJackie doesn't wince, doesn't even blink.  Nothing for his memory\n\tbank but smiles.  He looks at the photo...\n\n\t...Jackie holding a spunky newborn.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThat's you and me.  Our first photo\n\t\tas a couple.\n\n\tHe nods.  Really staring at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tDid you know I was good-looking\n\t\tright away?\n\n\tShe reaches to hold his face in her hand.  Stares in his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThis good-looking.  Was beyond\n\t\tmy imagination.\n\n\tShe leans.  Kisses his lips lightly.  How many more times will she\n\tget to do this?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(a murmur)\n\t\tSo what do you think we're gonna\n\t\ttalk about?\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\t(straight back)\n\t\tYou dying.\n\n\tShe nods.  Her smile is right there.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThe secret of it.  That only\n\t\tmagicians.  Can ever understand.\n\n\tHis eyes brighten.  The sadness pushed aside.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tSee, when we die.  Our body goes\n\t\taway.  Our body.  But we...we are\n\t\tnot our body, are we?\n\n\tHe doesn't know.  Maybe he thought we were.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIf a soldier loses his legs in a\n\t\twar.  Is he the same guy?  Sure\n\t\the is.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tBut you can still see him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tHalf.  Of him.\n\n\tThis is so fucking hard.  But her eyes stay dry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tDying.  Is where the whole body\n\t\tgoes away.  So you can't see any\n\t\tof it.  But...\n\n\tRests her hand tenderly.  On his hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhat do magicians know?\n\n\tLeans forward.  Here's the secret...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tJust because you can't see it.\n\t\tDoesn't.  Mean.  It's gone.\n\n\tDoes it?  And Ben smiles.  He is inside the secret.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThe world.  Thinks I'm gone.  But\n\t\tonly the magician.  Knows better.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tSo where are you?\n\n\tShe was waiting for this.  For a long time.  She wraps her hand\n\taround his fist.  And puts their hands against his heart.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tRight here.  Right here.  Inside\n\t\tthe magician.  Shhhh.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tCan I talk to you?  When you're\n\t\tthere.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAlways.  Always.  And you won't\n\t\thear a voice.  But in here.  You'll\n\t\tknow.  What I'm saying.\n\n\tYes, you will.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tIt's not good enough.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tNo, it isn't.  Because it isn't\n\t\teverything.  And we want every-\n\t\tthing, don't we?\n\n\tHe nods.  They do.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tBut God does let us keep the one\n\t\tbest thing we have together.  The\n\t\tone best thing we've always had.\n\t\tKnow what it is?\n\n\tHe doesn't.  But he wants to.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI love you.  And you love me.\n\n\tComes closer.  Nose to nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tIt's worth a lot.  Will you keep it?\n\n\tHe answers.  With a kiss.\n\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n\tLuke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle.  Ben\n\truns in, falls on his knees by the puzzle.  Without looking at\n\tAnnabelle, he tells her...\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tYour turn.  It wasn't bad.\n\n\tAnnabelle looks straight to her dad.  There is a moment, a silence,\n\tthat no one else could ever understand.  She leans to him and\n\twhispers...\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tHere it is?\n\n\tHis eyes water.  He takes her in his arms.  Whispers close to her\n\tear, only the words...\n\n\t\t\t\tLUKE\n\t\tHere it is.\n\n\tShe smiles at hi.  Fear gone, filled with resolve.  Gives him a\n\tkiss.  Rises, to...\n\n\t...follow Rachel down the hall.  Rache wraps an arm around her big\n\tgirl.  No words, except a murmured...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou can do this.\n\n\tVoice cracking.  She's not as good at it as this girl's mother.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou can do anything.\n\n\tAt the door.  Open it, and...\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM\n\n\t...Annabelle enters alone.  The door closes behind her.  Her eyes\n\tlock with her mother's.  No words.  Annabelle's eyes filled with\n\ttears, and Jackie's arms...\n\n\t... REACH out, and Annabelle RUNS to them.\n\n\tThey hold each other.  For a forever moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI don't want to say goodbye.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tDon't. Take me with you.\n\n\tAnd Annabelle looks up.  Tears on her face.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThank God.  I got to see you.\n\t\tGrown up.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI'm not.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\t\t(very softly)\n\t\tLet me be the judge of that.\n\n\tAnd Annabelle climbs onto the bed.  Their hands never stop touching\n\teach other.  Saying I love you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThere's an amazing thing when a\n\t\twoman has a daughter.  One day you\n\t\tlook up, and you see...a sister.\n\t\tSomeone.  You can say.  Anything to.\n\n\tAnything.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tI wrote a whole lot of letters.  To\n\t\teach of you.  And the envelope says\n\t\twhen to open it.  Like, which\n\t\tbirthday.  Or...when you get your\n\t\tdriver's permit.  First time you see\n\t\tRome.  Things like that.\n\n\tThings like that.  Annabelle is beginning to lose it now.  So\n\tJackie says only...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tKeep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until\n\t\the's old enough to not open them all\n\t\tat once.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tUntil he's old enough to read.\n\n\tTears on Annabelle's face.  Her mom wonders...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tAre you afraid for me?  Where\n\t\tI'm going.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tDon't be.  I'm going.  Where we\n\t\tall go.  Now how can that be bad.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tI'll miss you so much.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tGood.  That's very good.\n\n\tShe nods, yes it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhat you're grown-up enough to\n\t\tknow.  Is that people.  Can do\n\t\ttwo things at once.  Okay?\n\n\tShe brushes at her baby's tears.  Then tastes her wet fingertips.\n\tMmmn, surprisingly good.  Annabelle sort of smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou can miss me.  And.  Take me\n\t\twith you.\n\n\tHold the child's face.  In her hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tWhen you're in trouble.  Have me\n\t\tthere.  When you fall in love.\n\t\tHave me there.  You can.\n\n\tSaid with such absolute assurance.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tThat's how we go on, you know.\n\t\tForever.  Because someone takes\n\t\tus along.\n\n\tAnnabelle swallows hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tOn your wedding night.  When your\n\t\tbabies are born.  I want to be\n\t\tthere.  Will you take me?\n\n\tA straight question.  It needs an answer.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNABELLE\n\t\tAlways, always.  Always.\n\n\tA sigh.  A shared smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tYou made my life wonderful.\n\n\tYou.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACKIE\n\t\tTake that with you, too.\n\n\tHold.  On Annabelle.\n\n\tINT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING\n\n\tThe presents are here now, they fill up the room, spill over the\n\tbed, where both children sprawl.\n\n\t...Ben RIPPING the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine,\n\tAnnabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to\n\thang it in the Louvre.  She holds a tank top up to her chest, for\n\ther Mom's approval.  Jackie's not sure.  Rachel handing up more\n\tboxes, Luke in charge of bagging trash...\n\n\tBen's white dove, flying free around the room, zipping and diving.\n\tNo one cares.  It's Christmas.\n\n\tHOLD.  Hold.  And CROSSFADE TO...\n\n\tEXT. CHAPEL - NIGHT\n\n\tFamily and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly-lit\n\tchapel into a snowy night.  They are saying goodbyes, kissing one\n\tanother, going to their cars.  And saying her last goodbye...\n\n\t...Rachel turns to Luke.  Whispers, close to his ear.  He looks at\n\ther for a beat, then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car, as...\n\n\tRachel goes back into the chapel.  Alone.\n\n\tINT. FUNERAL PARLOR\n\n\tThe room is nearly dark.  One soft spot plays on a simple CASKET.\n\tNo canned organ music, no sound at all.  As Rachel enters.\n\n\tShe goes to the casket.  Stares down at it for a beat.  And just\n\tabove a whisper...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tSee, I told you I'd do this.\n\n\tOnly...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tOnly.  Now I don't know what to say.\n\n\tHer hand reaches out.  A finger absently traces the edge of the\n\twood.  It seems a gesture of unconscious affection.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tYou'd have written it down, so you\n\t\twouldn't blow it.\n\n\tA slight smile.  Here's where the love shows.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tMaybe we should change places.\n\n\tNods slightly.  Maybe we should.  She takes a step back now, to a\n\twaiting chair.\n\n\tSits.  Her hands folded in her lap.  Thinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWell.  We were less than friends, I\n\t\tguess.  And more.\n\n\tMore.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWe were never...girlfriends, we\n\t\tnever dished.  That wasn't.  What\n\t\twe had.\n\n\tNo apology there.  It's just the truth.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWe had some battles, man, they\n\t\twere...world class, huh?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd I don't regret a one of them.\n\n\tSad little shrug.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI miss them.\n\n\tThinking.  Of how much more she'll miss.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tWe've got our secrets, we have.\n\t\tAnd I'll keep 'em if you will.\n\n\tCrosses her arms.  Lost in the moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tBut I wish we had one more night.\n\t\tIn that little bar, remember?\n\t\tRemember that toast?  Sure, you do.\n\n\tHer voice wavers.  But the eyes are dry.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tKnow what?  I forgive me, too.\n\t\tSee?  You're the magician.\n\n\tA murmur...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tDon't worry, partner, I've got\n\t\tyour back.  We're covered.\n\n\tIt's what she came to say.  CROSSFADE TO...\n\n\tINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tLights and music and laughter.  They're in black tie tonight.  It's\n\ta wedding party.  Up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is\n\tfinishing a toast, and as everyone ROARS and CLAPS...\n\n\t\t\t\tBEST MAN\n\t\t...so TO THE BRIDE!  Thank GOD\n\t\tshe's more than he deserves!\n\n\tEverybody shouts THE BRIDE.  Everybody drinks champagne.\n\n\tAnd the bride stands up. In her white gown.  In her hand, an\n\tenvelope.  She goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers,\n\tthe calls of SPEECH!, to die down.\n\n\tLeans to the mike.  Flushed and happy.  And, oddly, nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tNow I know the tradition, so\n\t\tthis isn't a toast.  At least...\n\t\tnot for me.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tThe guest list is 114.  But we\n\t\tall know there's one more here,\n\t\ttonight.  Because...\n\n\tLooks down the table at her children.  Dressed to kill.  Enjoying\n\tthe party.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t...my two sidekicks there always\n\t\tbring her along.  Wherever they go.\n\n\tRight?  Right.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tSo Jackie and I were sitting\n\t\taround.  On New Year's Eve.  And\n\t\tshe said, 'You're not gonna talk\n\t\tat my funeral, are you?'\n\n\tAnd now.  It is quiet indeed.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tAnd I said, 'I've never been to\n\t\ta funeral.  I'm not sure I'll know\n\t\thow to act...'\n\n\tHer sweet smile.  Keeps the mood right.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t'...but I'll prob'ly sneak into\n\t\twhere you are.  Just before it's\n\t\tover...'\n\n\tNods to herself.  Fights back the feeling of that moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t'...say something.  Just to you.\n\t\tGet the last word in, when you\n\t\tcan't talk back.'\n\n\tThere is laughter in this room.  Gentle, loving.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tSo she says, 'No way.'\n\n\tHolds up the envelope.  Holds it tight.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tShe wrote this.  She sealed it\n\t\tup, I didn't see it.  She made\n\t\tme promise to read it.  At the\n\t\twedding.\n\n\tAnd slowly, Luke begins to CLAP.  And others join.  And when it\n\tstops...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tI told her she'd better make it\n\t\tdirty, or make it funny.  Because...\n\t\tno way...on my wedding...\n\n\tNo way in hell.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t...could she make me cry.\n\n\tAPPLAUSE.  They are loving it.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tShe says, 'It's a deal'.\n\n\tThe band plays an impromptu FLOURISH.  Rachel begins to carefully\n\ttear open the envelope...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tNow, if it's too raunchy, we may\n\t\thave to excuse the kids...\n\n\tSHOUTS from everyone, ESPECIALLY the children.\n\n\tShe has it open.  She looks at it.\n\n\tAnd everything.  Stops.\n\n\tThe world watches her sway, watches her eyes fill as she stares at\n\tthe small card in her hand.  She can't believe this...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\t\t(mouths to herself)\n\t\tYou promised.\n\n\tThe tears are welling.  Everyone SCREAMS for her to read it.  She\n\tleans to the mike, shaking her head...\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n\t\tIt's...no big thing, really...\n\t\tit's just...five words, it's...\n\n\tThe place goes happily UP FOR GRABS.  A joyful RIOT of demand.\n\tTears STREAMING now, Rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded\n\tbag.  As she puts the card inside, we alone can read the words...\n\n\tMY BABIES.  ARE SO LUCKY.\n\n\tHOLD on this.  And...\n\n\tFADE TO BLACK.
