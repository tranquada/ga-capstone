Unfair to me.\n\nHe begins to overpower her. This is quickly turning into date rape. SHE \nSTARTS TO FIGHT BACK BUT HE DOESN'T STOP. FINALLY, SHE SCRATCHES him \nsavagely across the face.

CAR\n\nRod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it.\n\nEXT.  ROAD\n\nAs Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at \nlover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.\n\nEXT. WOODS\n\nStacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her \nbreath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her. \nSuddenly, the footsteps stop.

I lose.\n              Come out and we'll fuck.\n\nShe hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the \nsilhouette of someone standing a few feet away.\n\nThe wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that \nwhoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very \nlong, jagged, steel nail in the other.\n\n                  STACY\n               (in full panic)\n              NO!\n\nStacy starts to run.

Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.\n\nINT.  CAR\n\nRod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nStacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into \nthe woods.\n\nEXT.  STACY'S\n\nRod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark \nwoods.\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nRod's POV - The woods are pitch black.\n\n                   ROD\n              Stacy?\n\n                  STACY(O.C.)\n            (struggling, in the distance)\n            ROD!\n\nEXT.

CAR\n\nRod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nRod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.\n\nRod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.\n\nEXT.

WOODS\n\nThe hammer descends on the nail.\n\nStacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to \nthe tree.\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nRod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.\n\nStacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.\n\nAnother nail is readied.\n\nStacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.\n\nRod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample \nfallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.\n\nStacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each \ntree. She almost looks crucified.\n\nRod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's \nterrified eyes. She's looking behind him.\n\nRod quickly turns around but he's too late.\n\nA knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.\n\nStacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping \nher palms on the nails.\n\nRod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.\n\nStacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.\n\nThe killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.\n\nStacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.\n\nA small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is \nplaced up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like \nit's an ordinary pencil.\n\nStacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never \nexperienced such pain.\n\nBlood drips to the ground.\n\nDissolve to:\n\nEXT.  NIGHT SKY\n\nThe full moon looks down on the town.\n\nEXT.  CUL DE SAC\n\nAnother romantic turn off.

Kenny is also sixteen. He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute \nnonetheless. His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. He takes \nhimself seriously, all rebel.\n\n                  JODY\n              Cut it out.\n\n                  KENNY\n              Why?\n\n                  JODY\n              I was supposed to be home\n              fifteen minutes ago.\n\n                  KENNY\n              So? You're already late.\n              A few more minutes won't\n              matter.\n\nHe slides a second finger into her pants.

Kenny takes off, not even waiting to \nsee if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A \ncar backfires in the distance. A nearby noise  startles her. Something's \nbehind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing \nbehind the house.\n\nINT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE - BACK FOYER\n\nAll is quiet in the house. The back door opens. Jody tiptoes up back \nstaircase.\n\nINT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE\n\nJody appears on the second floor. It's a family house, politely decorated \nand immaculately clean.

HALLWAY\n\nJody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before \npicking it up. She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny.\n\n                 JODY\n            Hello.

He then moves to Stacy, \nlooking at one nailed hand, then the other.\n\n                  BRENT\n           What kind of a person wakes\n           up in the morning and says\n           to themselves, 'Think I'll nail\n           a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?\n\n                  DEPUTY\n           The same type that decides to carve into\n           her stomach.\n\nBrent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into \nher flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nMONTAGE\n\nHigh school kids are getting ready for school.\n\nBody parts are being covered.

Tom is a wiry, hard \nfeatured man in his mid-forties. They have known each other for a long \ntime but are not really friends. Brent knows Tom too well.

CAFTERIA\n\nMARK SHALE, a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table \nin the crowded cafeteria eating lunch. The place is a zoo. CINDY, a cute, \nmini-skirted brunette, and BEN,  a frizzy-haired, tattooed, pierced, punk-\nrocker, are sitting with him.\n\nJody is standing at the door with her best friend SANDY, looking for a \nplace to sit. Sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age. She \nis wearing very little make-up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans. Although \nshe looks much more tomboyish than Jody and a year or two younger, she is \nstill quite cute and curvy, just lacking a  bit in self-confidence when it \ncomes to boys.

Jody realizes it. Mark is paying no attention \nto her.\n\n                   BEN\n              What I don't understand is\n              why they asked Marliston if\n              Rod was a virgin. They could have\n              asked you Cindy.\n\n                  CINDY\n              I never fucked Rod.\n\n                  BEN\n              Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.\n\nJody nudges Sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something. \nSandy can only stare at Mark as he eats.\n\n                   CINDY(O.C.)\n              If I'm so all-used-up Ben,\n              why do you try to hook me\n              up non-stop?\n\n                  BEN(O.C.)\n              As fucking if.\n\nAcross the cafeteria, a sophomore ANNETTE storms in very upset.

The killer doesn't seem to be there either.\n\nThe window is broken. The curtains flap in the breeze. She moves toward \nit, wondering whether it's safe to climb out. She looks in the mirror.\n\nIn the mirror, Jody can see the killer's shoes peeking out from under the \ndrapes. The killer's in the room. The drapes start to move.\n\nJody turns around and swings the bat, hitting the killer squarely in the \nhead, sending her to the ground, pulling the drapes down.\n\nINT.

She screams and \nkicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her \nrolling down the roof. She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the \ngutter, hanging from it.\n\nThe gutter starts to break.\n\nAbove her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof.\n\nThe killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her.\n\nJody knows she has no choice.\n\nJody lets go of the gutter.\n\nEXT.

SCHOOL\n\nThe kids arrive at School. Everyone is freaked. The word spreads fast \nabout Jody's attack. Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little \nextra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity \neverywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.\n\nThe normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are \nsexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids \ntogether. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth.

HIGH SCHOOL\n\nAs Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the \nattack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. \nShe hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a \nGirl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone \nbadly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more \nfeet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's \njust a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.\n\nJody heads toward the main school entrance.

She hits her brakes and skids \ninto the tail of the oncoming car. She glances off it and goes sliding off \nthe road, into a few garbage cans.\n\nThe car nicks another car and pulls over.\n\nAcross the street, we see that the Killer's IMPERIAL is stopped at the red \nlight.\n\nJody gets up, shaken.

For your own\n            safety.\n\nJody doesn't know what to make of this. It's not what she expected to hear \nfrom her teacher.\n\nLeonard goes into the kitchen. Jody sits on the couch and looks around. \nShe's immediately sensing that something is off about the place. It's \ncertainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look. It has all \nsorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls. Years of Cherry \nFalls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles.\n\nHe reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water. He hands \nher a beer.\n\n                  JODY\n            I just feel so manipulated.\n            By everyone.

He kneels down in \nfront of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg.\n\n                  LEONARD\n            We're all manipulated. From the moment\n            we're born.

We have no real freedom.\n            You of all people should understand\n            that. This may sting.\n\nJody is beginning to feel strange.

I've planned this since I was\n           a very little boy. You have no real freedom\n           either. Your father has cast a shadow that\n           you've never eluded.\n\nJody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. He's \nnot letting her get away.\n\nJody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it.\n\nLeonard grabs her and throws her across the room.\n\nJody smashes into a  table. He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a \nbook case over on him, narrowly escaping.\n\nShe runs for the back door.\n\nINT.  BACK DOOR\n\nJody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, \npulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her \nsprawling to the ground. He picks her up and punches her a second time, \nbreaking her nose, knocking her half out. He picks her up by the waist and \ncarries her to the basement stairs.\n\nINT.

He \nthrows it down the stairs and turns the lights on.\n\nThe basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his \nmother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa \nSherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks.\n\nLeonard sits Jody back up.\n\nA little blood drips from Jody's closed hands.

Did people really call her a slut\n           and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to\n           snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least\n           in my direction, was snarl.
