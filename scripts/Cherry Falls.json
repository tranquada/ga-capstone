TOWN - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe hanging sign says 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio'\n\nWe see Cherry Falls - A small town in rural Northeastern Ohio. This is \nNorman Rockwell land, red barns on dirt roads, a square in the center of \ntown. But things are hidden here. The barns are locked, the shades are \ndrawn.\n\nDissolve to:\n\n<b>EXT.  LOVER'S LANE \n</b>\nA romantic turn-off used exclusively for parking. A river gushes by. \nCrickets chirp. The trees blow in the autumn wind. A single car sits on \nthe lonely road. The muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts \nthrough the streamed up windows.\n\n<b>INT.  CAR\n</b>\nA teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her \nbreast. He pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her \nbare knee.\n\nAs he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently \npulls it away. She places it back on her breast, sliding it under her \nshirt.\n\nWe pull back. STACY and ROD, two healthy sixteen year olds, are \npassionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big American car.\n\nRod smiles seductively, kisses Stacy, and places his hand back on her \nknee. Once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand \ntightly.\n\n<b>                   STACY\n</b>               No.\n\nHe doesn't give up easy. He playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it \nunder her skirt.

He slides his hand under her skirt again.\n\n<b>                   STACY\n</b>               Stop it.\n\nHe doesn't.\n<b>                   STACY\n</b>               Rod!\n\n<b>                   ROD\n</b>                (exasperated)\n               You're being unfair.\n\n<b>                   STACY\n</b>               Unfair?!\n\n<b>                   ROD\n</b>               Yes. Unfair to me.\n\nHe begins to overpower her. This is quickly turning into date rape. SHE \nSTARTS TO FIGHT BACK BUT HE DOESN'T STOP. FINALLY, SHE SCRATCHES him \nsavagely across the face. This catches his attention. He jumps back, cut \nslightly, surprised.\n\nShe opens the car door and quickly escapes.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD\n</b>\nShe runs away from the car, down the road, very upset.\n\n<b>INT.  CAR\n</b>\nRod catches himself. He looks at his bloodied face in the rear view mirror \nand realizes what he's done.\n\nHe starts up the car.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD\n</b>\nStacy runs down the road alone, still very upset.\n\n<b>INT.  CAR\n</b>\nRod pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.\n\n<b>                  ROD\n</b>              Stacy! I'm sorry.\n\n<b>EXT.

CAR\n</b>\nRod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD\n</b>\nAs Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at \nlover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.\n\n<b>EXT. WOODS\n</b>\nStacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her \nbreath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her. \nSuddenly, the footsteps stop. Stacy senses that someone is watching her.\n\n<b>                  STACY\n</b>                Rod?\n\nNo answer.\n\n<b>                 STACY\n</b>               Is that you Rod?\n\nStill no answer. A little frightened, she starts to walk again.  Again she \nhears the footsteps following her. She stops again. Whoever is out there \nstops too. She looks around in every direction.\n\n<b>                 STACY\n</b>               Come out Rod.\n               This SCREAM bull shit ain't\n               gonna work with me!\n\nNo answer.

I lose.\n              Come out and we'll fuck.\n\nShe hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the \nsilhouette of someone standing a few feet away.\n\nThe wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that \nwhoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very \nlong, jagged, steel nail in the other.\n\n<b>                  STACY\n</b>               (in full panic)\n<b>              NO!\n</b>\nStacy starts to run. The killer starts after her.\n\n<b>EXT.  STACY'S\n</b>\nRod is sitting in his car in front of Stacy's house at the edge of the \nwoods, waiting for her to appear. He checks his watch.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nStacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isn't quite fast enough to \nelude her pursuer.\n\n<b>                  STACY\n</b>              Help!\n\nThe killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against \na tree, cracking a branch. Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.\n\n<b>INT.  CAR\n</b>\nRod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nStacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into \nthe woods.\n\n<b>EXT.  STACY'S\n</b>\nRod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark \nwoods.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nRod's POV - The woods are pitch black.\n\n<b>                   ROD\n</b>              Stacy?\n\n<b>                  STACY(O.C.)\n</b>            (struggling, in the distance)\n<b>            ROD!\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nThe killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her \nand ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the \nkiller.\n\n<b>INT.  CAR\n</b>\nRod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nRod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.\n\nRod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nStacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against \na tree trunk.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nRod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nThe huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of \nStacy's outstretched palm.\n\nThe hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail.\n\n<b>EXT. WOODS\n</b>\nRod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing \nbattle.\n\n<b>                  ROD\n</b>             Stacy?!\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nThe hammer descends on the nail.\n\nStacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to \nthe tree.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nRod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.\n\nStacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.\n\nAnother nail is readied.\n\nStacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.\n\nRod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample \nfallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.\n\nStacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each \ntree. She almost looks crucified.\n\nRod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's \nterrified eyes. She's looking behind him.\n\nRod quickly turns around but he's too late.\n\nA knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.\n\nStacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping \nher palms on the nails.\n\nRod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.\n\nStacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.\n\nThe killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.\n\nStacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.\n\nA small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is \nplaced up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like \nit's an ordinary pencil.\n\nStacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never \nexperienced such pain.\n\nBlood drips to the ground.\n\nDissolve to:\n\n<b>EXT.  NIGHT SKY\n</b>\nThe full moon looks down on the town.\n\n<b>EXT.  CUL DE SAC\n</b>\nAnother romantic turn off. A view from the top of a hill overlooking the \nsleepy town. A lonely car sits there, the sound of a teenage couple making \nout drifting through it's steamed up windows. It's almost a repeat of the \nfirst scene.\n\n<b>INT.  CAR\n</b>\nThe boy pulls his hand from under the girl's shirt and unsnaps her jeans. \nShe pushes his hand away but he puts it right back, wriggling a finger \ndown into her pants.\n\nJODY MARKEN, a pretty all-American sixteen year old girl, strong willed \nbut still innocent, stops kissing her boyfriend KENNY, trying to hold him \noff. Kenny is also sixteen. He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute \nnonetheless. His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. He takes \nhimself seriously, all rebel.\n\n<b>                  JODY\n</b>              Cut it out.\n\n<b>                  KENNY\n</b>              Why?\n\n<b>                  JODY\n</b>              I was supposed to be home\n              fifteen minutes ago.\n\n<b>                  KENNY\n</b>              So? You're already late.\n              A few more minutes won't\n              matter.\n\nHe slides a second finger into her pants. She closes her legs, making his \nprobing much more difficult.\n\n<b>                  JODY\n</b>              I got to get home.\n\n<b>                  KENNY\n</b>              Fuck your curfew.

Kenny takes off, not even waiting to \nsee if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A \ncar backfires in the distance. A nearby noise  startles her. Something's \nbehind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing \nbehind the house.\n\n<b>INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE - BACK FOYER\n</b>\nAll is quiet in the house. The back door opens. Jody tiptoes up back \nstaircase.\n\n<b>INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE\n</b>\nJody appears on the second floor. It's a family house, politely decorated \nand immaculately clean. She quietly creeps down the hallway toward her \nroom. As she passes her parents' room, she looks down. She's relieved that \nno light is coming from under their door.\n\n<b>INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM \n</b>\nJody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door. She's made it. \nShe sits on the bed to catch her breath.\n\nSomething moves in the corner of her room. Jody jumps, scared.\nSomeone is sitting in her rocking chair.\n\n<b>                 BRENT\n</b>            It's almost ten o'clock.\n\n<b>                 JODY\n</b>            Daddy you scared me!\n\n<b>                 BRENT\n</b>            You're grounded Friday night!\n\n<b>                 JODY\n</b>            What?

SCHOOL\n</b>\nThe kids arrive at School. Everyone is freaked. The word spreads fast \nabout Jody's attack. Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little \nextra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity \neverywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.\n\nThe normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are \nsexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids \ntogether. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth. Punkers chat with nerds, \ncheerleaders with potheads.\n\nIn the parking lot, we see that Aunt Lisa's IMPERIAL is parked. The killer \nis close by.\n\n<b>EXT.

She looks about \neighteen years old and has her hair done in an old fashioned wave. She \nlooks like your average small town girl from the late sixties.\n\nBrent's face goes white when he sees who it is.\n\nJody notices this.\n<b>               \n</b><b>                  JODY\n</b>             You know her?\n\n<b>                  BRENT\n</b>             It can't be.\n\n<b>                  JODY\n</b>             Who is she Daddy?\n\n<b>                  BRENT\n</b>             Never mind darling.\n             You go back to school.\n             I don't want you missing\n             anymore classes today.\n\nHe picks up the picture and heads quickly into his own office. Jody \nwatches through his window, sensing he's very, very upset.\n\n<b>INT.  OFFICE\n</b>\nBrent picks up the phone and quickly dials a number.\n\n<b>INT.  MAIN ROOM\n</b>\nJody has never seen her dad like this.

HIGH SCHOOL\n</b>\nAs Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the \nattack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. \nShe hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a \nGirl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone \nbadly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more \nfeet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's \njust a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.\n\nJody heads toward the main school entrance. She starts noticing a lot of \nkids are outside, a few more hidden from sight, having sex. Something's \nup. \n\n<b>INT.  HIGH SCHOOL\n</b>\nJody opens her locker.

Kenny looks around.\n\n<b>                 KENNY\n</b>            Jody was right, this party IS sick.\n\nKenny buttons his shirt and heads out. Sharon is pissed.\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  BASEMENT               \n</b>\nAs Jody comes to, she finds herself gagged, tied to a chair in the dark \nbasement. She can't see much but she can hear the sounds of water dripping \nand a rat scurrying around. She tips her chair over and falls onto the \ncold floor. She tries to removes her gag by rubbing her head against the \nground.\n\n<b>EXT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE\n</b>\nLeonard goes to his station wagon and opens the back.\n\n<b>INT.   CAR\n</b>\nA body is hidden under a blanket. Leonard picks it up. It's too heavy.\n\n<b>INT.   BASEMENT\n</b>\nJody can't undo her gag but she notices a piece of glass under a dresser. \nShe turns herself around to grab for it.\n\nShe squeezes her hand under the dresser, reaching for the shard.\n\nThe door at the top of the stairs opens.\n\nLeonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket. He \nthrows it down the stairs and turns the lights on.\n\nThe basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his \nmother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa \nSherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks.\n\nLeonard sits Jody back up.\n\nA little blood drips from Jody's closed hands. She has the shard.\n\nLeonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody. He starts singing SLY \n<b>AND THE FAMILY STONE.\n</b>\n<b>                  LEONARD\n</b>                (singing)\n             'It's a family affair,\n             It's a family affair.'\n\nHe undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of \nJody's dad. Brent's bleeding from the forehead, nose, and mouth. He's \nbadly beaten up.\n\nJody gags on her gag. Her dad looks her in the eye.\n\n<b>                   LEONARD\n</b>             Well, we may be family\n             One in four chance.\n\nLeonard picks up his razor and starts towards Jody.\n\n<b>                   LEONARD\n</b>             Sheriff Brent, you will be the\n             second of the four horsemen of\n             the apocalypse to die. But first you\n             will watch as I slice up your little\n             girl.\n\nBrent starts frantically shaking no, trying to escape as Leonard kneels in \nfront of Jody and runs his hands up under her dress, exposing her shaved, \nnubile leg. The 'V' is still fresh in her calf.\n\nLeonard starts to cut an 'I' next to it.\n\nJody's face grimaces in pain. Blood drips to the ground. Her leg starts to \nshake.          \n\n<b>                    LEONARD\n</b>           You're shaking too much.\n           If you don't stop shaking Jody,\n           I'll have to kill before I carve.\n           We wouldn't want that.\n\nJody concentrates on trying to show no pain, not to flinch. It's tough. \nHer father watches, \nhorrified.\n\nCut to:\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET\n</b>\nKenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house. He stops to catch \nhis breath for a second.\nHe notices something.\n\n<b>EXT.  LEONARD'S\n</b>\nJody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch.\n\n<b>EXT.

Jody and \nher father stare at each other, helplessly.\n\n<b>                  LEONARD\n</b>           My mother said, after you and your\n           three droogs raped her Brent, that people\n           in town refused to let her use their bathrooms.\n           Is that true? Did people really call her a slut\n           and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to\n           snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least\n           in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, \n           she saw only you.\n\nJody gags in pain. Brent looks away.\n\n<b>                   LEONARD\n</b>            Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or\n            will I cause her much more pain.\n\nBrent opens his eyes. More blood drips. Jody starts to lose consciousness, \nbarely able to stand it \nanymore. The doorbell rings. Leonard looks up, concerned.\n\n<b>EXT.  HOUSE\n</b>\nKenny rings it again. No one answers.\n\nHe walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the \ncurtains.\n\n<b>INT.  HOUSE\n</b>\nKenny's POV - Jody's coat and purse are still on the couch.\n\n<b>EXT.  HOUSE\n</b>\nKenny senses that something is really off. He rings again but no one \nanswers.

He can't ignore him any longer.\n\n<b>                     LEONARD\n</b>             Who the fuck is breaking into my house?\n\nLeonard checks Jody's and Brent's ropes are tight, then heads up the \nstairs. As soon as he disappears, Jody wriggles toward her father and \nstarts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass.\n\n<b>INT.    HOUSE\n</b>\nLeonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room.\n\n<b>INT.

He \ngrabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat. They struggle.\n\nThe door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open \nfrom the other side.\n\nLeonard picks up a  lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the \nhead. Kenny falls to the ground.\n\nThe door pops open. Brent charges out. Leonard turns to him and slashes \nhim across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes. Leonard \nscreams, and lunges at Brent.\n\nBrent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard \ndown the basement stairs.\n\nLeonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the \nbottom, smashing their heads along the way. As they come to a stop, Brent \nsmashes his head hard on the floor. Leonard ends up on top of him. He \nraises the razor and slits Brent across the face.\n\n<b>                    BRENT\n</b>               Jody run!\n\nJody crawls up the stairs, dragging her bad leg.\n\nInstinctually, Brent hangs on to Leonard, as Leonard tries to get to Jody. \nLeonard slashes Brent across the face again.\n\n<b>                      JODY\n</b>               No!\n\n<b>                      BRENT\n</b>                   (dying)\n              Run!\n\nJody crawls to the top of the stairs.  Leonard does everything he can to \nget away from Brent but Brent hangs on.  Jody watches, horrified, at the \ntop of the stair. Kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls Jody \naway from the gruesome sight as Leonard continues to slash Brent's body \nopen. Brent rolls over, a bloody mess.\n\n<b>INT.  TOP OF STAIRS\n</b>\nKenny slams the door shut as Leonard charges up the stairs. Kenny holds \nthe door shut with all his might.\n\n<b>                    JODY\n</b>               My dad's down there!\n\n<b>                     KENNY\n</b>              He's dead!

It's him.\n\n<b>INT.  CAR\n</b>\nLeonard steps on the gas.\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET\n</b>\nKenny peddles as fast as he can, going up onto the sidewalk but that \ndoesn't stop Leonard. He comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind \nKenny, ready to run him over.\n\nKenny tears up onto a lawn, Leonard follows him, grass spewing up \neverywhere.\n\nKenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street. He heads onto \nthe other sidewalk. LEONARD remains in pursuit, knocking into several \ncars, flattening several fences, and mutilating a cat along the way.\n\nLeonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street, \ndestroying it.\n\nLeonard pulls up right behind them. He hits the gas. Kenny has to turn \nhard to avoid getting hit.\n\nKenny can't hold the bike upright and it slides out from under them.\n\n<b>EXT.  BACKYARD\n</b>\nKenny and Jody tumble up someone's driveway, smashing into their fence.\n\n<b>EXT.

FRONT OF HOUSE\n</b>\nLeonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the \nGerman Shepard comes charging out the open fence.  Leonard screams. The \ndog pounces on him, starts humping his leg. Leonard rolls his eyes. The \ndog thrusts away.\n\nCLOSE ON THE RAZOR. Leonard raises the razor, contemplates, then rolls his \neyes. He pushes the dog off of him.  It lets out a panted growl, almost \nlike it's saying 'going so soon lover boy?' Leonard hops back in his car, \nspeeds off down the street. The dog barks wildly up at the night sky. Talk \nabout being left with a hard-on.\n\n<b>EXT.  PARTY HOUSE\n</b>\nThe house is dark. The lights are all out.\n\n<b>EXT.

A policeman comes running up.\n\n<b>                     POLICEMAN\n</b>                 We just found another body.\n\n<b>                     DEPUTY\n</b>                Who's?\n\n<b>                     POLICEMAN\n</b>                Tom Sisler.

Couples are everywhere. \nThere's no room\nto even walk.\n\nThe party has reached it's 'climax'.\n\nWe see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity. \nThey run the gamut of emotions. Some are terrified, some are ecstatic. \nSome are concentrating as hard as they've ever concentrated, some are \nclosing their eyes, trying to fade out.\n\nWe see Sandy, Mark, Cindy, and Ben all having a blast. Sharon has managed \nto find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls. It's \norgiastic.\n\nKenny and Jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of \nbodies looking for a place to hide.\n\nKENNY GRABS  a sheet off the ground and carries Jody up the stairs.\n\n<b>INT.  MASTER BEDROOM\n</b>\nKenny carries Jody into the huge bedroom.\n\nA couple of kids look up as the door opens. There must be over a 100 \nteenagers in the room, adjoining bathroom, and closets.

Get lost we're packed.\n\nKenny pays no attention to them. He shoves his way into a corner,  pissing \noff everyone on the way, stepping on a few hands and other appendages. He \nputs Jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt.\n\n<b>                      JODY\n</b>                    (whispering)\n                 What are you doing?\n\n<b>                      KENNY\n</b>                 Pretend we're just another couple.\n\nHe pulls her under the sheet.\n\n<b>INT.  PARTY - DOWNSTAIRS\n</b>\nLeonard comes in the front door, his razor in hand, the policeman's blood \nstill dripping from it. He looks around, wondering if they're here.\n\nNo one seems to notice Leonard as he hunts for Jody and Kenny, walking \nthrough the sea of bodies, dripping blood on the backs of a couple of \nkids. A serial killer at a fuckfest.  Leonard smiles at the sight of all \nthe teenagers copulating.\n\n<b>INT.  MASTER BEDROOM\n</b>\nKenny and Jody curl up next to each other. Kenny kisses her. She kisses \nhim back.\n\nThey're into each other. They can't keep their hands off each other. They \nstart to really make out.\n\n<b>INT.

One kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table, \nexploding it, sending a shard of glass out his throat. Blood sprays across \nthe ceiling like a lawn sprinkler.\n\nThrough the sea of legs, Leonard sees Jody's leg, the 'VIR' still freshly \ncarved. He slashes his way towards Jody.\n\n<b>EXT.   HOUSE\n</b>\nHalf naked kids come streaming out of the house, it's a bizarre sight. \nSome of them stop and scream, noticing the deputy (his body has been hung \nupside down from a telephone pole, and disemboweled). The house is almost \nbursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back.\n\n<b>INT.   STAIRWELL\n</b>\nToo many kids are trying to get out at one. The staircase and all the \nhallways start totally backed up but all the kids keep pushing forward. \nSomething's got to give.\n\n<b>INT.

The force of the mob \npushes him out the door, through the vortex.\n\n<b>INT.  UPSTAIRS\n</b>\nKids jam the staircase. There's too many trying to get down at once. \nEveryone's\nstill pushing. The kids on the staircase can't keep their position and \nstart falling forward, pushing harder.\n\n<b>INT.  BEDROOM\n</b>\nLeonard keeps hold of Jody's leg and pulls her toward him.\n\n<b>EXT.

Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase, \nonto kids below, CRACKING SKULLS, breaking bones.\n\n<b>INT.   DOWNSTAIRS\n</b>\nLamps smash to the ground. Tables are trampled.

BEDROOM\n</b>\nLeonard gets hold of Jody's waist and pulls her towards him, razor ready.\n\n<b>INT.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR\n</b>\nEveryone gives one final push out. Kenny is swept on to the staircase. It \ncan't take the pressure and finally cracks.\n\nKids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the \nstaircase splinters. Hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed \nover the edge. It's a disaster. Broken boned teenagers litter the floor \nlike it were a battlefield.\n\nKenny manages to grab hold of the second floor as kids fall past him.\n\nThe whole house begins to buckle.\n\n<b>INT.   BEDROOM\n</b>\nThe room empties as the kids push out. Leonard pulls Jody up next to him \nand puts the razor to her neck. He draws the first spot of blood.\n\n<b>                      JODY\n</b>                Please!

We do.\n\nLeonard stares at Jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving Kenny just \nthe break he needs to dive for Leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him \nover. They struggle for the razor but Leonard overpowers him and grabs it, \ncutting his own hand. He turns and slices Kenny down the side, cutting him \ndeep.\n\nKenny fights off the pain and leaps on Leonard's back, grabbing his arm \naround the neck.\n\nLeonard stands up and twirls around, trying to knock Kenny off his back, \nsmashing him into walls.\n\nKenny screams in pain, but doesn't let go, pulling at Leonard's face and \nthroat.\n\nLeonard spins faster.\n\nJODY struggles to her feet, holding her neck, still losing a little blood. \nKenny's grips start to slip as Leonard reaches back, to slice him across \nthe face and neck.\n\nLEONARD, backs up towards the window, slips over a dildo. He screams, \nloses his grip on Kenny, goes crashing out the second story window.\n\n<b>EXT.  HOUSE\n</b>\nLeonard crashes to the ground below, landing on his back on the front \nsteps.\n\n<b>INT.

It's fuck him up time!\n\nOne boy kicks Leonard in the face. Another kicks him in the ribs, another \nin the balls. Leonard tries to fight back for a second but slowly they all \ndescend on him, taking turns kicking and beating the ever living shit out \nof him. It's a feeding frenzy.  He disappears under the angry mob of \nteenagers.\n\n<b>INT.  BEDROOM\n</b>\nJody helps Kenny to his feet.\n\n<b>                     KENNY\n</b>                Come on.
