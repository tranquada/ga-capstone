On his arm is an Irish girl with\nblond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings\naround a bowling pin.\n\n<b>                       JODY\n</b>            And that's cricket, hon.\n\nAn attendant hands him the teddy bear.

She wraps her arms\naround his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,\nfumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow\nfalls across them.\n\nCLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He\nturns around, drunkenly.\n\n<b>                       JODY\n</b>             What the fuck --\n\nThe gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.\n\nJude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a\nfield.\n\nJody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing\namong the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around\nhim. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.\n\n<b>INT. CAR - DAY\n</b>\nA mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,\nthree in the back.\n\nOn the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet\non top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a\ngun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is\nsmoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat\ninnocent.\n\n<b>                       FERGUS\n</b>             So what's your name, soldier?\n\n\n\n<b>                                                               4.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                       JODY\n</b>          Fuck you.\n\n<b>                       FERGUS\n</b>          Yeah.\n\n<b>EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - EVENING.\n</b>\n<b>INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.\n</b>\nJody pulled through and tied to a chair.

The men are sleeping. Fergus is\nsitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.\nJude comes in, with a flashlight.\n\n\n\n<b>                                                               5.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                    FERGUS\n</b>          Hey -- what's he like?\n\n<b>                    JUDE\n</b>          Horny bastard.\n\n<b>                    FERGUS\n</b>          Did you give him it?\n\n<b>                    JUDE\n</b>          There are certain things I wouldn't do\n          for my country.\n\n<b>                    FERGUS\n</b>          Have a look at him.\n\n<b>                    JUDE\n</b>          Can't.\n\n<b>                    FERGUS\n</b>          Poke him or something.

Go on.\n          Have a heart.\n\nShe moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her\nfoot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so\nslightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like\nlightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,\nthrowing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.\n\n<b>                    JODY\n</b>          You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --\n\nHe pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair.

The blinds in her room\nare down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,\npacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We\nhear the song \"The Crying Game.\"\n\nFergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and\nsticks it in the letter box.\n\n<b>EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY\n</b>\nA man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with\na pole and replaces it with a number nine.\n\nBelow the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn\ntoward the building where Fergus is working.\n\n<b>INT. SITE - DAY\n</b>\nFergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the\npitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving\nglass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch\nbasket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high\nheels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks\nout.\n\nFergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving\ntoward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.\nAs the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,\nwhich rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a\nladder toward Fergus .\n\n<b>                        DEVEROUX\n</b>          How much did that frame cost, Mr.\n          Franknum?\n\n<b>                        FRANKNUM\n</b>          Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.\n\n<b>                        DEVEROUX\n</b>          Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.\n\n<b>                        FERGUS\n</b>          Sorry.\n\n\n\n<b>                                                              62.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                        DEVEROUX\n</b>          Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,\n          will it, Mr. Franknum?\n\n<b>                        FRANKNUM\n</b>          Not in my experience.\n\n<b>                        DEVEROUX\n</b>          Off his wages.\n\n<b>                        FERGUS\n</b>          Do you mean that?\n\n<b>                        DEVEROUX\n</b>          He wants to know do I mean that.\n\n<b>                        FRANKNUM\n</b>          I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.\n\n<b>                        DEVEROUX\n</b>          Bloody right I do...\n\nThrough this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf\nwhistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window\nshould be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at\nher, looking up her skirt, etc.\n\nShe passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.\n\n<b>                        DEVEROUX\n</b>          Is that his tart?
