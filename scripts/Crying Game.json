CARNIVAL - DAY\n\nA loudspeaker playing Percy Sledge's \"When a Man Loves a\nWoman,\" as we see a carnival in the distance - with a Ferris\nWheel turning round and round.\n\nA black man is by a stall. On his arm is an Irish girl with\nblond hair. The black man is drunk, and is tossing rings\naround a bowling pin.\n\n                       JODY\n            And that's cricket, hon.\n\nAn attendant hands him the teddy bear. It looks ridiculous in\nhis huge hands. He gives it to the girl.\n\n                       JODY\n            You want it?\n\n                       GIRL\n            Sure.\n\n                       JODY\n            Doesn't matter if you don't.\n\nHe puts his arm around her and drags her on.\n\n                       JODY\n            Jody won't be offended. Jody's never\n            offended. What'd you say your name was?\n\n                       GIRL\n            Jude.\n\n                       JODY\n            Jude. Suits you, Jude.\n\n                       JUDE\n            The teddy bear?\n\n                       JODY\n            No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And\n            it's June. Jude in June.\n\nHe comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET.\n\n\n\n                                                               2.\n\n\n\n                        JODY\n          Gotta piss, Jude.\n\nHe holds her hand.\n\n                        JODY\n          Don't run off, Jude.\n\n                        JUDE\n          You don't know me, do you?\n\nJody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We\ncan still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the\ncanvas, looking bored.\n\n                        JODY\n              (inside)\n          What if I did?\n\n                        JUDE\n          You'd know I wouldn't run off.\n\nShe stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her\neyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-\nhaired man in a dark jacket. He nods.\n\n                        JODY\n          Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.\n\n                        JUDE\n          You didn't?\n\n                        JODY\n          And you know what?\n\n                        JUDE\n          Tell me, Jody\n\nHe staggers out, buttoning up.\n\n                        JODY\n          It's nice.\n\nHe goes to kiss her. She turns her head away.\n\n                        JUDE\n          Not here.\n\n                        JODY\n          Who gives a fuck.\n\n                        JUDE\n          You never know.\n\n\n\n                                                               3.\n\n\n\nShe pulls him over toward the water.\n\n                       JODY\n             I never know nothing.\n\n                       JUDE\n             People. They could be looking.\n\nJody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He\nmoves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach,\nunder a train trestle.\n\n                       JUDE\n             Come and get me, soldier --\n\n                       JODY\n             Whatever you say, Jude...\n\nHe sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms\naround his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her,\nfumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow\nfalls across them.\n\nCLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He\nturns around, drunkenly.\n\n                       JODY\n             What the fuck --\n\nThe gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways.\n\nJude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a\nfield.\n\nJody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing\namong the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around\nhim. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.\n\nINT. CAR - DAY\n\nA mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front,\nthree in the back.\n\nOn the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet\non top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a\ngun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is\nsmoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat\ninnocent.\n\n                       FERGUS\n             So what's your name, soldier?\n\n\n\n                                                               4.\n\n\n\n                       JODY\n          Fuck you.\n\n                       FERGUS\n          Yeah.\n\nEXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - EVENING.\n\nINT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.\n\nJody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small\nlean man, talks to him through the hood.\n\n                       MAGUIRE\n          The situation is simple. You're being\n          held hostage by the Irish Republican\n          Army. They've got one of our senior\n          members under interrogation in\n          Castleraigh. We've informed them that if\n          they don't release him within three days,\n          you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our\n          guest until further developments. Have\n          you anything to say?\n\nJody is motionless under the black hood.\n\n                       FERGUS\n          Give him a cup of tea.\n\n                       MAGUIRE\n          Do you want a cup of tea?\n\nHe still says nothing.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE.\n\nAll the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a\nplate and some food on it.\n\n                       FERGUS\n          See does he want some.\n\n                       JUDE\n          Do you want some food?\n\nJody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE.\n\nLate at night -- it is dark. The men are sleeping. Fergus is\nsitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner.\nJude comes in, with a flashlight.\n\n\n\n                                                               5.\n\n\n\n                    FERGUS\n          Hey -- what's he like?\n\n                    JUDE\n          Horny bastard.\n\n                    FERGUS\n          Did you give him it?\n\n                    JUDE\n          There are certain things I wouldn't do\n          for my country.\n\n                    FERGUS\n          Have a look at him.\n\n                    JUDE\n          Can't.\n\n                    FERGUS\n          Poke him or something. See if he's still\n          alive.\n\n                    JUDE\n          He's all right.\n\n                    FERGUS\n          Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on.\n          Have a heart.\n\nShe moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her\nfoot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so\nslightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like\nlightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off,\nthrowing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.\n\n                    JODY\n          You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --\n\nHe pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He\nwrithes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is\nscreaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing\nguns, screaming.\n\n                    MAGUIRE\n          Turn the fucking thing off --\n\nEXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT.\n\nFergus follows Jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.\n\n                    FERGUS\n          You all right?\n\n\n\n                                                               6.\n\n\n\n                        JUDE\n          Fucking animal.\n\nShe takes in huge gobs of air.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          You don't know that.\n\n                        JUDE\n          Fucking do. I had him all over me.\n\nHe touches her face.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Tough work, that.\n\n                        JUDE\n          Someone's got to do it.\n\nShe rubs her hand on his chest.\n\n                        JUDE\n          Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of\n          you.\n\nShe sidles closer, coming on to him.\n\n                        JUDE\n          And you know what, Fergus? One of you\n          made me want it...\n\nShe puts her lips to his neck.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Which one?\n\nShe doesn't answer. They embrace.\n\nEXT.

GREENHOUSE - DAY\n\nDusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. Broken glass. The\nsun pouring through. Fergus leads Jody over to a wrought iron\nchair and sits him in it. He sits opposite, gun on his lap.\nFergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. He\nholds one out toward him.\n\n\n\n                                                               7.\n\n\n\n                     FERGUS\n           Eat something, would you?\n\n                     JODY\n           Can't.\n\n                     FERGUS\n           What do you mean you can't?\n\n                     JODY\n           Can't eat through a canvas bag.\n\nFergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is\nrevealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats,\nslowly.\n\n                     JODY\n           This is a farce, man.\n\n                     FERGUS\n           How is it a farce?\n\n                     JODY\n           I seen your fucking face.\n\n                     FERGUS\n           So, what do I look like?\n\n                     JODY\n           You're the one about five ten with the\n           killer smile and the baby face.\n\n                     FERGUS\n           Am I?\n\n                     JODY\n           Yeah.

His body flies in the air\nand bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt\nand the huge wheels grind over him.\n\nFergus, screaming, \"No-!\" He almost moves forward, then sees\nsoldiers spilling from the tank around the body. Fergus turns\nand runs.\n\nEXT. TREES - DAY\n\nFergus whipping through the trees, his body crouched low as\nhe runs.\n\nINT. GREENHOUSE - DAY\n\nTinker sitting in the greenhouse.

BUILDING SITE - DAY\n\nFADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in\nclouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, hacking at\na wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in\nlaborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the\nbricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and\nrelentlessly, like a machine.\n\nWe see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls\naway, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust\nand the growing hole.\n\n\n\n                                                              34.\n\n\n\nFergus's face, as he works.\n\nThe hole.

Then the hammer stops. The\ndust begins to clear.\n\nHis face.\n\nThe jagged hole. The dust drifts across it, revealing a\ncricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the\ngreen.\n\nEXT.

He takes one last look through\nthe window where Dil is taking off her smock, touching up her\nhair, etc. It is as if she has forgotten all about him. He\nwalks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway.\n\nThe doorway of the shop. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of\nhigh heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy\nclothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door\nand walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub\ncalled the Metro. Fergus follows.\n\n\n\n                                                             37.\n\n\n\nINT. METRO - EVENING.\n\nHalf full, with an after-work crowd.

He grabs her by the elbow.\nShe shrugs him off. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by\nthe elbow again. The sense of an old argument. Dave suddenly\nstrikes her across the face with his open palm.\n\n\n\n                                                              40.\n\n\nShe leans her head against a wall.

Dil\nopens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk\ninside.\n\nFergus stands there, observing.\n\nA light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her\nshadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of\nDave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse.\nShe stands absolutely still as he does so.\n\nFergus backs away, then walks off.\n\nINT. HOSTEL - NIGHT.\n\nFergus, in bed.

He seems most out of place in his cheap\nsuit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.\n\nAT THE BAR.\n\nFergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find Dil.

She looks down into her drink.\n\n                       DIL\n          He was different.\n\n                       FERGUS\n          How different?\n\n                       DIL\n          As different as it's possible to be.\n\n                       FERGUS\n          Tell me about him.\n\n                       DIL\n          No.\n\n                       FERGUS\n          Shouldn't I go?\n\n                       DIL\n          Yes.\n\nAnd they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with\nher whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently\npassionate.\n\nThey fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The\nphotograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress\nwith his hands. She suddenly pulls away.\n\n                       DIL\n          No --\n\n                       FERGUS\n          Did you do that to him?\n\nShe comes up toward him once more.

Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her\nhand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while\nher other hand undoes his pants. She kisses his stomach; her\nmouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of\nJody. Jody's eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her\nhead and kisses his mouth. There are tears in his eyes.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          What would he think?\n\n                        DIL\n          Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland.

His hands slip the wrap down from her\nshoulders.\n\nCLOSE ON HIS HANDS, traveling down her neck, in the darkness.\nThen the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently,\nwith a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a\nclose-up, that she is a man.\n\nFergus sits there, frozen, staring at her.\n\n                            DIL\n              You did know, didn't you?\n\nFergus says nothing.\n\n                            DIL\n              Oh my God.\n\nShe gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch\nhim.

The blinds in her room\nare down and the light is on inside. We see her outline,\npacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. We\nhear the song \"The Crying Game.\"\n\nFergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and\nsticks it in the letter box.\n\nEXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY\n\nA man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with\na pole and replaces it with a number nine.\n\nBelow the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn\ntoward the building where Fergus is working.\n\nINT. SITE - DAY\n\nFergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the\npitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving\nglass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch\nbasket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high\nheels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks\nout.\n\nFergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving\ntoward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters.\nAs the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift,\nwhich rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a\nladder toward Fergus .\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          How much did that frame cost, Mr.\n          Franknum?\n\n                        FRANKNUM\n          Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Sorry.\n\n\n\n                                                              62.\n\n\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back,\n          will it, Mr. Franknum?\n\n                        FRANKNUM\n          Not in my experience.\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Off his wages.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Do you mean that?\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          He wants to know do I mean that.\n\n                        FRANKNUM\n          I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Bloody right I do...\n\nThrough this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf\nwhistles increasing. He looks out the gap where the window\nshould be and sees Dil in the lift. The laborers whistle at\nher, looking up her skirt, etc.\n\nShe passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?\n\n                        FERGUS\n          She's not a tart.\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          No, of course not, she's a lady.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          She's not that either.\n\nFergus walks out of the room.\n\nFergus walks round the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves,\nsits on some bricks and opens the hamper.\n\n                        DIL\n          Darling --\n\nShe is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. She is\nwearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. She\npecks him on the cheek.\n\n\n\n                                                       63.\n\n\n\n                      DIL\n          Never let the sun go down on an argument,\n          Jody used to say.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          What you doing here?\n\n                      DIL\n          Got your note. So let's kiss and make up,\n          hon.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          Don't call me that.\n\n                      DIL\n          Sorry, darling.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          Give it over, Dil --\n\n                      DIL\n          Apologies, my sweet.\n\nFergus smiles in spite of himself.\n\n                      DIL\n          That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.\n\nShe takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          You're something else, Dil, you know\n          that?\n\n                      DIL\n          Never said a truer word.\n\nShe hands him a neatly cut sandwich.\n\n                      DIL\n          See, I was always best looking after\n          someone. Must be something in the genes.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          Must be.\n\n                      DIL\n          And the fact that you didn't know is\n          basically the fault of yours truly. And\n          even when you were throwing up, I could\n          tell you cared.\n\n\n\n                                                       64.\n\n\n\n                        FERGUS\n          You could?\n\n                        DIL\n          Do you care, Jimmy?\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Sure I do.\n\n                        DIL\n          You mean that?\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Yeah. I care, Dil.\n\nShe lowers her head.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          You crying, Dil?\n\nHe removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.\n\n                        DIL\n          I'm tired and emotional.\n\nThen he hears a voice behind him.\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Do it on your own time, Paddy.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          What?\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Whatever it is she does for you.\n\nFergus looks from Dil to Deveroux.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          If I was her I'd consider that an insult.\n\n                        DEVEROUX\n          Consider it how you like. Just get that\n          bloody tart out of here.\n\nFergus stands up suddenly. He speaks quietly.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Did you ever pick your teeth up with\n          broken fingers?\n\nDeveroux stares, suddenly chilled.\n\n\n\n                                                          65.\n\n\n\n                      DEVEROUX\n          What's that supposed to mean?\n\n                      FERGUS\n          It's a simple question.\n\nDeveroux says nothing. Fergus looks down to Dil.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          Come on, dear.\n\nHe holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it.\nHer face is wreathed in a smile.\n\n                      DIL\n          He didn't answer, honey --\n\nFergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.\n\n                      FRANKNUM\n          Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.\n\nDil and Fergus descend from the site in the lift.\n\n                      DIL\n          My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          Shut up.\n\n                      DIL\n          Made me feel all funny inside.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          I said stop it.\n\n                      DIL\n          Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          You think that's wise?\n\n                      DIL\n          Nothing's wise.\n\nThe lift stops with a thud.\n\n                      FERGUS\n          I didn't mean to hit you.\n\n                      DIL\n          I know that.\n\n\n\n                                                            66.\n\n\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Kind of liked you as a girl.\n\n                        DIL\n          That's a start.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          So I'm sorry.\n\n                        DIL\n          Make it up to me, then.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          How?\n\n                        DIL\n          Ask to meet me again.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Will you meet me again?\n\n                        DIL\n          When?\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Whenever. Tonight.\n\nShe leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of\ncatcalls behind him. He watches Dil go as the lift takes him\nback up to the site.\n\nEXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING.\n\nFergus, outside the hair salon. Dil, inside, is throwing off\nher smock and walking toward him. All the girls are smiling.\nFergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach.\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Do they know?\n\n                        DIL\n          Know what, honey?\n\n                        FERGUS\n          Know what I didn't know.

I couldn't shoot him in the back.\n          I tried to catch him. He made it to the\n          road and got hit by a Saracen.\n\n                     JUDE\n          So you did fuck up.\n\n                     FERGUS\n          Yes.\n\n                     JUDE\n          But you know what the thing is, Fergus?\n\n                     FERGUS\n          No, what is the thing?\n\n                     JUDE\n          You vanished quite effectively.
