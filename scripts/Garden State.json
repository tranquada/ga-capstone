BEDROOM -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture\r\n          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins\r\n          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls\r\n          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in\r\n          which he sleeps.\r\n\r\n          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams\r\n          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.\r\n          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine.

He falls back to sleep.\r\n\r\n          FADE TO BLACK-'\r\n\r\n                         IN BLACK:\r\n          The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink.\r\n\r\n          INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING\r\n\r\n          Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body\r\n          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle\r\n          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the\r\n          mirror he's been staring into.\r\n\r\n          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two\r\n          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately\r\n          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.\r\n\r\n          He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.\r\n\r\n          MUSIC CUB., (\"DON'T PANIC\" BY COLDPLAY)\r\n\r\n          EXT. CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER\r\n\r\n          Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.\r\n          He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries\r\n          to find an address while checking a piece of paper.\r\n          He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-\r\n          stairs.\r\n\r\n                         0\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         3\r\n          After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a\r\n          gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.\r\n          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.\r\n\r\n          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the\r\n          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way\r\n          down, where he moves to the \"Up\" one and rises towards the\r\n          next level. His expression never changes.\r\n\r\n          INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY\r\n\r\n          A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and\r\n          manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly.

LARGE' S CAR -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405\r\n          freeway.

TALK\r\n\r\n          RADIO.\r\n          Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in\r\n          pain.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws \"The Club\" on\r\n          his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the\r\n          restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his\r\n          car.\r\n          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle\r\n          sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped\r\n          off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last\r\n          time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the\r\n          nozzle from his tank.\r\n          He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws\r\n          the nozzle in an open dumpater.\r\n\r\n          INT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Large flings open the door and enters a long, dark corridor\r\n          lined with stacked chairs. He passes a WAITER in a black\r\n          TUNIC wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian.\r\n\r\n                         WAITER\r\n          Dick head. You've got thirty-four\r\n          and twenty-five seated and Taylor\r\n          booked a pilot so he quit.

He rounds a corner to a time card machine and\r\n          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,\r\n          \"LATE\" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes\r\n          into a black tunic and pants.\r\n          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over\r\n          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.\r\n          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the\r\n          line. Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER. She walks with\r\n          him as he weaves his way through the kitchen.\r\n\r\n                         FRENCH MANAGER\r\n\r\n                         (FRENCH ACCENT)\r\n          Ten resumes just today.

He takes a\r\n          stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints\r\n          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,\r\n          male waiters.)\r\n          He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of\r\n          the tunic and turns it on. He unwinds the ear piece, pulls it\r\n          through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his\r\n          ear. Immediately we hear a VIETNAMESE MAN'S VOICE giving\r\n          orders over the ear piece.\r\n\r\n          VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)\r\n          (accented, but monotone)\r\n          Waiter number fifteen, your table\r\n          number twenty-three is ready.\r\n          Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into:\r\n\r\n          INT.

Morning sun\r\n          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,\r\n          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker\r\n          the word \"BALLS\" is written.\r\n          His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs\r\n          swing left, then right.

White morning\r\n          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to\r\n          highlight the duet in the air.\r\n          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea\r\n          where he is.\r\n          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a\r\n          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his\r\n          Bigfoot sighting.\r\n          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal\r\n          box.\r\n          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval\r\n          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second\r\n          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the\r\n          knight is gone.\r\n\r\n          INT.

I think he'd prefer\r\n          me to stay on it. He likes to think\r\n          it makes me happy. And I let him\r\n          think that because he's sort of\r\n          consumed by the idea of making\r\n          everyone happy.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Well look, I'll examine you and\r\n          give you a Catscan just so you\r\n          won't worry that it's anything\r\n          serious. But to be honest, I think\r\n          the headaches are something else.\r\n          Our bodies do very funny things\r\n          when they're consumed with stress\r\n          and anxiety.

That just's something\r\n          that should have been remedied\r\n          years ago. He knows better.\r\n          Secondly, I'm not in a position to\r\n          comment on whether or not you\r\n          should stay on the meds or not; I\r\n          don't know your story. But my\r\n          opinion, since you're paying for\r\n          it, is that those drugs may help as\r\n          a means to an end. But if you're\r\n          not In any sort of therapy, sooner\r\n          or later what's ever going on in\r\n          your mind will find a way to peek\r\n          it's little head out of the water.\r\n          Just something to think about.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         43\r\n          ,beat)\r\n          But, for now, let's have a look at\r\n          you.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT.
