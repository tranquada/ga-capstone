Then she turns, looks the\n     other direction. A dark street.

Feeds hungrily as\n     Marius's face fills with the bond. He slowly sinks\n     down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds.

As if the music is\n     calling to him.\n\n     The girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and\n     plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. Lestat stands\n     there frozen to the spot.

A glittering torrent of\n     notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold.\n\n     Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into\n     firelight. The Father and his daughter become less\n     certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing\n     skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is\n     completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father\n     and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop\n     playing. Lestat looks up.

We recognize Akasha from the sketches\n     in Talbot's office. Stepping closer, they appear not to\n     be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the\n     palest skin imaginable. His eyes widen at the sight of\n     their clothes -- the most valuable Egyptian finery;\n     bracelets of gold, headdresses of incredible gems,\n     clothes of silk.

He throws a\n     glance up at the throne and stops...\n\n     Akasha is moving...\n\n     Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes.\n\n     Lestat stares in amazement... Her arm rises up, her wrist\n      extended outward towards Lestat. The pulse of a\n     HEARTBEAT begins... Lestat moves toward her as if\n     beckoned. A green vein appears beneath the marble\n     surface of her skin. The vein pulses as the blood\n     courses around. The HEARTBEAT POUNDS LOUDER, DEEPER.\n\n     The sound fills Lestat's head as he is drawn closer to\n     Akasha's wrist.

Jesse looks to Lestat,\n      straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely\n      unwavering.\n\n<b>                           JESSE\n</b>                   It's what I want.

A thin, red scar remains from where she\n      cut herself with the silver stick from the Chinese\n      barrette.\n\n      Lestat gazes at her, begins to advance. Jesse keeps her\n      gaze steady into Lestat's, risking everything.\n\n<b>                           AKASHA\n</b>                      (smirking)\n                   How sweet...\n\n<b>                                              (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                117.\n</b>\n<b>193   CONTINUED:    (4)                                                193\n</b>\n      Lestat moves closer and closer to her, gazes into her\n      eyes, hesitates for a moment, then continues on...\n\n      Jesse watches him with absolute love. He reaches her.\n      Maharet flies across the room, but Akasha meets her\n      halfway. Grabs her by the hair. Maharet struggles but\n      Akasha is much more powerful. Jesse offers up her neck\n      to his bite. Maharet looks away and Akasha looks pleased\n      as...\n\n      Lestat sinks his teeth into Jesse's neck. Jesse gasps\n      with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws\n      her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she\n      holds him.\n\n      With that Maharet's great family mural begins to weep\n      blood from every name. All the Ancients turn, stare at\n      the mural as...\n\n      Lestat drinks and drinks and Jesse sighs with intimacy,\n      clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper\n      into her flesh. She slowly crumples to the floor, being\n      drawn down until finally...\n\n      Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale.    Dead.\n\n<b>                           AKASHA\n</b>                   Good-bye, great family.\n\n      She turns to the MURAL with a fierce gaze. Flash! It\n      EXPLODES, CRUMBLING to a million pieces on the ground.\n      Maharet stares in horror.\n\n<b>                           AKASHA\n</b>                   Now, my children, remember your\n                   real family!

A silent signal\n      passes between them as...\n\n      The Ancients make an instantaneous decision.

There's no blood left to flow from\n      the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to\n      transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin\n      returning to MARBLE.

Stares at Marius for a\n      long moment. Then stands, grabs his coat, heads for the\n      door.\n\n\n<b>199   EXT.

Lestat pulls Jesse into his\n      arms.\n\n      They kiss. It's long, deep, romantic. They pull away,\n      gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes...\n\n      And exchange happy, fanged smiles...\n\n<b>                           LESTAT\n</b>                   Shall we go get a drink, love?\n\n      She smiles, nods.
