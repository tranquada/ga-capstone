LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               1\n\n    An empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We\n    hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth-\n    century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past\n    the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and\n    CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance.\n\n                             VOICE (V.O.)\n               There comes a time for every vampire\n               when the idea of eternity becomes\n               momentarily unbearable...\n\n    As we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT\n    OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal:\n\n    A FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb,\n    silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.\n\n                       VOICE (V.O.)\n               The wounds suffered from love and\n               failed friendships don't heal like\n               a human's, but seem to only gape\n               larger. The longing to be mortal\n               returns, a longing for finiteness.\n\n    A beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n2   OMITTED                                                     2\n&                                                               &\n3                                                               3\n\n\n4   EXT. TOMB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               4\n\n    The figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door.\n\n                        VOICE (V.O.)\n               In 1883 I suffered such a spell\n               and decided to cease feeding on\n               blood. Just lie in the earth and\n               let time return to its natural\n               state...\n\n    As the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine\n    growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER\n    and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up.\n    Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the\n    sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months\n    fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns\n    all around the tomb.\n\n                                         (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             2.\n\n4   CONTINUED:                                                    4\n\n                         VOICE (V.O.)\n                 I had hoped the sounds of the\n                 passing eras would fade out, and a\n                 kind of death might happen. A\n                 kind of forgetting where I would\n                 be healed from my wounds.\n\n    The CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS\n    DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES.\n\n                         VOICE (V.O.)\n                 But as I lay there, the sounds\n                 didn't fade but grew with the\n                 world.\n\n    The BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET\n    STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS\n    MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK\n    BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS.\n\n                         VOICE (V.O.)\n                 And gradually the world didn't\n                 sound like the place I had left,\n                 but something different...\n                 better...\n\n    As we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of\n    the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST...\n\n                         VOICE (V.O.)\n                 A new fearless attitude had\n                 possessed the world, brave and\n                 Godless. I began to wonder if it\n                 was not time to resurrect. But\n                 the thing that eventually brought\n                 me back -- the decisive thing\n                 really -- came like a bolt out of\n                 the blue.\n\n    GUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw\n    and dark.\n\n\n5   SERIES OF GLIMPSES                                            5\n\n    Slender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and\n    a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments.\n    Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored\n    nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the\n    confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or\n    girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in\n    on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and\n    LOUDER than the rest.\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            3.\n\n5    CONTINUED:                                                  5\n\n     A SCRAPING ROAR, like a bandsaw being twisted into the\n     most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its\n     emotion.\n\n                          VOICE (V.O.)\n                  A music so sublime, so deeply\n                  vampiric, I had no doubt it could\n                  be heard in Hades. I had no\n                  choice... it summoned me.\n\n     An ULTRA-FAST TECHNO BEAT BEGINS and the FULL-SOUND of a\n     BAND RUSHES in, creating a sense of vertigo with its\n     energy.\n\n\n6    INT. TOMB                                                   6\n\n     The BAND'S sounds ECHO about the stone chamber, thrumming\n     a deep, life-giving pulse. Suddenly, the LID of a\n     SARCOPHAGUS SCRAPES and slides to one side.\n\n\n7    EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               7\n\n     The Figure re-emerges from the tomb, his cape now in\n     tatters -- posture bent. He creeps across the cemetery\n     in unnatural, staccato movements as if hindered by the\n     physics of distance and time. All the while the SONG\n     plays, drawing the figure toward it.\n\n\n8    EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT                                 8\n\n     The Figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill\n     of yellow light from the street lamps. Stopping in a\n     darkened alleyway, he gasps for air, exhausted by his movements.\n      He listens again to the mesmeric TUNE of the\n     band in the distance, when -- From down the alley, a\n     voice...\n\n                          VOICE #2 (O.S.)\n                     (in French; subtitled)\n                  Need a fix?\n\n\n9    CLOSE ON FIGURE'S EYES                                      9\n\n     staring hungrily at...\n\n\n10   BACK TO SCENE                                               10\n\n     A MAN proffering a little parcel wrapped in foil.\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              4.\n\n10   CONTINUED:                                                    10\n\n     Pulling deeper into the shadows, the caped Figure beckons\n     the dealer over. The man approaches when -- With a wild\n     animal cry, the Figure lunges like a phantom -- A flash of teeth\n     -- The Dealer is on the ground -- the Figure set\n     upon him. OVER this scene the BAND'S SONG RUSHES IN LOUD again,\n     reaching an incredible CRESCENDO as the violent\n     frenzy continues -- the monster gnawing at the Dealer's\n     neck.\n\n\n11   CLOSE ON FIGURE'S HAND                                        11\n\n     Its vein refilling with the flow of warm blood -- skin\n     regaining a youthful tautness.\n\n\n12   WIDER                                                         12\n\n     Rising from his victim we see for the first time the\n     revitalized face of this creature, a mane of blond hair\n     frames the beautiful features of the VAMPIRE LESTAT --\n     his bulbous lips glistening red.\n\n                           LESTAT (V.O.)\n                  Whether it was that first meal,\n                  the music, or the 100 years of\n                  rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I\n                  was feeling better than ever. My\n                  appetite for living was voracious.\n                  My hearing so exact I could locate\n                  precisely the source of the\n                  music...\n\n\n13   EXT.

He looks up at an\n     extremely run-down flophouse...\n\n                          LESTAT (V.O.)\n                  My old house.\n\n     High in the attic, a single window glows with dim light.\n     The source of the MUSIC. The whole house is shaking from\n     the sound of the BAND playing upstairs.\n\n\n14   INT.

JAMES,\n     ALEX and MAUDY stare at each other as if in some tantric\n     trance, as they play their music -- Alex's long fingers\n     climbing up and down his guitar, Maudy's waifish body\n     sensually curls around her keyboard, the waves of music\n     flowing through them while James, on drums, drives them\n     further into it.\n\n                          LESTAT (V.O.)\n                  It was hard to believe these\n                  beings were mortal -- so confident\n                  in their skin. Everything in my\n                  body wanted to be with them. I\n                  couldn't help myself.\n\n     Then, from somewhere in the room, an ANGELIC VOICE begins\n     to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in\n     exquisite harmony. Arching her neck in some higher\n     ecstasy, Maudy looks across the makeshift studio and\n     suddenly stops playing.\n\n                          ALEX\n                  What the hell, Maudy.\n\n     Seeing Maudy's stunned face, Alex and James turn to see\n     Lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of\n     speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb\n     of the guitars. Slowly opening his cool grey eyes --\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  Please don't stop.\n\n                          JAMES\n                  What the f-- How did you get in\n                  here?\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  The door, of course.\n\n     James and Alex look at the door on the other side of the\n     attic -- they should have seen him. Maudy stares at\n     Lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks --\n     Drinking Maudy in with his eyes --\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  Your music woke me from the\n                  longest sleep.

Roger steps to the\n     podium.\n\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             8.\n\n17   CONTINUED:                                                   17\n\n                          ROGER\n                  May I present the Vampire Lestat.\n\n     He pushes a button and a black curtain slides open to\n     reveal a huge monitor on the wall.\n\n     Every eye is glued to the SCREEN... CRACKLE, CRACKLE.\n     Nothing. Then suddenly, on the screen, a face in shadow\n     appears... Lestat. His voice booms out over the crowd.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  Good evening. I'm so sorry I'm\n                  late.

Hushed\n     whispers move through the crowd. Lestat's eyes burn\n     unnaturally bright. His white skin absolutely glows,\n     luminous. Lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile.\n     Then grins wider, revealing his fangs.\n\n                          JOURNALIST\n                  Excellent makeup job.

Correct me if I'm\n                  wrong, but what I remember about\n                  vampires is you guys usually keep\n                  your identity secret.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  Yes. But why hide it in this day\n                  and age? I've hidden in the\n                  shadows for centuries. It's time\n                  to share myself with the world.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             9.\n\n19   CONTINUED:                                                   19\n\n     In the corner, Roger gives a big winking smile to the\n     camera crew.

She\n     looks down the street. In one direction, a busy,\n     brightly-lit street. Jesse gazes at a group of tourists\n     coming out of a pub, laughing. Then she turns, looks the\n     other direction. A dark street. She hesitates a long\n     moment, stares at the light, then can't help herself,\n     plunges toward the darkness, the LAUGHTER ECHOING, then\n     DYING.\n\n\n36   EXT.

Jesse, unable to look away, gazes as one\n     gets in a car. He stares back at her, disappears into\n     the car.\n\n\n37   EXT. BRIDGE - JUST AFTER                                     37\n\n     Jesse passes couples using the shadows for privacy in the\n     dark, filthy streets. She strides past a girl leaning\n     against a brick wall, the man grunting, moving\n     rhythmically against her.\n\n\n38   EXT. LONDON STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                        38\n\n     Fog floats in the yellow vapor lights. Jesse pauses at\n     the intersection of a narrow alley. She hesitates,\n     nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into\n     the blackness...\n\n\n39   EXT. WAVERLY ARMS - NIGHT                                    39\n\n     Jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho\n     private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign\n     and a dull blue light mounted above.\n\n     Jesse hears strange whispering. She sees now figures\n     moving through the fog. One pushes a buzzer. Jesse stares,\n     barely breathing, her heart pounding.\n\n     The figures have white, luminescent faces, strange, bright,\n     glowing eyes. Their fingernails are glass-like. A moment\n     later, a slot in the door opens. The glowing eyes of another\n     creature stares out at them, scrutinizing them. The door\n     closes quickly.\n\n     Jesse stands there, deliberating. She takes a step closer\n     to the door. Stops. Takes another nervous step. She hears\n     something, whirls around.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                16.\n\n39   CONTINUED:                                                       39\n\n     Another group of the strange figures walk steadily down the\n     street towards her. Jesse begins backing away. A HISSING\n     sound slowly fills the alley...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n\n     CLOSE ON LESTAT\n\n     smiling, revealing his fangs.\n\n     REVEAL we are...\n\n\n40   INT.

Subjects are marked, Werewolves, Poltergeists,\n     Possession...\n\n     SUPERIMPOSE:    SECRET ORDER OF THE TALAMASCA: CENTER FOR\n                     PARANORMAL STUDIES: LONDON HEADQUARTERS\n\n     Jesse, making a presentation, stands before an impressive\n     and imposing group of 10 TALAMASCANS, wearing demure\n     suits.\n\n     Jesse is excited, a bit nervous, hoping to impress. She\n     holds a remote which controls images appearing on the\n     large video screen. Clips from Lestat's press conference\n     continue. Jesse gazes out at the Talamascans.\n\n                                JESSE\n                  I have reason to believe Lestat's\n                  the real thing. A vampire.

In one of his songs\n                  he refers to a pub called the\n                  Sailor's Arms.

It\n                  turns out, in the late 1700's,\n                  there was a pub right in the\n                  backstreets of Soho called the\n                  Sailor's Arms.\n\n     The lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving\n     of a pub with the sign reading \"SAILOR'S ARMS.\"\n\n                                 JESSE\n                  And it had a reputation for\n                  dealing with black magic.\n                  Witches' covens, seances, that\n                  sort of thing.\n\n     Quick flashes of gruesome drawings appear -- animal\n     sacrifices. A corpses floating above a table...\n\n     Jesse talks faster and faster with her enthusiasm.\n\n                                JESSE\n                  And most importantly, reports of\n                  people being lured there and\n                  subsequently attacked by\n                  bloodsucking fiends.\n\n     Quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings,\n     blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman.

Of course the Sailor's\n                  Arms is not there anymore. That\n                  part of London is mostly old\n                  warehouses, meat-packing plants.\n\n                                TALAMASCAN #2\n                  In a few years it will be artists'\n                  lofts and pretentious French\n                  cafes...\n\n     Jesse leans forward now as she talks.\n\n                                JESSE\n                  Yes, but right now there's only\n                  one place to get a drink -- of\n                  sorts. A private club -- in\n                  exactly the same place.

What\n                  vampires hold sacred is keeping\n                  their kind a secret. You never\n                  name other immortals, tell where\n                  their lairs are.

A huge antique bed sits in the\n     room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and\n     fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck\n     wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning\n     suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed\n     wound as he sees...\n\n     An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red\n     velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An\n     easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting.\n     Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a\n     nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when...\n\n     Lestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting\n     that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in\n     ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his\n     blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself,\n     he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his\n     own image, when suddenly...\n\n     The sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and\n     again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck.\n     Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match\n     as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. Finally...\n\n     The strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to\n     reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious\n     figure.

Marius bends down, cups\n     Lestat's chin.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Drink and live. You've been brave\n                  enough for one night, my son.\n\n     Marius brings his open vein to Lestat's lips. Lestat\n     hesitates, but then suddenly... Feeds hungrily as\n     Marius's face fills with the bond. He slowly sinks\n     down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds. As\n     Lestat drinks, a barrage of IMAGES flood into him...\n\n\n52   IMAGES                                                         52\n\n     of Marius's life through the ages... Impressionistic,\n     subliminal burst of IMAGES, color... the glory days of\n     the Roman Empire to this very moment flash by...\n\n\n53   BACK TO LESTAT                                                 53\n\n     He keeps drinking from the vampire Marius who gasps with\n     the creation of his child.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Drink... drink and learn.\n\n     Lestat's body grows stronger, his back arching up as he\n     draws the \"life\" into him with full force, as... Marius\n     begins to weaken, himself.\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              36.\n\n53   CONTINUED:                                                     53\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  There... there... that will do.\n\n     But Lestat keeps on feeding hungrily.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  No... no more.   Lestat, no more!\n\n     With one great move, Marius pulls Lestat off his arm and\n     tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. Marius\n     reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as\n     Lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the\n     rush.\n\n     Slowly, Lestat starts to feel something. Pain begins\n     travelling through his body, consuming him until he\n     screams. Marius crosses to Lestat convulsing on the\n     floor. He kneels and gently wipes his brow. Lestat's\n     body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs...\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Don't be afraid, it's only your\n                  body that dies...\n\n     Wiping his brow as he dies...\n\n     Then, Lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins\n     to laugh almost drunkenly. Raising his head, his\n     metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes\n     fill with a new kind of power.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  More!\n\n     Lestat smiles with red glistening lips.     A beat on Marius\n     as he slowly smiles, too.\n\n\n54   EXT.

He set out to\n                  educate me in the unknown. Taught\n                  me all about the world, its hidden\n                  history... and about myself.\n\n     TILT DOWN to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as\n     Lestat bites into his throat. Marius watches as the\n     fisherman's body relaxes. He pulls Lestat away.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            37.\n\n54   CONTINUED:                                                   54\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  That's enough, my son... When you\n                  feed, you must hold back from the\n                  moment of death. You must never\n                  take the last drop, or it will\n                  draw you in and you will die...\n\n     The fisherman is moaning. Looking down at the suffering\n     victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into\n     a boat. He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength,\n     drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat.\n     Water starts bubbling in.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Remember, there is wisdom in the\n                  flesh, Lestat. A man wears his\n                  history on his skin...\n\n     Marius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  I'm talking about humanity.\n\n     As Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom\n     of the boat...\n\n                                     LESTAT\n                  Humanity?\n                     (snort)\n                  We're murderers.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  We're more than that. Their blood\n                  that we take into us carries with\n                  it life... their life, their\n                  knowledge, their complexity.\n                  Appreciate your prey, Lestat.\n\n     Marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire\n     strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean.\n\n\n55   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           55\n\n     Below the brightest of summer night skies, Lestat and\n     Marius walk along, talking intensely. The ocean appears\n     to shimmer in the faint light of stars. In the distance,\n     several bonfires burn on the sand, dancing figures\n     gathered around.\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           38.\n\n55   CONTINUED:                                                   55\n\n                          LESTAT (V.O.)\n                  My senses run amok, like a newborn\n                  child. And as for my new powers,\n                  I was beside myself with the\n                  pleasure of it all...\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  The trick is to find the way to\n                  face eternity head on. The\n                  spirit can be annihilated by\n                  boredom just as the body can be\n                  destroyed by sun or fire. My\n                  solace, my delight, is witnessing\n                  the unfolding of human destiny...\n\n     Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual\n     fervor. As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers,\n     just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing.\n\n     Lestat gazes over at them as he and Marius pass, hidden\n     in shadow.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  ... From Christ to the Dark Ages\n                  to the enlightenment, I've never\n                  been able to divine what was coming.\n                  That's what keeps me going -- I\n                  can't wait to see what human\n                  beings are going to do next...\n\n     Lestat nods, taking it in. They pass another bonfire.\n     MUSIC floats through the night. An OLDER MAN, 50, plays\n     balalaika while his daughter, 18, plays violin with great\n     passion.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Who could've predicted the\n                  Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his\n                  elephants?\n\n     Marius stops talking, turns. Lestat is no longer beside\n     him. Marius turns back and sees Lestat standing in the\n     shadows, listening to the music. The young woman, sensing\n     something, turns towards Lestat in the shadows as she\n     plays. Marius goes to Lestat, pulls him farther into the\n     shadows.\n\n                             MARIUS\n                  Careful.\n\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             39.\n\n55   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             55\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  But why must we hide, Marius? We\n                  are the powerful, we are the\n                  immortal. We should walk fearless\n                  in the open!\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Shhh. The life of a vampire is a\n                  life of discretion. We must sleep\n                  during the day, when we are\n                  vulnerable to the sun. Mortals\n                  must never know about us. It is\n                  forbidden, for the sake of all our\n                  kind.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                     (gazing at violin\n                      player as it sinks in)\n                  So I could never know her?\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Not unless you wanted to kill her.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                     (beat, quietly,\n                      intensely)\n                  So I can never be known?\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  You're known by me. I granted you\n                  that. There are others of our\n                  kind... though most are solitary\n                  creatures.\n\n     Lestat's eyes fill with some existential realization.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  My God...\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Forget God. You're no longer in\n                  his realm. Now we must leave.\n\n     Relenting, Lestat starts to follow. But the music\n     quickens. Lestat pauses, turns back. As if the music is\n     calling to him.\n\n     The girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and\n     plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. Lestat stands\n     there frozen to the spot. The music pulses through\n     him. He gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate\n     movements intensely...\n\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              40.\n\n55   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              55\n\n     Impulsively, Lestat goes back to them, hovers, his face\n     still somewhat obscured by the darkness. Lestat starts\n     clapping along to the music, exuberantly.\n\n     The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play.\n     Marius, in the shadows, is fuming. Lestat's eyes fill\n     with the moment, the girl's vitality. He notices that\n     sitting on the ground by the girl are several\n     instruments. Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a\n     violin. He studies the girl's playing again, then with\n     his new powers, as if by osmosis...\n\n     Begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her\n     movements.\n\n     The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new\n     musician. Lestat plays along with them, joyful,\n     exhilarated. The girl's fingers fly. Lestat's fingers\n     pick up speed. Faster. Faster. A glittering torrent of\n     notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold.\n\n     Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into\n     firelight. The Father and his daughter become less\n     certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing\n     skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is\n     completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father\n     and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop\n     playing. Lestat looks up. Sees terror in their eyes.\n     The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in\n     horror at Lestat.\n\n                          FATHER\n                  Fantasma!! Teras!!\n\n     Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius. He\n     grabs the Father. The girl drops her violin, turns, starts\n     running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  Stop her, Lestat!\n\n     Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror.\n\n                          MARIUS\n                  You must!\n\n     Lestat hesitates, then runs after the girl. She turns\n     back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream...\n     Lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her\n     mouth, covering her muffled scream.   Her struggle is no\n     use against his strength. Reaching up to her neck, he\n     touches it. He looks into her terrified eyes...\n\n                                          CUT TO:\n\n                                                              41.\n\n56   EXT.

Lestat gazes\n     at the lifeless body of the girl. Marius turns to\n     Lestat, furious.\n\n                       MARIUS\n               I will not have you put everything\n               at risk!

She\n     hears the lyrics... \"Mine eyes dazzle, she died so\n     young...\" She looks up, her eyes fill with tears, moved\n     by Lestat's loneliness.

Suddenly, out of the shadows, a\n     BOTTLE SMASHES... She starts, quickens her pace...\n\n     Runs straight into a bulky figure. A primal scream rises\n     from her stomach. The figure is a homeless drunk, more\n     scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the\n     night. Jesse presses her back against the wall.\n     Breathes. She inches around the corner...\n\n\n61   EXT.

The bar is comprised of\n     elaborately-carved Chinese dragons, a TV mounted\n     incongruously in the corner showing a silent Vampire\n     Lestat video.\n\n     Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a\n     music box. Another couple is necking hot and heavy in\n     the corner. Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire\n     coven. Many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt.\n     Their eyes shine with a strange, reflective light. Jesse\n     moves through the tables, passing a mortal YUPPIE-TYPE\n     sitting with a VAMPIRE GIRL he's obviously just met that\n     night.\n\n                          YUPPIE\n                  Wow.

Jesse looks away quickly, moves on... The\n     pianist watches as she passes by. The couple necking in\n     the corner begins to get even more aroused. A mortal\n     girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses\n     her shoulder, her throat...\n\n\n63   UNKNOWN POV                                                    63\n\n     Unaware that she is being watched, Jesse continues her\n     circuit.\n\n\n64   BACK TO SCENE                                                  64\n\n     as Jesse approaches the bar where three PUNK VAMPIRES\n     slouch, looking up at Lestat on the video.\n\n                                                           44.\n\n65   UNKNOWN POV                                                 65\n\n     We watch the Punk Vampires and hear every word they say\n     as the other SOUNDS FADE AWAY.\n\n                       PUNK VAMPIRE #1\n               Every coven's going...\n\n\n66   REVERSE ANGLE                                               66\n\n     REVEAL unknown POV.

Life is\n                  brief, but for you...\n\n     She inches toward the door, desperately stalling. Their\n     white faces gleam menacingly as they close in.

The hooded figure leans forward revealing his\n     face...\n\n     It is Lestat. He stares at Jesse, amazed. Jesse glances\n     desperately at the door.

For you\n                  that's forever, right?\n\n     All around her, vampires are turning to look. The Punk\n     Vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. Jesse is now\n     inches from the door. She can barely breathe. Punk\n     Vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning\n     to anger.\n\n                          PUNK VAMPIRE #1\n                  You know, you're really a\n                  downer...\n\n     He bares his fangs.

The others grin.\n     He picks her up by the throat. Her legs flail in the\n     air...\n\n     Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. Jesse\n     hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. She gasps for\n     air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley\n     by an invisible force. Jesse alone, turns, still woozy.\n     Finds herself staring at...\n\n     Lestat...\n\n     Jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned.\n\n     He drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness\n     of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks,\n     her pulsing jugular.\n\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             48.\n\n74   CONTINUED:                                                    74\n\n     Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to\n     gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated.\n     They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.\n\n                          JESSE\n                  You saved me.\n\n                                LESTAT\n                  Perhaps...

He curls his finger\n     around the first groupie's hair when a shadow crosses\n     his face.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  Mine eyes dazzle, she died so\n                  young.\n\n                             GROUPIE #1\n                  Huh?\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  It's a very old poem of mine.\n\n     Losing enthusiasm, Lestat walks away and drops himself\n     onto a couch. With a clap of his hands, the TV switches\n     ON. He silently watches one of his video clips.\n\n     The girls glance at each other, then, giggling, crawl\n     over toward Lestat. Groupie #1 slides her hand slowly\n     up his leg.\n\n                                GROUPIE #1\n                  C'mon, don't you want to have\n                  some fun?\n\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             57.\n\n77   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             77\n\n     She reaches for his belt. But he recoils at the touch\n     and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace.\n\n                          LESTAT\n                  Don't do that.\n\n                          GROUPIE #1\n                     (giggling)\n                  Are you ticklish?\n\n                          LESTAT\n                     (deadpan)\n                  I'm very ticklish.\n\n     The Second Groupie giggles as well...\n\n                                GROUPIE #2\n                  Hey, you ever been tickled by four\n                  hands at once? Hey, can you take\n                  both us, Lestat? What'd'ya think?\n\n     And at once they both start after Lestat on all fours\n     to tickle him. He gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the\n     sight and gets down on...\n\n     All fours as well as he leads them around the room in a\n     childish game.\n\n                                   LESTAT\n                  I don't know.     Let's see.\n\n     They try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of\n     them the whole time. The girls giggle as they pursue...\n\n     Lestat crawling just   ahead of them across the floor\n     and... Up the wall.    The teenagers keep giggling as they\n     watch him ascend the   wall like a spider. They can't\n     believe what they're   seeing as...\n\n     Lestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside-down\n     across the ceiling. The girls begin to giggle and half-cry...\n     as they arch their necks all the way back to see...\n     Lestat crawling down the opposite wall. The girls sit\n     open-mouthed with terror as Lestat reaches the ground --\n\n     He heads straight for them.\n\n     The girls begin to scream...

He looks at all the paintings.\n     His neat, protected world. It's as if Marius is taunting\n     him. He slams his fist down in fury. Stares at the\n     rising dust.\n\n\n82   INT. PLANE - NIGHT                                             82\n\n     Jesse puts on headphones, listens to LESTAT'S MUSIC.   As\n     she opens the journal, LESTAT'S MUSIC DISSOLVES INTO\n     VIOLIN...\n\n\n83   FLASHBACK - INT. VILLA - BEDROOM - LESTAT                      83\n\n     Lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie,\n     playing the violin, with incredible passion.\n\n     His playing picks up speed, the bow bending across the\n     strings with a maestro's speed and precision.\n\n                             LESTAT (V.O.)\n               Yes, Marius was impressed with my\n               thirst for knowledge... But it\n\n               turned out that there was such a\n               thing as knowing too much. There\n               were things Marius was not yet\n               ready to teach me... and Marius\n               and I parted ways.\n\n     Suddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across\n     the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase. Lestat\n     comes out of his spell, walks across the room to the\n     bookcase, bends down to cleave the bow out from under it.\n     Having difficulty, he pushes back an old rug on the floor\n     when he sees something...\n\n     Carved into one of the floorboards is an Egyptian eye\n     with a hole dug out of its iris. Stepping aside, he\n     realizes he is standing on a manhole. A beat ON Lestat\n     as he thinks... Poking his finger through the hole of the\n     Egyptian eye, he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set\n     of steps leading down into the villa's basement.\n\n                          LESTAT\n               Marius!\n\n     No answer. Lestat looks around wondering what to do.\n     Taking a candelabra off the table, he ventures down the\n     stairs, peering down into the darkness.\n\n                                                             60.\n\n84   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - SECRET STAIRCASE - NIGHT                84\n\n     Lestat negotiates a circling flight of stone steps,\n     winding its way into the lowest bowels of the villa,\n     still carrying his violin.\n\n\n85   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY                  85\n\n     Lestat finds himself facing a steeply descending\n     passageway that stretches into darkness. He tests the\n     stones ahead of him with caution...\n\n     Suddenly, the sconces along the passageway come to\n     life... In quick succession, they flare up and burn with\n     an unnatural intensity. Lestat, struck with curiosity\n     and wonder, puts down his candelabra and ventures forth.\n     We FOLLOW Lestat as he rounds the corner and stops.\n     There is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden\n     doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that\n     bars the doors shut from the outside.\n\n     Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a\n     SHRIEKING CRACK. The doors fly open revealing a bright\n     light from within... Lestat, apprehensive, continues\n     towards the open doorway.\n\n\n86   INT. SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            86\n\n     Lestat enters, squinting through the bright light from\n     scores of burning sconces. At the far end of the\n     sanctuary Lestat makes out the shape of two statues,\n     an Egyptian man and an Egyptian woman sitting stone\n     still, seemingly staring straight at him, AKASHA and\n     her King, ENKIL. We recognize Akasha from the sketches\n     in Talbot's office. Stepping closer, they appear not to\n     be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the\n     palest skin imaginable. His eyes widen at the sight of\n     their clothes -- the most valuable Egyptian finery;\n     bracelets of gold, headdresses of incredible gems,\n     clothes of silk. Staring up into their faces, Lestat\n     is struck with the realization...\n\n                       LESTAT\n               They're... alive.\n\n     Lestat is drawn to the woman -- her form and beauty is\n     exquisite even in its absolute stillness. As if this\n     statue had just asked him to play, Lestat holds out his\n     violin.\n\n                       LESTAT\n               Would you like me to play for you?\n\n                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            61.\n\n86   CONTINUED:                                                   86\n\n     Her eyes still bore into him. Lestat smiles.   He raises\n     his violin and begins to play.\n\n     The song of the VIOLIN ECHOES around the walls...\n\n     Lestat plays, with increasing abandon...\n\n     Akasha and Enkil sit frozen...\n\n     Lestat plays and plays, lost in the music.   He throws a\n     glance up at the throne and stops...\n\n     Akasha is moving...\n\n     Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes.\n\n     Lestat stares in amazement... Her arm rises up, her wrist\n      extended outward towards Lestat. The pulse of a\n     HEARTBEAT begins... Lestat moves toward her as if\n     beckoned. A green vein appears beneath the marble\n     surface of her skin. The vein pulses as the blood\n     courses around. The HEARTBEAT POUNDS LOUDER, DEEPER.\n\n     The sound fills Lestat's head as he is drawn closer to\n     Akasha's wrist. Lowering himself, as if genuflecting,\n     Lestat bends closer to the vein which looks like the very\n     font of life to him...\n\n\n87   EXT. VILLA ROOF - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                          87\n\n     Marius sits under the stars, painting, when his hand\n     begins to tremble... Suddenly, he drops his brush,\n     startled by some unexpected feeling that passes through\n     him. He stands bolt upright as a frightening GUST of\n     WIND sweeps across him.\n\n\n88   BACK TO SANCTUARY                                            88\n\n     Lestat sinks his teeth into Akasha's vein, drawing in the\n     unimaginable font. A burst of image and color floods\n     into him, as...\n\n\n89   LESTAT'S IMAGES                                              89\n\n     of Ancient Egypt... power... supremacy... slavery... all\n     impressionistic, subliminal... the bright burning sun, red\n     lips, blood spurting like a fountain...\n\n     END OF IMAGES.\n\n                                                           62.\n\n90   MARIUS                                                      90\n\n     in the sanctuary, hovering over Lestat, who lays on the\n     stone floor in a catatonic state, staring. Marius looks\n     down upon him, the sconces above blazing high with\n     flames. Marius's VOICE ECHOING furiously...\n\n                       MARIUS\n               What have you done, Lestat?\n               Lestat!\n\n\n91   INT.

Lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with\n     manacles and chains. Struggles against them.\n\n                       LESTAT\n               Let me go!\n\n                       MARIUS\n               No. You've drunk the purest\n               blood.

I have\n                  watched over Akasha and her King\n                  for 2000 years!

They drank until\n                  they lost their will to drink.\n                  They became living statues. And\n                  yet Akasha still sustains the\n                  life force of all vampires. It\n                  is believed what happens to her,\n                  happens to all of us.\n\n     Lestat gazes up at him, taking it in.

Lestat awakens,\n     his manacles removed. He stretches, shakes his head, as\n     if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop...\n     Something has changed. Marius's paints have gone. Some\n     of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes\n     are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded\n     marble floor.\n\n                         LESTAT\n               Marius!\n\n     No response.\n\n\n93   INT.

I howled into the night\n               in loneliness and pain.\n\n     Lestat screams into the darkness, filled with despair,\n     grief. He disappears off into the night.\n\n                       LESTAT (V.O.)\n               But there was no answer -- just\n               the endless procession of days,\n               months, years... My teacher left\n               me to my darkest lesson -- that in\n               the end, we are alone.\n\n     Lestat looks up from feeding on a mortal.

She sits there a moment,\n      speechless, then stares out at the vast, black night.\n\n      TILT DOWN TO:\n\n\n97    EXT.

The fence encircles his\n      Hollywood Hills home, a high-tech modern version of a\n      medieval fortress of steel and glass, hidden deep in\n      the canyon, his only neighbors, chaparral and coyotes.\n\n      Lestat closes his eyes as if listening to something. As\n      we PULL BACK again, and RISE UP INTO the sky, a LESTAT\n      SONG begins to play and magically we are in the MUSIC\n      and with a visual splash we are...

Akasha and her\n      throne remain O.S. We MOVE CLOSER to reveal... Enkil's\n      throat gapes, torn open, and whereas before his skin\n      was pale, it's now a chalkish powder. And next to him...\n      Akasha's throne sits empty. A god again walks the earth.\n      A GUST of WIND suddenly blows and Enkil crumbles into\n      white dust.\n\n\n108   INT.

PAST\n      his band, James, Alex and Maudy, laying in the studio in\n      a hazy sleep from yet another night of debauchery.\n\n      We MOVE menacingly INTO... Lestat's expensive living\n      quarters, PAST the huge glassed-in space and into\n      Lestat's private hall, leading to his bedroom door.

The dance is\n      seductive, slow, her head thrown back. The vampires\n      turn, stare at her, mesmerized, aroused by her\n      movements. They move to the dance floor, watching.\n      Akasha opens her eyes, smiles at them, then turns to\n      Vampire Lover, points to him, beckons. He smiles back,\n      happy to be chosen, moves onto the dance floor. She\n      dances a little farther away. A game.

He stares at her. Her hips are gyrating, her\n      body slithering. A moan escapes from him. Again, he\n      moves to her, reaches for her. She laughs.\n\n\n      CLOSE ON HIS PUZZLED FACE\n\n      He turns...\n\n      She's dancing across the floor now. Vampire Lover's\n      smile is not so friendly now. He steps toward her,\n      determined... She moves behind him. Her body pressed up\n      tight against his. He smiles, shudders with a rush of\n      desire. All the other vampires watch, envious. Her\n      lips brush his neck, her hands run up and down his\n      body pausing on his chest. He reaches for her. She\n      kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl.

We can't see where... We\n      STAY ON Vampire Lover's face as Akasha disappears FROM\n      FRAME. The sound of BONE SNAPPING, the SQUISH of RIPPING FLESH.\n       LOUD SUCKING.

She brings it to her lips, sucks\n      again thirstily...\n\n      Vampire Lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry\n      husk, then tosses it. She turns back to Vampire Lover,\n      his face frozen in a grotesque mask. She laughs, drops\n      him unceremoniously to the floor...\n\n      Akasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires.\n      They begin to back away. But the DOOR LOCKS itself\n      LOUDLY.\n\n      Akasha sways again to the music, moving faster now, as if\n      refreshed.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   Turn up the music!\n\n      The terrified barman quickly COMPLIES.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                      (smiles, to herself)\n                   Oh, I do love the 21st Century.\n\n      Akasha turns to the terrified barman again, pulls him\n      over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching\n      for a snack. He flails but is overwhelmed by her\n      strength...\n\n      The Vampire Girl who Jesse saw vanish with the Yuppie,\n      flies towards Akasha, knife raised, but Akasha just\n      turns... Suddenly there is an EXPLOSION of FLAMES. The\n      Vampire Girl screams as she is consumed. The piano\n      player and guitar player go up in flames...\n\n      All hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the\n      door.

Marius turns, uneasy, sensing something,\n      peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign.\n      Marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows.\n\n      It is Mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.\n\n                        MAEL\n                Marius, you've broken your oath.\n                You were to watch over Akasha\n                and Khayman. You are a great\n                disappointment to me.\n\n      Marius looks up to see all the Ancients now stepping\n      from the shadows. KHAYMAN, the desert vampire, in\n      Egyptian dress along with PANDORA, the dark-haired\n      beauty in her sari, ARMAND, the boy sage, in his\n      Mesopotamian robes. Last, MAHARET steps from her\n      grand door. She is beautiful with long red hair,\n      alabaster skin.\n\n                        MARIUS\n                Pandora, Armand, it's been a long\n                time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do\n                I owe this honor?\n\n                        KHAYMAN\n                You have been summoned because of\n                your errant child...\n\n      Khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the\n      distance at Lestat's house.\n\n                             PANDORA\n                   (giving deep,\n                    sexy laugh)\n                He's quite the devil, isn't he?\n\n                        ARMAND\n                His music mocks us, Pandora!\n\n                        PANDORA\n                His music moves my blood.\n\n                         ARMAND\n                Keep your amorous thoughts to\n                yourself. His music is a threat\n                to all vampires. We will let the\n                covens dismember him at his\n                concert.\n\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            78.\n\n126   CONTINUED:                                                  126\n\n                            MAEL\n                   Yes.   It will set an example.\n\n                            MARIUS\n                   I don't see how this solves\n                   things. This isn't thought\n                   through.\n\n                           KHAYMAN\n                   Marius, we understand your\n                   affection for Lestat, but your\n                   duty is to us!\n\n      He gazes again down at Lestat's house with a threatening\n      glance. Turns to Marius with a look of warning.\n\n                                 KHAYMAN\n                   We could always get rid of him\n                   right now.\n\n                                MAEL\n                   No. We will contact the covens.\n                   Let them know we condone the\n                   slaying. It will be better for\n                   all to see.\n\n      Marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at Mael.\n      Maharet steps up.\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   Wait. Never mind Lestat!   We\n                   have greater problems...\n\n                           MARIUS\n                          (stepping up)\n                   Maharet is right. It is Akasha\n                   we face now.\n\n                           PANDORA\n                      (joyous)\n                   Is it true, Maharet?   Has our\n                   Queen really risen!\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   Don't be so happy, Pandora. I\n                   knew Akasha when she walked this\n                   earth. I was her slave. I am now\n                   her enemy. I know what she is\n                   capable of.\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             79.\n\n126   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            126\n\n                           ARMAND\n                   Yes. We've all felt her presence,\n                   even as she hides from us.\n                      (as others nod,\n                       acknowledging the\n                       truth of this)\n                   What does she want now?\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   She knows only one thing. Taking\n                   pleasure in destroying life. She\n                   is already killing the young ones\n                   to build her strength.\n\n                           MARIUS\n                   She's sucked the life out of her\n                   King like a praying mantis. I\n                   sense she is getting closer.\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   She has come to destroy Lestat,\n                   but he will only whet her thirst\n                   more...\n\n      The Ancients look to each other, taking this in.\n      Pandora looks around, suddenly nervous.\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   If we act together, we have a\n                   chance to destroy her.\n\n      They all gaze at Maharet, astonished.\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   Yes! We must destroy her\n                   immediately! If she is not\n                   stopped, I'm afraid of what will\n                   happen to the entire mortal world.\n\n                           MAEL\n                   But can she be destroyed? I am\n                   left to bear the scars of the last\n                   attempt on her life. She was\n                   dragged into the sun. She\n                   survived. But we almost didn't...\n\n      Removing his hood, we see his terribly-burned face.   They\n      all stare at him.\n\n                            MARIUS\n                   What happens to our Queen happens\n                   to us. If Akasha dies, we die\n                   as well.\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               80.\n\n126   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              126\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   Then so be it! We must take that\n                   chance.\n\n      She gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her\n      words sink in.\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   We must destroy Akasha. For the\n                   sake of humanity! We must find\n                   her. Now!\n\n                           ARMAND\n                   But perhaps she has come to kill\n                   Lestat and then will go back to her\n                   slumber. That is our only hope.\n\n                           PANDORA\n                      (eager)\n                   Yes. That's right. She and the\n                   covens will take care of that\n                   brat. We must go to the concert\n                   and pay our respects to our great\n                   Queen.\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   How?

It is\n                   our only hope.\n\n      Marius then goes and stands beside Maharet and Khayman.\n      The others gaze at the three standing together now.\n\n                           MAEL\n                   No. Armand is right.

Lestat\n      creates a fantastic melody around the beat. He lets\n      the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the\n      REVERB still RINGING in the room. Lestat hears\n      something, turns. Outside, in the Hollywood Hills,\n      DOGS are HOWLING across the canyons like wolves.\n      Lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside...\n\n                                                             82.\n\n128   EXT.

As Maudy and the\n      band continue to play, the wolflike HOWLS in the night\n      get LOUDER. And beneath it all, a DEEP PULSE BEATS. The\n      song comes to an end. Lestat turns, gazes back at the\n      band THROUGH the window, at their excitement. He comes\n      back inside.\n\n\n129   INT.

Opening her eyes for a moment, Jesse watches\n      the world whiz past her at incredible speed and\n      suddenly -- they stop on a dime.\n\n      Jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at\n      Hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying\n      out before her like a glimmering blanket.\n\n\n132   EXT.

She laughs, intoxicated by\n      the experience.\n\n                        JESSE\n                Do that again!\n\n      Lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. Her trust. For\n      a moment she laughs like a child. Then they look at each\n      other deeply, feeling something. He wants to kiss her.\n      She knows it. He turns away.\n\n                              LESTAT\n                And now for my next trick.\n\n      Lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open.\n\n      Jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something\n      stirring in her. Magically, the wound heals up. She\n      stares, impressed.\n\n                                 JESSE\n                Did it hurt?\n\n                        LESTAT\n                Yes.

Love is the essence of\n                the dark gift. The connection is\n                so much more satisfying, brief as\n                it is, than anything else.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                    88.\n\n132   CONTINUED:                                                          132\n\n      Lestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular,\n      the white flesh of her neck. He reaches out, touches her\n      neck, strokes it. Jesse shivers under his touch,\n      terrified, but wanting more. Lestat brushes his lips\n      against her hair, her neck. Runs his hands down her\n      arms. She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm\n      of his voice.\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   As you drink, you feel the heart\n                   weakening... it struggles even\n                   though there's no hope. You feel\n                   the life slipping away, the flash\n                   of those brief years. The taste\n                   of mortality you can no longer\n                   experience... and it is\n                   beautiful...\n                      (pulls away sharply)\n                   No 'relationship,' no commingling\n                   can ever reach the heights of that\n                   experience.\n\n      But Jesse steps forward.       Lestat turns, stares at her.\n\n      Her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced.\n      One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens\n      her blouse down to her navel.\n\n      Lestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin\n      from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about\n      her shoulders. Her face remains aimed unwavering at\n      Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast.\n\n      With her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the\n      point across her breast. She inhales through clenched\n      teeth... then settles as we see:\n\n      The long incision go from pink to red; then the blood,\n      like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping\n      down her chest.\n\n      Lestat staggers. Breaking their stare, he accepts her\n      gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound\n      itself. Lestat closes her eyes... He comes up to her\n      face, brushing his lips against her cheek.

His head flails as he\n      tries to stop his natural impulse. Lestat lets out a\n      desperate cry and throws her aside. Jesse gazes at him,\n      surprised. He looms over her, angry.\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   You want to know everything. You\n                   want to see what it's like. Then\n                   come!

He looks into the dark.\n      Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to\n      her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving\n      across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman\n      giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she\n      realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves\n      forward. Jesse gingerly follows.\n\n      Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite\n      her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches,\n      fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's\n      presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes\n      shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a\n      street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the\n      vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone.\n      Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too.\n      Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over\n      the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to\n      see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the\n      bench.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              90.\n\n134   CONTINUED:                                                    134\n\n                           JESSE\n                   Is she alright?\n\n      Lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained\n      lips.

You want to know?\n\n                           JESSE\n                   Lestat, no!\n\n      Lestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his\n      back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. The\n      woman's body convulses... Jesse watches in horror as...\n      the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens...\n      finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm.\n      Jesse gasps, backs away. Lestat finishes and, wiping his\n      mouth, approaches Jesse.\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   You see now? Are you ready?     Now\n                   do you want it?!\n\n      He gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately\n      wanting her to say yes. The horror, the revulsion in\n      Jesse's face says it all.\n\n                            LESTAT\n                   No.   Of course you don't.\n\n      She backs away from him, now terrified.

They are cold, blank.\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   Well I didn't grant your final\n                   wish.\n                      (shakes his head)\n                   It was an impossible wish to begin\n                   with.

Jesse's face is\n      completely still in HUMAN TIME. As her hand drops, she\n      realizes what just happened. And with that, Lestat\n      disappears. She stares into the night. There's a SWISH\n      and the sound of RUSHING AIR. Jesse turns, screams,\n      backs away. It's not Lestat standing there at all but\n      Mael, the Druid vampire. With great speed he glides\n      towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her\n      cries...

MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - FRONT ENTRANCE -               149\n      CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\n      Jesse moves to the front entrance, gazes at the walls\n      surrounding the front gate.\n\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             97.\n\n149   CONTINUED:                                                   149\n\n                           JESSE (V.O.)\n                   I know you want me to be a regular\n                   human girl... but I'm not. I\n                   can't be...\n\n      She looks back at the house, then quickly slips out the\n      gate.\n\n\n150   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - DAY                          150\n\n      Maharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty\n      desert. Nothing for as far as the eye can see.\n\n                           JESSE (V.O.)\n                   Lestat is my destiny... I know\n                   that now. I love you, Aunt\n                   Maharet. Good-bye.\n\n      Jesse walks away from the house. Coming to a highway,\n      she reads a sign -- \"DEATH VALLEY 120 miles.\" Just then,\n      a VW minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction.\n      She sticks out her thumb... The minibus pulls to a stop\n      on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. A VAMPIRE DRIVER\n      leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid\n      with white face-paint and fake fangs.\n\n                           VAMPIRE DRIVER\n                   Need a ride?\n\n      Jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of Goths and fake\n      vampires. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT BLARES FROM the SPEAKERS.\n\n                           JESSE\n                      (smiles)\n                   Yeah.\n\n\n151   EXT. DEATH VALLEY - FROM HIGH ABOVE - DUSK                   151\n\n      We see a line of traffic snake out along a desert road\n      toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky.\n      A distant sound of DRUMS BEATING chaotic rhythms is\n      heard. As we FLY CLOSER, the DRUMMING becomes LOUDER and\n      clearer. Until we are RIGHT ABOVE an incredible scene...\n      A mass of people (30,000) gather in a valley of red rock.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n152   EXT.

But she has disappeared. Talbot is\n      jostled, dropping his glasses on the ground.\n\n                           VOICE (O.S.)\n                   Sorry, Grandpa!\n\n      Talbot crouches down and finds his glasses.

Next to the real thing, all\n      these fake vampires look ridiculous.\n\n                           MARIUS\n                      (quietly)\n                   Hello, David.\n\n\n155   ON TALBOT                                                      155\n\n      Speechless.\n\n                           MARIUS\n                   I must show you my new paintings\n                   sometime.\n\n      Marius smiles. Talbot is awestruck -- the goal of a\n      lifetime's searching. He tries to say something, but\n      it's too late. Flash. Marius is moving through the\n      crowd at unnatural speed. Enormous pipes spout flames\n      high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light\n      along the crowd, leading to two enormous Egyptian\n      effigies of Akasha and Enkil flanking a stage at the\n      top end. And before the stage stretches a mass of\n      human bacchanalian debauchery... Woodstock on mescaline.\n      Naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the\n      strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles\n      around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms.\n\n      The whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit   -- naked\n      bodies walk across heads of people while others   get\n      tossed and thrown. This crowd is determined to    get\n      what they were promised... Nothing like they've   ever\n      seen.\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            99.\n\n155   CONTINUED:                                                  155\n\n      A new world, a world of the initiated who have somehow\n      managed to include themselves in the select number of\n      attendees to a sacred rite. And among the mortals are\n      the immortals. Amidst them we see the tattooed Vampires,\n      the Armani Vampire, the others, now dressed in cloaks\n      which they use to hide their knives and sickles.\n\n\n156   HIGH ABOVE VALLEY                                           156\n\n      Standing on the strange rocks are the Ancient vampires,\n      except for Maharet.

Roger pops his head in.\n\n                           ROGER\n                   They're getting pretty worked up\n                   out there.\n\n\n159   INT.

He looks ready for business, whatever\n      may happen. The band look at each other, then look to\n      Lestat. This is the moment.

Suddenly the torches go out sending\n      the place into utter darkness. A stunned moment. The\n      place goes berserk. We see the dim figures of the band\n      take their places. Jesse desperately tries to push\n      toward the front.\n\n\n161   INT.

The mass\n      surges forward... The stage lights up in a huge halo of\n      blood-red light. The band plays a hypnotic tune that\n      would put the devil in a spell, as... We wait for Lestat.\n      The band keeps playing the pounding cadence, as...\n\n      The audience doesn't see Lestat anywhere and cheers over\n      the sound, and it seems as if the whole of Death Valley\n      is shaking, when...

Jesse, in the crowd, screams up to\n      him... But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams\n      for him. Lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips\n      into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note,\n      filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be\n      replaced with hell.\n\n\n165   AT BACK OF CONCERT - MIXING BOARD                            165\n\n      Two STUDIO ENGINEERS sit dazed.\n\n                           ENGINEER #1\n                      (Cockney accent)\n                   Could we turn it down a tad?\n\n      The second Engineer looks to the mixing panel.\n\n                           ENGINEER #2\n                   His mic's not even up.\n\n      They stare, dumbfounded.\n\n\n166   BACK TO CONCERT                                              166\n\n      The pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole\n      place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the\n      energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front\n      of this papal devil. All move and sway except for...\n      Jesse, desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get\n      closer and closer to...\n\n      Lestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice.\n      Lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand.

Lestat launches the band into a new number that\n      makes the previous song seem like a lullaby. He eyes the\n      coven-assassins here and there and sings straight to\n      them. His lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting\n      them with satire. Jesse whirls around, spying the\n      assassins in the crowd. She shakes her head no...\n      The covens need no more encouragement as they begin to\n      move through the crowd toward the stage.

Reaching   the stage, they are\n      suddenly on it -- roadies run   in and are immediately\n      cast aside by inhuman powers.    We speed into vampire\n      time as... (NOTE: In camera,    no C.G.I.)\n\n      The assassins draw knives and lunge, determined to\n      dismember Lestat. Lestat does an acrobatic leap, dodging\n      the knives. He rips the microphone from the stand and\n      holds it up just in time... as an assassin is impaled.\n      The assassin squirms and convulses. The crowd goes\n      insane... Lestat snarls at the audience as if this\n      really were part of the performance... The assassins\n      attack again, this time hurtling massive light stands\n      like they were small spears.

Back to\n      mortal time. The crowd cheers at the sudden appearance\n      of the figure on stage, loving the show. Lestat grins at\n      Marius. The band keeps playing. Marius hurls a huge\n      LIGHT at the assassins. It EXPLODES as it hits them,\n      pinning one with shards. But an assassin hurls a sickle\n      at Lestat.

But one after the other they\n      spontaneously combust, turning hot-white to black ash\n      and drift up into the air like strange supernatural\n      kites.

Blood trickles slightly across\n      her chin. Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it,\n      as the pulse of her blood increases... Lestat looks at\n      it, both wanting and fearful. Wrapping her arms around\n      Lestat, she braces him, licks his face.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   Has your tongue lost its taste for\n                   blood?\n\n                           LESTAT\n                      (melting)\n                   Never.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   But you didn't kill the mortal\n                   girl.\n\n      Lestat looks caught.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   Instead you kissed her.

Akasha rises above him,\n      hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill\n      into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to\n      meet her as...\n\n      Akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until\n      their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into\n      him.

Forget about\n                   everything else.\n\n      Lestat looks straight at Akasha, his face flushed.    His\n      eyes are empty of everything except her blood.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   What's your answer?\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            108.\n\n180   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            180\n\n      Lestat looks at her and then smiles. Akasha's mouth\n      spreads into a smile. Flashes of brilliant light strobe\n      over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again. There's a\n      powerful rush of WIND that engulfs them as they spin\n      together, detached from time and space.\n\n\n181   FLASH CUTS - STOCK FOOTAGE                                   181\n\n      All INTERCUT WITH Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching.\n      Lestat falls back in ecstasy. He shakes out his body and\n      lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest,\n      his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins.\n      Akasha watches and waits. Finally Lestat grins boyishly\n      through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of\n      his hand.\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   Can we try that again?\n\n      Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a\n      kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual\n      hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and\n      scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   Show me the world...\n\n      Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up\n      into the air and off into the night.\n\n\n182   INT.

They stare at Lestat, nervous,\n      yet fascinated. They move towards him. Lestat finds\n      himself surrounded by hands, touching him, reaching\n      beneath his shirt, pulling his clothes from his body. He\n      swoons, closes his eyes, smiles.\n\n                        LESTAT\n                So warm...\n                   (sniffs their skin)\n                ... their blood...\n\n                        AKASHA\n                ... yes...\n\n                        LESTAT\n                ... they're mortal...\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              111.\n\n185   CONTINUED:                                                     185\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   ... of course.

Lestat's white skin breaks\n      the surface. Lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin\n      alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water...\n      the water laps gently -- strange sighs of pleasure as\n      girls' hands caress Lestat's torso... their hands reach\n      down lower and lower through the water... Lestat's eyes\n      remain closed but his mouth opens... Now it's Akasha\n      kissing him. Lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek.\n      Akasha smiles -- takes his head in her hands -- she\n      kisses him, pushes him back -- he tries to resist -- he\n      can't, startled by her strength... Akasha kisses his\n      neck, his chest, bites... Lestat arches in ecstasy...\n      Akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips,\n      smiles, goes back down and drinks.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n187   AKASHA AND LESTAT - LATER                                      187\n\n      now moved to the bed, surrounded by the fine nets...\n      kissing, probing each other's bodies, floating above the\n      bed... Akasha rolls him over -- smiles down at him -- a\n      fang exposed... She draws her wrist across her mouth... a\n      globule of blood smacks Lestat's open lips... Flash --\n      A thousand images in a second. Lestat jolted as if by a\n      million volts. Blood smears their bodies -- they bathe\n      in it.\n\n\n188   CLOSE ON LESTAT                                                188\n\n      The most lascivious smile spreading over his face, even\n      as the waves of pleasure still course through him,\n      causing his mouth to twitch and tremble.

He sits up alone in the canopied bed,\n      disoriented. Akasha is nowhere to be seen. He looks\n      toward the window. The sun is just about to disappear\n      below the horizon. Lestat stares, amazed, blinking...\n      Shielding his eyes, Lestat goes to window, gazes in awe\n      at the setting sun. As the last rays slice through the\n      sky, Lestat closes his eyes, stretches his arms out, feels\n      the warm sun on his skin. He smiles at this feeling he's\n      craved for so long. Still smiling, he opens his eyes,\n      blinking from the light. He turns, gazes towards the\n      bath and gasps. The dying light illuminates... The\n      servant girls' bodies, now grey with death, lying around\n      the edge of the bath. The roses are now black and the\n      water is colored a rich deep red...\n\n\n190   INT.

PLANTATION HOUSE - DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION         191\n\n      The candles have all melted, forming pools that spread\n      across the lace cloth. Food sits uneaten on plates. The\n      last of the sun's rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting\n      around the table, some slumped onto their food, some\n      frozen in death. Lestat moves through the room, a\n      feeling of dread spreading. We FOLLOW as he moves...\n\n\n192   EXT.

Lestat stares at her dripping blood.\n      She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. She lifts\n      her wrist, drips her blood into Lestat's mouth. Lestat's\n      eyes glaze over again. He smiles, feeds hungrily, lost\n      again. Akasha smiles.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   Come, my King.

A shadow passes over the Ancients' faces.\n\n                           MARIUS\n                   She comes...\n\n      The WINDOWS along one side of the hall EXPLODE with a\n      startling GUST.

A thin, red scar remains from where she\n      cut herself with the silver stick from the Chinese\n      barrette.\n\n      Lestat gazes at her, begins to advance.

He reaches her.\n      Maharet flies across the room, but Akasha meets her\n      halfway. Grabs her by the hair. Maharet struggles but\n      Akasha is much more powerful. Jesse offers up her neck\n      to his bite. Maharet looks away and Akasha looks pleased\n      as...\n\n      Lestat sinks his teeth into Jesse's neck. Jesse gasps\n      with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws\n      her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she\n      holds him.\n\n      With that Maharet's great family mural begins to weep\n      blood from every name. All the Ancients turn, stare at\n      the mural as...\n\n      Lestat drinks and drinks and Jesse sighs with intimacy,\n      clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper\n      into her flesh. She slowly crumples to the floor, being\n      drawn down until finally...\n\n      Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale.    Dead.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   Good-bye, great family.\n\n      She turns to the MURAL with a fierce gaze. Flash! It\n      EXPLODES, CRUMBLING to a million pieces on the ground.\n      Maharet stares in horror.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   Now, my children, remember your\n                   real family!

My King, you've\n                   just earned your crown.\n\n      Lestat smiles with a blood-stained mouth. Akasha\n      approaches Lestat and offers him her vein. She looks\n      scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist...\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                   118.\n\n193   CONTINUED:    (5)                                                   193\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   You see how he obeys.

He drinks as Akasha gasps with\n      pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him. She keeps\n      smiling to the others. But Lestat doesn't stop drinking.\n      Akasha looks back to him, her face changing.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   That's enough, Lestat.\n\n      Still Lestat doesn't stop.\n\n                             AKASHA\n                   Lestat.

Akasha thrashes,\n      trying to release herself.\n\n      Maharet and Marius realize what he's doing, see the\n      chance Lestat has gained for them. A silent signal\n      passes between them as...\n\n      The Ancients make an instantaneous decision. Akasha\n      looks up, gasping, in time to see Maharet, Marius,\n      Khayman, Armand, Mael, Pandora flying towards her.\n      Akasha lets out a hiss...\n\n      Most of the Ancients are thrown to the ground while Mael\n      ignites in mid-air. Mael's skin bubbles. He screams,\n      the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood\n      were burning acid...\n\n      Pandora too bursts into flames.       She falls to the ground.\n\n      But Lestat, strong with Akasha's blood, keeps his hold\n      and Khayman, Armand, Marius, Maharet fly at her again.\n      They swarm over Akasha. She rises into the air,\n      thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass\n      of flailing limbs.\n\n      The THUMP of Akasha's HEART ACCELERATES as they try to\n      drain her...\n\n      Akasha turns on [Khayman to incinerate him.

The mass of bodies sinks to the\n      ground. The Ancients pull back to reveal that...\n\n      Akasha's skin is deathly blue white.    In horror, she\n      manages to spit out her words.\n\n                           AKASHA\n                   You kill me, you kill yourselves.\n\n      The Ancient Ones look to each other, uncertain a moment.\n\n      Akasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze\n      on Lestat. He gazes back at her.\n\n      Suddenly, Akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare\n      green, marshalling the last of her wrath. Lestat cries\n      out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs.\n\n      Fiercely determined, Lestat bites into Akasha's throat,\n      this time for the kill. Akasha sinks her nails into his throat.\n       He hangs on, his teeth deep. They are locked in mortal combat.\n       Akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real\n      fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes.\n\n                           MAHARET\n                   Wait, Lestat!

She strides over to Akasha\n      and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck. Akasha struggles\n      but this time she cannot even rise up. Maharet does not\n      stop. A HOWLING sound as if from hell fills the room.\n\n      The Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe.\n      Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see...\n\n      Akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and\n      cake into a chalk. There's no blood left to flow from\n      the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to\n      transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin\n      returning to MARBLE. CRACKS multiply, becoming fissures.\n      Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces, SMASHING on\n      the stone floor like porcelain.\n\n      A silent moment. The Ancient Ones look at each other,\n      astonished, as they realize they're still \"alive.\"\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             120.\n\n193   CONTINUED:    (7)                                             193\n\n                           KHAYMAN\n                      (whisper)\n                   We survived!\n\n      The Ancients let out relieved hisses.\n\n      But Lestat is only concerned about Jesse. He rushes to\n      her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the\n      floor and slices his wrist. He brings the open vein to\n      Jesse's mouth, but she's not moving. Lestat bends down\n      to her ear and whispers.\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   I left you one drop, my love.\n                   Drink deep and live.\n\n      Jesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the\n      blood. She begins to take the blood inside her and then\n      finally truly drink and revive as Lestat cradles her.\n      She pulls away, gasping. Lestat looks into her eyes.\n\n                           JESSE\n                   I thought I'd lost you...\n\n                           LESTAT\n                   Drink, my love.\n\n      Her lips move to his wrist.

Then Jesse turns, stares at Maharet. All\n      the Ancients turn, follow her gaze.\n\n      A whiteness is spreading across Maharet's face and skin.\n      Maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to\n      stone.

On Maharet's lips is the most content of\n      smiles. Jesse wipes away a tear.\n\n      Marius turns to Lestat.    Their eyes meet.
