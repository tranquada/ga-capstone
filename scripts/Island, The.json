Then more apartments, above and\n    below, the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks. It might be a\n    prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent. Indeed, the\n    residents move freely, all notably male, all clad in shearlings,\n    polo shirts and slacks. It is just another day in Sector Four.\n\n3   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n\n    Satie's Gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers. \n\n    A glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley. The plaza, \n    formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile, is divided into two service \n    areas.\n\n    Male residents in line on one side, females on the other. Both\n    genders combine in the seating area. Lincoln reaches the head of\n    the line. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner. A NUTRITION\n    CLERK, a surly woman in uniform, eyes the readout on her screen-\n\n                                    NUTRITION CLERK\n                     Lincoln Six-Echo... Options are dried\n                     fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                     What? No bacon?\n\n                                NUTRITION CLERK\n                     You got a sodium flag, pal - now\n                     what's it going to be?\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     Whatever.\n\n    He shrugs, disgruntled. The clerk taps her screen. Turning to a\n    row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a\n    drink can. Lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the\n    oatmeal and juice breakfast. Then he heads into the seating area.\n\n    In the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and\n    chatting happily. Uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping\n    tables. A divide in this community now starts to become clear...\n\n    The busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service,\n    maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct\n    uniforms but no facial marking. They are known as \"outsiders\".\n\n    The \"residents\", like Lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their\n    upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. Mostly Caucasian,\n    from mid-twenties to mid-sixties. There are no children here.\n\n    We isolate a blonde - mid-20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile\n    beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. Her\n    name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln, she smiles and waves-\n\n                                     ESTER\n                     Lincoln ! Over here!\n\n                                                             3.\n\n\n\nLincoln crosses, a little surprised to see her. Pleasantly so.\n\n                            LINCOLN\n              Hello , stranger.\n\n                           ESTER\n              What? You don't recognize me?\n\n                          LINCOLN\n              It's just an expression, that's all.\n\n                         ESTER\n              You and your expressions, Lincoln. Now\n              sit down and ask me where I've been.\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                     (sits , a spreading smile)\n              Okay, Ester. Where have you been?\n\n                               ESTER\n              At the medical center. Just for tests\n              but they had me on liquid nutrition.\n                     (forks a mouthful of eggs)\n\n              Mmmmm. This is the first solid food\n              I've had in a week.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n              Exciting.\n\n                            ESTER\n              That's not the exciting part. I got my\n              first trimester report: happy, healthy\n              and contaminant-free... Both of us.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n              Us?\n\n                        ESTER\n              My baby... It's in perfect condition.\n              I just hope I can keep it that way. I\n              still have six months to delivery.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n              Then you leave all this behind, huh?\n\n                          ESTER\n              Why? Will you miss me?\n\nHer eyes betray a flicker of something. It unsettles Lincoln.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n              I'll miss your coffee. C'mon, I\n              already burned up my quota.\n\n                                                                       4.\n\n\n\n                             ESTER\n                Okay. But this is the last time.\n\nIn a deliberate move, she drops her napkin on the floor. As she\nducks down to retrieve it, Lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee.\nRising again, Ester registers his souring look.\n\n                            ESTER\n                What is it?\n\nLincoln just nods across the plaza. Ambient conversation is now\nebbing at an arrival. An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical\nuniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes. He might be a prison\nwarden but for the generally warm reception. He is known as The\nCommunity Director. His name is MERRICK.\n\nHe crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a\nthree-forked pendant known as a \"tri-key\". He slots the tri-key\ninto the lectern. The glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o\na live feed of himself. Now amplified by the plaza speakers,\nMerrick begins his address-\n\n                            MERRICK\n                Good morning. To everyone here and\n                everyone watching on etherscreen,\n                welcome to the community address. Today\n                I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For\n                those of you here with sugar quotas, let\n                me recommend the french toast. I just\n                tried some and it's excellent, really.\n                But I know what everyone's hungry for\n                s o let's move on to the lottery. As\n                always the draw will be made from our\n                host sector. So tell me, Sector Four -\n                is everyone ready for The Daily Spin?\n\nApplause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents,\nwho take on the zeal of a game show audience. The older ones -\nincluding Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance.\nMerrick turns the tri-key i n the lectern. The glass wall\nswitches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text;\n\n- - DAILY SPIN!... GET READY TO WIN!... DAILY SPIN!--\n\n                           MERRICK\n                Let The Spin begin.\n\nTo a burst of cheers, he turns the tri-key another notch. The\nglass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot\nmachine. But instead of icons, it clicks through names, each\nseparated by a blank line - from \"Adams One-Alpha\" to \"Zucker\nThree - Charlie\" - scrolling the entire population of Sector Four.\n\n                                                                     5.\n\n\n\n    As the spin slows, a pent silence falls. Expectant eyes watch the\n    names click through the P's, the Q's, the R's, the S's and . . .\n    - - SPIN WIN!... STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA... SPIN-WIN!--\n\n                                     MERRICK\n                   Starkweather Two-Delta! Step up!\n\n    Cheers and applause as everyone looks for the lucky recipient.\n    The excitement abates as it becomes clear he's not among them.\n\n                                    MERRICK\n                   Well , Starkweather, if you're watching\n                   on etherscreen - your time has come, my\n                   friend! You're moving out to The Island!\n                          (another burst of cheers)\n                   And the rest of you, never lose hope;\n                   what do we know about The Daily Spin?\n\n                                   THE YOUNGER RESIDENTS\n                   Everyone gets to win!\n\n                              MERRICK\n                   An d tomorrow it could be you...\n\n    Merrick steps down and departs. The plaza reverts to its former\n    mood, dotted with murmurs of disappointment. Lincoln scowls.\n\n                                ESTER\n                   Don't worry. Your time will come.\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                   That's easy for you to say. Your time's\n                   guaranteed. All you have is six months.\n\n                              ESTER\n                   Six months of mood swings, sore back\n                   and swollen feet. Want to trade places?\n\n                                    LINCOLN\n                          (scowl lifting)\n                   Give me some more of your coffee.\n\n4   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n\n    The portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates, known as\n    an \"ethergate.\" Residents swipe their ethercuffs o v e r scanners,\n    the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order.\n\n                                                                      6.\n\n\n\n5   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n\n    The subway, formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile, is not\n    unlike our own. In place of escalators, moving walkways deliver\n    the residents onto the platform. Along the platform wall runs a\n    strip of mirrored panels, etherscreen reporting in banner crawl:\n\n    - - NEXT STOP... SECTOR 5 - SECTOR 6 - CENTERVILLE...\n    At the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence, where the\n    residents wait in a patient line, Lincoln among them. His focus\n    is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby.\n\n                            RESIDENT #1\n                   A stim unit says it hits the wall.\n\n                                RESIDENT #2\n                   Okay . But I get to set the can.\n\n    Resident #1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. Resident #2 ducks\n    under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. Or what\n    looks like a track. The struts lining the bed are not sleepers\n    but buffers of galvanized rubber. Nor are there any rails. The\n    relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the\n    buffers to run in twin parallel. Known as \"lode-poles,\" they now\n    start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.\n\n                                RESIDENT #1\n                   Hurry it up. The shuttle's coming.\n\n    Resident #2 regains the platform. We PUSH IN on the drink can,\n    balanced on a buffer. It starts rattling. Then suddenly shoots\n    upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall,\n    clattering into obscurity. Resident #1 whoops in victory.\n\n    A rush of air heralds the shuttle. It sails out of the tunnel,\n    floating three feet above the track. A hybrid of subway car and\n    nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on\n    a catamaran. It is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the\n    lode-poles, an invisible river known as a \"lode-stream\". The\n    shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. Its\n    gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence\n    lowers. Lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.\n\n6   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY\n\n    An avenue of cream colored buildings. Uniform in architecture,\n    rising five stories to meet a mirrored roof. Despite lighting\n    arrays, the absence of sky lends a chasmic quality . Lincoln\n    follows the flow of residents up the avenue. Building signs read:\n    \"Dept. Of Labor\", \"Dept. Of Health\", \"Dept. Of Sanitation\". He\n    splits off, turning into a building marked \"Dept. Of Population.\"\n\n                                                                            7.\n\n\n\n7   INT. OFFICES - DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION - DAY\n\n    Frosted glass workstations, notably circular rather than square.\n    Lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen,\n    divided into three sections, a formation known as a \"visor\".\n    Right-visor shows a polymorph in fractal cycle, like a permanent\n    screen saver. Mid-visor shows a tomograph of a residential block;\n    tiers of apartments shown as boxes, most in solid white, a few\n    blink red with the text label \"Vacancy\". Left-visor shows a list\n    of names and sociographic grading sheaded \"Residents Pending\".\n\n                                   LINCOLN (TO VISOR)\n                     Hudson Four-Alpha; profile reviewed.\n                     Match to vacancy; 171, Sector 5.\n                     Request clearance to populate.\n\n    - - PROCESSING . . . FOUR-ALPHA, HUDSON; POPULATION APPROVED\n\n    Left-visor, the name highlights then blinks out. Mid-visor, a\n    box labelled \"Vacancy\" turns from blinking red to solid white.\n\n                                 A VOICE (O.S.)\n                     Hey, you want to know something?\n\n    Lincoln looks up at a face grinning over the partition - mid\n    30's, jovial, tall and burly. His name is JONES THREE-BRAVO.\n\n                                JONES\n                     You know that guy who won the Spin in\n                     your sector?

A stim unit says you\n                   won't last three rounds.\n\n8   INT . BOXING RING - CENTERVILLE - EARLY EVENING\n\n    - C R A C K - The same face recoils from a punch. Jones shakes it off,\n    retreating, recovering. He resets his guard as Lincoln moves in.\n    Lincoln jabs at Jones' defenses, his blowing hitting harder than\n    we'd expect from his stature. Suddenly he breaks through with a\n    left hook. Jones staggers back. A strange ripple distorts his\n    face. Stranger still, his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor.\n\n    As the bout continues, we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed\n    a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring.\n    With Lincoln in FG, we now see another figure in the outer ring,\n    mirroring his moves, dressed identically but for the gloves which\n    are like gauntlets. The gauntlets are rigged to two armatures\n    which are, in turn, rigged to a gantry-like mechanism. It glides\n\n    noiselessly to and fro, shadowing the figure round the outer ring.\n    RACK FOCUS reveals the figure is also Lincoln . The real Lincoln,\n    in fact. The one in FG is a derivative hologram known as a \"proxy\".\n    As Lincoln fakes and jabs, the counter-weighted armatures drag\n    and recoil, duplicating the exertions of his proxy. Jones moves\n    more sluggishly, his proxy now ghostly, transparent. Now being\n    sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left\n    hook. Jones' proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist.\n\n                                                                     9.\n\n\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                   Whoooooo!\n\n    Lincoln proxy - and Lincoln - punch the air in victory.

STIM BAR - CENTERVILLE - EVENING\n\n    Rainbow light and swirling electronic music. The clientele are\n    all male residents. Round the walls, poster-sized etherscreens\n    display various dancing women, beckoning, text supers flashing:\n\n    - - NEW AT THE PLEASURE CENTER!... OR TRY A MYSTERY DATE!...\n    At the bar, Lincoln and Jones, freshly showered, each swipe their\n    ethercuffs over a scanner. A uniformed BARTENDER notes the readout-\n\n                                BARTENDER\n                   Jones Three-Bravo; you got five units.\n                   Your friend, he's got an alcohol flag.\n\n                             JONES\n                   So make it a beer and a Vita Cola.\n\n    The bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the\n    bar. Scoping for onlookers, Lincoln steals a gulp of Jones' beer.\n\n                              JONES\n                   You know, you're going to get yourself\n                   contaminated one of these days.\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                   Shut up, Jonesy.\n\n                              JONES\n                   So, you up for a rematch tomorrow?\n\n                            LINCOLN\n                   I can't.

Give me that beer back.\n\n     TWO CENSUS OFFICERS (\"CENSORS\") enter the bar; in wireless head-\n     sets and white uniforms, they seem at once clinical and military.\n     CENSOR 1 carries a tablet known as an \"etherboard\". CENSOR 2,\n     more imposing, carries a wide-muzzle rifle known as a \"stopgun\".\n     Their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm. As they\n     move up the bar, the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs\n     over the etherboard. Now reaching Jones, who swipes accordingly-\n\n                                  JONES\n                    What's going on, officer?\n\n                                  CENSOR 1\n                    Census check.\n\n     Censor1 checks the etherboard; a headshot of Jones spins in 3-D.\n     He offers it to Lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically-\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                    What happened?

As they move on, he grimaces at the taste.\n\n10   INT . SHUTTLE - IN TRANSIT - LATER\n\n     Lincoln stares out of the window. The red pulse of the lode poles\n     catches a glazed look in his eyes. His pupils, a little dilated.\n     His focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner:\n\n     - - G E T READY FOR THE DAILY SPIN!... TOMORROW IT COULD BE YOU...\n\n                                                                             11.\n\n\n\n11   INT. BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY\n\n     The horizon. The morning sun streams over the green mountains.\n     Lincoln lies sleeping, his head buried under the pillow. Off a\n     beeping sound, he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling:\n\n     - - ETHER CALL PENDING ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?\n\n                                   LINCOLN\n                       Accept.\n\n     The etherscreen resolves Ester's face, fresh and bright.\n\n                                       ESTER (ON ETHERSCREEN)\n                       Lincoln?

Lincoln gets out of bed with a smile.\n\n12   INT . RESIDENTIAL BLOCK - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n\n     Lincoln exits his apartment and heads up the walkway. We reveal\n     the walkway ends at another ethergate, governing residential\n     access. Lincoln swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner and a gate\n     swings open. He heads on, the gate hissing closed behind him.\n\n13   INT . NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n     Ravel's Pavane plays overhead. The plaza is emptying as residents\n     leave for work. Lincoln arrives at the service counter. He\n     swipes his ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin.\n\n                                   LINCOLN\n                       Just juice today.

I gotta serve the full meal.\n\n     Lincoln shrugs, his gaze wandering past her into the kitchens.\n     His grin fades as he spots TWO CENSORS talking to a busboy. Then\n     the view is lost as he's served an oatmeal and juice breakfast.\n\n                                                                        12.\n\n\n\n14   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n\n     Not so crowded at this hour. Halfway down the platform we see a\n     vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers. A\n     mouse-ish resident collects a bar from the trough. His name is\n     KLEINWORT NINE-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln approach, he preempts-\n\n                              KLEINWORT\n                   No, no, no. Use your own sugar quota.\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                   C'mon, Kleinwort...\n\n     He says this amicably enough but he's using his imposing presence\n     on the smaller man. Kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk.\n                             LINCOLN\n                   So what's up with the Censors, huh?\n\n                                  KLEINWORT\n                   They're conducting a census check. Or\n                   don't you watch the bulletins?\n\n                            LINCOLN\n                   I know what it is. I've just never\n                   seen them out in this sector before.\n\n                                     KLEINWORT\n                   Probably just tracking a glitch. A bad\n                   scanner or maybe an userware defect.\n                          (off Lincoln's puzzled look)\n                   Ethercuffs. They get damaged, you get\n                   a false read. Sometimes even a dropout.\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                   What are you saying? They lost someone?\n\n                                  KLEINWORT\n                   Someone just isn't showing up where\n                   they should be. What do you care?\n\n     A rush of air heralds the shuttle, curtailing the conversation.\n     Beneath his tousling hair, a frown plays on Lincoln's brow.\n\n15   INT . LINCOLN'S WORKSTATION - DEPT. OF POPULATION - DAY\n\n     Lincoln stares at the fractal on right-visor, at the intricate\n     paths of dysplasia. The glazed look has returned to his eyes,\n     his pupils, a little dilated. His stare narrows at an errant\n     thought. He shrugs it off. But the thought returns, persistent.\n     More to dispel than indulge it, Lincoln turns to mid-visor-\n\n                                                                       13.\n\n\n\n                              LINCOLN (TO VISOR)\n                Census File: Two-Delta, Starkweather.\n- - T W O - D E L T A , STARKWEATHER: 102, SECTOR 4 - DAY: -- / HR: --\n\n                                  LINCOLN (TO VISOR)\n                Accomodation Status : 102, Sector 4.\n\nThe tiered boxes resolve, zooming in to isolate Apartment 102.\nThe box shows solid white.

CONSTRUCTION ZONE - SECTOR SIX - DAY\n\n     An arc of blue light. A uniformed worker steers a plasma torch\n     over a conduit. In the fog of smoke, we see wires being spliced,\n     circuits, tested. Outsiders in hardhats, goggles and cup masks.\n     Lincoln comes over the crosswalk, starkly contrasted in dacron\n     coveralls and a hooded gasmask. THE CREW FOREMAN intercepts him -\n     drawn, desiccated features, a husky drawl. His name is MCCORD-\n\n                                      MCCORD\n                        Sorry, chief.

A light\n     starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss.\n\n18   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT\n\n     A deep steady thrum. Giant extractor fans churn above and below,\n     both directions seemingly limitless. The bleak concrete shaft is\n     streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. On one\n     such, we isolate Lincoln and McCord. B o t h smoking cigarettes.\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                    I t ' s too bad.\n                                MCCORD\n                    What do you mean?\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                    T h a t your shift's almost over.\n\n                                                                     16.\n\n\n\n                           MCCORD\n                You mean, these things? Well, these\n                things ain't good for you anyways.\n\n                            LINCOLN\n                The y taste good.\n\nAn exchanged smile. A pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure.\n\n                         LINCOLN\n                I like coming here. Talking. Most\n                outsiders don't like to talk.\n\n                              MCCORD\n                That's because we ain't supposed to.\n                They got rules about fraternization.\n\nLincoln nods. Another pause as they drag on their cigarettes.\n\n                            LINCOLN\n                What do you do when the shift's over?\n\n                            MCCORD\n                M o r e of the same. They cycle us onto\n                the disposal detail. Hump `n dump crew.\n\n                            LINCOLN\n                H u m p `n dump crew?\n\n                              MCCORD\n                D e b r i s clearance. We hump the heavy\n                stuff to a site on the outside.\n                          LINCOLN\n                Is it as bad as they say out there?\n\nM c C o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. Lincoln displays his gasmask.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n                The air... the containments.\n\n                           MCCORD\n                Right.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n                But not everywhere. Not on The Island.\n\n                              MCCORD\n                    ( b e a t , stubs his cigarette)\n                I don't know too much about that.\nLincoln eyes him narrowly. McCord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter\ninto the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile.\n\n                                                                       17.\n\n\n\n                                MCCORD\n                    He y , take it from me, you got a sweet\n                    deal right here. So why worry, huh?\n     Lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke.\n     We tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans.\n\n19   EXT . THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY\n     A i r blasts up from a giant tunnel.\n\n     W i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust,\n     backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. At the hub of the ring is\n     a large cubic building. From its facets, giant appendages of\n     ducting plunge into its surround. These are the inlets for the\n     processed air that feeds the underground...\n\n     This is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above.\n\n     F r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a\n     large industrial complex. More cubic buildings, cream colored,\n     windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. Now we see the\n     front of the complex. The planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the\n     entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye.\n\n     F r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the\n     ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway,\n     lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a \"lodeway\".\n     From the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red\n     rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. The gates\n     now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall-\n\n     The shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona Desert.\n     O u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a\n     vehicle emerges from the shimmer. A hybrid of bus and nautical\n     craft, single hulled, known simply as a \"liner\". Now as the\n     liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a\n     crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d \"The Sanger Institute\".\n20   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY\n\n     The polarized glass shows the liner has docked and A TOUR GROUP\n     is disembarking. The men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury.\n     The women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and\n     haute couture. They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted\n     by the courtesy staff. Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers\n     with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named LYDIA.\n\n                                  LYDIA\n                    L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia\n                    and on behalf of our staff, I'd like\n                    t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.\n\n                                                                          18.\n\n                                    LYDIA (cont'd)\n                    Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-\n                    i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center\n                    and circulating our standard discretion\n                    agreements. I should add that today you\n                    are all very lucky because our CEO and\n                    founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us\n                    and will be leading the tour personally.\n\n21   INT . INNER FOYER - LATER\n     The crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen. Not a real\n     screen but a projected flat known as a \"holoframe\". Here, Lydia\n     assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. The\n     holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins:\n     A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame --\n     a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a\n     mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain.\n     The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. Then-\n\n                                V O I C E (O.S.)\n                    I t ' s not a pretty sight, is it?\n     E y e s turn to a figure behind them, dressed in a vestmental w h i t e\n     labcoat - 70's, tall, slightly hunched by senility, eyes like\n     quicksilver, glittering. He has the hauteur of a visionary\n     stooping to the role of a salesman. His name is DR. HENRY SANGER.\n\n                                      DR. SANGER (cont'd)\n                    M o r t a l i t y . We all know its face and yet\n                    w e look away, don't we? We deny that our\n                    l i v e s are ordained to suffering. That\n                    w e are all, inalterably, going to die.\n\n     He pauses, fielding the various disconcerted looks. Then smiles.\n\n                                DR. SANGER\n                    I t takes courage to confront mortality,\n                    my friends. And I see it in each of\n                    y o u . My name is Dr. Henry Sanger and\n                    I'm here to reward your courage.\n     L y d i a applauds. The tour group dutifully follows suit. Sanger\n     whispers a question in Lydia's ear. She broadcasts her response-\n\n                                   LYDIA\n                    T o d a y ' s group is from New Gaza Health\n                    Care. They're with the platinum plan.\n\n                               DR. SANGER\n                    N e w Gaza. Yes, very good oncology unit.\n\n     M u l l i n g this, he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at\n     his passage. Rallied by Lydia the tour group follows him into--\n\n                                                                  19.\n\n\n\n22   INT. SALES HALL - DAY\n\n     A hall of windows, each window framing a display case, each\n     display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l . Not unlike\n     a museum. On closer inspection, more like a chamber of horrors.\n     I n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen. Another,\n     magnified, shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back. In\n     another, a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes.\n\n                               DR. SANGER\n                   I t doesn't get any prettier, does it?\n                   But this is not a freakshow, my friends.\n                   This is a war museum. A history of our\n                   battles with mortality... and defeats.\n                   Take the stem cell, for instance. A bid\n                   to cultivate human parts for transplant -\n                   in rodents, primates, barnyard animals.\n                   It's enough to make your skin crawl. In\n                   some cases literally, giving rise to a\n                   new range of cross-species viruses. But\n                   that's how we learn. From our mistakes.\n     The y turn a corner. Another hall of windows, portals onto tanks\n     of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde. Suspended within are\n     embryos, fetuses and infants. All human. All grotesquely mutated.\n\n                               DR. SANGER\n                   C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the\n                   beginning, the mapping of the human\n                   genome was declared a historic landmark-\n                   t o break the curse of heredity, to\n                   correct congenital defect... genetic\n                   engineering became the brave new world\n                   of medical science. A bright future\n                   that led to a dark age and much of the\n                   legislation we know today. But while\n                   the clone laws may have narrowed the\n                   field, science marches on. Only to hit\n                   the same wall over and over again - the\n                   enigma of growth, the alchemy that\n                   takes us from embryo to adult. A clone\n                   barely reaches infancy before its\n                   growth enzymes misfire, resulting in\n                   the kind of monstrosities - which are\n                   only effigies - you see here.\n\n     S o m e reassured sighs from the women. They turn another corner onto\n     another hall. A hall of mirrors. Simple, full-length mirrors.\n\n                            DR. SANGER\n                   So what do we learn from our mistakes?\n                   That human parts cannot grow outside a\n                   human body. That human bodies cannot\n                   grow outside nature's grand design.\n\n                                                                  20.\n\n\n\nA FAT MAN, supporting his bulk with a walking stick, grunts -\n\n                         T H E FAT MAN\n               S o what the hell are we doing here?\n\n                            DR. SANGER\n               L e t ' s say one day you go to your doctor\n               for a checkup. He discovers you have\n               imminent renal failure and require a\n               kidney transplant. What would you do?\n\n                           T H E FAT MAN\n               I wouldn't do nothing. My brother'd\n               g i v e me one of his. Or else.\n\n                           DR. SANGER\n               E v e n if your brother's kidney is with-\n               o u t defect, there's still a 38% chance\n               of rejection. Or less if he's your twin.\n\n                           T H E FAT MAN\n               He's not. He's older.\n\n                          DR. SANGER\n               But what if you did have a twin?\n\nO f f the fat man's confused look, Sanger smiles and gently coaxes\nhim to face a mirror. Their reflections stare back at them.\n\n                           DR. SANGER\n               What if you had a genetic double who'd\n               give you not just one of his kidneys,\n               but both? In fact, any organ or body\n               part you ever had cause to need?\n\n                            T H E FAT MAN\n               What ? You mean like a clone? I thought\n               you said all that stuff was a bust.\n\n                        DR. SANGER\n               I said the problem with a clone is it\n               doesn't survive infancy. The solution\n               is to find a different starting point.\n               Why sow the seed when you can create\n               the fruit? Or what we like to call...\n               an \"agnate\".\n\nL y d i a starts clapping., then s t o p s , realizing this wasn't a cue.\n\n                         DR. SANGER\n               An agnate is sequenced from a point on\n               the cellular timeclock. I t is spawned\n               post-maturate. It is `created' adult.\n\n                                                              21.\n\n\n\n                                DR. SANGER (cont'd)\n              O f course, its brain is still vestigial\n              s o for the first three years we keep it\n              i n suspension. During which time we use\n              d a t a impression to supply a template\n              f o r functionality - a process we call\n              \" f o u n d a t i o n \" .

You\n             can create this whatever... this walking\n             spare parts holder... but I gotta w a i t\n             five years to get hold of em?\n\n                        DR. SANGER\n             The spare parts, as you put it, need to\n             be tested for integrity. But as many of\n             our clients leave it till late in life\n             to take out the policy, we do offer the\n             option for early harvest. Given the\n             risks, however, a waiver is required.\n\n                       T H E FAT MAN\n             S o five years or no warranty?

If\n             you had to put a price on     your life,\n             your very survival - what     would it be?\n\nA deep lull as the group considers this. Sanger picks his moment.\n\n                         DR. SANGER\n             I t ' s a question your insurance company\n             has already answered. For them, the\n             agnate obviates costly and ineffective\n             treatment programs. Should you decide\n             t o take out our policy, not only will\n             they lower your existing premiums but\n             they'll also cover the production cost.\n\n                                                               22.\n\n\n\nThe incentive ripples across the faces. A troubled one speaks up-\n\n                          T O U R MEMBER\n              This \"agnate\"... what happens to it?\n              After our friend here gets his kidney.\n\n                            DR. SANGER\n              That's entirely his decision. Our role\n              is intermediary. We, as the insurance\n              provider, guarantee the condition and\n              availability of the agnate but all\n              other rights are retained. In legal\n              terms, the policy holder is defined as\n              a \"sponsor\".

At such time\n              and where feasible, the sponsor has\n              the option to extend sponsorship,\n              retaining the agnate for secondary\n              harvest or, shall we say, let the\n              policy expire.\n\n                             T O U R MEMBER\n              E x p i r e ?

Not as you and I know it, at least.\n              The associations of life and death are\n              no more applicable to an agnate than to\n              a cow in a field. It exists in a state\n              of limited consciousness - aware not of\n              life but of functionality. Imbued with\n              the knowledge to maintain its function\n              but without the capacity to question it.\n              And yet, in many ways, the end if the\n              most humane part of the process. The\n              agnate goes to harvest without any fore-\n              b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the\n              sleep from whence it came. Eternal or\n              otherwise. There is mortality for an\n              agnate. Just utility and redundancy.\n\n                        T O U R MEMBER\n              S o it doesn't know?

A fix for infertility?\n\n                         DR. SANGER\n              You mean the maternity plan? No.\n              N o t endemic infertility at least. As I\n              said, the law prohibits genetic\n              alteration so a defect endemic in a\n              sponsor will also be present in their\n              agnate. No, what the maternity plan\n              provides is a way round the risks and\n              rigors of childbirth. Under this plan,\n              an agnate becomes eligible for\n              pregnancy shortly after foundation. A\n              simple donation of sperm from the\n              father, then the agnate is fertilized\n              and brings your baby to term.\n\n                                                                      24.\n\n\n\n                                THE WASP\n                     An d then what?

SANGER\n                     The same rule applies. You can continue\n                     your sponsorship. Or not. And in this\n                     case, there's a natural window for\n                     compliance as the agnate is routinely\n                     sedated after delivery. As to whether\n                     it wakes up from that sleep, like I\n                     said, the choice is yours...\n\n                                      T H E WASP\n                            ( b e a t , a shrug)\n                     An y t h i n g to avoid stretch-marks, right?\n\n     The other tour members, some more guiltily than others, laugh.\n\n23   EXT .

The audience is mostly pregnant females\n     and older residents. As the lights dim, eyes turn to the stage.\n     Speakers bring up Handel's O m b r a M a i Fu. Then a glowing mist\n     rises, condensing into a huge sphere, like a seed. Known as a\n     \"holomorph\", it reacts sonically, germinating into stems and\n     branches and blossoms, growing and evolving with the music. The\n     diaspora i s as spellbinding as it is pacifying. It is beautiful.\n\n28   INT . FOYER - COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING\n\n     The music from within is like a warm beckoning hand. The foyer is\n     slightly vaulted to accommodate a statue. On a bench at its\n     f o o t , Ester sits alone, waiting patiently. As Lincoln enters,\n     s h e rises to greet him, smiling. He seems more sullen than\n     usual.\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                    S o r r y I'm late.\n\n                                ESTER\n                    I t ' s okay. I was waiting to tell you\n                    something anyway. Guess what?\n\n     Lincoln looks at her, unsettled by her flourishing smile.\n\n                              ESTER\n                    M y baby - I felt it move. And it's the\n                    weirdest feeling too. I can't explain\n                    it. It's like being more... more h e r e .\n     Lincoln returns a deadpan look. Ester's smile wavers a little.\n\n                                                                          30.\n\n\n\n                                ESTER\n                     I'm sorry. I'm all excited and we're\n                     supposed to be finding peace of mind.\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I have to cancel, Ester.\n\n     His voice is expressionless. Ester shrugs, refreshing her smile.\n\n                               ESTER\n                     S o I'll see you at breakfast tomorrow?\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I don't think so.\n     Ester ' s smile falls. Her eyes, reaching, trying to understand.\n\n                                ESTER\n                     Did I do something wrong, Lincoln?\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     No.\n\n     A small word but it comes heavily. Before Ester can ask another\n     question, Lincoln turns and leaves. His jaw, clenching with the\n     effort of self-containment. Ester watches him, not hurt, just a\n     little confused. We widen to encompass the height of the statue.\n     The likeness is idealized but unmistakably that of Dr. Sanger.\n\n29   INT . PLEASURE CENTER - NIGHT\n\n     B l u e light. Lincoln walks up a long corridor, carrying a sealed\n     plastic bag. Along the walls, poster-sized screens like those in\n     the bar, display images of women, gyrating, licking their lips.\n\n30   INT . PLEASURE CELL - NIGHT\n\n     The blue light sustains. To one side is a mirrored wall, known\n     as an \"etherwall\". It is currently pixellated t o display a grid\n     of women's faces, artificial consorts waiting to be selected.\n     Facing the etherwall i s a large aquarium-like tank, filled with\n     gelatinous blue liquid. This vessel is known as a \"sense tank\".\n\n     Lincoln sits at the rim, naked, wearing a full-head oxygen mask.\n     He couples it to a hose dangling from the ceiling. Then lowers\n     himself into the tank. On the inner facet, a touchlight k e y p a d\n     resolves. Lincoln taps some keys and the etherwall a c k n o w l e d g e s :\n\n     - - P L E A S U R E PARTNER SELECTED; PROGRAM COMMENCING...\n\n     Lincoln looks out at the etherwall. The faces blink off to leave\n     him staring at his reflection. Just one left, a pouting redhead,\n     who licks her lips in anticipation as the lights dim.\n\n                                                                       31.\n\n\n\n     A holographic mist now rises. First resolving a proxy of Lincoln,\n     naked, replicating his posture in the tank. Then the redhead is\n     conjured, her buxom nudity glimpsed through the swirling mist.\n     Lincoln proxy reaches out to stroke redhead proxy's breast. In\n     the tank, Lincoln's fingers caress only the gel, his fingertips\n     met by soft arcs of light - neurological charges, conducted by\n     the gel, creating the sense of touch. They are known as \"impulse\n     arcs\". Redhead proxy responds, dappling her lips across Lincoln\n     proxy's neck. In the tank, impulse arcs flicker across Lincoln's\n     throat, then down his chest, descending to more erogenous zones.\n     Lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes, yielding to the sensation.\n\n     The sensation engulfing him, Lincoln's brow starts to furrow. Not\n     with ecstasy. Something darker. His eyes open, his pupils fixed\n     in a black dilated stare. Resisting the artificiality, his face\n     forming a sneer, tightening until... he slams h i s palm into the\n     touchpad. The tank shakes. The proxies blink out. Lincoln stands\n     mirrored in the etherwall. His hand, pressed against the glass in\n     a posture of defiance. His reflection, warped and shuddering.\n\n31   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n     F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. Red light, pulsing to reveal\n     the shaft, lined by lode-poles, here in triangulated relay. The\n     polarity cradles a dark mass towards us. An elevator in descent.\n\n32   INT . DIRECTOR'S OFFICE\n\n     Merrick   is at his console, working late. Off a buzz, he taps a\n     button.   The door opens and an outsider enters - 40's, square set,\n     hollow,   remote eyes. His hair is damp and he wears post-decon\n     scrubs.   A USMC ring is visible on his finger. His name is SCHEER.\n\n                                    MERRICK\n                     K a r l . . . Welcome back.\n\n     S c h e e r pauses, his face twitching.

A\nproxy resolves over the console, quarter scale, spinning in 3D;\nmale, African American, bull neck. Data etches across thin air:\n\n- - P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER; FOUNDATION: II; GENERATION: DELTA;\n- - I N T E G R A T I O N DATE: 01/27/84 // CONTAINMENT REF: 102, SECTOR 4\n\n                           MERRICK\n                His name is Starkweather Two-Delta.

At\n                first we thought it was a system error.\n                Then we found this in a garbage chute.\n\nHe opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff. He hands it to\nScheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds.

But for\n               some reason, your men seem unable to\n               find him. It's your job to contain the\n               products. I'd like you to do it, okay?\n\n                        SCHEER\n               A little sensitive, aren't we?\n\n                           MERRICK\n               J u s t after Starkweather went missing,\n               his sponsor placed an order.

Lincoln sits rigidly hunched on his bed, still in\n     yesterday's clothes, sleepless. He is staring fixedly out of the\n     window, hungrily, as if inviting the outer darkness to come in.\n\n     His gaze lowers onto his jacket, slung across the bed. He digs\n     in the pocket. And pulls out the cigarette pack. For a moment he\n     considers it. Then slowly, purposefully, he opens it. He slips a\n     cigarette between his lips. And lights up. He leans back, taking\n     a slow drag. Exhaling, he watches the smoke rise. His gaze rests\n     on the etherscreen above, expectant. The cursor comes to life:\n\n     - - S C R E E N I N G . . .

He stops at the\n     ethergate, regarding it as if for the first time. Then he stubs\n     out his cigarette. And swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner.\n\n35   INT . THE ETHER GRID\n\n     A blue dot blinks in space. We widen to establish its locus on a\n     tomograph. Now building the boxes, the quadrants, the sectors.\n     Revealing a vast, fully dimensional hologram of containment. It\n     spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom.\n\n36   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM\n\n     O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, like a studio control booth.

NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - PREDAWN\n\n     The glass wall reprises the predawn glower. The plaza is empty\n     at this hour. But the service counters are staffed as breakfast\n     is being prepared. The clerk looks surprised to see Lincoln\n     arriving so early. He seems grim, latent, stiffly swiping his\n     ethercuff o v e r the scanner.

And flings i t across\n     the plaza. Then the juice can, trying to outdistance the bowl.\n     Finally, the tray, which rotors almost to the far side before\n     clattering into obscurity. Then he turns back to the clerk-\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                    P u t that on my fucking r e c o r d .\n\n38   INT . SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR\n\n     The latticed wall of ethergates. The rising beat of footfalls as\n     Lincoln approaches. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. The\n     gate slowly hisses open. Too slowly for Lincoln, who kicks it and\n     barges his way through, leaving the gate to shudder on its hinge.\n\n39   INT . SUBWAY PLATFORM\n\n     The walkways, unmoving. The platform, deserted. The echoing beat\n     of footfalls as Lincoln marches up to the vending machine. He\n     swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. A screen illuminates:\n\n                                                                36.\n\n\n\n--SUGAR QUOTA EXCEEDED; ACCESS DENIED\n\nLincoln glowers at the message. His jaw clenching, twitching with\nanger. Erupting, he lashes out, punching t h e machine. He winces\nas his knuckles crack. Then grabs the machine, trying to rip it\noff the wall. Pulling, straining, sneering with effort, until-\n\nHe lets go with a defeated gasp. Then kicks the machine in final\naffront. The machine resounds with a dull boom. For a moment, he\nstands there, chest heaving. Then suddenly traps his breath...\n\nThe r e , in the fading boom, a noise. Faint, rhythmic. Becoming\ndiscernible as THE SOUND OF A MAN SOBBING. Lincoln turns toward\nthe platform. Tracing the sound, he crosses to the safety fence.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               Hello?\n\nHis voice echoes to nothing. He leans over the fence and peers\nup the tunnel. There. In the fog of darkness, a figure. A figure\npaused, half-standing, like an animal on the brink of flight.\nThe figure seems to stare at him. Then pulls upright. Now moving\nforward and into the light. His face is African American, bull-\nn e c k e d , eyes wild and bloodshot. A stranger to Lincoln, we know\nhim as STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA. His voice is quivering, unhinged-\n\n                           STARKWEATHER\n               Please...\n\nLincoln stands, frozen by the sight of this dark, dishevelled\nresident.

Teetering, Lincoln props himself\n     against the wall. Then his focus resolves on the etherscreen and\n     his fractured reflection. He releases a deep, bewildered breath.\n     Then he notices his wrist. His ethercuff i s missing, his skin,\n     grazed red from abrasion.

EXTRACTOR SHAFT\n\n     The deep steady thrum of the extractor fans. We are TIGHT ON the\n     frame of an airlock. Hissing, it indents and opens. Lincoln steps\n     through, eyes black and uncanny. The tri-key g l i n t i n g , dangling\n     from his fingers. Scanning around, he fixes on a section of wall.\n     He wipes off some soot. Legible beneath is a number. Twenty. He\n     assimilates this. Then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft.\n\n50   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n     Looking up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,\n     rippling downward as an elevator descends from the surface.\n\n51   INT . OUTER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE\n\n     A tiled chamber. Draped off cubicles. The elevator doors slide\n     open. An outsider emerges, dressed in a flightsuit, emblazoned\n     \"Medical Courier\". He announces himself, seemingly to no one-\n\n                                      T H E COURIER\n                     Clearance code: NG-230-2DS.\n\n                                V O I C E ON SPEAKER\n                     New Gaza Healthcare. Okay, you're\n                     clear. Go ahead and get undressed.\n\n52   INT . DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER\n\n     The pressure door hisses, heaving open. The courier steps inside,\n     naked, covering his genitals, some goggles slung around his neck.\n     He takes position on two marked footpads and puts on the goggles-\n\n                              T H E COURIER\n                     I tell you, I hate this fucking r u n .

It's\n                     even more fun. Especially the colonics.\n\n     The lights blink out. A red glow rises. Twin planes of light\n     scrape across the courier, infra-red, searing his epidermis.\n\n53   INT . INNER THRESHOLD - LEVEL THREE\n\n     A chamber like the first. The inner pressure door hisses open.\n     The courier emerges, dripping wet from a decon s h o w e r . He goes\n     to a cubicle, grabbing a towel and dries himself off. Laid out\n     within are some scrubs. Beside them is A STEEL COOLER, inset\n     with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia.\n\n                                                                     45.\n\n\n\n54   INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE\n\n     The courier strolls up the corridor, now dressed in the scrubs\n     and carrying the cooler. He turns a corner and his footsteps\n     gradually fade out. A flat, sterile silence falls in his wake.\n\n     A metal squeal. A ventilation grid levers down from the ceiling.\n     A pause. Then a pair of feet drop through, legs, torso. Dropping\n     to the floor, Lincoln stands revealed. Sweaty, smeared black\n     with dust. For a moment he looks around to get his bearings.\n     Suddenly he freezes, hearing-\n\n                                  A VOICE (O.S.)\n                     C h e c k in at the nurse's station. Up\n                     the corridor, left, then first right.\n\n     The footsteps are now coming back. Lincoln spins round. He finds\n     a door. A lock panel. A moment of panic. Then he fumbles the tri-\n     k e y f r o m his pocket, hurriedly slotting it into the lock panel.\n\n55   INT . THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR - SECONDS LATER\n\n     Lincoln waits, ear to the door, listening as the footsteps pass\n     and fade out of earshot. Lincoln releases his breath in relief,\n     calming a little, then frowning as he registers another sound.\n\n     Very faint, rhythmic. He turns and looks around. The room is in\n     partial shadow. To one side is a row of seats, to the other, a\n     row of windows, covered by blinds, light creasing through. The\n     sound repeats. Muffled. But now unmistakably THE CRY OF A BABY.\n\n56   INT . HARVEST ROOM\n\n     A grid of bio-readouts, each square alive with graphs and digits.\n     The familiar baseline of a cardiograph. A lever-arm mounted with\n     an IV r e s e r v o i r , dangling tubes and wires onto the OR table.\n\n     We see A DOCTOR and A MIDWIFE, in whose arms A NEWBORN BABY\n     squirms and bawls. Lying on the table, we see THE MOTHER, her\n     feet up in stirrups, deeply flushed and puffing from exertion.\n     Marked by her crosshatch as an agnate, she has just given birth-\n\n                                THE AGNATE MOTHER\n                     May I hold her?\n\n                               THE DOCTOR\n                     We have to run a few tests on her first.\n                     In the meantime, I'm going to give you\n                     something to help you relax, okay?\n\n     Off his smile, the agnate mother nods, anxiously watching the\n     midwife wrap her baby in blanket. The doctor taps a button and\n     watches the IV reservoir misting with a pale colored fluid.\n\n                                                                              46.\n\n\n\n     The cardiograph marks the drop as the fast-acting sedative takes\n     effect. The agnate mother watches drowsily as the midwife takes\n     her baby from the room. Then the cry of the newborn is shut out.\n     J u s t the cardiograph now, the beeps evening out, the scart o f\n     peaks shallowing a s the agnate mother falls asleep. The doctor\n     taps a button. On the grid, the face of a DESK NURSE appears.\n\n                                 THE DOCTOR\n                        I'm incubating the baby for 24 hours\n                        prior to transport. But go ahead and\n                        contact the sponsor. Tell her she has\n                        a beautiful baby girl.\n\n     The nurse nods. The grid square goes blank. A pause. Then the\n     doctor taps another button. Text appears. Reading it, he cites-\n\n                                    THE DOCTOR\n                        Let the record show the sponsor has\n                        signed Clause 22 of The Basic Sponsor-\n                        s h i p Agreement. Initiate compliance.\n\n     A light starts blinking. The doctor walks stiffly out of the\n     room. The door hisses closed. The agnate mother is left alone.\n     Sleeping peacefully, blind to the fluid now seeping into her IV.\n     D e a f to the slowing beep of the cardiograph. The peaks of the\n     baseline falling. Spacing, fading, slowing, slowing, until...\n     The cardiograph flatlines. An d a sepulchral stillness falls. Our\n     angle widens with the growing emptiness. The lifelessness.\n\n57   INT . OBSERVATION ROOM\n\n     Lincoln looks down from above, eyes frozen in the slatted light.\n     His fingers are trembling, rattling the blinds against the glass.\n\n58   INT . CORRIDOR\n\n     Lincoln tumbles out of the door. He can't breathe, can't think,\n     his mind is in overload. He stumbles around like a wounded\n     animal. His focus suddenly and searingly r e t u r n s as he hears-\n\n                                          DESK NURSE (O.S.)\n                        Starkweather ? Like the football player?\n\n59   INT . NURSES STATION - LEVEL THREE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     A rotunda spoked by corridors. A console at its hub, manned by\n     the desk nurse we saw earlier. The courier stands over her-\n\n                                      THE COURIER\n                        That's right.

ANOTHER OPERATING ROOM\n\n     Another grid of readouts. Another cardiograph beeps. A spotlamp\n     illuminates the OR table and STARKWEATHER TWO-DELTA - his face,\n     slack with anesthesis, eyes rolling a little beneath the lids.\n     The rest of him under a sheet, cut out over the belly, the flesh\n     slit and parted by a clamp, framing a window into his innards.\n\n     Standing over him, mid-operation, A SURGEON and SURGICAL TECH.\n     Interrupted by a chime, the surgeon looks up at a screen, where\n     a panel flashes: \"PAGING\". He cradles his bloody gloves and\n     elbows a button. The face of the desk nurse resolves on screen-\n\n                               DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)\n                    The courier's here for pickup.\n\n                                THE SURGEON\n                    Well he's going to have to wait a while.\n                    It took forever to put this one under.\n\n                                SURGICAL TECH (O.S.)\n                    Doctor...\n\n                                DESK NURSE (ON SCREEN)\n                    He's asking for an ETA. Said something\n                    about some kind of storm moving in.\n\n                               THE SURGEON\n                    For Christ's sake, is that my fault?\n                    Just find a way to stall him, okay?\n\n                                S U R G I C A L TECH (O.S.)\n                    Doctor.\n\n                                SURGEON\n                    What is it?\n\n                                     SURGICAL TECH\n                    Subject's heart rate is spiking.\n\n                               SURGEON\n                    Not again. Boost the anaesthetic lev...\n\n     Suddenly he's sprayed with blood a s the clamp springs loose from\n     the stomach, clattering to the floor. He's frozen by shock as...\n\n                                                                               48.\n\n\n\n     Starkweather sits bolts upright. Dazed, he looks at the surgeon,\n     the tech, then down at his wide-open stomach. Instinctively, he\n     clutches it. Then, his mind assimilating the horror, he SCREAMS.\n     Now launching off the operating table, the lever-arm swinging\n     out, blindsiding t h e tech - tubes and wires snapping loose -\n     instruments flying - Starkweather lunges for the doorway - the\n     surgeon steps up to block him - only to be hurled aside...\n\n61   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL THREE\n\n     THE BLARE OF AN ALARM. Starkweather, clumping down the corridor,\n     clutching his open stomach, blood streaming down his legs. He's\n     delirious, running nowhere, anywhere, running blind. Reaching the\n     end of the corridor, he stops suddenly, seeing WHITE UNIFORMS.\n     He doubles back up the corridor. Kicking at doors with bare feet,\n     frantic for any means of escape. He spots a ventilator grid,\n     slightly open. He jumps, reaching for it. Once, twice, then his\n     feet slip from under him. He hits the floor with a damp splat.\n     TWO CENSORS turn the corner, ready for action. But there is\n     Starkweather, face-down in a starburst o f his own blood.\n\n                                    CENSOR (INTO HEADSET)\n                       Yeah, no sweat, subject is secured.\n\n62   INT . DUCTING - MINUTES LATER\n\n     POVCEILING VENTILATOR GRID. Looking down through the slits onto\n     Starkweather directly beneath. He now has a loose white hood over\n     his head. His wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs. A\n     loop of intestine plumps out from his belly. His weight is such\n     that the Censors have to drag him away, leaving a bloodsmear o n\n     the floor. His guttural whimpers are the only sign of life.\n\n     CLOSEUP: Lincoln's face in part shadow, looking down. The gleam\n     of his eyes as Starkweather disappears from view. Listening now,\n     to those feeble whimpers, growing fainter, ever fainter until\n     they disappear from earshot. Silence again. Emptiness. All that\n     remains of Starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor.\n\n                                                           SLOW FADE TO BLACK.\n\n63   INT . BEDROOM - DAWN\n\n     The horizon. The green mountains in different aspect, framed by\n     a different window. The bedroom is like Lincoln's but with a few\n     feminine touches. Ester, in her papery pajamas, sits brushing\n     her hair. With a chime, etherscreen scales over her reflection:\n     - - E T H E R C A L L P E N D I N G ; ACCEPT OR SEND TO MESSAGE BANK?--\n\n                                                                        49.\n\n\n\n                                  ESTER\n                    Accept.\n     The etherscreen resolves Lincoln's face, dishevelled, urgent-\n\n                                    LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)\n                    Ester . . .

Somebody\n                    said you'd been exposed.\n\n     Lincoln pauses to process this. Hunted, more cautious now-\n\n                             LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)\n                    I want you to meet me as soon as you\n                    can. But you can't tell anyone.\n\n                              ESTER\n                    Is it true? Were you contaminated?\n\n                               LINCOLN (ON ETHERSCREEN)\n                    You know where to come.\n\n     His face blinks out. Ester is left frowning at her reflection.\n\n64   INT . BEDROOM - LINCOLN'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n     Lincoln stares at his own mirror image. His eyes, fraught with\n     revelation. His clothes, begrimed with dirt and blood. He rests\n     his head against the etherscreen panel, shuddering, pressing his\n     eyes tightly closed. As if he could ever forget what he's seen.\n\n65   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY\n\n     The routine flow of residents up the avenue. Lincoln walks, head\n     bowed, trying to look inconspicuous. Showered, white shirt and\n     blue slacks under his shearling, he looks a little too scrubbed,\n     too clean. He spots a familiar figure up ahead. He catches up.\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                    Jonesy. . .\n\n     J o n e s lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity-\n\n                                                                           50.\n\n\n\n                                 JONES\n                     Hey, champ. Are you alright? I heard\n                     there was a contamination scare.\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I saw what happened to him.\n\n                                 JONES\n                     What are you talking about?\n\n                                       LINCOLN\n                     Starkweather . . .

The y took\n                     him upstairs and they cut him open.\n\n     Jones holds his gaze a moment, then shrugs off his grip.\n\n                                JONES\n                     You caught that fucking p a t h o g e n ,\n                     didn't you?

Then stops\n     dead in his tracks. Across the avenue, TWO CENSORS are on patrol\n     and his best friend is now heading towards them. With a barren,\n     torn grimace, Lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd.\n\n66   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - CENTERVILLE - LATER\n\n     R i n g s of empty seats round the empty stage. Ester enters warily,\n     walking up the aisle. Lincoln waits in the shadows. He checks to\n     see she hasn't been followed. Then steps forward. Ester recoils-\n\n                                      ESTER\n                     Please . . . don't come any closer.

Ester looks at\nhim, alarmed by his vehemence. Lincoln calms himself a little-\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n               Contaminants, pathogens... it's just\n               what they tell us to keep us inside.\n\n                           ESTER\n               What do you mean?\n\n                        LINCOLN\n               I saw it. Why they keep us here. To\n               use us. To take things from us.\n\n                             ESTER\n               You're not making sense.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               Your baby... they're going to take\n               your baby away... you understand?\n\n                         ESTER\n               M y baby? Why would they do that?\n\n                        LINCOLN\n               I don't know! But I saw it!\n\n                             ESTER\n               You're scaring me, Lincoln...\n               I want to go back now.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n               You can't go back! Don't you get it?\n                             A VOICE (O.S.)\n               N o b o d y move! Stay right where you are!\n\nA CENSOR steps through, stopgun l e v e l l e d . Ester freezes. Lincoln\nhovers, mind racing. The censor moves in, tightening aim on him.\nEster looks on anxiously as he approaches Lincoln. Lincoln now\nsees the censor pulling out some plastic cuffs. The same cuffs\nused on Starkweather, promising the same fate... TRIGGERING HIM--\n\nLINCOLN LUNGES AT THE CENSOR - ramming him - toppling him across\nthe seats - knocking the stopgun f r o m his grasp - recoiling as--\n\nTHE CENSOR RETALIATES - driving a knee into his groin, doubling\nhim over - then a knee to his head - THUDDING INTO HIS SKULL-\n\n                            ESTER\n               Don't hurt him!\n\n                                                                        52.\n\n\n\n     ESTER RUNS UP grabbing at the white uniform, trying to restrain\n     him - the censor swats her blindly - hitting her in the stomach--\n     LINCOLN SPINS ROUND at the sound of Ester's yelp - only to be\n     roundhoused b y the censor - the blow sending him to the floor--\n\n     Ester DOUBLED OVER - wincing at the pain - clutching her belly\n     instinctively, protectively - an ominous scowl knotting her face-\n     THE CENSOR PUNISHING LINCOLN - kicking him down the aisle - then\n     suddenly hearing a noise from behind - turning to face it as --\n\n     - B O O M - A GUNBLAST R I P S THE AIR. The brief wail of a hookhead.\n\n     - T H U D - THE CENSOR RECOILING - lurching as the hookhead b i t e s -\n     starting to gag - blood jetting from his neck - a hookhead\n     c l a w e d into his jugular - gurgling, collapsing to the floor--\n\n     Ester STANDING FROZEN - holding the stopgun - seeing Lincoln now\n     getting up - she drops the stopgun l i k e it's on fire, aghast-\n\n                                ESTER\n                     Lincoln?\n\n     L i k e she's asking him what she did... Silence - the rasp of the\n     censor, blood foaming - another sound - FOOTFALLS. Lincoln goes\n     to the door - an IMMINENT MASS OF WHITE UNIFORMS. He grabs Ester-\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     RUN!!!\n\n67   INT . FOYER - THE COMMUNITY CENTER\n\n     CENSORS BURSTING IN - led by Scheer, pushing through into the\n     main hall - the statue of Dr. Sanger looking serenely down--\n\n68   INT . MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - BEHIND THE COMMUNITY CENTER\n\n     A HISS OF DEPRESSURIZATION - a pressure door swings open - Lincoln\n     and Ester tumbling through - running up the maintenance corridor--\n\n69   INT . COMMUNITY CENTER - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     CENSORS FANNING OUT - sweeping the hall, stopguns r e a d y - Scheer\n     finds the fallen Censor - crouches to examine him, then-\n\n                                     SCHEER\n                     Somebody get someone down here!\n\n     A Censor splits off to join him, tapping his headset - Scheer\n     rises again - in his eyes, detachment yields to cold intensity--\n\n                                                                     53.\n\n\n\n70   INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS - CONTAINMENT INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n     THE CENSORS: flooding through into the maintenance corridor, in\n     their white uniforms, they seem like a swarm of antibodies--\n\n     LINCOLN AND ESTER: deeper in, at another pressure door, fumbling\n     the trikey i n t o the lock. A tense second. The lock hisses open--\n\n     SCHEER : pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door,\n     taking the lead, his Censors surging up in his wake --\n\n     LINCOLN AND ESTER: meeting an intersection, veering at random,\n     running blind, running deeper into the faceless labyrinth--\n\n     SCHEER : catching up, hitting the intersection, pausing to split\n     his squad in each direction - white uniforms dispersing--\n\n     LINCOLN AND ESTER: reaching another pressure door. Footsteps\n     audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits. The\n     seconds pass. But the door doesn't open. Lincoln looks around\n     for another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then--\n     THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS: not onto a corridor but an elevator\n     car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons.\n     His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press. So he punches all\n     of them, stabbing madly, trying to prompt the door to close.\n     SCHEER : turns a corner, seeing his quarry at the far end of the\n     corridor, he gathers pace. The elevator is closing but he doesn't\n     break stride. He deftly taps his headset, opening a channel to--\n\n                                     SCHEER (ON HEADSET)\n                    Ethercon! The elevator - override it!\n                    Do you read me? Bring it back down!\n\n71   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM\n\n     Ethercon is working the console keys like a madman. His gaze\n     flitting to a subgrid o f the complex, spinning the angles,\n     navigating the mesh of lines. His voice comes apologetically-\n\n                                  ETHERCON (INTO HEADSET)\n                    You're off the grid, sir. Give me a\n                    second. Can you tell me where you are?\n\n     He recoils at the blaring volume of the response.\n\n72   INT . CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR\n\n     Scheer stands with his Censors, poised, watching the panel chart\n     the elevator's descent. A light flashes and the doors open. They\n     level their stopguns o n . . . nothing. The elevator is empty.\n\n                                                                       54.\n\n\n\n                                      SCHEER (INTO HEADSET)\n                    Foundation Levels - all of them. Lock\n                    them down. Access only on my command.\n\n73   INT . FOUNDATION LEVEL\n\n     A dead acoustic. A corridor paved with sound proofing panels. It\n     ends at a pressure door, where Lincoln and Ester now arrive.\n     Lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end. No going\n     back. He slots the tri-key into the lock. The door hisses open.\n\n74   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS\n\n     Amber light. The sound of slow bubbling. Lincoln and Ester pause\n     to adjust to the gloom. They are in a hall of windows. Ester is\n     the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window.\n\n     Behind the glass is a foundation tank. Bubbling with viscous\n     fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. The\n     tubes connect to a form. A human form, an adult form but curled\n     foetally. I t is known as a \"nascent\". In this tank is a female\n     nascent, shifting slightly, causing Ester to gasp. The nascent\n     registers the noise, turning its head. Its eyelids are closed but\n     its eyeballs move, questioning. A slight furrow appears on its\n     crosshatched brow. Ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps\n     remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from.\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                    Ester ! Come on!\n\n     Spurred to action, Ester follows Lincoln onward up the hall.\n     Still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at\n     the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare.\n\n75   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBER\n\n     A STOPGUN n o s e s through the door. Followed by Scheer moving in\n     silence, honed. How much time has passed is unclear. He signals\n     his censors to split off. Tracking Scheer's advance, we INTERCUT:\n     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: Censors making their sweep. Strobes\n     of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks.\n     It angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then\n     fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow.\n     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: another contingent moves up another\n     row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables plugged\n     into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a posture\n     of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression.\n\n     RETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber.\n     No further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks.\n     He pauses, confused for a second. One of the censors comes up-\n\n                                                                    55.\n\n\n\n                                      CENSOR\n                      Nothing , sir. No sign.\n\n                                  SCHEER\n                      They can't have got past this level.\n\n     Scheer peels off his headset, giving full leash to his senses,\n     straining to concentrate. Seconds of pent silence. Then he hears\n     a faint humming. His gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator grid.\n\n76   INT . / EXT . THE FUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n     A POV LOOKING UP. The funnel mouth framing a vista of the world\n     outside. A hostile vista of black sky, maelstroms of sand. The\n     sound of blasting air, suborned to the giant howl of a DUSTSTORM.\n     A HAND. Reaching over the funnel lip as Lincoln pulls himself up\n     with a mighty effort. Blinking, blinded by the sand, he swings\n     astride the lip. Then he reaches down to pull Ester up. Ester\n     gains the lip and likewise swings astride, coughing, blinking.\n     T H E DUSTY EARTH as Lincoln leaps down to meet it. We track up as\n     he helps Ester down from the funnel. Her feet meeting the earth,\n     we are now in CU o n their faces. Gaping and blinking at the\n     prospect of the world outside. A world of darkness and storm.\n\n     SUDDEN BLINDING LIGHT as halogens explode the darkness. Lincoln\n     shields his eyes, scanning for their source. He spots a large\n     cubic building, banks of spotlights on the roof. He pulls Ester\n     away. Away from the lights and towards the safety of darkness.\n\n77   INT . EXTRACTOR SHAFT\n\n     T H E THRUM OF EXTRACTOR FANS. Scheer pacing on a catwalk. White\n     uniforms above and below, flashlights roving, sliced by the\n     blades of the extractor fans. From somewhere, comes a shout-\n\n                                  C E N S O R (O.S.)\n                      Sir ! We got em! Motion sensors just\n                      picked them up at the surface!\n\n78   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT\n\n     ANOTHER BURST OF HALOGENS. More spotlights engage, their blaze\n     flooding across the foreview, catching two figures; Lincoln and\n     Ester, running, now, veering sharply away from the light. Now\n     disappearing from sight, dropping into the trench of the lodeway.\n\n79   INT . MAINTENANCE ELEVATOR - CONTAINMENT\n\n     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES. The elevator crammed with\n     censors. Scheer at the front, staring ahead. He looks very\n     focused, bitterly so. The look of a man outwitted by lab rats.\n\n                                                                 56.\n\n\n\n80   EXT. THE LODEWAY - NIGHT\n\n     THE DARKNESS OF THE TRENCH. Lincoln and Ester running along the\n     lode-way, stumbling over the buffers. Above them, the dust\n     flails in lashing tongues, starkly depicted by the halogens.\n\n81   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - NIGHT\n\n     WHITE UNIFORMS IN THE NIGHT - censors spill forth into the\n     halogen light, splitting in all directions. Scheer suddenly\n     notices the corona of light from the front of the complex. He\n     barks something inaudible to his men, launching into a run.\n\n82   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT\n     THE GATEWAY LOOMING ABOVE. Beneath, Lincoln and Ester, on their\n     knees, clawing at the dust. Like burrowing animals, trying to\n     widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway.\n\n83   EXT . FRONT OF THE INSTITUTE - NIGHT\n     A LONE WHITE UNIFORM. As Scheer reaches the forecourt, stopping\n     to scan the spotlit view, the veils of the duststorm. His face\n     tightening with urgency. Suddenly he taps his headset, barking-\n\n                               S C H E E R (INTO HEADSET)\n                    The lodeway! Flood it! Light it up!\n\n84   EXT . THE GATEWAY - NIGHT\n\n     THE RISING HUM OF THE LODE-POLES barely audible over the storm.\n     Lincoln and Ester, washed by pulsing red light. Ester recoiling,\n     her arm flinging back from the pull. Lincoln grabbing her, his\n     own arm straining now. The polarity tugging their ethercuffs.\n\n85   EXT . THE LODEWAY - NIGHT\n\n     THE RED WASH OF LIGHT from the lodeway as Scheer races up the\n     edge, eyes trawling the trench for his quarry. His pace now\n     suddenly dropping, slowing to a halt. He doubles over, catching\n     his breath. More white uniforms now appear from the dust as the\n     Censors, unable to match his pace, finally catch up. The first\n     reaching him, Scheer pulls upright, bellowing over the wind-\n\n                               SCHEER\n                    G e t me a bird!\n\n                             CENSOR\n                    A bird?! In this storm?!\n\n                                SCHEER\n                    The y got out! They got past the gate!\n\n                                                                                  57.\n\n\n\n     Scheer spins on his heel back towards The Institute. The Censor\n     lingers, confused. Then he fixes on the lodeway. Floating past\n     in the red wash are the luminous blue seams of two ethercuffs.\n\n86   EXT . THE DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     The perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle-distance. Lincoln\n     and Ester scramble through the scrub, blinded by dust, driven by\n     momentum. As Ester starts lagging behind, Lincoln grabs her arm-\n\n                                      LINCOLN\n                        Ester ! We have to keep going!\n\n     But Ester resists him, breaking loose from his grasp. Lincoln\n     looks at her, uncomprehending. Until he sees her expression, the\n     harrowed stare in her eyes, the labored heaving of her chest.\n\n                                     LINCOLN\n                        Ester?\n\n     Ester staggers back, losing balance, reeling as if spun by the\n     storm. Her eyes widening, senses flooding. The howling wind, the\n     swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. Her reel\n     returning her to face Lincoln, Ester opens her mouth to speak.\n     But all that comes is A SCREAM. A scream from deep within, shrill\n     and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. Lincoln grabs\n     her and covers her mouth. Fighting to stifle her, rocking to her\n     convulsions. But Ester keeps screaming. A scream of everything.\n\n87   INT . BEDROOM - SOMEWHERE - LATE NIGHT\n\n     All is still. Just a muted shudder of wind on glass. The room is\n     in shadow. All we see is a canopied bed where a figure,\n     obscured, lies sleeping. The still is disrupted by a chime. The\n     figure stirs, fumbling at the nightstand. A holoframe resolves,\n     the light revealing Dr. Sanger, rumpled by sleep. He peers into\n     the holoframe to find the face of Merrick, gaunt with concern-\n\n                                        Merrick (ON HOLOFRAME)\n                        He n r y . . . There's been a breach.\n\n                                                                H A R D CUT TO BLACK.\n\n     SLOW FADE UP:\n88   EXT . THE RED ROCKS - DAWN\n\n     A horizon. A brim of dawn over the red rocks. The view is framed\n     by the mouth of a cave. Lincoln sleeps within, slumped against\n     the rock, his head bowed heavily. The touch of first light opens\n     his eyes. His brow creasing, as if waking from a bad dream into\n     a worse reality. He looks around only to find himself alone. He\n     gets up, a little shaky at first, then ventures out of the cave.\n\n                                                                     58.\n\n\n\n     He emerges onto a ledge, perhaps fifty feet up. He pauses, eyes\n     adjusting to the quality of light. He sees the storm has reduced\n     to a low wind, combing the floorland o f scrub. Now, across the\n     ledge, he sees Ester. Perched on an outcrop, hugging her knees,\n     watching the sunrise over the desert. He crosses and lowers to a\n     crouch beside her. Ester turns to him with a confused frown-\n\n                                 ESTER\n                    W h e r e did all the green go?\n     Lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes. He answers gently-\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                    The r e is no green. The windows in\n                    there... they were just pictures.\n\n     Ester absorbs this with difficulty. Lincoln rises again and\n     stands looking out across the desert, into the barren unknown.\n\n89   EXT . THE SKY OVER THE DESERT - MORNING\n\n     From the massive sky grows a glinting shape. Like a helicopter\n     but sleeker, aquiline. Without combustion, its only noise is the\n     sibilance of blades slicing air. It is known as a \"whisper\".\n\n90   INT . WHISPER - MORNING\n\n     The pilot jockeys with the thermals. Scheer rides shotgun. Now\n     in civvies, scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars. The\n     flight console beeps. He taps a keypad. A holoframe resolves:\n\n                                  CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)\n                    Ground team checking in.\n\n                                 SCHEER\n                    Anything?\n\n                               CENSOR (ON HOLOFRAME)\n                    The storm pretty much covered their\n                    tracks. We're scanning for thermals\n                    b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it\n                    is to isolate a heat signature. I don't\n                    know, sir, it's a big desert out there.\n\n91   EXT . CHASM - THE RED ROCKS - DAY\n\n     The desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow. Lincoln\n     trudges into view, Ester lagging behind. He stops to let her\n     catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. He allows her a\n     moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end.\n\n                                                                     59.\n\n\n\n     He surveys the terrain. His eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now\n     narrowing on an inconsistency. A faint strip where nothing seems\n     to grow. Tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. Then\n     drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust.\n\n     His fingers meet something hard. He sweeps off the dust to expose\n     a layer of concrete. Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line.\n     What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him.\n     Continuing, opening a window in the dust. Now his fingers snag\n     o n something. He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to\n     reveal a section of rusted chainlink. A corner of metal is\n     visible. Lincoln exposes the rest. A sign, barely legible: \"US\n     Government - Restricted Area\". He frowns, trying to assimilate.\n     Ester comes up to join him. Off her anxious look, he decides-\n\n                             LINCOLN\n                    I think I've found a path.\n\n92   EXT . THE GREEN MOUNTAINS - DAY\n\n     W h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine. A\n     whisper skims over the treecaps, circling in on a high shelf.\n     Here, remotely nestled in a clearing, stands a glass villa.\n\n93   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - DAY\n\n     The flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude.\n     The decor is minimalist with Native American accents, kokopelli\n     spirits in carved silhouette. Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall,\n     looking out across the green mountain valley. On the sofa sits\n     Merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. The air stirs\n     as a maid ushers in A WOMAN - 30's, all business, sharp blue\n     eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. Her name is ELLEN CROWNE.\n\n                                CROWNE\n                    Good morning, gentlemen.\n\n                                    SANGER\n                    Bernard, this is Ellen Crowne from our\n                    legal department. Ellen, this is\n                    Bernard Merrick, director of products.\n\n                                 MERRICK\n                    Thank you for coming out here.\n\n                                CROWNE\n                    Well when Henry called me I got the\n                    sense it wasn't for a social visit.\n\n     They settle at a table. A jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out.\n\n                             CROWNE\n                    I understand there was an incident?\n\n                                                                 60.\n\n\n\n                            MERRICK\n              First, let me stress there's no way we\n              could have anticipated what happened...\n\n                           CROWNE\n              We're on the same team, Mr. Merrick.\n              Just give me the facts down-and-dirty.\n\n                               MERRICK\n                     (uneasy, clears his throat)\n              We'v e lost two of our products. They\n              escaped containment last night.\n\nCrowne casts a troubled look at Sanger. Merrick quickly adds-\n\n                                Merrick (cont'd)\n               However, we have all available\n               resources dedicated to the search.\n\n                         CROWNE\n              How exactly did this happen?\n\n                           MERRICK\n              We'r e still piecing it together.\n\n                        CROWNE\n              Do we expect more products to escape?\n\n                           DR. SANGER\n              Don't be so alarmist, Ellen.\n\n                         CROWNE\n              I'm sorry, Henry, but you asked me\n              here to assess our liabilities.\n\n                        MERRICK\n              To answer your question, we condition\n              our products with a deterrent. A fear of\n              contamination. And thereby of the outer\n              environment. So to escape, they first\n              have to escape their conditioning.\n\nCrowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette.\n\n                                CROWNE\n              Containment is one of the terms of our\n              state health license. The fact it was\n              compromised could put us in violation.\n\n                       DR. SANGER\n              Bureaucracy.\n\n                                                  61.\n\n\n\n              CROWNE\nHenry , it was a bloody battle getting\nour license through in the first place.\n\n                DR. SANGER\nThey're not going to pull our license,\nEllen. We have a lot of friends on the\nCommission. Not to mention the goodwill\nwe earned in DC when we took over the\nfacility; a bunker complex for a bio-\nchemical war that never happened... We\nrelieved them of a costly embarrassment.\n\n           CROWNE\nI'm not sure we can rely on that.\n\n                DR. SANGER\nAlright . What do you suggest?\n\n              CROWNE\nFirst, I need you to level with me.\nWhat are our chances of finding them?\n\n             MERRICK\nWell, in our favor, they've never been\noutside containment. They'd have no\ncoordinates, no sense of direction.\n\n         CROWNE\nI don't see how that's in our favor.\n\n               MERRICK\nThey're in the middle of the desert.\nFood and water become an issue.\n\n          CROWNE\nSo they might return to the trough?\n\n            MERRICK\nPossibly.\n\n           CROWNE\nAnd if not? How long could they last?\n\n         MERRICK\nA few days maybe. But there is another\nvariable. We maintain the products in a\nsterile environment. So basically their\nimmune systems are untested. Toxins,\npathogens, environmentals t h e rest of\nus overcome routinely, to them...\n\n                                                               62.\n\n\n\n                             DR. SANGER\n               That's a little drastic. Some immune\n               systems are more adaptive than others.\n\n                            CROWNE\n               Let's take the drastic case. What then?\n\n                              MERRICK\n               Well . . . the male, we could cover. Fast-\n               track another generation before the\n               sponsor ever needed access. The female\n               comes under the maternity plan. She's\n               three months pregnant. Even if we fast-\n               tracked another generation, we couldn't\n               fast-track the pregnancy. We'd miss the\n               delivery date, the sponsor would wonder\n               why and there would be... difficulties.\n\nCrowne looks worried. Sanger pours a glass of icewater.\n\n                           DR. SANGER\n               Even so, the worst may not happen.\n\n                         CROWNE\n               We haven't even touched on the worst. If\n               these products reach a populated area,\n               there's the problem of scrutiny.\n                             DR. SANGER\n               Ellen , we operate under State license on\n               a lease from the Federal Government...\n\n                             CROWNE\n                    ( c u t s him off, harshly)\n               We slipped through a loophole in the\n               clone laws, Henry. And they only let\n               u s through because they smelt money.\n               And they gave us a government basement\n               to cover their own a s s e s not ours. It's\n               at the core of our license - why we\n               screen potential sponsors, why we make\n               them sign discretion agreements, why\n               containment is such a critical factor -\n               to limit the extent of public scrutiny.\n\n                             DR. SANGER\n               E i t h e r way, it's unlikely they'd get\n               that far. It's at least twenty miles to\n               the next settlement. Right, Bernard?\n\nMerrick hesitates before nodding his assent. Crowne pounces on it-\n\n                                                                    63.\n\n\n\n                                     CROWNE\n                    Something to add, Mr. Merrick?\n\n                                    MERRICK\n                    I just don't think we should under-\n                    estimate them. Especially the male.\n\n                               DR. SANGER\n                    And I don't think we should panic.\n\n     He cautions Merrick with a discreet look, then shakes a pill\n     from a bottle. Crowne looks forward to both men. Very serious.\n\n                                      CROWNE\n                    Gentlemen, whatever happens we need\n                    t o keep one thing clearly in mind. As\n                    far as the world at large goes, we are\n                    just another medical services company.\n                    Anything that alters that perception\n                    puts us at risk. And we cannot rely on\n                    the sanction of the law to protect us.\n                    Whenever and wherever and in whatever\n                    condition we recover these products, we\n                    have to stay beyond reproach. All it\n                    takes is one nudge to put us in the\n                    spotlight. Then you'll see how fast\n                    politicians can run for cover.\n\n     Merrick shifts, uneasy. Sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile-\n\n                              DR. SANGER\n                    I n other words we need to find them\n                    o r else. That's very astute, Ellen.\n\n94   EXT . DESERT HIGHWAY - SUNSET\n\n     The dust swirls and puffs across a highway of yesteryear. A dirt\n     track but for patches of exposed concrete and angles of buckled\n     lampposts. The empty path reaches to a blood-red sunset.\n\n95   EXT . SCRAPYARD - SUNSET\n\n     The dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap. Nestled in the\n     mountains is a shack. A sign creaks in the breeze \"Osmund D e e r ,\n     Licensed Salvage Merchant\". On the porch sits an old man in a\n     greasy ballcap a n d dungarees. This is the eponymous owner, OZZIE.\n\n     He's sitting on a lounger, surveying his empire, enjoying a beer\n     and a cigarette. Exhaling a drag of smoke, his eyes crease to a\n     squint. He sees something through the smoke, silhouetted against\n     the sunset. An approaching figure, wary, like a flighty animal.\n\n                                                                          64.\n\n\n\n                                OZZIE\n                    Hello?\n\n     The silhouetted figure doesn't answer, just stares back at him.\n\n                               OZZIE\n                    Can I help you?\n\n     This seems to get a response. The figure ventures closer. We\n     recognize Lincoln. Exhausted, dust-covered and dry-throated -\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                    My friend... she needs water.\n\n96   INT . BACK ROOM - THE SHACK - SUNSET\n\n     A mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past.\n     Lincoln lowers Ester onto a threadbare sofa. Ozzie, excited to\n     have visitors, bustles up with a water gallon, pouring a glass.\n     Lincoln takes it and tips it to Ester's lips. She coughs it out\n     at first. Then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor.\n     Ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors. Then\n     settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer. It lends the mood,\n     albeit strained, of a social visit. Lonely old Ozzie wanting to\n     make it so. Despite which, both men have an eye on each other.\n\n                               OZZIE\n                    Got stuck in that supercell, didya?\n\n     Lincoln eyes him, wary of the question. Ozzie reads confusion-\n\n                                     OZZIE\n                    Supercellstorm , that's what they call\n                    it on the news anyways. I n my day, we\n                    just called `em \"big ol' h o w l e r s \" .\n\n     Ozzie chuckles to himself. It seems to put his visitor at ease.\n\n                                OZZIE\n                    Yep, I heard it shut down some of the\n                    lodeways. Dust in the works, I guess.\n                    Where were you folks headed anyways?\n\n     Lincoln gulps down some water, deciding an answer. Then ventures-\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                    Away.\n\n                                 OZZIE\n                    A w a y ?

This is starting to feel like a real social visit.\n\n                               OZZIE\n                    N o w where's my manners gone? I'm Ozzie.\n                    Osmund r e a l l y . But folks call me Ozzie.\n\n     An awkward lull as Ozzie waits for his visitor to reciprocate.\n\n                                     OZZIE\n                    S o m e t i m e s I like to make a joke of it,\n                    my last name bein' D e e r . . . \"O. Deer\".\n\n     O z z i e chuckles but the pun seems lost on his visitor. He lets it\n     drop. The awkward silence returns. Lincoln drinks the water,\n     wondering if this strange old man is as harmless as he appears.\n\n                                OZZIE\n                    We l l now, looks like yer g i r l f r i e n d ' s\n                    made herself at home.\n\n     Lincoln looks at Ester, slumped over, asleep on the sofa. Ozzie\n     puts a finger to his lips, beckoning his visitor out of the room.\n\n97   EXT . SCRAPYARD - DUSK\n\n     The porch light comes on, casting the scrapyard in grades of\n     light and shadow. Ozzie steps out onto the porch, lighting a\n     cigarette. His visitor hovering at the threshold, he offers the\n     pack. Lincoln steps out and takes one. Ozzie lights it for him-\n\n                                    OZZIE\n                    Yer girlfriend sure is pretty.\n\n     His visitor looks at him curiously. Ozzie misinterprets that\n     he's said something out of turn. Time to change the subject-\n\n                              OZZIE\n                    So what's with them tattoos, huh?\n\n     He taps his forehead. Lincoln fingers his crosshatch, suddenly\n     aware of it now and suspicious of the question. Ozzie palliates-\n\n                                OZZIE\n                    Hey , in the eye of the beholder, right?\n                    Now this place, this is beautiful to\n                    me. This is my place. I own it. `May\n                    not look like much but you'd be\n                    surprised. C'mon, lemme show you...\n\n     Ozzie moseys into the scrapyard, beckoning his visitor. Lincoln\n     hesitates, then follows him, sensing it's better to play along.\n\n                                                                       66.\n\n\n\n                                    OZZIE\n                    M o s t a t h i s heavy stuff's industrial\n                    scrap.

I find the\n                    parts, she's as good as solid gold.\n\n     Ozzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile.\n     Steepled by rail tracks, we see elevator sheaves, tension cables.\n\n                                 OZZIE\n                    Now this here's got a colorful history.\n                    Came in from this ol' g o v e r n m e n t bunker\n                    out in the valley. `Got shut down way\n                    back. Then this new outfit took over,\n                    stripped the place out.

Nice fellas.\n\n     Lincoln frowns. The term is familiar. The taste of smoke, a hint.\n     But his memory has been clouded by trauma. Ozzie reads his face-\n\n                               OZZIE\n                    You okay there?\n\n     Lincoln looks at him, something breaking the clouds. A sense of\n     danger, indistinct. Suddenly cautious, he stubs his cigarette-\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                    I'm going to check on my friend.\n\n98   INT . FRONT ROOM - THE SHACK - DUSK\n\n     A front room turned into a front office. Piles of paper teeter\n     atop junk furniture. A bankers lap we might recognize from our\n     own era glows over a desk where Ozzie is rummaging, looking for\n     something. He stops to peer through and check on his visitors-\n\n                                                                   67.\n\n\n\nThe woman still lies asleep on the sofa. The man is sitting\nbeside her armchair, head bowed, seemingly plunged in thought.\nO z z i e resumes rummaging to find a crumpled delivery note. He\nreviews it for a moment. Then quickly clears away some more\npapers to uncover a keypad device. It is known as a \"holocom\".\nHe taps a key and a holoframe resolves. Then taps in some digits\nfrom the delivery note. The holoframe snows with static. Then a\ncrosshatch insignia appears, spinning in 3D:\n\n                              RECORDED VOICE (ON HOLOCOM)\n               Welcome to The Sanger Institute.

I wasn't doin nuthin .\n\nLincoln frowns, the sense of danger becoming more distinct.\nOzzie reads his visitor's troubled expression, realizing-\n\n                        OZZIE\n               I knew it... them clothes... them\n               weird tattoos... I mean, I heard\n               stories from those guys but I never...\n\nO f f his visitor's frown, Ozzie bites his tongue. He's cornered\nin this cramped space with a freak of science. Time to backpedal-\n\n                          OZZIE\n               N o t that I believe `em... buncha c r a z y\n               stories... nuthin t o do with you...\n\nHe chuckles feebly. But his visitor just stares back at him,\npupils dilated and dark, somehow inhuman. Time to wriggle out-\n\n                               OZZIE\n               W h a d d y a s a y we just forget about it,\n               huh? How about I go getcha a beer?\n\nHe makes a move past but his visitor doesn't budge. Lincoln\nsenses danger in this old man, whose fear is now manifest-\n\n                               OZZIE\n               What e v e r you want...

Ozzie quickly unlocks a cashbox. He grabs\n      some colored plastic cards and offers them like meat to a lion.\n\n                                 OZZIE\n                     I t ' s all I got...

An ominous moment, then-\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     \" O u t of state\" - how do I get there?\n\n      O f f Ozzie's cowering and confused look, we -\n                                                               C U T TO:\n\n99    EXT . SKY OVER THE DESERT - NIGHT\n\n      F r o m darkness grows a seed of light. The whisper flies low and\n      quiet, its spotlight roving the undulant desert. Now picking out\n      metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard. Now training its beam\n      on a figure in the dust whirl beneath. Ozzie, his hair flying\n      wild, gesticulating madly. The whisper follows his directions,\n      nosing onwards, its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks.\n\n100   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - NIGHT\n\n      I n the middle of nowhere, a canopied platform. Not unlike the sub-\n      w a y platform, it borders a deeply trenched lodeway. A wave of dust\n      rolls in, swelled by the whisper, landed beyond. It seems to bring\n      Scheer to the platform. He scans around for a clue, a footprint\n      perhaps. But somehow he already knows. He looks up the lodeway,\n      eyes honing. The deep black line stretches far into the night.\n\n101   INT . THE GLASS VILLA - NIGHT\n\n      Silence. Still. Sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea. Crowne\n      sits smoking. Stubs in the ashtray speak of long hours waiting.\n      The still is broken as Merrick emerges from an adjacent room.\n      Sanger and Crowne look up, expectant. Merrick closes the door\n      with slow care. Then he faces them, a grim tenor in his voice-\n\n                                   MERRICK\n                     Bad news.\n\n102   EXT . PHOENIX - NIGHT\n\n      The whisper slices the night, running lights blinking. We pan to\n      frame it against a skyline of black towers. A glittering row of\n      domes and spires, somehow celestial, touching the sky. The city\n      bears no trace of its origins, once built over Indian ruins, now\n      rebuilt, subsumed by urban overhaul. It has become a metropolis.\n\n                                                                        69.\n\n\n\n103   INT. ROOFTOP NIGHTCLUB - PHOENIX\n\n      A glass dome, faceted, insectile. A haut-monde h i v e . The movers\n      and shakers of the high-tech boomtown drinking, dancing. Shot\n      waitresses dose blue tequila. Bass music thuds like a heartbeat.\n      Scheer looks out of place here but the crowd's too self-absorbed\n      to care. He moves through them, invisibly, towards a corner booth.\n\n      TWO MEN IN SUITS sit with a bottle of blue tequila. The first is\n      bald, pale and dead-looking, he'd be the grim reaper but for his\n      fixed leer. The second is long-haired, bearded, hulking, more of\n      a grim ploughman. He has a metal brace screwed into his forearm.\n\n                                  SCHEER\n                     Which one of you is Diggs?\n\n                                   DIGGS (THE BALD MAN)\n                     That's me, slick.

He licks\nsome salt, downs a blue tequila shot and bites a slice of lime.\n\n                            DIGGS\n              What's the bond?\n\n                         SCHEER\n              The parties I represent want to limit\n              the specific details.

Then dips in his pocket for two\ndigital slides - Lincoln and Ester's headshots, spinning in 3D.\n\n                            DIGGS\n              What's up with these tattoos?

THE DESERT - MORNING\n\n      S u n l i g h t blinks off a chain of carriages, travelling the trench\n      of a lodeway. The overnight shuttle slits through the desert.\n\n105   INT . PASSENGER CAR - MORNING\n      The sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass. Lincoln stares out\n      of the window at the bleak new world blurring past. He's wearing\n      Ozzie's ballcap o v e r his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded\n      for some of the old man's ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise\n      or perhaps just to shed the memory. He glances across at Ester,\n      dressed likewise, her hair teased to cover her crosshatch. She's\n      dozing, head rested on the glass. A TICKET COLLECTOR comes up-\n\n                                                                        73.\n\n\n\n                               TICKET COLLECTOR\n                      Tickets...\n      Lincoln looks at the man in uniform, uncertain what he wants.

Do you have the money, sir?\n\n      Lincoln assimilates. Money. The word is familiar. He pulls out\n      the blue plastic card. The man in uniform looks encouraged. He\n      gives him the card, watching him slot it into a handheld device,\n      which briefly flashes, then the card is returned. Lincoln sees a\n      strip at the top is now transparent, like a depleted reservoir.\n      He assimilates. Not so different from the transactions in the\n      world below. Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at\n      him. Her bright eyes, dim and troubled, somehow accusatory.\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                      I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.\n\n                                ESTER\n                           (faint)\n                      Is it?\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                      We just need to get out of state.\n\n      Ester , disconsolate, looks out of the window. In her gaze, the\n      forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest. Lincoln watches\n      her, knowing her troubles and knowing that he cannot relieve them.\n\n106   EXT . PHOENIX - DAY\n\n      The skyline stands reprised in daylight. A glimmering citadel.\n\n107   EXT . SHUTTLE STOP - PHOENIX - DAY\n\n      P a s s e n g e r s climb the steps from an underground gloom. Lincoln and\n      Ester with them, jostled by the more certain flow. They cross the\n      portal onto the street and stop, dazzled by the sunlight. Only to\n      be dazzled again by the sudden, stunning prospect of the city...\n\n      F i r s t there's the quality of light, a burning white, perhaps from\n      depleted ozone, depicting everything in a surreal shimmer. Then\n      there's the towers, darkly crystalline, facets of polarized glass\n      rising to domes and spires, like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for\n      the sky. The traffic flashing past, the chassis identifiable as\n      trucks, taxis, compacts, sedans, streamlined in a nautical trim,\n      hull runners in place of wheels. The sound of claxons, more like\n      fog horns than car horns. Then there's the street itself, a six-\n      l a n e lodeway, lanes marked with buoys, bobbing around on cables.\n\n                                                                            74.\n\n\n\n      The graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections. The\n      citizens, strange hairstyles, fashions, all wearing sunglasses.\n      Even to us it's a wondrous sight. The urbanism, the grandeur, as\n      if here in the heart of southwest, Manhattan has met Venice.\n\n                                  V O I C E (O.S.)\n                      He y , man, spare a little green?\n\n      A w e interrupted, Lincoln and Ester look around. Slouched by the\n      street exit is A HOBO with a mangy dog. He grins toothlessly-\n\n                                   T H E HOBO\n                      A i n ' t eaten in two days, have we, boy?\n\n      Lincoln and Ester step back as the dog rises to greet them. Tail\n      wagging, it noses forward, sniffing. Then, abruptly, drops its\n      tail and backs off, whining. Lincoln and Ester likewise back off.\n      Both sides have just discovered a new species. The hobo pets his\n      whining canine, watching the strangers walk off with curiosity.\n\n108   EXT . STREET - DAY\n\n      The sunlight flares off passing vehicles, hypnotic. The faces of\n      pedestrians flash past. Lincoln and Ester wander in thrall up the\n      street. Everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them...\n\n      The storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. The\n      glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: \"Temps! Temps!\n      New Tech Opportunities!\" - \"Beauty Therapy! Manicures, Dermals,\n      Follicle Grafts!\" - \"Discount Legal Service! Class Actions Only!\"\n\n      H o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street, huge shimmering\n      panels like phantom jumbotrons, commercials playing on a loop:\n      - - A businessman in a conference room, shrinking from a fierce\n      negotiation; the scene replayed with the same businessman, now\n      on his feet, stabbing his finger angrily in the air; a pill\n      bottle in CU, a text super \"Combatrine! The Aggression Enhancer\"\n      - - A teenager bemused by his homework: his parents escorting him\n      into a clinic; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome; his\n      parents clapping; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma;\n      a text super \"Intellex: Data Impression For A New Generation\"\n\n      Lincoln suddenly looks round, realizing Ester is gone from his\n      side. He scans the sea of faces. Then spots her stepping through\n      a doorway. Over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings,\n      circled by the legend \"Hog Heaven! Home Of The True Hamburger\".\n\n109   INT . HOG HEAVEN - DAY\n\n      F a s t food outlets have evidently changed little. Promotional\n      posters in 3D: \"Ham Slam\", \"Porker Forkers\", \"Bacon Blitz\".\n\n                                                                     75.\n\n\n\n      Service counter, seating area. Ester is looking around like\n      Alice In Wonderland. Lincoln comes up, out of breath, edgy-\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I told you to stay with me.\n\n                                     ESTER\n                           ( i n n o c e n t , plaintive)\n                     I'm hungry.\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                     O k a y . Okay...\n\n      He nods, realizing he is too. He plants Ester in a seat and looks\n      around. People stand in line transacting, receiving food trays.\n      Not unlike nutrition plaza. Lincoln ventures to the counter. He\n      offers the blue card hopefully. THE SERVICE CLERK looks at him-\n\n                                T H E SERVICE CLERK\n                     A r e you gonna tell me what you want?\n\n                                      LINCOLN\n                            ( b e a t , no other reference)\n                     What are my options?\n\n                                  T H E SERVICE CLERK\n                     K n o c k yourself out, buddy.\n\n      He indicates a menu above. Lincoln assimilates, looking up at\n      the menu. Understanding now, his face lifts to almost a smile.\n      It's the first time he's been given an unrestricted choice.\n\n110   INT . SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n\n      Lincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink. She's\n      staring off again, distant. He puts a burger and drink cup in\n      front of her. She seems not to notice. He tries to engage her-\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I asked the man how to get to the\n                     terminal. He said it's not far.\n\n      But Ester just keeps staring, her brow now furrowing as A LITTLE\n      GIRL skips past, maybe 11, sipping a soda. Now Lincoln sees her\n      too and is transfixed. Now the little girl notices the strangers,\n      staring at her. She hurries onward, uncomfortable. Lincoln and\n      Ester's eyes follow. It's the first time they've seen a child.\n\n111   EXT . PHOENIX TERMINAL - DAY\n\n      A low rumble. A plume of smoke. A sudden eruption of fire. A bird\n      rises from the flames and a phoenix spreads its wings. Widening,\n      we reveal this is a holoform o v e r the terminal entrance.\n\n                                                                        76.\n\n\n\n      Union Station now looks more like Grand Central. A huge granite\n      facade, a covered colonnade linking to pedestrian bridges at the\n      corners. Here, in the flow of figures, we make out Lincoln and\n      Ester, resembling tourists. Then, a short distance behind, we\n      spot two more figures. The hobo and his timorous dog. Following.\n\n112   INT . CONCOURSE - TERMINAL - DAY\n\n      V a u l t e d . Arched windows, mosaiced i n polarized glass. Sunlight\n      falls in filtered shafts. Footfalls echo off polished granite.\n      Lincoln and Ester scan around. Ester looks daunted by the space.\n      Lincoln looks focused. He sees people in line, transacting.\n\n113   INT . TICKET WINDOW - DAY\n      The sign on the window reads \"Tickets\". Lincoln assimilates. The\n      word is familiar. He steps up to the counter with Ester. A TICKET\n      CLERK - female, immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy\n      smile. Lincoln offers her the blue card. She seems not to notice.\n\n                                    T H E TICKET CLERK\n                     We l c o m e to Phoenix Union Station. What\n                     is your date of travel, sir?\n\n      Lincoln has to think. Dates mean nothing to him. He ventures-\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     Now...\n\n                                T H E TICKET CLERK\n                     An d what is your destination?\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     O u t of state.\n\n                                T H E TICKET CLERK\n                     I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                     We want to go out of state.\n\n                                T H E TICKET CLERK\n                     I'm sorry.

The interceder is pale, bald,\n      wearing leathers. A stranger to them, we recognize him as DIGGS-\n\n                                       DIGGS\n                     H o l o s e r v e .

The sense of danger is welling-\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                      What do you want?\n\n                                  DIGGS\n                      J u s t wanted to help, that's all.\n      D i g g s shrugs, disarming, trying to win them over, nice and easy\n      per the mandate. Then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. The\n      pupils, black and dilating. Suddenly the male jerks away, like a\n      shying horse, drawing the female with him. Diggs, unperturbed,\n      makes no attempt to follow. Turning his back on them, he touches\n      a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two-way radio-\n\n                                     D I G G S (INTO RADIO)\n                      B u r d i e , it's them. East exit.\n\n114   EXT . TERMINAL - DAY\n\n      Lincoln and Ester emerge into the colonnade, rejoining the flow\n      of figures. Lincoln presses the pace, alert, darting looks back.\n      The pale man doesn't appear to be following. But the sense of\n      danger is spurring him to gain distance. Ester, vicarious to the\n      danger, stays close to Lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up.\n      Neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them,\n      kerbside. A commercial transit van known as a \"cutter\", it's a\n      common sight on the streets. The driver leans out of the window -\n      hair tied back, dressed in buckskins, we recognize BURDON-\n\n                                 BURDON\n                      You folks need a ride?\n\n      Lincoln and Ester turn to look. The dark giant is just another\n      stranger, cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry. He's offering an\n      opportunity to gain distance but Lincoln remains hesitant. The\n      sense of danger, turbulent, hard to read. Burdon sugars the way-\n\n                                     BURDON\n                      P r i v a t e cab. No state surcharge...\n\n      He taps a button and the side-door slips open. Lincoln looks into\n      the lightless c a v i t y , wavering, uncertain. Ester, hugging close,\n      nervous. Figures passing, jostling them toward the cavity. The\n      dark giant, looking on expectantly. The pause stretching, then-\n\n                                                                78.\n\n\n\n                           VOICE (O.S.)\n               He y !

They went inside!\n\nThe hobo doesn't see Lincoln and Ester, unwitting that he's just\nbetrayed himself as their shadow... and Burdon as their predator.\nHis dog starts barking. Lincoln starts backing away with Ester,\nhis eyes blackening, the danger surging, the dog barking, the\ngiant's face dropping, the elements converging... They bolt.\n\n                           BURDON\n               Shit!\n\nB U R D O N JAMS INTO REVERSE - but his pursuit is cut short by a\nparked vehicle - he swings a look back, jabbing his earpiece-\n\n                            B U R D O N (INTO RADIO)\n               N o r t h Corner!

Now\n      seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street, he\n      turns to his lumberous p a r t n e t , fury mixed with incredulity-\n\n                                 DIGGS\n                      Why the fuck d i d n ' t you go after them?!\n\n      B u r d o n just looks at him, displaying the metal brace on his fore-\n      a r m .

The alley is divided by a lodeway and the\n      walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters. Lincoln and Ester\n      run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk, forced into single file.\n\n      A huge shape looms ahead. A garbage vehicle known as a \"scow\".\n      Like a leviathan spreading its tentacles, the scow's tube-arrays\n      dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out.\n\n      Lincoln glances back to find Ester has stopped and is cringing\n      away from the tentacled monster. He returns to her, his eyes\n      flicking around, aware that their real predators are close-\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                      We have to keep going.\n\n      He takes Ester's hand, drawing her onward. But Ester recoils,\n      shaking off his grip. Now he looks at her more closely. She's\n      panting, shuddering, fraught with trauma. Her voice is haunted-\n\n                                                                            80.\n\n\n\n                                      ESTER\n                     P l e a s e . . .

Then looks back towards the\n      alley mouth. Her fingers reach for her belly, clawing a little.\n      Then her eyes lower, assimilating, reason reasserting its heavy\n      grip. Lincoln senses her turmoil. His voice is soft but sturdy-\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                     We have to keep going, Ester.\n\n      Ester looks up at him again. The forlorn air seems to have faded.\n      Her eyes, grimly set. Her face, a little haggard. Older somehow.\n      She takes Lincoln's hand and together they head off up the alley.\n\n116   EXT .

Burdon absorbs this, unflinched, thinking-\n\n                                                                       81.\n\n\n\n                                BURDON\n                      I t was blue, right?\n\n                                DIGGS\n                      What?\n\n                                  BURDON\n                      The y were using a blue currency card.\n\n118   EXT . STREET - DAY\n\n      Lincoln and Ester walk up the street. Wary of attention, they go\n      with the flow of figures, eyes peeled for predators. The sights\n      of the city now seem hostile. Faces flash past, dead-eyed in sun-\n      g l a s s e s . Traffic rushes like steel rapids. Storefronts construct\n      a black wall. Holoframe b i l l b o a r d s loom, mocking, half-noticed:\n\n      - - A woman in a bathroom, adjusting her sexy neglige; a crack in\n      the door shows a man in bed, waiting; the woman closes the door\n      and picks up what looks like a toothpaste tube; she arches her\n      eyebrow; \"F.I.G. F e m i n i n e Impulse Gel... Because who needs him?\"\n      - - A cemetery under a grim overcast sky; suddenly a frisbee flies\n      across frame; an old woman, dressed like a teenager, catches it;\n      she tosses it to an old man dressed likewise; a text super \"Death\n      Sucks!\", a sting, \"New Gaza Healthcare: Your Life Is Our Life.\"\n      Lincoln and Ester stop at the corner. They look around, blindly,\n      no coordinates, no frame of reference. Urban canyons, identical,\n      gordian a n d chasmic. P a s s i n g figures jostle. Then Lincoln spots\n      something across the street. It looks like an over-sized phone\n      booth. Its beacon flashes; \"C.I.N. - CITY INFORMATION NETWORK.\"\n\n119   INT . CIN BOOTH - DAY\n\n      A flourish of music greets Lincoln and Ester as they enter. The\n      fanfare conjures a holoform i n mid-air. A cartoon rattlesnake,\n      benignly rendered, welcomes them with a clownish, fanged smile:\n\n                                THE SNAKE\n                      H i there! I'm Tattletail!

Let's look at the menu!\n\n      A set of text frames appear: \"Residential Listings\", \"Business\n      Listings\", \"Transport Listings\", \"Hotel Listings\". Lincoln\n      assimilates. The terminologies are not unfamiliar.\n\n                                 THE SNAKE (CONT'D)\n                      N o w let's make a selection!\n\n                                                                     82.\n\n\n\n                                   LINCOLN\n                         ( b e a t , venturing)\n                     Transport...\n                                  THE SNAKE\n                     O k a y ! Let me open that directory for\n                     you! I'll be with you in two shakes!\n\n      The snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern.\n      Then a tomographic map of the city appears. A red dot plants\n      itself under a text flag \"You Are Here!\". Then other red dots\n      scatter across the map, each flagging with transportation icons.\n\n120   INT. CUTTER - STREETS - DRIVING - DAY\n\n      B u r d o n steers calmly, scanning the streets. Diggs impatiently\n      bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console. A holoframe\n      hovers, snowed with static. Then a secretary's face appears -\n      sagging, older, primped and painted young. Her name is JANEEN-\n\n                                  J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)\n                     D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.\n\n                                    DIGGS\n                     J a n e e n , where the fuck have you been?\n\n                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)\n                     B e a u t y therapy.

BUS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n      A surging sound. A surface of water. A burst of spray. A dolphin\n      leaps from the waves and hangs suspended. Text scrolls around:\n      \"Get Out Of State & Out Of Mind - Ride the Grey Dolphin Line!\"\n      This is the next incarnation of the greyhound. The blue facade,\n      crested into waves. We make out Lincoln and Ester, now looking\n      more like transients than tourists, dirty, worn and exhausted.\n\n                                                                      83.\n\n\n\n122   INT. CONCOURSE - BUS STATION\n\n      Low roof. Flat lighting. The faces here seem less threatening,\n      the young and the low-income. Lincoln and Ester look around. Not\n      unlike the train terminal. People standing in line, transacting.\n\n123   INT . TICKET WINDOW\n\n      Lincoln and Ester step up to the ticket window. A TICKET CLERK -\n      male, immaculately groomed - greets them with a polished smile.\n\n                                     T I C K E T CLERK\n                      We l c o m e to Grey Dolphin Bus Lines.\n                      What is your destination, please?\n\n      Lincoln squints at him. Then wafts his hand across the counter.\n      The ticket clerk flinches at the impact. Then composes himself.\n      A trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer-\n\n                                  T I C K E T CLERK\n                      I t ' s okay. Really.

It's perfect this time of year.\n\n      Lincoln nods, liking the sound of this. The ticket clerk smiles,\n      enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion, he ventures hopefully-\n\n                                        T I C K E T CLERK\n                      T r a v e l l i n g alone, are we?\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                      N o . With her.\n\n      He gestures, then realizes Ester is gone from his side again.\n\n                                                                     84.\n\n\n\n      He scans the faces. The clerk, disappointed, taps some keys.\n\n                                 T I C K E T COLLECTOR\n                      T w o adults, let me see... I'm afraid I\n                      can't get you seats till the morning.\n\n124   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - BUS STATION\n\n      A grill bar. A rank of vending machines. Ester moves through the\n      seating area as if drawn. Now over the ambient noise, we isolate\n      the cry of a baby. Ester is following the sound to its source.\n      She finds a Mexican woman shushing her infant. The woman looks\n      up and smiles. Ester just stands there, awe-struck. Lincoln now\n      comes up to reclaim her. He's about to ask why she wandered off\n      when she turns to him. He sees her eyes are brimming with tears.\n      Tears of joy and sorrow. It's the first time she's seen a baby.\n\n125   EXT . STREET - DUSK\n\n      The winged pig flutters over the doors of \"Hog Heaven\". The\n      milling customers are suddenly parted by Diggs, bursting out\n      through the doors. He leaps into the grey cutter, parked\n      kerbside. I t peels out with a flash of its halogen eyes.\n\n126   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - DUSK\n\n      B u r d o n steers, glancing inquisitively at his partner. Diggs taps\n      the holocom, urgently, galvanized. The holoframe resolves snowed\n      with static. Janeen's face appears. Less primped, disgruntled-\n\n                                   J A N E E N (ON HOLOCOM)\n                      D i g g s & Burdon Bond Agency.\n\n                                DIGGS\n                      We got a positive on the serial number.\n                      Punch in and pull up the transactions.\n                      Start with the last hour and work back.\n\n                                    JANEEN\n                      G r e a t . So I got to park my ass in\n                      front of a screen all night?\n\n                                  DIGGS\n                      I t ' s a platinum bond, Janeen. We get\n                      this, I'll buy you a new ass, okay?\n\n      He grins at Burdon. The thrill of the chase glows in his eyes.\n\n127   INT . WAITING AREA - BUS STATION - NIGHT\n\n      A blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot. More like\n      a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks. \"Liners\" slot\n      in and out, their nautical trim making them seem like ferries.\n\n                                                                    85.\n\n\n\n      Lincoln and Ester sit waiting. Lincoln, rigid, watchful. Ester,\n      gazing across at the Mexican woman, who as the infant cradled\n      asleep. Ester glances wistfully at Lincoln. Then she frowns-\n\n                                      ESTER\n                      Lincoln , what is that? On your face?\n\n      Lincoln turns, touching his face. He feels stubble there. For\n      the first time. His body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural\n      to him. Ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek.\n      Lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. But\n      her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. Their eyes\n      slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. Then\n      Ester's face contorts slightly. She emits a shallow cough.\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                      A r e you alright?\n\n      Ester clears her throat. But another cough follows.\n\n                                ESTER\n                      M y throat... it feels dry...\n\n                                     LINCOLN\n                      O k a y . . . I'll get you some water.\n\n128   INT . FOOD SERVICE AREA - NIGHT\n\n      E m p t y . The grill bar is closed. Only the vending machines are\n      active. Lincoln considers them. Not unlike those he used to\n      know. He finds one that offers water bottles. The sign reads\n      \"Arctic Melt\". He pulls out his blue card and looks for the\n      slot. Then pauses, picking up his reflection in the glass. He\n      examines the shadowy growth on his face. Then he notices his\n      eyes. They seem to be darkening. The pupils, welling open. Then\n      he feels it. The sense of danger, surging up like a geyser.\n\n129   INT . DEPARTURE AREA\n\n      Ester sits waiting, anxious now, coughing persistently. Hearing\n      footfalls, she looks round. But the face that greets her is not\n      Lincoln. It's the pale man, the one who chased them. Before she\n      can react, he forcefully pulls her upright, tapping his earpiece-\n\n                                   D I G G S (ON RADIO)\n                      P i e c e of cake, Burdie.

Diggs confronts the spectators, flashing a badge -\n\n                                  DIGGS\n                      Bond recovery... state license.\n\n                                                                      86.\n\n\n\n      He marches his female quarry towards the exit.

BACKSTREET - NIGHT\n\n      S I R E N S WAILING IN THE DISTANCE. Lincoln and Ester race down the\n      sidewalk, along a construction hoarding. Ester slows, doubling\n      over, rasping. Lincoln looks at her, her l i p s , blue, her face,\n      pale. The sirens, getting louder. He sees a gap in the hoarding-\n\n135   EXT . ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT\n\n      Lincoln and Ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract.\n      A once public park, now a construction site. Mounds and craters\n      of earth. Dim shapes of huge vehicles, like sleeping dragons.\n      Patches of parkland, as yet untouched. Bowed palms, dead grass,\n      a stagnant lagoon, a dull mirror for the ascendant moon. On its\n      shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse.\n\n136   INT . BOATHOUSE - ENCANTO PARK - NIGHT\n\n      The refuge of shadow. The collapsed   roof allowing streams and\n      puddles of moonlight. Lincoln helps     Ester onto a rotted bench.\n      She slumps down, exhausted, Lincoln     watches her, helplessly.\n      She's fighting for breath, wheezing     and coughing in deep rasps.\n\n                              ESTER\n                     I can't... I can't breathe... my\n                     throat... it's so... dry...\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     I ' l l find you some water.\n\n      He looks around blindly. Some junk in the corner. He rummages,\n      finds a rusted metal box. Pries it open, empties the contents.\n      Gauzes, band-aids - evidently a first-aid box - then a bottle.\n      He opens it, sniffs. It smells pungent. Alcohol, not water.\n      Ester suddenly starts sobbing. Lincoln returns to her side-\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     I t ' s going to be okay, Ester.\n\n                                                                90.\n\n\n\n                            ESTER\n               N o . . . no, it isn't...\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               I ' l l find you some water, okay?\n\nEster looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes-\n\n                          ESTER\n               An d then what, Lincoln?\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               I ' l l find another way. Out of state.\n\n                          ESTER\n               An d then what? What if they find us?\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               The n we'll keep going.\n\n                        ESTER\n               I can't... I can't run anymore...\n\nEster folds over, sobbing and coughing at the same time. Pitiful\nto watch. Lincoln crouches, gaining her eyeline, very deliberate-\n\n                            LINCOLN\n               We ' l l keep going till we get there.\n\nEster traps a sob, reading his eyes, something reviving in her-\n\n                          ESTER\n               The Island... You mean, The Island?\n\nLincoln answers with a brief smile. If this will keep her going\nthen the truth is redundant. He eases her out of the moment-\n\n                          LINCOLN\n               N o w I'm going to get some water. But I\n               want you to stay here. It'll be safer.\n\nEster wipes away her tears, sniffing. Her breaths, calming.\n\n                            ESTER\n               Don't go yet. Stay with me, Lincoln.\n               Stay with me for a little while.\n\nLincoln looks puzzled by Ester's request. Even more puzzled as\nshe rests her head on his shoulder, nestling into his neck. He\nfeels her against him. The warmth spreading through him again.\nHis arm reaching, as if of its own accord, closing around her.\nI t feels right somehow. And there he stays, holding her, looking\nout across the dereliction. And the moon rises over Encanto P a r k .\n\n                                                                      91.\n\n\n\n137   EXT. METRO PD STATION - NIGHT\n\n      The holoform l o g o of The Metro PD glows over the threshold.\n      Diggs exits with a dark glower. The cutter is waiting kerbside.\n\n138   INT . CUTTER - DRIVING - NIGHT\n\n      Diggs climbs in an Burdon steers out into traffic. The thrill\n      o f the chase is gone from them now. Both seem equally grim and\n      determined. Diggs taps the holocom. A holoframe resolves, snows\n      with static. Then Janeen's face appears, dishevelled, bitter-\n\n                                 JANEEN (ON HOLOCOM)\n                     What the fuck do you want now?\n\n                                     DIGGS\n                            (very calm, very cold)\n                     Punch into the currency stream, close\n                     the net on downtown and keep the search\n                     active. The next time they use the card,\n                     I want to be right on top of them...\n\n      O f f his icy tone, Janeen nods without retort. Diggs hits a key\n      and her face blinks out. And the cutter prowls into the night.\n\n139   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT\n\n      The winged pig flutters over the doors of \"Hog Heaven\". Another\n      franchise on a more downtrodden street. Lincoln emerges with a\n      bag of food and drink. He considers the blue card. The reservoir,\n      now close to the bottom, his resources almost exhausted. With a\n      look of foreboding, he pockets the card and turns the corner.\n      An d suddenly stops in his tracks. But it's not a vehicle that he\n      sees. Or a predator. His eyes are fixed on a holoframe billboard:\n\n      - - A football player in montage; pummeling into a defensive line;\n      running for a touchdown; gyrating in the endzone; spinning in an\n      NFL podium shot, super; \"Nobody Stops The Juggernaut!\"; a team\n      logo, super; \"Come See The Phoenix Admirals! Rulers of the AFC!\"\n      Lincoln recognizes the player's face but it's not possible. He\n      waits for the loop to restart. There it is again. The face of\n      Starkweather Two-Delta. Incredulous, he stops a pedestrian-\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     The man, the man up there. Who is he?\n\n                                 PEDESTRIAN\n                     What planet `you been living on?\n                     That's the Juggernaut, brother.\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     The juggernaut...\n\n                                                                          92.\n\n\n\n                                     PEDESTRIAN\n                     Jamil \"The Juggernaut\" Starkweather -\n                     highest rushing total in the league.\n                     `Least till that injury blew out his\n                     gut. Now the doctors are saying he'll\n                     be back on his feet next season. Those\n                     fuckers sure can work miracles, huh?\n\n      Lincoln doesn't respond. The pedestrian shrugs and heads on,\n      writing him off. Lincoln lingers, staring up at the billboard.\n\n140   INT . CIN BOOTH - NIGHT\n\n      The flourish of music greets Lincoln as he enters. The cartoon\n      rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish, fanged smile:\n\n                               THE SNAKE\n                     Hi there! I'm Tattletail!

Let's look at the menu!\n\n      The set of text frames appears: \"Residential Listings\", \"Business\n      Listings\", \"Transport Listings\", \"Hotel Listings\".\n\n                                THE SNAKE\n                     N o w let's make a selection!\n\n      A heavy pause. Lincoln's voice comes with a slight tremor.\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     Residential...\n\n                                   THE SNAKE\n                     Please give me the name.\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     Starkweather...\n\n                                  THE SNAKE\n                     Okay!

Then a headshot a p p e a r s with the\n      face of Jamil Starkweather , scaled across with a red line.\n\n                                       THE SNAKE\n                     Starkweather , Jamil... I'm sorry! This\n                     listing is blocked from the directory!\n\n      Lincoln stands, darkly intent on the face. Now irrefutably the\n      same face he saw in his life below. The snake shakes its rattle-\n\n                                                                           93.\n\n\n\n                                THE SNAKE\n                     You want me to find another listing?\n      Lincoln looks at the snake, flicking its tongue, coiling.\n\n                                                             F A D E TO BLACK.\n\n141   EXT . DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING\n\n      A downtrodden neighborhood. The buildings look like remnants from\n      our own era. A scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront. He\n      slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up, squealing.\n      We widen to a vehicle parked kerbside. A familiar grey cutter.\n\n142   INT . STORE - MORNING\n\n      L i g h t s flicker on to disclose a gunshop. The array of firearms\n      a s fathomless as their purpose. The scruffy gunshop o w n e r slouches\n      inside. Diggs and Burdon enter on his heels. He yawns at them-\n\n                               G U N S H O P OWNER\n                     We ain't open for another hour.\n\n                                  DIGGS\n                     Y e a h , well we ain't in the market.\n\n                                       G U N S H O P OWNER\n                     E v e r y o n e ' s in the market, pal.

Lincoln\n      approaches the entrance with Ester. We now see he has a band-aid\n      covering his crosshatch. He takes Ester briefly aside, teasing\n      some tresses over hers. As she gently smooths down her hair,\n      Ester catches his eye. A look flickers between them. Then-\n\n                                  D O O R M A N (O.S.)\n                     Fancy dress, was it, sir?\n\n      A DOORMAN is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club\n      he wouldn't be seen dead in. Off their flustered looks, he gives\n      an apologetic smile. Then opens the door and holds it for them.\n      Lincoln reaches for Ester's hand. Then stiffly leads her inside.\n\n144   INT . CORRIDOR - AN UPPER FLOOR - DAY\n\n      The doors are set with small glowing orbs at peephole level. Like\n      eyeballs, watching, as Lincoln and Ester proceed up the corridor.\n      They stop at a door. Lincoln checks the number. Pauses heavily.\n      Then looks for some type of doorbell. As his eyes cross the orb,\n      it seems to blink. Then comes a sound of disengaging locks. Then\n      the door swings open. Lincoln flinches, taken by surprise. Then\n      frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door.\n\n145   INT . APARTMENT - DAY\n\n      Lincoln enters, wary, scanning around. A living room. Framed\n      pictures. A sofa, chairs. A coffee table, empty bottles,\n      cigarette packs, a full ashtray. A bureau, some paperwork.\n      Silence, stillness. No sign of life, no sense of danger. Lincoln\n      moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the\n      papers. Ester ventures in through the door, curious-\n\n                                 ESTER\n                     What are you looking for?\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I don't know. Something. Just wait\n                     there and make sure nobody's coming.\n\n                                                                    95.\n\n\n\nAs he leafs the papers, Ester waits dutifully by the door. Her\neyes wander across the framed pictures. Then narrow onto a 3D\np h o t o g r a p h . A college boxing team photo, grinning cup winners.\n\n                            ESTER\n                L o o k at this...\n\nLincoln returns to her. Ester points to the photo. A face in the\nrow, blurred but eerily familiar. Lincoln seems not to react.\nEster, curiosity piqued, scans the other pictures. She alights\non a framed certificate - \"Thomas R. Lincoln, Attorney-at-Law\".\n\n                            A MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                What the hell are you doing?\n\nLincoln turns to confront A MAN in a robe. Disheveled from sleep,\ngrey from a hangover... the man's face is unmistakably his own.\nThis is TOM LINCOLN, sponsor of Lincoln Six-Echo, his bleary\neyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate-\n\n                           TOM\n                Oh, Jesus...\n\nLincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned\nby the sight of his double in the flesh. Sponsor and agnate stand\nfrozen. The only movement is Ester, her eyes flicking between\nthe same men, fraught, confused. Lincoln breaks the silence-\n\n                           LINCOLN\n                Who are you?\n\nLincoln steps closer, eyes piercing. Tom takes a step back.\n\n                            TOM\n                The y said... I'd never have to see you.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n                Who?\nLincoln takes another step closer. Tom takes another step back.\n\n                           TOM\n                The people...\n\n                            LINCOLN\n                What people?\n\nLincoln takes another step closer. Tom stiffens, gathers himself-\n\n                             TOM\n                Look, if you don't get out of here\n                right now, I'm calling security...\n\n                                                                  96.\n\n\n\nLincoln examines him, assimilating. His double seems to be as\nbelligerent as he is. Reasoning now, threat response kicking in.\nLincoln draws the hunting knife. Unused to it, he points it like\na gun. But it's enough of a threat for Tom, who swallows dryly-\n\n                           TOM\n                Why are you here? What do you want?\n\n                         LINCOLN\n                I want to know...\n\nTom grimaces at the ambiguity. That face. His f a c e . If not for\nthe pounding headache this would be a bad dream. He lowers onto\nthe sofa. Finds a cigarette and lights up. A drag, mind kicking\nin. The knife cautioning him. With a slow exhale, he confesses-\n\n                             TOM\n                One of the partners at my firm... he\n                told me about it. Gave me a referral.\n                I thought he was joking at first. I\n                went out there, took the sales tour.\n                Even before that I knew it wasn't a\n                joke. There was this discretion agree-\n                ment. I never saw anything like it and\n                I've seen a lot. Ironclad... breathe a\n                word and they've got you by the balls.\n                I don't know... There's cancer in my\n                family. Maybe it was just to keep up.\n                All the partners were on the policy.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n                The policy?\n\nHe looks at his agnate. Then realizes the level of ignorance.\n\n                               TOM\n                Christ, you have no idea, do you?\n\n                             LINCOLN\n                About what?\n\nTom drags his cigarette, fingers trembling. He shakes his head-\n\n                         TOM\n                I can't fucking do this...\n\n                            LINCOLN\n                What are you talking about?\n\nLincoln moves closer, pointing the knife. Tom flinches, then-\n\n                                  TOM\n                Insurance. You're an insurance policy.\n\n                                                                   97.\n\n\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               What is that?\n\n                             TOM\n               Health insurance... medical...\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               What does that mean?\n\n                         TOM\n               If I get sick... if part of me gets\n               sick... I take a healthy part from you.\n\n                             LINCOLN\n               Why?\n\n                          TOM\n               How do you expect me to answer that?\n               It's just how it works, that's all.\n\nTom looks at his agnate. The insistent stare. The knife, pointing\nat him like a finger. His fear yields to a flicker of anger-\n\n                           TOM\n               What do you want? A fucking apology?\n\n                          LINCOLN\n               Why do I look like you?\n\n                              TOM\n               Because you are me . . .\n\n                        LINCOLN\n               I don't understand.\n\n                              TOM\n               Because they made you from my cells...\n\n                             LINCOLN\n               Made me?\n\n                             TOM\n                      ( a flare of anger)\n               That's right. You were made. Cooked up\n               in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled\n               egg. Every thought running through your\n               head, every word coming out of your\n               mouth, all of it, manufactured, made...\n\nLincoln frowns, trying to assimilate. Too much to process.\n\n                             LINCOLN\n               You . . . you're the one who made me?\n\n                                                                98.\n\n\n\n                         TOM\n               No.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n               Who made me?\n\n                        TOM\n               I signed a contract. I can show you.\n\nHe gestures to a mirror on the wall. Lincoln steps back but his\neyes are unremitting. Tom rises, cautious, crossing to the wall.\nHe opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe. His trembling fingers\ntap the keypad and the safe hisses open. He draws out a contract\nfolder embossed with a crosshatch. Then offers it to his agnate-\n\n                           TOM\n               It's all right there. Who, why...\n\nLincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages,\nreading. A pendulous silence falls. Tom stands watching, smoking\nnervously. Ester stands by the door, trying to take all this in.\n\n                           TOM\n               Look you've got what you wanted. Now\n               why don't you just get out of here?\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                      (pause, looks at him)\n               There are men out there, looking for\n               us. I want you to make them stop.\n\n                        TOM\n               I can't...\n\nLincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again.\n\n                          TOM\n               I can't. Look, I'm a lawyer, I know how\n               it works. The contract, everything, it's\n               all laced with confidentiality clauses.\n               It means they don't want this to get\n               out. It means whatever I do, they're\n               not going to stop. You understand?\n\nLincoln pauses, assimilating. His double's expression indicates\nthat he's telling the truth. Maybe try a more practical request-\n\n                         LINCOLN\n               Do you have transport?\n\n                                 TOM\n               Transport , yes... yes, parked\n               downstairs... Bay 53... Take it...\n\n                                                                      99.\n\n\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     And then you'll call security?\n\n      Lincoln steps closer, pointing the knife. Tom tries to stay dead-\n      pan. The lawyer kicking in. Look them in the eye when you lie-\n\n                                TOM\n                     I'm not going to call security. I'm\n                     not going to call anybody, okay?\n\n      Lincoln looks at his double, reason now yielding to anger. Deep,\n      roiling. Tom looks at his agnate, fear welling, deadpan cracking-\n\n                                  TOM\n                     Look, maybe there's something... maybe\n                     there's a way to cancel the contract...\n\n      Lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double's cheek.\n\n                                TOM\n                     For Christ's sake! It's not my fault!\n\n      Lincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face, drawing\n      blood. The anger urging, hungry for more blood. Then suddenly-\n\n                                     ESTER\n                     Lincoln ! No!\n\n      Lincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in\n      place. He pauses. Then returns to his double. The dreading eyes,\n      the trickle of blood down the face. His e y e s . His f a c e . A long,\n      foreboding moment. Then suddenly Lincoln lashes out. His fist\n      sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages.\n      Lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species.\n      His double is unmoving, unconscious. Lincoln abruptly spins away.\n\n146   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING\n\n      The light panel flashes. Lincoln stands grimly, head lowered,\n      trying to fathom the anger roiling within. Ester stares at him,\n      wanly. Both held in the dark tableau. And the elevator descends.\n\n147   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n      The vehicle parked in bay 53 is a hybrid of sportscar a n d speed-\n      b o a t , a two-seater known as a \"skiff\". Lincoln and Ester climb\n      in. Lincoln reviews the drive console, the controls, all of it,\n      meaningless. His eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel.\n\n      The orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up.\n      Lincoln reviews it. A screen in front of him is flashing:\n      \"PILOTING: MANUAL/AUTO?\". He assimilates. Then ventures-\n\n                                                                     100.\n\n\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                      Auto...\n\n      The interface processes, then asks: \"DESTINATION: NAME/ADDRESS?\"\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                      O u t of state... West...\n\n      The interface processes, then reports \"UNDOCKING\". Lincoln and\n      Ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward. Lode-poles pulsing ahead\n      of them, the skiff moves out, as if pulled by a phantom tugboat.\n\n148   EXT . STREET - DAY\n\n      The skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet. Then stops\n      rocking a little. The interface reports: \"ESTABLISHING UPLINK\".\n      On another screen, a road map appears. A red dot plants at their\n      point of origin then bleeds into a red line, plotting a course.\n\n      The autopilot scans for traffic, then nudges forward on the\n      throttle. The resistors drone, the steering wheel turns and the\n      skiff noses onto the street. Finding its lane, it drops to\n      cruise speed. Lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel,\n      throttle and brake. Then glances at Ester. She's plunged in\n      thought, staring off. She turns to him with a haggard frown-\n\n                                 ESTER\n                      The man back there... who looked like\n                      you... does it mean I have someone too?\n\n      Lincoln looks at her blankly, unknowing. Ester stares off again,\n      her brow knotting with unanswered questions. But Lincoln's gaze\n      lingers. Her pale skin, her limpid eyes, her hair fluttering in\n      the breeze. It's the first time he's really seen Ester's beauty.\n\n149   EXT . PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY\n\n      The domes and spires glint in the sunlight. We isolate a glass\n      steeple. A crosshatch insignia. A legend \"Sanger Industries\".\n\n150   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY\n\n      A corner office with a panoramic view of the city. Crowne sits\n      at a console desk, reviewing some data on a holoframe screen. A\n      knock on the door and HER SECRETARY enters, looking unsettled-\n\n                               SECRETARY\n                      I just thought I should warn you. I\n                      have a sponsor holding. His name's\n                      Thomas Lincoln. He sounded... angry.\n\n                                                                      101.\n\n\n\n151   EXT. STREET TUNNEL - DAY\n\n      The skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass. The interface\n      flashes: \"UPLINK INTERRUPT... AUTOPILOT DISENGAGING\". Lincoln\n      sits up, confused. The skiff is now slowing, drifting as if cut\n      loose. He studies the controls again. Positions one hand on the\n      steering wheel, the other on the throttle. Then he nudges it.\n\n      The skiff lurches, veering out of its lane. Another vehicle zips\n      narrowly past, rocking them with its invisible backwash. Ester\n      looks at Lincoln, suddenly alarmed. Lincoln tries again, firm on\n      the wheel, gentle on the throttle. And the skiff eases forward.\n\n152   EXT . MOTEL - DOWNTOWN PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON\n      D i s m a l . The kind of place that precedes a life on the street. We\n      push in on a window, cracked glass, the drapes closed within.\n\n153   INT . MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n      G l o o m y , musty. A \"holovision\" plays some type of NFL recap. But\n      Scheer is not watching it. He is lying on the bed, staring at\n      the ceiling, motionless. Off a beeping sound, he stirs. He taps\n      a holocom on the nightstand. A holoframe appears, resolving:\n\n                                  Merrick (ON HOLOCOM)\n                     K a r l , there's been a complication.\n\n154   EXT . INTERSTATE - SUNSET\n\n      The sunset melts gold across the horizon as the skiff cruises\n      westward. Eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats.\n      Lincoln is driving more confidently now. Ester is huddled asleep\n      beside him. Suddenly the skiff starts to slow again. Lincoln\n      reviews the controls. Throttle, forward, foot, off the brake.\n      The interface flashes: \"REMOTE LOCKDOWN E N G A G I N G \" . The skiff is\n      steering itself onto the hard shoulder. It now pulls to a dead\n      halt. Ester is woken by the sudden inertia. She opens her eyes\n      and looks around. They've stopped in the middle of nowhere.\n\n155   EXT . THE SALT FLATS - SUNSET\n\n      The sun sinks in a slow pink haze. Lincoln and Ester walk across\n      the salt flats. Visible in the distance is a walled settlement.\n\n156   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET\n\n      An adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway. Lincoln\n      and Ester approach. They haven't walked far but Ester is already\n      short of breath. As they near the gateway a holoserve appears,\n      like a sentry - Native American, buckskins, feathered headdress\n      and facepaint. His voice seems as old as the wind-\n\n                                                                     102.\n\n\n\n                                    THE INDIAN HOLOGRAM\n                     Welcome to Salt River Heritage Park,\n                     home to the Hohokam Nation for over two\n                     thousand years. The park is now closed.\n                     Please come back during opening hours,\n                     9am t o 5pm, Monday through Saturday...\n\n      Ester steps closer. With the sun hazing through, the holoserve\n      s e e m s angelic or ghostly. She's examining his striped facepaint-\n\n                               ESTER\n                     He has marks on his face like us.\n\n      She turns to Lincoln with a flowering smile. Then rushes up to\n      the gateway, suddenly galvanized, squeezing through a gap.\n\n157   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET\n\n      A ring of Native American pueblos. Pithouses a n d coursed adobes,\n      recreations and preserved ruins. Ester rushes around the ring,\n      looking into the pueblos as if expecting to find them inhabited.\n      She ducks into one of the pithouses. Lincoln follows her inside.\n\n158   INT . PITHOUSE - SUNSET\n\n      The mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs, cholla branches.\n      It's cosy in here, dim. The living area, recreated with mats and\n      pottery. Lincoln finds Ester looking around, between excitement\n      and confusion. She turns to him, her voice wavering, wheezing-\n\n                               ESTER\n                     Is this... is this place The Island?\n      Lincoln answers with a softly negating look. Ester's face slowly\n      falls, the energy draining from her eyes. She lowers onto one of\n      the mats and lies down, huddling. She looks up to him, wheezing-\n\n                                ESTER\n                     I'm tired. Let me rest for a while.\n\n159   EXT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n      Silence prevails but for the faint rattle of Ester's breathing.\n      Lincoln sits on low stool, in sentinel over her as she sleeps.\n      In his eyes, we see the weight of foreboding. He doesn't know\n      what they'll do when she wakes. Of a moaning sound he looks at\n      Ester. Then realizes it isn't coming from her. The sound is far\n      off, a rhythmic moaning. Now discernible as the chant of voices.\n\n160   EXT . THE PLATFORM MOUND - NIGHT\n      A blazing fire. Figures in silhouette, moving around, chanting.\n\n                                                                     103.\n\n\n\n      The platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park. An\n      ancient ceremonial site, stepped in ruins, dusted with caliche.\n      Pima and Maricopa, descendants of the Hohokam, are congregated\n      for a solstice ceremony. Off to the side, a group of horses are\n      tethered, shuffling, snorting. Lincoln approaches, cautiously,\n      but somehow like a moth to the flame. He stops at a distance,\n      watching. The curiosity of congruent sound and movement.\n\n                                VOICE (O.S.)\n                     You look a little lost, my friend.\n\n      Lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night. A tall man -\n      swarthy skin, mist-colored eyes. His tribal name is GREY DOVE-\n\n                               GREY DOVE (cont'd)\n                     Or did you come here for a reason?\n\n      Lincoln examines the tall man. The face seems as deep and gentle\n      as the voice. His sense of danger, unstirring, he concedes-\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I was looking for water.\n\n                                GREY DOVE\n                     Not the best place to look.\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                     My transport... it stopped working.\n\n                              GREY DOVE\n                     I see. And where were you going?\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     Out of state...\n\n      Lincoln sighs, the destination seeming very far away. Grey Dove\n      considers him. This bruised, weary outsider is somehow childlike.\n\n161   EXT . THE CEREMONY - LATER\n\n      The fire blazes across the face of a shaman. Old, gnarled, and\n      dry as the salt flats. With a sacred mutter, he slips a peyote\n      button onto his tongue. Then flings back his head, casting his\n      eyes to the stars. When he lowers his head again, we see his\n      pupils dilating. He rises, chanting, moving in ceremonial steps\n      around the fire. Tribespeople s i t in a ring, joining the chant.\n\n      Beyond the ring, others are dining at a roasting pit. Roast\n      rabbit. Cornflour bread. The food is as it might been two\n      thousand years ago. Only the sight of plastic water gallons\n      breaks the illusion. Lincoln stands apart with Grey Dove, eating\n      ravenously, gulping from a water gallon. He looks around-\n\n                                                                     104.\n\n\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     What is this place?\n\n                               GREY DOVE\n                     It is a sacred place. My people come\n                     here to commune with their spirits.\n\n      Lincoln looks at him, puzzled. Grey Dove smiles tolerantly.\n\n                                     GREY DOVE\n                     Not easy to understand perhaps. For us,\n                     the spirit is like the shadow on the\n                     rock. Sometimes close, sometimes far\n                     away, sometimes the sky clouds and the\n                     shadow fades. We come here to ask our\n                     spirits to return to us. The man...\n                           (gestures to the shaman)\n                     He speaks to The Grandfather from whom\n                     all spirits are born. The Great Spirit\n                     who binds every living thing. He has no\n                     name. But he is everywhere. In the sun\n                     and the moon, the wind and the rain...\n\n      The shaman's chanting grows louder, more insistent. His circuit\n      around the fire becoming faster, building in religious fervor.\n\n                                GREY DOVE\n                     Now he asks for the gift of vision that\n                     he may see through to the spirit shape\n                     of things. To find the spirits of the\n                     lost. To bring them into the light...\n\n      The shaman's chanting suddenly stops. He is looking directly at\n      Lincoln, pointing. His face, contorting with what might be anger\n      or fear. He starts babbling in dialect, ardently. Lincoln frowns\n      in confusion. Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound.\n\n162   INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER\n\n      Ester stirs from slumber. On the ground beside her, she finds a\n      bowl of food and a water gallon. Now through the gloom, she sees\n      Lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil.\n      Something seems different about him as he turns, registering her-\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     A r e you alright?\n\n                              ESTER\n                     I feel better after I sleep.\n\n      Lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. Ester\n      moves closer, sensing something. He speaks as if from far away-\n\n                                                                      105.\n\n\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     The man out there... he said\n                     everything has a spirit... every\n                     living thing... but not...\n\n      His voice cuts off. Ester looks at him, recognizing his pain.\n      She doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. It's pain\n      and it evokes a response in her. A feeling, taking her over. Her\n      hand reaches out and strokes his hair. Lincoln looks up at her,\n      questioning. With supreme knowing, Ester leans down and kisses\n      him. At the touch of her lips, Lincoln pauses. The first kiss\n      for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride. The calm\n      ballet of nature. Fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts\n      steeping with moonlight. Lincoln rising to face her, feeling her\n      proximity, her radiant heat. His fingers touching her breasts.\n      Ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. Lincoln closing\n      his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. He yields to it,\n      returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit.\n\n163   EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN\n\n      The sun rises in the east, depicting the traffic in silhouette.\n      A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where\n      the skiff sits abandoned. The grey cutter pulls to a halt.\n\n164   EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN\n\n      D i g g s and Burdon move up on the skiff, cover positions, weapons\n      levelled. Burdon spins in to the driver side, snapping aim with\n      the thunderbolt. But the skiff is empty. The only sign of life\n      is the interface, flashing red: \"REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING\".\n\n      B u r d o n exchanges a look with Diggs. No dice. Diggs reaches in his\n      pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope. He\n      puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats. Burdon crouches at\n      the roadside, looking for tracks. Then Diggs fixes on something-\n\n                              DIGGS\n                     I got thermals.\n\n165   EXT . PLATFORM MOUND - SUNRISE\n\n      The fire is now reduced to a heap of embers. The tribespeople\n      a r e asleep around the mound, wrapped in ethnic blankets. Diggs\n      and Burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. The horses\n      bristle and snort, betraying their approach. The tribespeople,\n      stirred by the noise, awake. Diggs and Burdon swing aim around\n      the ring as faces rise and stare at them. None of the faces have\n      white skin. Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering-\n\n                                DIGGS\n                     I'm looking for two bond runners. They\n                     ditched near here last night.\n\n                                                                        106.\n\n\n\n                                          DIGGS (cont'd)\n                      One man, one woman. Tattoos on the\n                      forehead...\n                              (nothing, just silent stares)\n                      Anyone's seen them, I got fifty green.\n                              (still nothing, aggravated)\n                      What the fuck are you? Deaf and dumb?\n\n      The tribal faces just keep staring. Diggs scowls. Then suddenly\n      swings aim with the rainmaker and fires. -BOOM- hitting one of\n      the horses in the haunch. It rears up, whinnying, setting off\n      the rest of the horses. Diggs turns back to the gathering-\n\n                                     DIGGS\n                     Somebody start talking.\n\n      He scans around the ring. Then fixes on one of the women. She\n      lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby. Grey Dove stiffens.\n\n166   EXT . SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE\n\n      The sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge.\n      Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks. Ester now\n      stops to catch her breath. She is wheezing again, fighting for\n      air. As Lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile-\n\n                              ESTER\n                     I can make it.\n\n167   EXT . SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING\n\n      A freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of\n      low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height.\n      The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known\n      as a \"lode-canal\". At each end of the canyon, it intersects with\n      other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system\n      of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic.\n      High above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find Lincoln and\n      Ester. Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. She looks down at\n      the passing vessel, daunted. Lincoln offers her small comfort-\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                     Don't worry. The one we want goes the\n                     other way. He said it goes slower.\n\n      They exchange a smile. The chain of containers tailing off, the\n      barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon.\n\n168   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING\n\n      Lincoln and Ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode-canal.\n      Ester stops, having to catch her breath every few steps. Lincoln\n      tries to hide his concern, looking away towards the sunrise. The\n      westbound vessel will be coming soon.\n\n                                                                        107.\n\n\n\n      They just need to get out of state... Now he frowns, sensing\n      something. Faint but growing. His jaw clenches. His face\n      tightens. His pupils start to dilate.\n\n169   EXT . THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING\n\n      The north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the\n      grey cutter pulling up. Diggs and Burdon get out and look down\n      into the canyon. Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning.\n      Burdon peels off his jacket. It's early but it's already getting\n      hot. Diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion-\n\n                                DIGGS\n                      Up there in the rocks. Three o'clock.\n                      I'm not sure... it could be ambient.\n\n170   EXT . THE SOUTH FACE - MORNING\n\n      Lincoln and Ester hide in the shadow of a rock. Ester is muffling\n      her breaths as best she can. Lincoln now hazards a look over the\n      top. Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon,\n      now pointing in their direction. He ducks back, assimilating.\n      Hiding, no longer an option. Nor running, at least for Ester.\n      His face sets in a grimace of conviction. His eyes glow darkly.\n\n171   EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING\n\n      Diggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks. Neither speaks,\n      communicating in hand-signals. Diggs slips into the lode-canal.\n      Burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face.\n\n      Diggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. He stays low,\n      moving up into the rocks. Then, from above, a rock dislodges,\n      rattling down. Diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire-\n\n      - B O O M - B O O M - The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock.\n      The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, Burdon firing from\n      the far side - SHOTS, BOLTS, KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST --\n      SUDDENLY HOLDING FIRE, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading.\n      No sign of movement. Just a slide of rubble. Fading echoes.\n\n      D I G G S STEALS ONWARDS UP THE ROCKS - into the fog of dust - the\n      sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly-\n      LINCOLN BURSTS OUT OF THE DUST - from the left - tackling the\n      pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope --\n\n      THUDDING TO A HALT at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker\n      lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust --\n      THE DUSTCLOUD - Diggs and Lincoln struggling, clawing, punching -\n      Lincoln, with surprise on his side, gaining with the upper hand--\n\n                                                               108.\n\n\n\nDIGGS' CLAWING FINGERS discover Lincoln's knife - tugging it from\nhis jacket - Lincoln grabbing his wrist, fighting for control -\nTHE KNIFE MOVING BETWEEN THEM - Diggs with better leverage - the\nblade inching towards Lincoln's face - pressing into his cheek--\n\nLINCOLN'S EYES - welling black, almost inhuman - the sense of\ndanger screaming in his ears - he grabs the pale man's throat -\nDIGGS' EYES - bulging as he strains to push the knife home -\noxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back -\n\nLINCOLN REGAINS THE KNIFE - the pale man seems to be out cold -\nbut he's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him, then--\n- B O O M - THE KNIFE FLIES FROM HIS GRIP IN A BURST OF DISCHARGE -\n\nBURDON SNAPS AIM FOR ANOTHER SHOT - beading - his target moving\nnow - dropping out of the firing line - into the lode-canal--\n\nBURDON INCHES TOWARD THE EDGE - thunderbolt angling downward -\ninto the trench - then suddenly he's GRABBED BY THE ANKLES -\n\nLINCOLN STRAINING to overbalance the giant - feet up against the\nwall - like trying to topple a tree - finally winning some give-\n\nBURDON TOPPLES INTO THE TRENCH - his ankles clamped by his\nquarry - both men meeting the concrete with a bone-shaking-\n\n- THUD - LINCOLN IS CRUSHED BENEATH THE MASSIVE WEIGHT - the giant\nalready recovering from the fall - now dragging him upright--\n\n- THUD - BURDON THROWS A PUNCH - mightily - hurling his quarry\nacross the trench - moving in quickly, following up with a kick--\n\n- THUD - LINCOLN CRUMPLES as the boot smacks into him - then\nanother kick - then another - the world starts blurring --\n\nBURDON TURNS AWAY - his quarry disabled for now - he recovers\nhis thunderbolt - turns back to administer the coup de grace--\n\nLINCOLN LOOKS UP - the giant looming - the muzzle of his weapon\nthrumming with energy - the rivets on his denims start rattling--\n\nBURDON SPINS ROUND - the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his\ngrasp - there, in the distance - AN EASTBOUND BARGE IS COMING -\n\nLINCOLN SCRAMBLES UP THE WALL OF THE TRENCH - muscles straining,\nfeet slipping on the concrete - escaping the imminent vessel --\n\n                                                               109.\n\n\n\nDIGGS COMING TO - now seeing his quarry a short distance away -\nemerging from the lode-canal - he looks around for a weapon, then-\n\n                             BURDON (O.S.)\n               Diggs!

When we heard about\n               the technology, it was like... forgive-\n               n e s s , like a second chance. A child of\n               our own, part of both of us. Sailing\n               trips, fishing trips, so many plans...\n                      ( a flat beat)\n               J o h n got cancer a year ago. He died.\n\nHe r eyes mist, distant and bittersweet, talking to herself now.\n\n                              KATHERINE\n               I r o n i c . That the same technology could\n               have saved his life. And now the baby\n               is the only part of him I have left.\n               And the boat. I still have the boat.\n\nLincoln looks discomfited. There's more to this than he thought.\n\n                                                                     117.\n\n\n\n179   INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVENING\n\n      S c h e e r opens the door. Merrick stands at the threshold with an\n      attache case. Scheer, seemingly unsurprised, brings him inside.\n\n                              SCHEER\n                     I told you we shouldn't have gone to\n                     outside personnel. They were cowboys.\n\n                               MERRICK\n                     We had no choice, Karl. We had to keep\n                     this away from The Institute.\n\n                                  SCHEER\n                     An d now?\n\n      Merrick lowers in a chair, grim and leaden. He opens his attache\n      and pulls out a contract folder. He hands it to Scheer.\n\n                                   SCHEER\n                     What's this?\n\n                                 MERRICK\n                     Your resignation papers. Maybe `early\n                     retirement' would be more accurate...\n\n      S c h e e r leans forward, frowning, curious.\n\n                                MERRICK\n                     T e n platinum bounty - if you sign the\n                     papers, their loss becomes your gain.\n\n                              SCHEER\n                     A parachute... So there's a jump?\n\n                                MERRICK\n                     You understand that whatever happens,\n                     The Institute must be able to deny it.\n\n      S c h e e r says nothing. Merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out\n      a case. Inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe-gun.\n\n                               MERRICK\n                     We use a chemical to dispose of waste\n                     product. It's called di-halcyonate. I t\n                     reacts on a molecular level to start a\n                     process of internal combustion. The\n                     subject is incinerated from the inside\n                     out. In post-mortem application it's\n                     done its job before rigor mortis.

We have to be very... thorough.\n                     If you still have it in you, that is.\n\n      S c h e e r gives him a sideways look. Then displays the USMC ring.\n\n                                SCHEER\n                     Why do you think I still wear this?\n\n                              MERRICK\n                     I don't know.\n\n                               SCHEER\n                     I was discharged from the marines for\n                     insubordination. If you asked anyone\n                     i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. I\n                     disobeyed an order to fall back. I took\n                     out a bunker complex single-handed.\n\n                               MERRICK\n                     S o you wear it is a badge of honor?\n\n                                SCHEER\n                     N o . It wasn't bravery. I wasn't afraid\n                     of dying. I just didn't care. You see,\n                     I suddenly realized I was just a sack\n                     of flesh with a heartbeat. Life, death,\n                     I just couldn't see the point anymore.\n\n      Merrick allows a respectful pause, then-\n\n                                   MERRICK\n                     You'll find a vehicle parked outside.\n                     It's unregistered, difficult to trace.\n                     I take it we have an agreement...?\n\n180   INT . KATHERINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n      A slant of light falls across Ester, writhing in her sleep,\n      rasping. Katherine and Lincoln peer in through the doorway,\n      checking on her. Then Katherine quietly closes the door.\n\n181   INT . KATHERINE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n      Lincoln paces around, feeling useless. Katherine considers him-\n\n                                 KATHERINE\n                     What do I call you?\n\n                                                                 119.\n\n\n\n                               LINCOLN\n               Lincoln .

I think she needs to see a doctor.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n               N o . They'll find her. They'll take her.\n\n                          KATHERINE\n               N o t if I don't want them to.\n\n                          LINCOLN\n               You don't understand. They don't want\n               people to know about her. Either of us.\n\n                          KATHERINE\n               The doctor I'm thinking of, he's an\n               old friend. He look after John in\n               t h e final stages. I trust him.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               Why ? So you can take her baby?\n\n                          KATHERINE\n               N o . No, that's not what I want.\nO f f Lincoln's blunt look, she sighs, lowering into a chair.\n\n                               KATHERINE\n               M a y b e I didn't realize she'd      be so...\n                      ( c u t s off, a deep pause)\n               M a y b e I just didn't want to.      Either\n               way, I was wrong. I want you          to know\n               that. I was wrong... And I'm          sorry.\n\nA heavy lull. Lincoln hangs his head, remembering.\n\n                           LINCOLN\n               The y make you believe there's a place\n               called The Island. Then they take you\n               upstairs and put you to sleep. They\n               cut you open. They take pieces of you.\n\nKatherine looks at him, intuiting. She allows a pause, then-\n\n                           KATHERINE\n               E v e n if I had taken her baby, I swear\n               to you, I'd never have...

I saw a lot of us go to The Island.\n                     But I never saw anyone come back.\n\n                                KATHERINE\n                     You mean... Even if I had extended the\n                     sponsorship, they'd have... and kept\n                     taking the money? But that's inhuman.\n\n                                    LINCOLN\n                          ( b e a t , a lost look)\n                     Is it? I wouldn't know.\n\n182   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - EVENING\n\n      A sleek low vehicle known as a \"straker\" pulls down the ramp.\n\n183   INT . APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING\n\n      The orbs on the doors eyeball Scheer, moving up the corridor. He\n      stops at a doorway. Rings the bell. Tom Lincoln opens the door-\n\n                                TOM\n                     Yes?\n\n                                SCHEER\n                     I'm from the Sanger Institute.\n\n                                 TOM\n                     I've given you people enough of my\n                     time already.\n\n                                 SCHEER\n                     I t ' s just a formality. I need to see\n                     your sponsorship contract.\n\n      T o m pauses then lets Scheer inside. He crosses to the wall safe,\n      taps the keys. Then pulls out the contract folder. He offers it.\n\n                               SCHEER\n                     Is this the only copy?\n\n                                TOM\n                     Why would I make copies? Do you think\n                     I want anyone else to know about this?\n\n      S c h e e r accepts the folder. As Tom turns to close the safe, he\n      sets it down. And grabs Tom from behind, by the scalp, pressing\n      the syringe-gun into his jugular. A HISS. Tom clutches his throat\n      like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers forward.\n      Sweating, collapsing. Convulsing, belching steam. Then falling\n      slack. His skin starts to smolder. Scheer pauses, then tosses\n      t h e contract folder on top of him, leaving it to burn with him.\n\n                                                                          121.\n\n\n\n184   EXT.

A hatch-\n      b a c k vehicle known as a \"corsair\" pulls down the parking ramp.\n\n185   INT . UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT\n\n      The corsair pulls up at the ER entrance, Lincoln at the wheel.\n      Katherine gets out of the passenger side. A doctor is waiting -\n      50's, caring face. His name is DR. ABRAMS. He looks curiously at\n      the man at the wheel. Then greets Katherine with a hug -\n\n                                        D R . ABRAMS\n                      Katherine . . . It's good to see you.

What\n                      is it exactly that's wrong with you?\n\n                                  KATHERINE\n                      I t ' s not me... Not exactly.\n\n      She opens the rear door of the corsair. Ester is lying on the\n      back seat. Dr. Abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance.\n\n186   EXT . THE RANCH HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT\n\n      The straker p u l l s up into the port.\n\n187   INT . THE STUDIO / MAIN HOUSE - SEDONA - NIGHT\n\n      The shadow of Scheer moving outside the windows, looking for a\n      point of entry. He inspects the studio door for alarms. Then\n      elbows the glass. Reaching inside, turning the lock. He enters\n      the studio, glancing at the sculptures. Moving through the home.\n\n      S i l e n t l y , systematically, checking the rooms. He reaches the\n      guest bedroom, looks around. Something catches his eye. Spots of\n      blood of the linens. Eyes honing, he moves on into the kitchen.\n      He discovers a holocom keypad on the counter. Taps some keys.\n      The holoframe flashes \"REDIALLING\". The holoframe snows with\n      static. Then a receptionist's face appears-\n\n                                 R E C E P T I O N I S T (ON HOLOCOM)\n                      N e w Gaza Hospital, how may I help you?\n\n                                                                     122.\n\n\n\n188   INT. WAITING ROOM - NEW GAZA HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER\n\n      Lincoln stands waiting. There are chairs but he's too tense to\n      sit. Katherine and Dr. Abrams now enter. Lincoln looks at them,\n      expectantly. There's a pause. Then Dr. Abrams speaks-\n\n                                 D R . ABRAMS\n                     Your friend... she has pneumonia. At a\n                     very advanced stage. Its progress has\n                     been unchecked by her immune system.\n\n                                LINCOLN\n                     C a n you help her?\n\n                                    D R . ABRAMS\n                     We have two options... One is a super-\n                     b i o t i c . But there's the risk her immune\n                     system might bow out of the fight. The\n                     other is a nodal transfusion. Katherine\n                     has agreed to be the donor. But the new\n                     antibodies may not conform fully. They\n                     m a y decide to attack the baby...\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I don't understand any of this.\n\n                               KATHERINE\n                     He means that by trying to help her,\n                     we could lose her. Or lose the baby.\n\n                                D R . ABRAMS\n                     Or , if we do nothing, both. Her immune\n                     system is... remarkably unstable. If we\n                     don't act, the infection will take over.\n\n      Lincoln lowers into a chair. He feels a pain somewhere. He can't\n      quite pin down where. Or what caused it. Or why it hurts so bad.\n\n189   INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n      Ester lies in bed, dozing, looking more relaxed. Her oxygen mask\n      makes breathing easier. Lincoln enters and sits beside her. She\n      stirs, meeting his eye with a faint smile.

And I\n                     keep thinking... about the others...\n                     the ones we left behind, about how\n                     they'll never know... how they'll...\n\n      Ester ' s out of breath again, coughing. Lincoln helps her put the\n      oxygen mask back over her mouth. Ester slumps back, relaxing.\n      Off Lincoln's worried look, she smiles at him with her eyes-\n\n                                ESTER\n                     I'm going to be okay, Lincoln.\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                     I know.\n\n      But even to his own ears, the affirmation sounds hollow.\n\n190   INT . MEN'S ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT\n\n      The stream of water gushes into Lincoln's hands. He splashes his\n      face. Then looks at himself in the mirror. He looks sallow from\n      sleeplessness. The facial hair makes him look like a shadow of\n      his former self. For an instant he tenses at a light blinking in\n      the glass. Blue light. Like etherscreen. Then he sees it's just\n      a humidifier on the far wall. Tension ebbing, he splashes some\n      more water. When he looks up again, he sees his pupils are\n      dilating. The sense of danger. His voice comes in a cold whisper-\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                     No...\n\n                                                                        124.\n\n\n\n191   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n      Lincoln emerges from the restroom, scanning for the danger's\n      source. Figures flash past in scrubs, white coats. Then he sees\n      it. The figure emerging from the elevator. The face of Scheer...\n\n192   INT . PREP ROOM - NIGHT\n\n      A flurry of disturbance from the nurses as someone barges into\n      the room. Dr. Abrams is prepping Katherine for the transfusion.\n      Off the ruckus, he looks up. Lincoln comes up to them, urgently-\n\n                               LINCOLN\n                     We have to go.

Take\n                     her somewhere they can't find her...\n\n      Katherine , understanding, simply nods. Lincoln takes a last look\n      at Ester, then departs.

He looks down at the crashsite\n      b e l o w . The parking lot, like a marina, is filled to capacity. A\n      game is in progress. A corona of light coming from the stadium.\n      Hoots, music, the roaring crowd. Over which, sirens can now be\n      heard. Scheer draws the syringe-gun and heads down the ramp.\n\n199   EXT . PARKING LOT - HOLSPAR STADIUM - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER\n\n      D u s t blooms from the crashsite. S c h e e r crouches, peering down at\n      the wrecked corsair. The burst windshield, the dangling driver\n      side door shows his quarry has escaped the wreckage. He rises\n      and scans around. On the concrete, a trail of blood is visible.\n\n200   INT . STORAGE AREA - HOLSPAR STADIUM - MINUTES LATER\n\n      The blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell. The game is just\n      audible overhead. Lincoln stumbles down the steps, clutching his\n      bleeding arm. Between pain and concussion, he loses his footing\n      and falls. He tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom.\n\n      I n the gloom we   see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t , supplies - edgers,\n      aerators, spray    rigs, drums of insecticides, herbicides. For a\n      moment, Lincoln    lies stunned. Then hears a noise and rolls over.\n      He looks up the    stairwell. A shadow is descending towards him.\n\n      W i t h painful effort, Lincoln starts crawling across the floor,\n      eyes fixed on the shadow. Tensing as A HANDGUN noses out of the\n      darkness. Then A STADIUM SECURITY GUARD steps into the light -\n\n                                 S E C U R I T Y GUARD\n                     You , what are you doing down here?\n\n      N o w he sees Lincoln more closely - injured, his arm bleeding.\n\n                                S E C U R I T Y GUARD\n                     O h , Jesus... Are you okay, son?\n\n      Lincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his\n      weapon. Then suddenly the guard is JERKED BACK BY THE SCALP.\n      A HISS. Now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun, clutching\n      his throat like it's on fire. With a boiling gurgle, he staggers\n      forward. Streaming with sweat. Toppling across a herbicide drum.\n      Convulsing, belching steam. Then suddenly his body falls slack.\n      S c h e e r is at the foot of the steps, discarding the spent ampule\n      from the syringe-gun. Now screwing a fresh ampule into place.\n\n      Lincoln turns to him, realizing what he's just witnessed is a\n      glimpse of his own fate. He pushes himself upright, bracing.\n      S c h e e r looks at him. Clutching his bloody arm, barely able to\n      stay upright, but still ready to fight for life. He half-smiles-\n\n                                                                                 128.\n\n\n\n                                  SCHEER\n                       I'm jealous of you. You have a reason to\n                       live. I can't say I've ever had that...\n\n      Lincoln holds his gaze, looking deep in his eyes. Then, as if\n      scared by what he sees there, starts inching away, glancing at--\n\n      T H E GUARD'S BODY SMOLDERING - lowering, melting through the drum-\n      S C H E E R MOVING FORWARD, the smile leaving his face.

Perhaps he really does understand.\n\n                               KATHERINE\n              Ester ' s life was my responsibility and\n              her death is my cross to bear alone.

Until the\n              day I die, I will silently curse your\n              name. That's w h a t I wanted you to know.\n\nShe drives it home with a horrible look. Sanger accepts it with\ndue gravity. There's an ugly pause. Katherine gets to her feet.\n\n                         KATHERINE\n              An d now I'd like to leave, please.\n\n                                                                          131.\n\n\n\n                               CROWNE\n                     We do have other issues to discuss...\n\n                                DR.

STREET - OUTSIDE THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY\n\n      Katherine descends the steps from the entrance. She crosses to a\n      black funeral sedan, parked kerbside. D r .

ROOFTOP FLIGHTPAD - THE SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER\n\n      C r o w n e escorts Sanger and Merrick to the waiting whisper.\n\n                                  CROWNE\n                     We l l , I don't know about the two of\n                     you but I'd say we got off lightly.\n\n                                 DR.

THE SANGER INSTITUTE - SOME WEEKS LATER\n\n      A i r blasts up from the giant funnel. Widening, we re-establish\n      the huge ring, the processing plant, the giant appendages of\n      ducting, the immutable red rocks. The shot sequence, reprising.\n      From the processing plant, over the main complex. From the front\n      of the complex, to the dock.\n\n                                                                           132.\n\n\n\n      Following the lodeway out to the perimeter wall. The gateway now\n      gliding open to disclose a view of the shimmering desert. Out in\n      the distance, the institute liner emerging from the shimmer. The\n      crosshatch insignia.\n\n207   INT . ENTRANCE HALL - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY\n\n      T h r o u g h the polarized glass we see the liner has docked. A TOUR\n      GROUP is disembarking. Another parade of plutocracy, aging\n      bloated me and brittle young women. They filter inside to be\n      greeted by the courtesy staff, led by the ever-perky LYDIA.\n\n                                     LYDIA\n                     L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia\n                     and on behalf of our staff, I'd like\n                     t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.\n                     Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-\n                     i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center\n                     and circulating our standard discretion\n                     agreements. I should add that today you\n                     are all very lucky because our CEO and\n                     founder, Dr. Henry Sanger, is with us\n                     and will be leading the tour personally.\n\n208   INT . VISITOR CENTER - THE SANGER INSTITUTE - DAY\n\n      The tour group pick and mingle at a buffet. We isolate a\n      casually dressed man, lightly bearded, in a Phoenix Admirals\n      cap, crossing to Lydia. She turns to greet him with a smile-\n\n                                   LYDIA\n                     Yes . . . Mr. Thomas, isn't it?\n      The man tilts up to reveal his face. We see he is LINCOLN...\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                     I can't find my sunglasses. I think I\n                     left them on the shuttle.\n\n                                 LYDIA\n                     We l l we're about to start the tour.\n                     But I can have someone check for you.\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                     Don't worry. I'll catch up.\n\n209   EXT . PROCESSING PLANT - DAY\n\n      Lincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the\n      complex. Hugging the shadows, scanning for onlookers. There is\n      the processing plant and there, the ring of funnels. The sight\n      brings a sudden rush of memories, painful memories, horrors.\n\n                                                                        133.\n\n\n\n      Lincoln steels himself, then breaks from shadow and races for\n      the nearest funnel. He makes a running lap. His fingers grab\n      t h e lip of the funnel and he pulls himself up. Reaching the lip,\n      he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded o v e r . Then he hears-\n\n                                  A VOICE (O.S.)\n                      S i r , this is a restricted area...\n\n      Lincoln lowers back to the ground. He finds himself facing A\n      TECHNICIAN in a hardhat. His uniform reads \"Air Processing\".\n\n210   INT . ELEVATOR - PROCESSING PLANT\n\n      The doors slide open and the technician enters, stiffly. Then\n      suddenly topples forward, pistol whipped from behind. Lincoln\n      enters the elevator, a familiar handgun clenched in his fist.\n\n211   INT . ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n      L o o k i n g up an elevator shaft. The red pulse of the lode-poles,\n      rippling downward as the elevator descends from the surface.\n\n212   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING\n\n      Lincoln is now wearing the technician's uniform. He watches the\n      panel lights flashing down. \"Level 3: Harvest\" \"Level 5: Labor\n      Decon\", \"Level 7: Labor Quarters\". His pupils are dilating but\n      his face is set with determination. He knows what he must do.\n      His gaze drifts down to \"Level Twenty: Agnate Containment\".\n\n213   INT . THE ETHER GRID\n\n      The holographic rendering of containment spins in the vaulted\n      chamber like a giant geometrical phantom. The ether blinks with\n      blue dots in their hundreds as the agnates g o about their day.\n\n214   INT . ETHER CONTROL ROOM\n\n      O v e r l o o k i n g the ether, Ethercon sits at his console. The hiss of\n      an opening door as someone enters. Ethercon looks round. He\n      greets the technician's arrival with an inquisitive look. Then\n      the technician takes off his hardhat. A crosshatch on his brow.\n      Ethercon reacts almost instantly, reaching for the console. Then\n      instantly freezes as Lincoln presses the handgun to his skull.\n\n215   INT . CORRIDOR - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN\n\n      P a l e blue light. Ethercon leads the way down a silent corridor.\n      Lincoln follows him, the handgun firmly levelled on his head.\n\n                                                                            134.\n\n\n\n216   INT. CHAMBER - LEVEL TWENTY SEVEN\n\n      The pale blue light sustains. The chamber is reminiscent of the\n      foundation chambers. The walls lined with tanks. But instead of\n      amber fluid, these contain blocks of ice. Beside each tank is a\n      grid of bio-monitors. E t h e r c o n stumbles into frame, prodded by\n      Lincoln. Then, with a trembling finger points to one of the\n      tanks. Lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet.\n      He wipes the condensation off the glass. Suspended in the block\n      of ice is a shadow. A human figure. A device is attached to his\n      stomach. Lincoln looks at the bio-monitors. A screen reads:\n\n      \" P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER/ FOUNDATION: II/ GENERATION: DELTA\".\n\n      Lincoln looks across the EKG, the cardiograph, indications that\n      Starkweather is still alive. Then he fixes on the RFI m o n i t o r . A\n      resonant image of the brain. The shifting aura showing a level of\n      consciousness. What thoughts must be going through that mind?\n      The fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration. To be kept on\n      i c e for future harvest. With a haggard look, Lincoln rests his\n      hand on the glass where Starkweather hangs frozen. Connecting.\n\n217   INT . SALES HALL - THE INSTITUTE - DAY\n\n      An embryo in mutated effigy hangs suspended in the amber fluid.\n      Dr. Sanger stands at the wall of display tanks, mid-way through\n      his sales pitch. He delivers it now with noticeably less gusto-\n\n                                       DR. SANGER\n                     C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the\n                     beginning, the mapping of the human\n                     genome was declared a historic landmark-\n                     to break the curse of heredity, to\n                     correct congenital defect... genetic\n                     engineering became the brave new world\n                     of medical science.

SANGER?\n\n      S a n g e r just looks at her. Then jolts from a spasm, clawing at\n      his chest. His knees buckling, he topples against a display\n      case. Pawing at the glass, he slides dreadfully to the ground.\n\n                                                                        135.\n\n\n\n                                 LYDIA\n                     He's having a heart attack! A doctor!\n                     Somebody get a doctor in here!\n\n      The tour group keeps their distance, unsettled by the face of\n      mortality. Sanger is now lying in contortion on the floor, his\n      gaping eyes fixed on the display tank. The embryo in mutated\n      effigy, rocking about in the amber fluid. The sight of this\n      little human monster is one that will follow him to the grave.\n\n218   INT .

He sits in front of a data tablet, his image\n      recorded on its screen. His voice also seems older as he speaks-\n\n                                                                   137.\n\n\n\n                                    LINCOLN\n                    I t ' s been a year since the breakout. A\n                    year in hiding, waiting for things to\n                    quiet down. I don't know how many made\n                    i t out or how many who did, survived. I\n                    know there are people called politicians\n                    trying to say it never happened. That's\n                    why I've kept this journal. To keep the\n                    truth alive. Alive... I've learned what\n                    that means but it still confuses me. In\n                    functional terms, I've been alive for ten\n                    years. In human terms, more than thirty.\n                    Human... I'm not sure about that one\n                    either. They say I'm not human because\n                    I have no mother or father. I guess I\n                    have more to learn. But one word I do\n                    understand is hope. So maybe this\n                    j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like\n                    me, who may be out there. To know\n                    t h e y ' r e not alone. My name is Lincoln\n                    S i x - E c h o and this is my testament...\n\n      He sits back, contemplating the screen with an air of closure.\n      Then he stirs at a sound. At first just a gurgle. Then a moan.\n      Becoming the sound of A BABY CRYING. Lincoln crosses to a cot.\n      He lifts up a baby boy, 6 months old, bawling and squirming.\n\n                              A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                    Is he hungry again? I just fed him.\n\n      Ester steps into the room, sleep-mussed, her beauty deepened by\n      maternity. The baby reaches out for her. Lincoln hands him over-\n\n                                   LINCOLN\n                    Lincoln Junior, huh? It still doesn't\n                    sound right. That name.\n\n                                ESTER\n                    I t ' s the name of his father.\n      She lovingly kisses him. Lincoln smiles at her, then the baby,\n      sweeping the hair from the forehead. Unscarred, blemishless.\n\n                              LINCOLN\n                    We should finish packing.\n\n224   EXT . JETTY - THE PACIFIC COAST - DAWN\n\n      A private jetty stretches out to a pile of supply canisters. A\n      yacht is moored. We recognized it as John's boat. And we recognize\n      Katherine, holding the baby as Lincoln and Ester finish loading.\n      The last canister stowed, Lincoln comes up to her. He smiles at\n      the sight of her with the baby. Then prompts her gently-\n\n                                                                       138.\n\n\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     Time to go.\n      Katherine hesitates, part of her unwilling to let the baby go.\n      Then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets\n      Ester take him. Lincoln presents her with the data tablet-\n\n                                   LINCOLN\n                     You'll make sure this gets out?\n\n                                 KATHERINE\n                     Yes . There are people sympathetic to\n                     the cause. I'm going to get it to them.\n\n                                  LINCOLN\n                     Thank you, Katherine. For everything.\n\n      He smiles. Katherine points to a canister left on the dock.\n\n                                  KATHERINE\n                     Don't forget that. It has the\n                     operating manuals for the boat.\n\n                                 LINCOLN\n                     I've been looking at them for months.\n\n                                KATHERINE\n                     But the maps, the charts...\n\n                                   LINCOLN\n                         ( b e a t ; a meaningful look)\n                     I don't need them either.\n      Katherine nods, understanding. Nothing more to say, she hugs him.\n      Then turns to Ester with the baby. She folds them in a yearning,\n      almost maternal embrace. Tears well in her eyes. Then the sorrow\n      turns to laughter as the baby starts tugging at her gray hair.\n\n225   EXT . THE PACIFIC - DAWN\n\n      The sun rises in the east, casting the coastline in silhouette.\n      The light glows across Lincoln's face, at the helm of the yacht,\n      staring back to the shore. He looks at Ester sitting beside him,\n      the baby swaddled in a blanket at her breast. Then he looks out\n      to the west, to the soft reach of dawn and the boundless horizon\n      of sea. There never was an island. But perhaps there will be...\n\n\n\n                                      T H E END\n\n\n\n\n\nIsland, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Caspian Tredwell-Owen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:27:49.933049"}
