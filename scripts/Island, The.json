Then more apartments, above and\n    below, the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks. It might be a\n    prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent. Indeed, the\n    residents move freely, all notably male, all clad in shearlings,\n    polo shirts and slacks. It is just another day in Sector Four.\n\n<b>3   INT. NUTRITION PLAZA - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n</b>\n    Satie's Gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers. \n\n    A glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley. The plaza, \n    formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile, is divided into two service \n    areas.\n\n    Male residents in line on one side, females on the other. Both\n    genders combine in the seating area. Lincoln reaches the head of\n    the line. He swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner. A NUTRITION\n    CLERK, a surly woman in uniform, eyes the readout on her screen-\n\n<b>                                    NUTRITION CLERK\n</b>                     Lincoln Six-Echo...

The clerk taps her screen. Turning to a\n    row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a\n    drink can. Lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the\n    oatmeal and juice breakfast. Then he heads into the seating area.\n\n    In the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and\n    chatting happily. Uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping\n    tables. A divide in this community now starts to become clear...\n\n    The busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service,\n    maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct\n    uniforms but no facial marking. They are known as \"outsiders\".\n\n    The \"residents\", like Lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their\n    upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. Mostly Caucasian,\n    from mid-twenties to mid-sixties. There are no children here.\n\n    We isolate a blonde - mid-20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile\n    beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. Her\n    name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln, she smiles and waves-\n\n<b>                                     ESTER\n</b>                     Lincoln !

Will you miss me?\n\nHer eyes betray a flicker of something. It unsettles Lincoln.\n\n<b>                          LINCOLN\n</b>              I'll miss your coffee. C'mon, I\n              already burned up my quota.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                       4.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                             ESTER\n</b>                Okay. But this is the last time.\n\nIn a deliberate move, she drops her napkin on the floor. As she\nducks down to retrieve it, Lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee.\nRising again, Ester registers his souring look.\n\n<b>                            ESTER\n</b>                What is it?\n\nLincoln just nods across the plaza. Ambient conversation is now\nebbing at an arrival. An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical\nuniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes. He might be a prison\nwarden but for the generally warm reception. He is known as The\nCommunity Director. His name is MERRICK.\n\nHe crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a\nthree-forked pendant known as a \"tri-key\". He slots the tri-key\ninto the lectern. The glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o\na live feed of himself. Now amplified by the plaza speakers,\nMerrick begins his address-\n\n<b>                            MERRICK\n</b>                Good morning. To everyone here and\n                everyone watching on etherscreen,\n                welcome to the community address. Today\n                I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For\n                those of you here with sugar quotas, let\n                me recommend the french toast. I just\n                tried some and it's excellent, really.\n                But I know what everyone's hungry for\n                s o let's move on to the lottery. As\n                always the draw will be made from our\n                host sector. So tell me, Sector Four -\n                is everyone ready for The Daily Spin?\n\nApplause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents,\nwho take on the zeal of a game show audience. The older ones -\nincluding Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance.\nMerrick turns the tri-key i n the lectern. The glass wall\nswitches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text;\n\n<b>- - DAILY SPIN!... GET READY TO WIN!...

The\nglass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot\nmachine. But instead of icons, it clicks through names, each\nseparated by a blank line - from \"Adams One-Alpha\" to \"Zucker\nThree - Charlie\" - scrolling the entire population of Sector Four.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     5.\n</b>\n\n\n    As the spin slows, a pent silence falls.

The plaza reverts to its former\n    mood, dotted with murmurs of disappointment. Lincoln scowls.\n\n<b>                                ESTER\n</b>                   Don't worry.

SUBWAY PORTAL - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n</b>\n    The portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates, known as\n    an \"ethergate.\" Residents swipe their ethercuffs o v e r scanners,\n    the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                      6.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>5   INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - SECTOR FOUR - DAY\n</b>\n    The subway, formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile, is not\n    unlike our own. In place of escalators, moving walkways deliver\n    the residents onto the platform. Along the platform wall runs a\n    strip of mirrored panels, etherscreen reporting in banner crawl:\n\n<b>    - - NEXT STOP... SECTOR 5 - SECTOR 6 - CENTERVILLE...\n</b>    At the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence, where the\n    residents wait in a patient line, Lincoln among them. His focus\n    is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby.\n\n<b>                            RESIDENT #1\n</b>                   A stim unit says it hits the wall.\n\n<b>                                RESIDENT #2\n</b>                   Okay . But I get to set the can.\n\n    Resident #1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. Resident #2 ducks\n    under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. Or what\n    looks like a track. The struts lining the bed are not sleepers\n    but buffers of galvanized rubber. Nor are there any rails. The\n    relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the\n    buffers to run in twin parallel. Known as \"lode-poles,\" they now\n    start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.\n\n<b>                                RESIDENT #1\n</b>                   Hurry it up. The shuttle's coming.\n\n    Resident #2 regains the platform. We PUSH IN on the drink can,\n    balanced on a buffer. It starts rattling. Then suddenly shoots\n    upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall,\n    clattering into obscurity. Resident #1 whoops in victory.\n\n    A rush of air heralds the shuttle. It sails out of the tunnel,\n    floating three feet above the track. A hybrid of subway car and\n    nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on\n    a catamaran. It is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the\n    lode-poles, an invisible river known as a \"lode-stream\". The\n    shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. Its\n    gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence\n    lowers. Lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.\n\n<b>6   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY\n</b>\n    An avenue of cream colored buildings. Uniform in architecture,\n    rising five stories to meet a mirrored roof. Despite lighting\n    arrays, the absence of sky lends a chasmic quality . Lincoln\n    follows the flow of residents up the avenue. Building signs read:\n    \"Dept. Of Labor\", \"Dept. Of Health\", \"Dept. Of Sanitation\". He\n    splits off, turning into a building marked \"Dept. Of Population.\"\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                            7.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>7   INT. OFFICES - DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION - DAY\n</b>\n    Frosted glass workstations, notably circular rather than square.\n    Lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen,\n    divided into three sections, a formation known as a \"visor\".\n    Right-visor shows a polymorph in fractal cycle, like a permanent\n    screen saver. Mid-visor shows a tomograph of a residential block;\n    tiers of apartments shown as boxes, most in solid white, a few\n    blink red with the text label \"Vacancy\". Left-visor shows a list\n    of names and sociographic grading sheaded \"Residents Pending\".\n\n<b>                                   LINCOLN (TO VISOR)\n</b>                     Hudson Four-Alpha; profile reviewed.\n                     Match to vacancy; 171, Sector 5.\n                     Request clearance to populate.\n\n<b>    - - PROCESSING . . .

Suddenly he breaks through with a\n    left hook. Jones staggers back. A strange ripple distorts his\n    face. Stranger still, his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor.\n\n    As the bout continues, we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed\n    a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring.\n    With Lincoln in FG, we now see another figure in the outer ring,\n    mirroring his moves, dressed identically but for the gloves which\n    are like gauntlets. The gauntlets are rigged to two armatures\n    which are, in turn, rigged to a gantry-like mechanism. It glides\n\n    noiselessly to and fro, shadowing the figure round the outer ring.\n    RACK FOCUS reveals the figure is also Lincoln . The real Lincoln,\n    in fact. The one in FG is a derivative hologram known as a \"proxy\".\n    As Lincoln fakes and jabs, the counter-weighted armatures drag\n    and recoil, duplicating the exertions of his proxy. Jones moves\n    more sluggishly, his proxy now ghostly, transparent. Now being\n    sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left\n    hook. Jones' proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     9.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                               LINCOLN\n</b>                   Whoooooo!\n\n    Lincoln proxy - and Lincoln - punch the air in victory.

THE WORLD OUTSIDE - DAY\n</b>     A i r blasts up from a giant tunnel.\n\n     W i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust,\n     backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. At the hub of the ring is\n     a large cubic building. From its facets, giant appendages of\n     ducting plunge into its surround. These are the inlets for the\n     processed air that feeds the underground...\n\n     This is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above.\n\n     F r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a\n     large industrial complex. More cubic buildings, cream colored,\n     windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. Now we see the\n     front of the complex. The planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the\n     entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye.\n\n     F r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the\n     ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway,\n     lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a \"lodeway\".\n     From the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red\n     rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. The gates\n     now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall-\n\n     The shimmering bleached wilderness of The Arizona Desert.\n     O u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a\n     vehicle emerges from the shimmer. A hybrid of bus and nautical\n     craft, single hulled, known simply as a \"liner\". Now as the\n     liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a\n     crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d \"The Sanger Institute\".\n<b>20   INT .

The men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury.\n     The women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and\n     haute couture. They filter into the entrance hall to be greeted\n     by the courtesy staff. Pretty girls in short skirts and blazers\n     with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named LYDIA.\n\n<b>                                  LYDIA\n</b>                    L a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is Lydia\n                    and on behalf of our staff, I'd like\n                    t o welcome you to The Sanger Institute.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                          18.\n</b>\n                                    LYDIA (cont'd)\n                    Before we start the tour, we'll be serv-\n                    i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center\n                    and circulating our standard discretion\n                    agreements.

Here, Lydia\n     assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. The\n     holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins:\n     A series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame --\n     a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a\n     mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain.\n     The group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles.

On closer inspection, more like a chamber of horrors.\n     I n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen. Another,\n     magnified, shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back.

A history of our\n                   battles with mortality... and defeats.\n                   Take the stem cell, for instance. A bid\n                   to cultivate human parts for transplant -\n                   in rodents, primates, barnyard animals.\n                   It's enough to make your skin crawl. In\n                   some cases literally, giving rise to a\n                   new range of cross-species viruses. But\n                   that's how we learn. From our mistakes.\n     The y turn a corner. Another hall of windows, portals onto tanks\n     of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde. Suspended within are\n     embryos, fetuses and infants. All human. All grotesquely mutated.\n\n<b>                               DR. SANGER\n</b>                   C a s e in point, the clone. Back in the\n                   beginning, the mapping of the human\n                   genome was declared a historic landmark-\n                   t o break the curse of heredity, to\n                   correct congenital defect... genetic\n                   engineering became the brave new world\n                   of medical science. A bright future\n                   that led to a dark age and much of the\n                   legislation we know today. But while\n                   the clone laws may have narrowed the\n                   field, science marches on. Only to hit\n                   the same wall over and over again - the\n                   enigma of growth, the alchemy that\n                   takes us from embryo to adult. A clone\n                   barely reaches infancy before its\n                   growth enzymes misfire, resulting in\n                   the kind of monstrosities - which are\n                   only effigies - you see here.\n\n     S o m e reassured sighs from the women.

But as many of\n             our clients leave it till late in life\n             to take out the policy, we do offer the\n             option for early harvest.

For them, the\n             agnate obviates costly and ineffective\n             treatment programs.

A troubled one speaks up-\n\n<b>                          T O U R MEMBER\n</b>              This \"agnate\"... what happens to it?\n              After our friend here gets his kidney.\n\n<b>                            DR. SANGER\n</b>              That's entirely his decision. Our role\n              is intermediary. We, as the insurance\n              provider, guarantee the condition and\n              availability of the agnate but all\n              other rights are retained. In legal\n              terms, the policy holder is defined as\n              a \"sponsor\". The premiums, in effect,\n              becoming sponsorship payments,\n              maintaining the agnate until such time\n              as harvest is required. At such time\n              and where feasible, the sponsor has\n              the option to extend sponsorship,\n              retaining the agnate for secondary\n              harvest or, shall we say, let the\n              policy expire.\n\n<b>                             T O U R MEMBER\n</b>              E x p i r e ?

Not as you and I know it, at least.\n              The associations of life and death are\n              no more applicable to an agnate than to\n              a cow in a field. It exists in a state\n              of limited consciousness - aware not of\n              life but of functionality. Imbued with\n              the knowledge to maintain its function\n              but without the capacity to question it.\n              And yet, in many ways, the end if the\n              most humane part of the process. The\n              agnate goes to harvest without any fore-\n              b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the\n              sleep from whence it came. Eternal or\n              otherwise. There is mortality for an\n              agnate. Just utility and redundancy.\n\n<b>                        T O U R MEMBER\n</b>              S o it doesn't know?

As I\n              said, the law prohibits genetic\n              alteration so a defect endemic in a\n              sponsor will also be present in their\n              agnate. No, what the maternity plan\n              provides is a way round the risks and\n              rigors of childbirth. Under this plan,\n              an agnate becomes eligible for\n              pregnancy shortly after foundation. A\n              simple donation of sperm from the\n              father, then the agnate is fertilized\n              and brings your baby to term.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                      24.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                THE WASP\n</b>                     An d then what?

In\n     the tank, Lincoln's fingers caress only the gel, his fingertips\n     met by soft arcs of light - neurological charges, conducted by\n     the gel, creating the sense of touch. They are known as \"impulse\n     arcs\". Redhead proxy responds, dappling her lips across Lincoln\n     proxy's neck. In the tank, impulse arcs flicker across Lincoln's\n     throat, then down his chest, descending to more erogenous zones.\n     Lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes, yielding to the sensation.\n\n     The sensation engulfing him, Lincoln's brow starts to furrow. Not\n     with ecstasy. Something darker. His eyes open, his pupils fixed\n     in a black dilated stare. Resisting the artificiality, his face\n     forming a sneer, tightening until... he slams h i s palm into the\n     touchpad. The tank shakes. The proxies blink out.

If\n              the agnate doesn't come together on the\n              first pass, we have to abort and start\n              over. It's like breaking inertia. The\n              bioreactor, the growth medium - we just\n              keep upping the levels till we achieve\n              integration. At which stage the agnate\n              is deemed physically stable. We rely on\n              foundation to provide mental stability -\n              matching the templates to their capacity\n              but walling it in with parameters.\n                     ( b e a t , considers the proxy)\n              When signs of instability started to\n              show up, it pointed to foundation. A\n              hole in the wall, an oversight. But it\n              was only happening in the later generat-\n              ions .

As if he could ever forget what he's seen.\n\n<b>65   INT . CENTERVILLE - DAY\n</b>\n     The routine flow of residents up the avenue. Lincoln walks, head\n     bowed, trying to look inconspicuous.

Footsteps\n     audible. Lincoln jams the tri-key i n t o the lock. And waits. The\n     seconds pass. But the door doesn't open. Lincoln looks around\n     for another exit. Ester looks at him in mounting panic then--\n     THE PRESSURE DOOR OPENS: not onto a corridor but an elevator\n     car. Pulling Ester inside, Lincoln finds an array of buttons.\n     His fingers hovers, uncertain which to press.

The door hisses open.\n\n<b>74   INT . FOUNDATION CHAMBERS\n</b>\n     Amber light. The sound of slow bubbling. Lincoln and Ester pause\n     to adjust to the gloom. They are in a hall of windows. Ester is\n     the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window.\n\n     Behind the glass is a foundation tank. Bubbling with viscous\n     fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. The\n     tubes connect to a form. A human form, an adult form but curled\n     foetally. I t is known as a \"nascent\". In this tank is a female\n     nascent, shifting slightly, causing Ester to gasp. The nascent\n     registers the noise, turning its head. Its eyelids are closed but\n     its eyeballs move, questioning. A slight furrow appears on its\n     crosshatched brow.

Tracking Scheer's advance, we INTERCUT:\n     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: Censors making their sweep. Strobes\n     of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks.\n     It angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then\n     fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow.\n     ANOTHER FOUNDATION CHAMBER: another contingent moves up another\n     row of foundation tanks. The nascents within have cables plugged\n     into their ears, filaments pulsing. The nascents a r e in a posture\n     of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression.\n\n     RETURNING TO SCHEER as he reaches the end of the first chamber.\n     No further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks.\n     He pauses, confused for a second.

Her eyes widening, senses flooding. The howling wind, the\n     swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. Her reel\n     returning her to face Lincoln, Ester opens her mouth to speak.\n     But all that comes is A SCREAM. A scream from deep within, shrill\n     and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. Lincoln grabs\n     her and covers her mouth. Fighting to stifle her, rocking to her\n     convulsions. But Ester keeps screaming. A scream of everything.\n\n<b>87   INT . BEDROOM - SOMEWHERE - LATE NIGHT\n</b>\n     All is still. Just a muted shudder of wind on glass. The room is\n     in shadow. All we see is a canopied bed where a figure,\n     obscured, lies sleeping. The still is disrupted by a chime. The\n     figure stirs, fumbling at the nightstand. A holoframe resolves,\n     the light revealing Dr. Sanger, rumpled by sleep.

Lincoln sleeps within, slumped against\n     the rock, his head bowed heavily. The touch of first light opens\n     his eyes. His brow creasing, as if waking from a bad dream into\n     a worse reality. He looks around only to find himself alone. He\n     gets up, a little shaky at first, then ventures out of the cave.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     58.\n</b>\n\n\n     He emerges onto a ledge, perhaps fifty feet up. He pauses, eyes\n     adjusting to the quality of light. He sees the storm has reduced\n     to a low wind, combing the floorland o f scrub. Now, across the\n     ledge, he sees Ester. Perched on an outcrop, hugging her knees,\n     watching the sunrise over the desert. He crosses and lowers to a\n     crouch beside her. Ester turns to him with a confused frown-\n\n<b>                                 ESTER\n</b>                    W h e r e did all the green go?\n     Lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes.

Lincoln rises again and\n     stands looking out across the desert, into the barren unknown.\n\n<b>89   EXT .

Lincoln\n     trudges into view, Ester lagging behind. He stops to let her\n     catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. He allows her a\n     moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     59.\n</b>\n\n\n     He surveys the terrain. His eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now\n     narrowing on an inconsistency. A faint strip where nothing seems\n     to grow. Tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. Then\n     drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust.\n\n     His fingers meet something hard. He sweeps off the dust to expose\n     a layer of concrete. Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line.\n     What we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him.\n     Continuing, opening a window in the dust. Now his fingers snag\n     o n something. He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to\n     reveal a section of rusted chainlink. A corner of metal is\n     visible. Lincoln exposes the rest. A sign, barely legible: \"US\n     Government - Restricted Area\". He frowns, trying to assimilate.\n     Ester comes up to join him. Off her anxious look, he decides-\n\n<b>                             LINCOLN\n</b>                    I think I've found a path.\n\n<b>92   EXT .

Dr. Sanger stands at a glass wall,\n     looking out across the green mountain valley. On the sofa sits\n     Merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry.

He's wearing\n      Ozzie's ballcap o v e r his crosshatch, his former clothes discarded\n      for some of the old man's ill-fitting denims. Perhaps a disguise\n      or perhaps just to shed the memory. He glances across at Ester,\n      dressed likewise, her hair teased to cover her crosshatch.

He\n      gives him the card, watching him slot it into a handheld device,\n      which briefly flashes, then the card is returned. Lincoln sees a\n      strip at the top is now transparent, like a depleted reservoir.\n      He assimilates. Not so different from the transactions in the\n      world below. Then he notices Ester is awake and is looking at\n      him.

They cross the\n      portal onto the street and stop, dazzled by the sunlight. Only to\n      be dazzled again by the sudden, stunning prospect of the city...\n\n      F i r s t there's the quality of light, a burning white, perhaps from\n      depleted ozone, depicting everything in a surreal shimmer. Then\n      there's the towers, darkly crystalline, facets of polarized glass\n      rising to domes and spires, like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for\n      the sky. The traffic flashing past, the chassis identifiable as\n      trucks, taxis, compacts, sedans, streamlined in a nautical trim,\n      hull runners in place of wheels. The sound of claxons, more like\n      fog horns than car horns.

The\n      citizens, strange hairstyles, fashions, all wearing sunglasses.\n      Even to us it's a wondrous sight.

Tail\n      wagging, it noses forward, sniffing. Then, abruptly, drops its\n      tail and backs off, whining. Lincoln and Ester likewise back off.\n      Both sides have just discovered a new species. The hobo pets his\n      whining canine, watching the strangers walk off with curiosity.\n\n<b>108   EXT .

Everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them...\n\n      The storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. The\n      glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: \"Temps! Temps!\n      New Tech Opportunities!\" - \"Beauty Therapy!

He scans the sea of faces. Then spots her stepping through\n      a doorway. Over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings,\n      circled by the legend \"Hog Heaven!

SEATING AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER\n</b>\n      Lincoln returns to Ester with a tray of food and drink. She's\n      staring off again, distant. He puts a burger and drink cup in\n      front of her. She seems not to notice. He tries to engage her-\n\n<b>                              LINCOLN\n</b>                     I asked the man how to get to the\n                     terminal.

Now the little girl notices the strangers,\n      staring at her. She hurries onward, uncomfortable. Lincoln and\n      Ester's eyes follow. It's the first time they've seen a child.\n\n<b>111   EXT . PHOENIX TERMINAL - DAY\n</b>\n      A low rumble. A plume of smoke. A sudden eruption of fire.

Then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. The\n      pupils, black and dilating. Suddenly the male jerks away, like a\n      shying horse, drawing the female with him. Diggs, unperturbed,\n      makes no attempt to follow. Turning his back on them, he touches\n      a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two-way radio-\n\n<b>                                     D I G G S (INTO RADIO)\n</b>                      B u r d i e , it's them.

Lincoln presses the pace, alert, darting looks back.\n      The pale man doesn't appear to be following. But the sense of\n      danger is spurring him to gain distance. Ester, vicarious to the\n      danger, stays close to Lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up.\n      Neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them,\n      kerbside. A commercial transit van known as a \"cutter\", it's a\n      common sight on the streets.

The dark giant is just another\n      stranger, cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry. He's offering an\n      opportunity to gain distance but Lincoln remains hesitant.

Like\n      eyeballs, watching, as Lincoln and Ester proceed up the corridor.\n      They stop at a door. Lincoln checks the number. Pauses heavily.\n      Then looks for some type of doorbell. As his eyes cross the orb,\n      it seems to blink. Then comes a sound of disengaging locks. Then\n      the door swings open. Lincoln flinches, taken by surprise. Then\n      frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door.\n\n<b>145   INT . APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\n      Lincoln enters, wary, scanning around. A living room. Framed\n      pictures. A sofa, chairs. A coffee table, empty bottles,\n      cigarette packs, a full ashtray. A bureau, some paperwork.\n      Silence, stillness. No sign of life, no sense of danger. Lincoln\n      moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the\n      papers.

His double seems to be as\nbelligerent as he is. Reasoning now, threat response kicking in.\nLincoln draws the hunting knife. Unused to it, he points it like\na gun. But it's enough of a threat for Tom, who swallows dryly-\n\n<b>                           TOM\n</b>                Why are you here?

If not for\nthe pounding headache this would be a bad dream. He lowers onto\nthe sofa. Finds a cigarette and lights up. A drag, mind kicking\nin. The knife cautioning him. With a slow exhale, he confesses-\n\n<b>                             TOM\n</b>                One of the partners at my firm... he\n                told me about it.

His trembling fingers\ntap the keypad and the safe hisses open. He draws out a contract\nfolder embossed with a crosshatch. Then offers it to his agnate-\n\n<b>                           TOM\n</b>               It's all right there. Who, why...\n\nLincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages,\nreading.

He pauses. Then returns to his double. The dreading eyes,\n      the trickle of blood down the face. His e y e s . His f a c e . A long,\n      foreboding moment. Then suddenly Lincoln lashes out. His fist\n      sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages.\n      Lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species.\n      His double is unmoving, unconscious. Lincoln abruptly spins away.\n\n<b>146   INT . ELEVATOR - DESCENDING\n</b>\n      The light panel flashes. Lincoln stands grimly, head lowered,\n      trying to fathom the anger roiling within.

His eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel.\n\n      The orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up.\n      Lincoln reviews it. A screen in front of him is flashing:\n      \"PILOTING: MANUAL/AUTO?\". He assimilates. Then ventures-\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     100.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                LINCOLN\n</b>                      Auto...\n\n      The interface processes, then asks: \"DESTINATION: NAME/ADDRESS?\"\n\n<b>                                 LINCOLN\n</b>                      O u t of state...

Lode-poles pulsing ahead\n      of them, the skiff moves out, as if pulled by a phantom tugboat.\n\n<b>148   EXT . STREET - DAY\n</b>\n      The skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet. Then stops\n      rocking a little. The interface reports: \"ESTABLISHING UPLINK\".\n      On another screen, a road map appears. A red dot plants at their\n      point of origin then bleeds into a red line, plotting a course.\n\n      The autopilot scans for traffic, then nudges forward on the\n      throttle. The resistors drone, the steering wheel turns and the\n      skiff noses onto the street. Finding its lane, it drops to\n      cruise speed. Lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel,\n      throttle and brake. Then glances at Ester. She's plunged in\n      thought, staring off. She turns to him with a haggard frown-\n\n<b>                                 ESTER\n</b>                      The man back there... who looked like\n                      you... does it mean I have someone too?\n\n      Lincoln looks at her blankly, unknowing. Ester stares off again,\n      her brow knotting with unanswered questions. But Lincoln's gaze\n      lingers. Her pale skin, her limpid eyes, her hair fluttering in\n      the breeze. It's the first time he's really seen Ester's beauty.\n\n<b>149   EXT . PHOENIX SKYLINE - DAY\n</b>\n      The domes and spires glint in the sunlight. We isolate a glass\n      steeple. A crosshatch insignia. A legend \"Sanger Industries\".\n\n<b>150   INT . CROWNE'S OFFICE - SANGER INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY\n</b>\n      A corner office with a panoramic view of the city. Crowne sits\n      at a console desk, reviewing some data on a holoframe screen.

STREET TUNNEL - DAY\n</b>\n      The skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass. The interface\n      flashes: \"UPLINK INTERRUPT... AUTOPILOT DISENGAGING\". Lincoln\n      sits up, confused. The skiff is now slowing, drifting as if cut\n      loose. He studies the controls again. Positions one hand on the\n      steering wheel, the other on the throttle. Then he nudges it.\n\n      The skiff lurches, veering out of its lane. Another vehicle zips\n      narrowly past, rocking them with its invisible backwash. Ester\n      looks at Lincoln, suddenly alarmed. Lincoln tries again, firm on\n      the wheel, gentle on the throttle. And the skiff eases forward.\n\n<b>152   EXT . MOTEL - DOWNTOWN PHOENIX - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>      D i s m a l . The kind of place that precedes a life on the street. We\n      push in on a window, cracked glass, the drapes closed within.\n\n<b>153   INT . MOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n      G l o o m y , musty. A \"holovision\" plays some type of NFL recap. But\n      Scheer is not watching it. He is lying on the bed, staring at\n      the ceiling, motionless. Off a beeping sound, he stirs. He taps\n      a holocom on the nightstand. A holoframe appears, resolving:\n\n                                  Merrick (ON HOLOCOM)\n                     K a r l , there's been a complication.\n\n<b>154   EXT .

Eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats.\n      Lincoln is driving more confidently now. Ester is huddled asleep\n      beside him. Suddenly the skiff starts to slow again. Lincoln\n      reviews the controls. Throttle, forward, foot, off the brake.\n      The interface flashes: \"REMOTE LOCKDOWN E N G A G I N G \" . The skiff is\n      steering itself onto the hard shoulder. It now pulls to a dead\n      halt. Ester is woken by the sudden inertia. She opens her eyes\n      and looks around. They've stopped in the middle of nowhere.\n\n<b>155   EXT . THE SALT FLATS - SUNSET\n</b>\n      The sun sinks in a slow pink haze. Lincoln and Ester walk across\n      the salt flats. Visible in the distance is a walled settlement.\n\n<b>156   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET\n</b>\n      An adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway. Lincoln\n      and Ester approach. They haven't walked far but Ester is already\n      short of breath. As they near the gateway a holoserve appears,\n      like a sentry - Native American, buckskins, feathered headdress\n      and facepaint. His voice seems as old as the wind-\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     102.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                    THE INDIAN HOLOGRAM\n</b>                     Welcome to Salt River Heritage Park,\n                     home to the Hohokam Nation for over two\n                     thousand years.

With the sun hazing through, the holoserve\n      s e e m s angelic or ghostly. She's examining his striped facepaint-\n\n<b>                               ESTER\n</b>                     He has marks on his face like us.\n\n      She turns to Lincoln with a flowering smile. Then rushes up to\n      the gateway, suddenly galvanized, squeezing through a gap.\n\n<b>157   EXT . THE HERITAGE PARK - SUNSET\n</b>\n      A ring of Native American pueblos. Pithouses a n d coursed adobes,\n      recreations and preserved ruins. Ester rushes around the ring,\n      looking into the pueblos as if expecting to find them inhabited.\n      She ducks into one of the pithouses. Lincoln follows her inside.\n\n<b>158   INT . PITHOUSE - SUNSET\n</b>\n      The mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs, cholla branches.\n      It's cosy in here, dim. The living area, recreated with mats and\n      pottery. Lincoln finds Ester looking around, between excitement\n      and confusion. She turns to him, her voice wavering, wheezing-\n\n<b>                               ESTER\n</b>                     Is this... is this place The Island?\n      Lincoln answers with a softly negating look. Ester's face slowly\n      falls, the energy draining from her eyes. She lowers onto one of\n      the mats and lies down, huddling. She looks up to him, wheezing-\n\n<b>                                ESTER\n</b>                     I'm tired. Let me rest for a while.\n\n<b>159   EXT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n      Silence prevails but for the faint rattle of Ester's breathing.\n      Lincoln sits on low stool, in sentinel over her as she sleeps.\n      In his eyes, we see the weight of foreboding. He doesn't know\n      what they'll do when she wakes. Of a moaning sound he looks at\n      Ester. Then realizes it isn't coming from her. The sound is far\n      off, a rhythmic moaning. Now discernible as the chant of voices.\n\n<b>160   EXT . THE PLATFORM MOUND - NIGHT\n</b>      A blazing fire. Figures in silhouette, moving around, chanting.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     103.\n</b>\n\n\n      The platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park. An\n      ancient ceremonial site, stepped in ruins, dusted with caliche.\n      Pima and Maricopa, descendants of the Hohokam, are congregated\n      for a solstice ceremony. Off to the side, a group of horses are\n      tethered, shuffling, snorting. Lincoln approaches, cautiously,\n      but somehow like a moth to the flame. He stops at a distance,\n      watching. The curiosity of congruent sound and movement.\n\n<b>                                VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                     You look a little lost, my friend.\n\n      Lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night. A tall man -\n      swarthy skin, mist-colored eyes. His tribal name is GREY DOVE-\n\n                               GREY DOVE (cont'd)\n                     Or did you come here for a reason?\n\n      Lincoln examines the tall man. The face seems as deep and gentle\n      as the voice. His sense of danger, unstirring, he concedes-\n\n<b>                              LINCOLN\n</b>                     I was looking for water.\n\n<b>                                GREY DOVE\n</b>                     Not the best place to look.\n\n<b>                               LINCOLN\n</b>                     My transport... it stopped working.\n\n<b>                              GREY DOVE\n</b>                     I see.

Grey Dove\n      considers him. This bruised, weary outsider is somehow childlike.\n\n<b>161   EXT . THE CEREMONY - LATER\n</b>\n      The fire blazes across the face of a shaman. Old, gnarled, and\n      dry as the salt flats. With a sacred mutter, he slips a peyote\n      button onto his tongue. Then flings back his head, casting his\n      eyes to the stars. When he lowers his head again, we see his\n      pupils dilating. He rises, chanting, moving in ceremonial steps\n      around the fire. Tribespeople s i t in a ring, joining the chant.\n\n      Beyond the ring, others are dining at a roasting pit. Roast\n      rabbit. Cornflour bread. The food is as it might been two\n      thousand years ago. Only the sight of plastic water gallons\n      breaks the illusion. Lincoln stands apart with Grey Dove, eating\n      ravenously, gulping from a water gallon. He looks around-\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     104.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                 LINCOLN\n</b>                     What is this place?\n\n<b>                               GREY DOVE\n</b>                     It is a sacred place. My people come\n                     here to commune with their spirits.\n\n      Lincoln looks at him, puzzled. Grey Dove smiles tolerantly.\n\n<b>                                     GREY DOVE\n</b>                     Not easy to understand perhaps. For us,\n                     the spirit is like the shadow on the\n                     rock. Sometimes close, sometimes far\n                     away, sometimes the sky clouds and the\n                     shadow fades. We come here to ask our\n                     spirits to return to us. The man...\n                           (gestures to the shaman)\n                     He speaks to The Grandfather from whom\n                     all spirits are born. The Great Spirit\n                     who binds every living thing. He has no\n                     name. But he is everywhere. In the sun\n                     and the moon, the wind and the rain...\n\n      The shaman's chanting grows louder, more insistent. His circuit\n      around the fire becoming faster, building in religious fervor.\n\n<b>                                GREY DOVE\n</b>                     Now he asks for the gift of vision that\n                     he may see through to the spirit shape\n                     of things. To find the spirits of the\n                     lost. To bring them into the light...\n\n      The shaman's chanting suddenly stops. He is looking directly at\n      Lincoln, pointing. His face, contorting with what might be anger\n      or fear. He starts babbling in dialect, ardently. Lincoln frowns\n      in confusion. Grey Dove quietly draws him away from the mound.\n\n<b>162   INT . PITHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER\n</b>\n      Ester stirs from slumber. On the ground beside her, she finds a\n      bowl of food and a water gallon. Now through the gloom, she sees\n      Lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil.\n      Something seems different about him as he turns, registering her-\n\n<b>                                LINCOLN\n</b>                     A r e you alright?\n\n<b>                              ESTER\n</b>                     I feel better after I sleep.\n\n      Lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. Ester\n      moves closer, sensing something. He speaks as if from far away-\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                      105.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                LINCOLN\n</b>                     The man out there... he said\n                     everything has a spirit... every\n                     living thing... but not...\n\n      His voice cuts off. Ester looks at him, recognizing his pain.\n      She doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. It's pain\n      and it evokes a response in her. A feeling, taking her over. Her\n      hand reaches out and strokes his hair. Lincoln looks up at her,\n      questioning. With supreme knowing, Ester leans down and kisses\n      him. At the touch of her lips, Lincoln pauses. The first kiss\n      for both of them but Ester takes it in her stride. The calm\n      ballet of nature. Fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts\n      steeping with moonlight. Lincoln rising to face her, feeling her\n      proximity, her radiant heat. His fingers touching her breasts.\n      Ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. Lincoln closing\n      his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. He yields to it,\n      returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit.\n\n<b>163   EXT . THE INTERSTATE - DAWN\n</b>\n      The sun rises in the east, depicting the traffic in silhouette.\n      A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where\n      the skiff sits abandoned. The grey cutter pulls to a halt.\n\n<b>164   EXT . HARD SHOULDER - DAWN\n</b>\n      D i g g s and Burdon move up on the skiff, cover positions, weapons\n      levelled. Burdon spins in to the driver side, snapping aim with\n      the thunderbolt. But the skiff is empty. The only sign of life\n      is the interface, flashing red: \"REMOTE LOCATOR TRANSMITTING\".\n\n      B u r d o n exchanges a look with Diggs. No dice. Diggs reaches in his\n      pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope. He\n      puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats. Burdon crouches at\n      the roadside, looking for tracks. Then Diggs fixes on something-\n\n<b>                              DIGGS\n</b>                     I got thermals.\n\n<b>165   EXT .

Diggs\n      and Burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. The horses\n      bristle and snort, betraying their approach. The tribespeople,\n      stirred by the noise, awake. Diggs and Burdon swing aim around\n      the ring as faces rise and stare at them. None of the faces have\n      white skin. Diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering-\n\n<b>                                DIGGS\n</b>                     I'm looking for two bond runners.

SALT MOUNTAINS - SUNRISE\n</b>\n      The sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge.\n      Lincoln and Ester clamber over the calcified rocks. Ester now\n      stops to catch her breath. She is wheezing again, fighting for\n      air.

SALT CANYON - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n      A freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of\n      low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height.\n      The conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known\n      as a \"lode-canal\". At each end of the canyon, it intersects with\n      other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system\n      of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic.\n      High above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find Lincoln and\n      Ester. Ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. She looks down at\n      the passing vessel, daunted.

THE NORTH RIDGE - MORNING\n</b>\n      The north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the\n      grey cutter pulling up. Diggs and Burdon get out and look down\n      into the canyon. Diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning.\n      Burdon peels off his jacket. It's early but it's already getting\n      hot. Diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion-\n\n<b>                                DIGGS\n</b>                      Up there in the rocks.

Ester is muffling\n      her breaths as best she can. Lincoln now hazards a look over the\n      top. Two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon,\n      now pointing in their direction. He ducks back, assimilating.\n      Hiding, no longer an option. Nor running, at least for Ester.\n      His face sets in a grimace of conviction. His eyes glow darkly.\n\n<b>171   EXT . THE NORTH FACE - MORNING\n</b>\n      Diggs and Burdon reach the foot of the rocks. Neither speaks,\n      communicating in hand-signals. Diggs slips into the lode-canal.\n      Burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face.\n\n      Diggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. He stays low,\n      moving up into the rocks. Then, from above, a rock dislodges,\n      rattling down. Diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire-\n\n      - B O O M - B O O M - The shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock.\n      The thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, Burdon firing from\n      the far side - SHOTS, BOLTS, KICKING UP A STORM OF DUST --\n      SUDDENLY HOLDING FIRE, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading.\n      No sign of movement.

Then\n      elbows the glass. Reaching inside, turning the lock. He enters\n      the studio, glancing at the sculptures. Moving through the home.\n\n      S i l e n t l y , systematically, checking the rooms. He reaches the\n      guest bedroom, looks around. Something catches his eye. Spots of\n      blood of the linens. Eyes honing, he moves on into the kitchen.\n      He discovers a holocom keypad on the counter. Taps some keys.\n      The holoframe flashes \"REDIALLING\". The holoframe snows with\n      static.

Lincoln looks at them,\n      expectantly. There's a pause. Then Dr. Abrams speaks-\n\n<b>                                 D R . ABRAMS\n</b>                     Your friend... she has pneumonia.

The\n                     other is a nodal transfusion. Katherine\n                     has agreed to be the donor. But the new\n                     antibodies may not conform fully.

If we\n                     don't act, the infection will take over.\n\n      Lincoln lowers into a chair. He feels a pain somewhere. He can't\n      quite pin down where. Or what caused it. Or why it hurts so bad.\n\n<b>189   INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>      Ester lies in bed, dozing, looking more relaxed. Her oxygen mask\n      makes breathing easier.

He looks sallow from\n      sleeplessness. The facial hair makes him look like a shadow of\n      his former self. For an instant he tenses at a light blinking in\n      the glass. Blue light. Like etherscreen. Then he sees it's just\n      a humidifier on the far wall. Tension ebbing, he splashes some\n      more water. When he looks up again, he sees his pupils are\n      dilating.

Then, with a trembling finger points to one of the\n      tanks. Lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet.\n      He wipes the condensation off the glass. Suspended in the block\n      of ice is a shadow. A human figure. A device is attached to his\n      stomach. Lincoln looks at the bio-monitors. A screen reads:\n\n<b>      \" P R O D U C T ID: STARKWEATHER/ FOUNDATION: II/ GENERATION: DELTA\".\n</b>\n      Lincoln looks across the EKG, the cardiograph, indications that\n      Starkweather is still alive. Then he fixes on the RFI m o n i t o r . A\n      resonant image of the brain. The shifting aura showing a level of\n      consciousness. What thoughts must be going through that mind?\n      The fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration. To be kept on\n      i c e for future harvest.

A\n                    year in hiding, waiting for things to\n                    quiet down. I don't know how many made\n                    i t out or how many who did, survived. I\n                    know there are people called politicians\n                    trying to say it never happened. That's\n                    why I've kept this journal. To keep the\n                    truth alive. Alive... I've learned what\n                    that means but it still confuses me. In\n                    functional terms, I've been alive for ten\n                    years. In human terms, more than thirty.\n                    Human... I'm not sure about that one\n                    either. They say I'm not human because\n                    I have no mother or father. I guess I\n                    have more to learn. But one word I do\n                    understand is hope. So maybe this\n                    j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like\n                    me, who may be out there.

At first just a gurgle. Then a moan.\n      Becoming the sound of A BABY CRYING. Lincoln crosses to a cot.\n      He lifts up a baby boy, 6 months old, bawling and squirming.\n\n<b>                              A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                    Is he hungry again? I just fed him.\n\n      Ester steps into the room, sleep-mussed, her beauty deepened by\n      maternity. The baby reaches out for her. Lincoln hands him over-\n\n<b>                                   LINCOLN\n</b>                    Lincoln Junior, huh? It still doesn't\n                    sound right.

Lincoln smiles at her, then the baby,\n      sweeping the hair from the forehead. Unscarred, blemishless.\n\n<b>                              LINCOLN\n</b>                    We should finish packing.\n\n<b>224   EXT .

And we recognize\n      Katherine, holding the baby as Lincoln and Ester finish loading.\n      The last canister stowed, Lincoln comes up to her. He smiles at\n      the sight of her with the baby. Then prompts her gently-\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                       138.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                 LINCOLN\n</b>                     Time to go.\n      Katherine hesitates, part of her unwilling to let the baby go.\n      Then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets\n      Ester take him. Lincoln presents her with the data tablet-\n\n<b>                                   LINCOLN\n</b>                     You'll make sure this gets out?\n\n<b>                                 KATHERINE\n</b>                     Yes .

Nothing more to say, she hugs him.\n      Then turns to Ester with the baby. She folds them in a yearning,\n      almost maternal embrace. Tears well in her eyes. Then the sorrow\n      turns to laughter as the baby starts tugging at her gray hair.\n\n<b>225   EXT . THE PACIFIC - DAWN\n</b>\n      The sun rises in the east, casting the coastline in silhouette.\n      The light glows across Lincoln's face, at the helm of the yacht,\n      staring back to the shore. He looks at Ester sitting beside him,\n      the baby swaddled in a blanket at her breast. Then he looks out\n      to the west, to the soft reach of dawn and the boundless horizon\n      of sea. There never was an island. But perhaps there will be...\n\n\n\n<b>                                      T H E END\n</b><b>\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Island,-The.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Island, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Caspian Tredwell-Owen\" title=\"Scripts by Caspian Tredwell-Owen\">Caspian Tredwell-Owen</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Island, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Island, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:08:19.733321"}
