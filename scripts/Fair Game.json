Was she really\r\n                    simply a glorified typist?\r\n          \r\n<b>                              ROGERS\r\n</b>                    Well, I think it's really all about\r\n                    the money. We're talking about a\r\n                    third-rate CIA agent who had a\r\n                    government salary, and she had sent\r\n                    her husband to Niger, and he had\r\n                    come back and didn't give the\r\n                    report to the CIA, but he turned it\r\n                    over in an op-ed to The New York\r\n                    Times. So she was already in the\r\n                    hot seat with the CIA, and so now\r\n                    she's all about the money. Plus\r\n                    it's come out that she was\r\n                    considered kind of a mediocre agent\r\n                    at best.\r\n          \r\n<b>          INT. LIVING ROOM.

I'm grateful for this\r\n                      opportunity to set the record\r\n                      straight.
