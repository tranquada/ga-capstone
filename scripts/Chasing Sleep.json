BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\nEd lies awake in bed.  He is sweaty and nervous.  His eyes are wide-open, blood-shot and tired.\n\n\nHe picks up his bedside clock which is ticking loudly.  It is 3:37.\n\n\nHe looks over at the other side of the\nqueen-size bed. It is still made. He picks a long, blonde hair from the\npillow and examines it curiously.\n\n\nThere is a noise outside and Ed gets up to investigate.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n\nEd walks through the dark hallway and into the living room of his small house.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nBy the front door, hanging on the wall, is a\nframed picture of Eve, Ed's wife. Ed passes by it and looks outside\nthrough the window. There is some wind outside, but nothing else.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd looks longingly at his reflection. Ed Saxon,\n45, is a morbid, insecure man. His frustration with his life has tinged\nhis sense of humor with an acerbic bite. His early success, a few\npublications of his poetry, has given him a professorship at the\nUniversity. He is well-read, intelligent, a bit pompous and\noccasionally condescending. But mostly, these qualities are restrained\nand his outward appearance is a little sorrowful. There is an\nunquestionable charm about him, and its effect is evident in the people\naround him.\n\n\nHe searches through the medicine cabinet, which\nis full of women's items, and takes out a Cosco-sized bottle of\nsleeping pills. He reads the back and takes two.\n\n\nHe hears something bang against the front door.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nHe opens the front door and takes a step outside.\n\n\nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT\n\n\nHe looks down by his feet and finds the morning\npaper, wrapped in blue plastic, lying on the doormat. He picks it up\nand goes back inside.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd stands helplessly in the empty living room.  \n\n\nEd's desk sits on one side of the living room,\ncrammed into the corner. He searches quickly through the stuff on the\ndesk and finds a small address book. He finds a name in the book and\ndials the number.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\n(over phone)\n\n\nHello?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSusie.  Hi, it's Ed.  I'm sorry I woke you up.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nIs something wrong?\n\n\nED\n\n\nEve isn't there, is she?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nNo.  She's not there?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  She didn't come home after work.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nOh, no.  Didn't she call or anything?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  She was supposed to be home around six.  I cooked her dinner.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nCould she have gone anywhere else?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't think so.  Do you?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm a little worried.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nI bet.  Did you call Harborview?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  Do you think I should?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nYeah.  If she got into an accident of something, they would take her there.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou don't think that's overreacting?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nDon't be silly.  Just call them.  It can't hurt.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAlright.  But if she comes home later and it turns out to be nothing, don't tell her I called the hospital, OK?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nCall me back.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAlright.\n\n\nEd finds the Yellow Pages and finds a page of\n\"non-emergency\" numbers. His finger runs down the list: Trauma, Fire,\nDisaster, etc. until he comes to Hospitals and then Harborview. He\ndials the number.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nHarborview.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello.  I wanted to find out if someone had come in.  In an emergency, maybe.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nHold on.\n\n\nShe transfers him and the phone rings again.\n\n\nNURSE\n\n\nEmergency room.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI wanted to find out if someone had been brought in.\n\n\nNURSE\n\n\nWhat's the last name?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSaxon.  Eve Saxon.\n\n\nNURSE\n\n\nAre you a relative?\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe's my wife.\n\n\nNURSE\n\n\nOne second.  No.  No one with last name Saxon.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAre there any other hospitals that I could check?\n\n\nNURSE\n\n\nWell, we serve as the emergency room for King County,\nso unless they specified a hospital, they would have been brought here.\nIn an emergency.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOK.  Thank you.\n\n\nHe calls Susie back.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nJeez.  Did you guys have a fight?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  No.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nDid you call the school?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYeah, a while ago.  No one answered the phone there.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nIt's not like her to not call, is it?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, she would have called.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nWhy don't you call the police?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe police?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nMaybe they know something?  Like if she was in an accident.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's going a little far, don't you think?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nI don't know.  If you're worried...It's not like the police have anything better to do.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI guess.  OK.  I'll call you tomorrow.  Sorry to wake you up.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nIt's OK.  Call me tomorrow.\n\n\nHe hangs up.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n\nEd looks around the kitchen, searching lazily\nfor something to eat. He opens a cabinet that is full of boxes of\nfat-free Skin-EE( chocolate-marshmallow cookies.\n\n\nHe opens the fridge, looks around and takes the\nplate of food he made for his wife. He takes off the cellophane and\nstarts to eat.\n\n\nHe sits at the table, but after a few more bites, he loses his appetite. \n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\nEd sits at his desk, staring at the phone.  He takes a breath and calls 911.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\n911 emergency.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHi.  I don't think this is an emergency.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\n\nED\n\n\nMy wife hasn't come home and, I don't know..I wanted to check with the police to see if there was an accident.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nWhen was the last time you saw her?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThis morning.  She was supposed to come home from work, but she didn't.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nWhen does she get off work?\n\n\nED\n\n\nAround six.  Usually.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nShe hasn't called since then?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nDo you have any idea where she might have gone?  Maybe to a friend's house?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't think so.  I called the only place I could think of.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nBut you were expecting her home.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  I cooked dinner.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nI could send a police officer to your house.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDo you think that's necessary?  Maybe I should wait.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nUntil when?  It's five in the morning.\n\n\nED\n\n\nMaybe she went somewhere.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nWhere?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know.  Should I be worried?\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nI would be.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, I'm worried.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nSo, do you want me to send an officer to your house?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't think so.  I think I should wait.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nDo you think she's going to come home soon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI hope so.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nSo do I.  How long are you going to wait?\n\n\nED\n\n\nA little longer.  I think I may be overreacting.  She might have gone somewhere I can't think of.  Sometimes I worry too much.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nOK.  It's up to you.  My name is Paul.  I'll be here if you change your mind.\n\n\nEd hangs up.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd takes the sleeping pills from the medicine cabinet and takes two more.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEve has a small room in the house that Ed is\ncautious about entering. He walks in and looks around, as if he hasn't\nbeen in there for a while.\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nThe room is painted sky-blue and the ceiling has clouds painted on it.\n\n\nOn one side of the room, there is a console piano with some sheet music resting on it.\n\n\nOn the other side of the room is a small,\nantique writing desk. Ed sits down and looks at some of the items lying\non it. There are a couple of letters and an address book. There is a\nbox containing paper clips, etc. There is an open box of Skin-EE(\ncookies.\n\n\nThere is a drawer in the desk which he tries to\nopen, but finds that it is locked. He searches around the desk for a\nkey, but can'' find one. He presses a little harder at the drawer, but\nit won't budge. He takes a letter opener from a jar on the desk and\nstarts to fidget with it, but he still can't open it.\n\n\nThen he hears some distant voices coming from\noutside. He looks out the window where he can see the house next door.\nThere is a light on in the neighbor's window, where the voices are\ncoming from, and some vague shadows move around inside. Ed turns off\nthe lights in Eve's room, so that he can see more clearly.\n\n\nFrom the muffled sounds, it is soon clear that the couple next door is having an argument.\n\n\nOnly the woman's voice is clear.\n\n\nWOMAN\n\n\nI hate you! Stay away from me! Don't touch me! Just go\nto sleep! I'll scream! I am not screaming now! You don't know anything\nabout me!\n\n\nThen the noise dies down and the woman can be heard sobbing in the distance.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\nEd picks up the phone and dials 911.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\n911 emergency.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHi.  I called before.  I think I was talking to Paul.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nHold on.\n\n\nPaul comes on the line.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nThis is Paul.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHi.  I called before.  My wife hasn't come home.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nYes.  I remember.  You want me to send an officer over?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nWhat's your address?\n\n\nED\n\n\n4523 East Street.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nHe should be there in a few minutes.  OK?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Thank you.\n\n\nOPERATOR\n\n\nYou did the right thing, sir.\n\n\nEd hangs up. Almost instantly, he sees some\nlights pass by the window. He looks through the window and sees a\npolice car pull up. He opens the door and watches the officer as he\napproaches the house.\n\n\nOFFICER STEWART is a youngish patrolman.  He is relaxed, caring and formal.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nYou called the police?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  It was me.  That was fast.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nCome in.\n\n\nStewart is led a few steps into the living room.  He looks around.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nYour wife didn't come home?  Is that right?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nWhen was the last time you saw her?\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhen she left for work this morning.  She was supposed to come home after work.  I cooked dinner.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nAnd she made it to work, right?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  I think so.  I don't know.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nWhat time does she usually come home?  Around six?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Usually.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nWhat does she look like?\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe's blonde, straight hair.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nWhat was she wearing?  Do you remember?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI think it was a red sweater and a dress.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nWhat kind of car does she drive?\n\n\nED\n\n\nA Volvo.  Gray.  '85, I think.\n\n\nStewart lets out a sigh of relief.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nWell, you had me worried. There was a blonde woman\ninvolved with a car-jacking around six. Apparently she was hit on the\nhead by one of the perpetrators and then wandered away from the\nincident in a daze. Nobody's seen her since. When I got the call on the\nradio, I thought that must have been your wife, but this woman was\ndriving a Pathfinder and was wearing jeans, so it probably wasn't her.\nYou had me worried.\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe drove a Volvo.  Drives a Volvo.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nThat's a relief.  Do you know anywhere your wife might have gone?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI called the only place I could think of.  And I called the hospital.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nHarborview?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nStewart takes a couple of pills from a bottle and takes them, chasing them down with a coffee he has with him.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nI'm afraid there's not much I can do now. By law, we\ncan't put out a missing persons until 72 hours has elapsed since the\nlast time she was seen.\n\n\nED\n\n\n72 hours?\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nUsually in these cases, it was something stupid. Maybe\nshe was upset about something, had to get away. Who knows? What I can\ndo is take the license plate number of her car and if it shows up for\nsome reason, we'll give you a call. Do you have your wife's license\nplate number?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Actually, it's easy to remember.  007 FEC.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nJames Bond.\n\n\nED\n\n\nRight.  And FEC, For Every Child.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nAnd what's her name?\n\n\nED\n\n\nEve.  Eve Saxon.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nAnd your name?\n\n\nED\n\n\nEd.  Saxon.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nLike I said, it was probably something stupid.  Did you have a fight?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNot at all.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nWell, you should try to get some sleep and, if she\ndoesn't show up tomorrow, give us a call and we'll see what things look\nlike then. OK?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Thank you.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nUsually, they come back.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Thank you.  I feel much better now.  Thank you for coming.\n\n\nSTEWART\n\n\nNo problem.  You have a good night.  Or morning, I guess.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  You too.\n\n\nEd shuts the door. He's a little wired so he\nsits at his desk and picks up a pile of his students' papers. He reads\nthe one on top, marking it with a red pen as he does.\n\n\nHe hears a gurgling noise coming quietly from the bathroom.  He gets up and walks into the-\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe looks around the bathroom, tracing the sound\nto the bathtub drain. It gets louder as he approaches it, but before he\ncan investigate, there is a knock on the front door.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n\nWhen Ed comes out to answer the door, it is now bright daylight outside.  \n\n\nThe sun is streaming in through the windows.\nThrough the washed-out sunlight outside his window, Ed can see a police\ncar parked in front of his house. \n\nSomeone knocks again and Ed answers the door.\nAs he does, he picks up the mail that has been dropped through the slot\nin the door.\n\n\nDETECTIVE DERM, 46, stands outside in plain\nclothes. Derm is, above all, a nice man. Experience has given him a\nknowing stare, but he is affable, not suspicious. He is consistently\nprofessional and genuinely concerned.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nSorry to wake you up.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI wasn't asleep.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nOh.  I called a few times and when there wasn't any answer I thought I better come over.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nAbout 3:30.\n\n\nED\n\n\n3:30?  Maybe I did fall asleep.  Damn.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'm Detective Derm of the Seattle Police Department.  You called last night about your wife.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe found her car this morning.  On Capitol Hill.  Actually, somebody called it in.  It was running.\n\n\nED\n\n\nRunning?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDid your wife come home last night?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDid she go to work today?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know.  I haven't called.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDo you have a number for her there?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure.\n\n\nEd picks up the phone and dials from memory.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWhy don't you let me?\n\n\nHe hands Derm the phone.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nHi, this is Detective Derm of the Seattle Police. I was\nwondering if Mrs Eve Saxon had come into work today, or called in, any\nword from her. Yes. Since yesterday. Did you see her leave yesterday?\nYes. About what time was that? I'm not sure. Is she calls, or comes in,\ncould you please ask her to call me. My number is 734-9722, extension\n38. Thank you. Bye.\n\n\nHe hangs up.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nShe hasn't been in today.\n\n\nED\n\n\nMy God.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nShe hasn't called here at all?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nAny messages?\n\n\nHe points to the answering machine.  It is blinking, full of messages.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI must have been asleep.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThat happens.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI was up late last night.  \n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI understand.  Why don't we listen to these messages?\n\n\nED\n\n\nAlright.\n\n\nEd pushes the button on the machine.\n\n\nThe first message is from Eve's work.\n\n\nCELESTE\n\n\n(on machine)\n\n\nHi, this is Celeste, calling for Eve. We're worried\nabout you. You don't come in. You don't call. No, seriously, we just\nwant to make sure you're OK. Don't worry about your students. Marie's\ncovering for you. But give us a call, OK? Bye.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThat's the school where Eve works.  She's a piano teacher at Franklin High.\n\n\nThen there's a message for Ed.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\n(on machine)\n\n\nHello, Mr Saxon. This is Mrs Mastrioni from the\nUniversity. You didn't show up for your morning class and I'm calling\nto see if you'll be in for your other classes so that I can make the\nproper arrangements. I assume you remember how to use the phone.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDamn.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYou're a teacher too?\n\n\nED\n\n\nA professor at the University.\n\n\nThe next message is Derm.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\n(on machine)\n\n\nHello, this is Detective Derm from the Seattle Police Department...\n\n\nDerm takes a small pill box from his overcoat, while the machine plays in the background.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThat's me.  Do you have a glass of water?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure.\n\n\nEd goes into the -\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\n- and fills a glass for the detective.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nWhen he comes back, he sees Derm casually\nlooking over the woman's magazines on the coffee table. Derm picks up a\nfilled-in New York Times Sunday Crossword and looks it over.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYour wife did this?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nSmart woman.  The acrostic, too.\n\n\nEd hands Derm the water.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThank you.  \n\n\nMeanwhile the next message comes on.  It is a girl from Ed's class.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n(on machine)\n\n\nHello, Mr Saxon? This is Sadie, from your creative\nwriting class. Anyway, you didn't show up today and I just wanted to\nsee if you were OK and, you know, if there was any reading or anything\nyou wanted us to do. My number is 323-4854. I hope you're alright. Bye.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nA student?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDo they call you often?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, but they all have my number.\n\n\nThe next message is from Susie.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\n(on machine)\n\n\nHe, Ed. I just wanted to find out what happened last\nnight. If Eve ever showed up, or what happened. Call me at work,\n672-5695.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI thought she might have gone over there last night.  Excuse me, I better call the University.\n\n\nThe next message is Detective Derm again and it plays behind Ed's conversation.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHi, Mrs Mastrioni?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\n(over phone)\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThis is Ed Saxon.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nOh, yes.  Didn't make it in today, huh?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI guess not.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nThere were students waiting for you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, I know.  It's a personal matter.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nA personal matter, huh?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThat's right.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nSo you'll be in tomorrow.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, tomorrow.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nOr you'll call.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOr I'll call, yes.  Hello?  Hello?\n\n\nEd hangs up, having been hung up on.  He turns around to see Derm standing right by, listening to his call.\n\n\nThe next message is from George Simian, a man\nwho works with Eve. His cautious voice makes it known that it is weird\nthat he is calling. Ed pays special attention to this call.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nHi, Eve. This is George, from school. You didn't come\ninto work today and I just wanted to make sure everything was OK. I\nguess I'll see you tomorrow.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWho's that?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSome guy she worked with.  P.E. teacher, I think.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI see.  Mr Saxon, does your wife have an address book?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nCould I see it, please?  And a picture, if you have one.\n\n\nED\n\n\nCertainly.\n\n\nEd heads into -\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\n- and picks up the small address book from the desk.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nHe hands the address book and takes a picture of Eve from his desk, removing from the frame.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nGreat.\n\n\nDerm flips through the address book and a business card falls out.  Derm picks it up and looks it over.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nGeorge Simian.  Is that the same George that called?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThis address, this George Simian lives on Capitol Hill, where we found your wife's car.\n\n\nED\n\n\nReally?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMay I borrow this?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI suppose.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'll call the numbers in here and see what I can turn up.  Try no to worry, Mr Saxon.  I'll be in touch.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, thank you.\n\n\nDerm leaves.  Ed shuts the door and locks it.\n\n\nThe phone rings and Ed picks it up.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n(over phone)\n\n\nHe, Mr Saxon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nHi, it's Sadie Crumb, from your creative writing class.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOh, yes.  Hi.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nAre you OK?  Is this a bad time to call?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  It's alright.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI was, I don't know, wondering if you were sick or something, when you didn't come to class.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, well, a little.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nDo you need anything?  I mean, I could bring you something.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nReally, it's no problem.  Have you eaten?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, but...\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI can bring you something to eat.  It's no problem.  Some soup or something.\n\n\nED\n\n\nReally, I don't know if it's a good idea.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, don't be.  It's just that I don't feel too well.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nThat's OK.  I used to volunteer at a hospital.\n\n\nED\n\n\nReally?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYeah, I was a candy striper.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou're kidding.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nWhat I mean is, I'm used to it.  You know, sick people.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYeah?  OK.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nWhere do you live?\n\n\nED\n\n\n4523 East Street.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI'll be there soon.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOK.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh.  Do you not eat meat, or anything?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  I eat anything.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nGreat.  Bye.\n\n\nEd hangs up the phone.  He walks into the -\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe looks in the mirror.  His hair is a mess and he is unshaven.  He looks tired.  He turns on the shower.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nEd takes off his clothes and walks back into the -\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe puts his hand under the water.  It isn't warm yet, so he picks up his toothbrush and puts some paste on it.\n\n\nThen he hears a piano playing, behind the sound of the shower.  It can hardly be heard.\n\n\nED\n\n\nEve?\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nHe looks around Eve's room quickly.  There is no one there.  Ed goes back to the -\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe comes back into the bathroom.  The music has stopped and all that can be heard is the shower filling up the tub.\n\n\nThe water is about ankle-deep.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDamn.\n\n\nEd reaches into the drain and pulls out a clump\nof Eve's hair. He throws it into the toilet and then gets in the\nshower. The drain is obviously still clogged up. He is up to his knees\nin soapy water.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n\nAs Ed comes out of the shower, he sees that it is completely dark.  There is a knock on the door.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHold on!  One second!\n\n\nEd grabs Eve's robe from the back of the bathroom door.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\nEd answers the door.\n\n\nSADIE, 18, is the kind of girl who always has\nsomething to say in class, who has always done her homework and who has\ndefinite ideas about her future and the future of the planet. She is\ninnocent and na\u00efve, nice and well-mannered. But also pushy and\nmanipulative, used to getting her way.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nHi, it's me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOh, hi.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nAre you OK?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI didn't think you'd be here so fast.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt's almost eight.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOh.  I seem to be having a little trouble with time.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI know what you mean.  I'm one of those people who is always late.\n\n\nED\n\n\nCome in.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI hope you don't mind me coming over like this. It\ndidn't occur to me that it might be a little strange until after I hung\nup. It's just, well, at my high school, I went to boarding school, and\nwe were pretty close with our teachers.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's nice.  Kindness.  Very refreshing.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI brought you some soup.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI better get some clothes on.  Make yourself at home.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOK.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM \n\n\nEd gets dressed. As he does, he notices a pile\nof Eve's clothes on the floor. He picks them up and puts them in the\ncloset, on top of a pile of Eve's dirty laundry.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nWhen Ed comes out, Sadie has put the soup in a bowl and set a place at the table.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI put it in a bowl for you.  I hope you don't mind.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nEd sits down and tastes the soup.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's good.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI got it at my favorite place.  You don't mind me hanging out for a little while, do you?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  I could use the company.  Like I said, I haven't been feeling very well.\n\n\nSadie notices the pile of papers on Ed's desk.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh, you graded our papers.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSome of them.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nCan I look?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure.\n\n\nSadie looks through the papers.  She finds hers marked with a C minus.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat is it?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI just...I guess I though this one was better.\n\n\nED\n\n\nLet me see.\n\n\nEd looks over the paper for a second.  He takes a pen and crosses out the C and changes it to an A.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI was in a bad mood when I graded these.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nDon't change it if it's not good.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's just a grade.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nPlease don't.  No.  Don't.  Please.\n\n\nSadie takes the paper away from him.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSorry.  I didn't mean to.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt's just. I don't think you're doing me any favors by\nletting me off easy. I mean, I'm hear to learn. It means a lot to me to\ndo well in your class. You're the best teacher I've had since I came to\nthe University.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHow long has that been?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nWell, I'm still a freshman, but I've met a lot of\nteachers and I'm very discerning. Before I took your class I went to\nthe library and looked up your work.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou're kidding.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nNo.  I read all your poems, or all they had.  The ones in the New Yorker and in Poetry Magazine, and two short stories.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat did you think?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI loved them; the poems especially. I mean, they're\ndark, but they're so...true. Really. I really got into them. I\nphotocopied one and put it on my wall. I hope you don't mind.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhich one?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n\"The Passion of my Youth\". It is so intense. \"Her eyes\nblew gently, purposefully by my ears, echoing gentle pulses of bliss\nwhich bounced and fired like a chill on my whole being, leaving just a\ntrace to fuel my longing.\"\n\n\nED\n\n\nMy wife like that poem.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYou're married.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nWhere's your wife?\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe's at her mother's.  She's gone for a while.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh.\n\n\nThere is an awkward silence.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nMay I use the bathroom?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure.  Go ahead.\n\n\nSadie takes her purse and goes into the bathroom.  Ed finishes his soup.  The phone rings and he picks it up.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nIs this Ed?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nThis is George Simian.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nWhere's Eve?\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhy do you want to talk to Eve?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nWhat have you done?\n\n\nED\n\n\nExcuse me?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nYou've done something.  I know you have.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nThe police found her car near my house.  They think I have something to do with her disappearance.\n\n\nED\n\n\nMaybe it's because you were fucking her.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nYou son of a bitch.  What did you do?  If you hurt her, I swear, I'm going to kill you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nLook, she disappeared.  I haven't seen her.  Why do you think I called the police?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nI'll kill you.  I'll kill you, you bastard.  I swear.\n\n\nEd hangs up. He is shaky, but also strangely\nexhilarated. He turns off the ringer on the phone and turns down the\nvolume on the answering machine.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nHe brings the rest of the soup to the sink,\nscrapes it into the garbage disposal, and flicks the switch. When the\nfood has gone down, he starts to wash the dishes. He stops and looks\nback to the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd walks over to the bathroom door.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSadie?\n\n\nThere is no answer.  He knocks on the door.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSadie?  Is everything alright?\n\n\nThere is still no answer.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm coming in.  OK?\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd opens the door. Sadie is lying on the floor,\npassed out. Her pants are around her knees, as if she passed out while\nstanding up from the toilet.\n\n\nHer nose is bleeding, like she might have hit it on the way down.  It has bled on her sweater.\n\n\nThe air from the open door wakes her up, but she is in a heavy daze.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAre you alright?  My God.  What happened?\n\n\nEd comes over to her and lifts her head.  She stares at him strangely.\n\n\nED\n\n\nCan you stand?  Do you understand me?  I'll help you to the bedroom.\n\n\nSadie notices her pants are down.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'll wait outside.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd waits outside and, a second later, Sadie\ncomes out, still reeling, clutching her purse. She leans on Ed, who\nleads her into the bedroom.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nSadie lies down on the bed.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou want some water.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYes, please.\n\n\nEd goes into the -\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nHe takes a glass from the cupboard and fills it\nup. He stops, having noticed something on the glass. He holds the glass\nup to the light. \n\nEve's lipstick is clearly marked on the rim.\n\n\nHe puts that glass down and fills another.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nWhen he comes back, he finds Sadie digging through her purse.  She pulls out an asthma inhaler and takes a couple of big hits.\n\n\nThen she sits on the bed and drinks a little water.  \n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI'm so embarrassed.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, don't be.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nGod, my nose.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDoes it hurt?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nNo, but the blood.\n\n\nED\n\n\nMaybe you hit it when you fell.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt was so weird.  I heard someone's voice, a woman's voice.  Like a scream.  And then it was like all my blood left my body.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSometimes you can hear the neighbors.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt was like it echoed around the bathroom.  Maybe I imagined it.  I've been taking these caffeine pills to stay awake.\n\n\nED\n\n\nJust relax.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI should go.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI can't let you leave like this.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI didn't mean to be such a burden.  I'm such a loser.  I am so sorry about this.\n\n\nIt seems that her nose has stopped bleeding, but her sweater has a surprising amount of blood on it.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'll get you a towel.\n\n\nEd leaves and then comes back with a wet towel.\n\n\nHe starts to wipe the blood off her nose.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI feel better now.  Thank you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDo you want me to drive you home?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI'll be OK.\n\n\nED\n\n\nMaybe you want me to call your roommate.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nMy roommate moved out.  She hated me.  She said I was immature, do you believe that?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYour friends, then.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI don't have any friends. I don't know what it is.\nPeople don't like me here. I thought it would be a good idea to go to a\nschool far away from home, but since I've been here, it's like, I spend\nall this time on my own. At my high school, my friends and I were so\nclose. I just don't get along with people anymore. I don't know what it\nis.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou get along with me.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYou're the first person I've met since I've been here that talks to me like a real person.\n\n\nEd walks over to the closet and takes out a sweater.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou can borrow this, if you want.  It's my wife's.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nShe wouldn't mind.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI bled so much.\n\n\nEd gets up to give her some room.\n\n\nShe slips out of her sweater and puts the other one on.\n\n\nSadie looks at a picture next to the bed.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIs this your wife?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThat's my mother.  That picture is older than it looks.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nShe's so pretty.\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe was young when that was taken.  She died a few years ago.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nThat's awful.  How'd she die?\n\n\nED\n\n\nCancer.  It was quite an ordeal.  She died very slowly.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nThat's so sad.  I better go, huh?\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's getting late.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd walks her to the door.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI'm sorry about everything.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDon't be sorry.  I'm glad you came.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI'll see you tomorrow.\n\n\nED\n\n\nTomorrow?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIn school.  You'll be there, right?\n\n\nED\n\n\nOh, yes.  I'll be there.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nSadie kisses him on the cheek and then leaves.\n\n\nEd locks the door after her.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd looks at the tub in the bathroom which is full of water.\n\n\nHe sticks his finger deep into the drain, trying\nto free whatever is in there. There is another tuft of hair, and again\nhe throws it into the toilet.\n\n\nThe gurgling sound that he heard before has come back, resonating through the soapy water from the drain.\n\n\nINT. BASEMENT\n\n\nEd follows the gurgling sounds into the basement.\n\n\nHe takes a flashlight from behind the basement\ndoor and shines it at the pipes that lead from the bathtub drain. He\ncan hear the gurgling sound running through them. It sound like they\nate something they can't digest. He reaches up and touches the pipe. It\nseems to be leaking a little, or maybe it is condensation.\n\n\nEd traces the noise to a larger sewage pipe\nthat runs down into the basement floor. He watches the pipe, but\nslowly, his attention is drawn to the shadow next to the pipe.\n\n\nAs he stares intently into the darkness of the\nshadow, a figure begins to emerge in the distance. The darkness begins\nto change into a long hallway. A small figure is walking towards Ed and\nhis footsteps echo in the distance.\n\n\nEd watches, mesmerized.\n\n\nThe basement fades into the blackness, and now, the hallway becomes more clear.\n\n\nINT. HOSPITAL\n\n\nIt is a very long hospital hallway, and the figure walking toward Ed is a doctor, carrying a clipboard.\n\n\nDOCTOR\n\n\nMr Saxon.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDOCTOR\n\n\nThere's nothing we can do for her now except to\nalleviate any pain she may be feeling. We have her on a morphine drip\nand we'll keep increasing the dosage as she shows any signs of pain.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI see.  Can she understand me?\n\n\nDOCTOR\n\n\nAt this point, probably not. She has so much morphine\nin her, I doubt she can even recognize you. But you never know.\nActually, in cases like this, where the end is inevitable, I recommend\nthat we increase the dosage on the morphine drip at an accelerated\nrate. There's no point in making this last longer than it has to.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhatever you think is best.\n\n\nThe doctor nods, then walks into the hospital\nroom where, we see now, Ed's MOTHER is lying in a hospital bed, hooked\nup to a digital IV. She is old, but looks older - she's been through\nchemotherapy and radiation and they have all taken their toll.\n\n\nShe stares at Ed with confused and desperate eyes.  It is hard to tell if she is looking at him or not.\n\n\nThe doctor, at the door, has a few words with the NURSE, who then looks into the room.\n\n\nEd sits next to his mother and takes her hand.  She stares at him.\n\n\nThe nurse comes in and pushes a button on the\ndigital IV. Ed watches the LED numbers on the digital IV go up. The\nnurse smiles an attempt at comfort, then leaves the room.\n\n\nMother reacts to the higher dosage of morphine.\nHer eyes get wider and more delirious. She sits up a little and tenses\nher muscles. She lets go of Ed's hand and starts moving her arm up and\ndown.\n\n\nShe starts shouting something.  At first, it is completely unintelligible, but slowly, it becomes clearer.\n\n\nMOTHER\n\n\nIT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL!\n\n\nEd stands up and backs away.  He backs out of the hospital room as his mother continues to scream.\n\n\nEd backs into the hallway, which is now blackness.\n\n\nAs he backs away, another noise starts to echo around him.  A banging.  A loud banging is coming from upstairs.\n\n\nEd backs away and then runs upstairs.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\n\nAs Ed opens the basement door, he sees that it is bright daylight again.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd opens the front door and before he can react, a fist hits him hard in the face.\n\n\nEd falls to the ground, next to a pile of letters that has been dropped through the slot in the door.\n\n\nGEORGE SIMIAN walks in, wearing a track suit.\nGeorge, 35, is a stronger man than Ed. He is better looking, too, or,\nat least, younger. He has a genuine honesty about him, like a big boy.\nIt is this boyish quality that makes his anger seem uncontrollable.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nYou son of a bitch.  Get up.\n\n\nEd staggers to his feet. He tries to get a swing\nin at George, but George grabs him by the collar, hits him again, then\nthrows him over the coffee table. Ed hits the phone and the answering\nmachine on the way down.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nEVE!\n\n\nWhen Ed doesn't say anything, George starts searching around the house.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nEVE!\n\n\nEd can hear George searching around in the other rooms.\n\n\nHe gets up and sits on the couch, nursing his wounds.\n\n\nAfter a minute, George comes back into the living room.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nWhat have you done?\n\n\nED\n\n\nDon't hit me again.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nYou son of a bitch.\n\n\nGeorge sits down on a chair across from Ed.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nYou son of a bitch.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat did you think would happen?  Nothing?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nYou did something.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI did what I always do. I woke up, went to my shitty\njob, came home and cooked dinner for my wife, who was too busy bouncing\nup and down on your bedsprings to cook it herself. Not exactly what I\nhad planned for my life. The same boring shit as always. Why don't you\nleave?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nI love her.  I'm sorry.  I know she's your wife.\n\n\nGeorge is crying.  Ed, despite himself, is moved.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat? Am I supposed to feel sorry for you now? Well, I\nwon't. People think they can just carry on. They don't think that there\nmight be consequences to their actions. You won't find sympathy here.\nWhy don't you just leave?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nWhat did you do?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI didn't do anything.  She didn't come home after work.\n\n\nGeorge gets up and starts to leave.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDon't come back here again.\n\n\nGeorge stops when he hears this and turns\ntowards Ed with and angry look on his face. He grabs Ed's collar, picks\nhim up from the couch and slugs him hard across the head. Ed lands on\nthe floor, stunned and not moving.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nI swear.  If I find out you did something to her, I'll kill you.\n\n\nEd watches George leave and stays lying on the floor as George's car can be heard driving away outside.\n\n\nThe telephone is lying on the floor, knocked off\nits cradle, just out of Ed's reach. Ed stares at it for a few seconds.\nIt is making that beeping noise that phones make when they are off the\nhook too long.\n\n\nHe slowly gets up and limps into the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe looks in the mirror. His eye is swelling up\nalready and his lip is bruised. He washes his lip off, and then takes a\ntowel from the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nHe fills the towel with ice and holds it to his head.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nHe picks up the phone as he walks into the\nliving room and places it on the coffee table. He sits on the couch and\nstares at it for a second.\n\n\nThen he brings the phone over to his desk and finds Derm's business card.  He sits down at the desk and calls Derm.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello.  Detective?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI've been trying to call you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou found her.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nNo.  I need to talk to you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDetective.  George Simian was just over here.  He hit me.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nAre you OK?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI think so.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDo you want me to call an ambulance?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't need an ambulance.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'll be right over.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOK.\n\n\nHe hangs up the phone.\n\n\nHe sits at the desk, resting the ice on his forehead.\n\n\nThen he notices something under the sofa.  It grabs his attention.  He gets up for a closer look.\n\n\nThere are dust bunnies and dust under the edge\nof the sofa, like it hasn't been swept for a while. Ed kneels down and\ntries to peer under the sofa. It is dark underneath and he can't see\nanything.\n\n\nHe reaches his fingers under and sweeps out a few dust bunnies.\n\n\nThen he reaches a little further under the sofa and sweeps out Eve's pinkie finger.\n\n\nHe recoils at the sight of this. The finger has\nbeen neatly cut, as if by a sharp blade. Dust has clung to the clotted\nblood around the stump, but it is unquestionably a woman's pinkie\nfinger.\n\n\nHe stares at it for a second, curiously disgusted.\n\n\nHe goes to pick it up, decides he doesn't want to touch it, then uses a tissue to pick it up.\n\n\nHe hurries to the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe drops the finger into the toilet with the tissue and flushes it.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nHe hurries to the edge of the couch with a sponge and cleans up the small amount of blood and dust left there.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nHe squeezes the sponge out until it is clean, then puts it aside.\n\n\nHe lets out a huge sigh of relief.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nMuch of the ice has melted and the towel it was wrapped in is now soaking wet.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe takes the towel into the bathroom and rings it out.\n\n\nThen he looks over at the toilet. The finger is\nstill there, floating like a cigarette butt. The water is pink from the\nblood, the tissue is gone, but the finger floats there defiantly.\n\n\nHe flushes the toilet again, but this time stays to watch.  The water goes down, but the finger stays buoyant and won't go down.\n\n\nThere is a knock on the front door.\n\n\nEd takes a bunch of toilet paper from the roll\nand tosses it over the finger. He flushes again, but the tank hasn't\nfilled up yet and, if anything, this makes it longer until it will fill\nup again.\n\n\nThere is another impatient knock at the door.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOne second!\n\n\nEd sits there waiting, listening to the toilet tank filling.\n\n\nThe knocking outside is becoming more impatient.\n\n\nThe tank finally fills. Ed flushes and watches.\nThis time the paper he threw in clogs the toilet and the bowl quickly\nfills up with water.\n\n\nEd reaches behind the toilet and turns off the water, stopping it from overflowing.\n\n\nHe looks in the toilet and can't see the finger through the mess of toilet paper.\n\n\nThere is another knock on the door. \n\n\nEd closes the toilet lid.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd shuts the bathroom door firmly, takes a breath, and hurries out to meet Derm.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd answers the door.  Derm comes in with two assistants, MAZUREK and SNYDER.  Snyder is holding Ed's morning paper.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDamn.  You did take a couple of blows, didn't you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI was just putting some ice on it.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThat's the best thing for it. Try to keep the swelling\ndown. It's going to look worse tomorrow. You don't want to have a\ndoctor examine you?\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's not necessary.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon, Officer Mazurek and Officer Snyder.  They'll be assisting me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHi.\n\n\nMAZUREK\n\n\nHow's it going?\n\n\nSNYDER\n\n\nHere.  I brought this in.\n\n\nSnyder hands Ed the newspaper.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYou say it was George Simian who hit you?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, he did.  He came barreling in here and hit me.  Several times.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDo you have any idea why he would come here?\n\n\nED\n\n\nBecause he's a fucking asshole.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI should say that I'm concerned that he would come\nhere. Mr Simian has a history of violent behavior, in regards to\ndomestic disputes.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat kind of history?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nNothing too serious. No felonies. But enough, I think,\nto warrant some concern. With your permission, I'd like to fill in a\ncomplaint report for his assault on you, and as soon as we're finished\nhere, I'll send these two over to arrest him, assuming he can be found.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou think he did something to Eve?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe don't have any evidence that he's even seen your\nwife she left her office and disappeared. We'll be arresting him solely\nfor his assault on you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nBut Eve's car.  You said you found her car near his house.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIt does no one any good to jump to conclusions.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI guess I misunderstood.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe're going to have to take some pictures of you for\nthe complaint report. The pictures will be used as evidence against Mr\nSimian if this matter does, eventually, go to trial.\n\n\nED\n\n\nFine.\n\n\nDerm turns to Snyder, who has heard this conversation, and Snyder begins to take pictures of Ed.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon. These investigations can be quite demanding,\nespecially when experiencing the trauma of loss. Do you understand what\nI am saying?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIf you feel that you need someone to talk to, at any\ntime, there are people, sometimes victims of similar situation\nthemselves, who are will to listen and would like to help.\n\n\nHe hands Ed a business card which reads Human Support Services, and has some address and phone information on it.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nAre you aware that your wife has been having an affair?\n\n\nED\n\n\nWith George Simian?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe P.E. teacher.  I guess I should have known.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nApparently your wife has been seeing him for some time.  Almost a year, in fact.\n\n\nED\n\n\nA year?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDo you consider that you and your wife have a normal relationship?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know. Normal relationship. We get on each\nother's nerves, have sex a few times a year, order pizza on Fridays.\nWe've been married for ten years. It doesn't stay rosy forever. Maybe\nit isn't paradise, but that doesn't mean that I don't love her.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nAre you having any other relationships?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDoes your wife keep a diary?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  She isn't the type.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon.  May I be frank?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Please.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nCases involving missing persons are not uncommon. In\nmany cases, and that is not to say in every case, but in many cases,\nthe results are unfortunate.\n\n\nED\n\n\nMy God.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'm not saying that you should give up hope, but my\nexperience tells me that you should prepare yourself for the worst.\nNow, having said that, we will do everything in our power to find your\nwife.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI understand.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nNow, it's best if we can gather as much information as\npossible, as quickly as possible. I'm sure you understand the urgency\nhere.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOf course.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIt will be necessary for us to search through some of your wife's personal items.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm sure I can find whatever it is that you want.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIt's really in your wife's best interests if you allow\nus to do it. We won't disturb anything or touch anything without your\npermission.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAlright.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nHow about we start in the bedroom?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe bedroom.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nED\n\n\nRight.  I'll show you.\n\n\nEd stands up and leads them into the bedroom.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nThey pass by the bathroom. The gurgling noises\nfrom the plumbing echo around the hallway, and while the police don't\nseem to pay it any mind, Ed can definitely hear it.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nEd looks around the bedroom quickly before they go in.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHere you go.  It's sort of a mess.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDo you know where your wife keeps her credit card receipts?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Sure.  This way.\n\n\nEd leads Derm to Eve's room, leaving the two assistants in the bedroom.\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nEd goes over to Eve's writing desk and looks over the papers lying on top.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nNice room.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou like it?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYeah.  Very Magritte.  It's like a nursery.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI guess it is.  I always through it was more of a conservatory.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWith the piano.\n\n\nED\n\n\nRight. She plays in here sometimes. It's nice. We\nalways wanted to fix up the whole house, but, this is the only room we\ngot to.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThings always cost more than you think.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYeah, I don't know what happened.  Anyway, we share a credit card, but she mostly uses her own.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIf someone has taken your wife, there's a chance they\nmight have used one of her credit cards. Or she might have used it\nherself.\n\n\nEd pulls at the locked drawer in the writing table.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI think she keeps the receipts in here, but I don't have a key.\n\n\nDerm looks at the lock.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nLet me try.\n\n\nEd gets out of the way and Derm sits in the\nchair to examine the lock more closely. He presses his thumbs against\nthe desk and breaks the wood around the lock, forcing the drawer open.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThere we go.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI could have done it if I wanted to break it.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'm sure she'll understand.\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe won't.  I promise.\n\n\nEd sits back down and searches through the drawer.  He finds some credit card receipts and sorts through them.\n\n\nMAZUREK\n\n\nDetective Derm.\n\n\nMazurek comes into the office carrying Sadie's sweater, which has blood all over it.\n\n\nSnyder follows Mazurek in and looks over Mazurek's shoulder.\n\n\nMAZUREK\n\n\nIt was under the bed, sir.\n\n\nDerm takes the sweater and looks at the blood on it.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIs this your wife's?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThere's blood on this sweater, Mr Saxon.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, I know. A student. Detective, this is going to\nsound awkward, I guess, but a student of mine came to the house\nyesterday, after you were here. She was nervous, I suppose. She had a\nbloody nose.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWhy would she have been nervous?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know, but she seemed nervous.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThat is awkward, isn't it.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI suppose it is.  I gave her one of my wife's sweaters to wear home.  She must have left that one by accident.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nBy accident?  Under the bed?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWhat was her name?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSadie.  Sadie Crumb.\n\n\nDerm finds a small, printed name-tag reading\nSadie Crumb sewn into the collar. Derm shows it to Mazurek and then\nindicates for him to go back to the bedroom.\n\n\nDerm shows the label to Ed.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDo you have this girl's phone number?  I'd like to talk to her.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't think so.  Maybe.\n\n\nEd gets up and walks into the -\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\n- where his desk is.  He searches around and quickly finds a photocopy of a hand-written list of phone numbers.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI should call her.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure.  Here.\n\n\nHe hands him the phone.  Derm dials the number.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI didn't tell her about my wife.  I didn't see any reason to.\n\n\nDerm reaches into his pocket and pulls out a\nroll of Tums. He takes a couple and chews them and it obviously puts a\nbad taste in his mouth.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nCould I trouble you for a glass of water?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure.\n\n\nEd walks into the -\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nHe passes by the bathroom and stops by the\nbedroom door. He looks into the bedroom where the officers are\nsearching through his stuff. They find a copy of Hustler Magazine and\nthey chuckle about it, before they notice Ed watching them.\n\n\nAs he watches, he can hear Derm talking to Sadie.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nHi. May I speak to Sadie Crumb, please? This is\nDetective Derm of the Seattle Police Department. Can I ask you a few\nquestions?\n\n\nThe officers turn and stare at Ed until he leaves.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nEd takes a glass from the cupboard. He takes it\nover to the sink and fills it with water. The tap makes enough noise so\nthat he can't hear anything else.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nAs Ed passes the bathroom door, the gurgling\nnoises from the plumbing get louder. He makes sure the door is firmly\nshot and then brings the glass of water to Derm.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nDerm hangs up the phone and drinks the water.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWell?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nShe sounded very nice.  You know, I think she left her sweater under your bed on purpose.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhy would she do that?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nSo that she'd have a reason to come back.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI see.\n\n\nDerm sees an open box of Skin-EE( cookies.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nHey.  My wife loves those things.  I swear, she eats them by the box.  I think they taste like shit.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI know.  I hate them.  Sometimes I think she eats them just to spite me.\n\n\nMAZUREK\n\n\nDetective Derm.\n\n\nDerm looks at Ed, then goes into the other room.  Ed follows.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nDid you go to work today, Mr Saxon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  I guess I didn't.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIf you'd like, I can call the University for you and explain the situation.  It might help.  I'm sure they would understand.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't think it's necessary.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWell, the offer stands if you change your mind later.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's just that, I don't want them to know anything about all this.  At least not yet.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI understand.\n\n\nThey walk into the -\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nMazurek is holding a small, fabric-bound writing book.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWhat's that?\n\n\nMAZUREK\n\n\nLooks like a diary, sir.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nLet's have a look.\n\n\nDerm looks it over, reads the last couple of entries quickly.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWhere'd you find this?\n\n\nMAZUREK\n\n\nBehind the bedside table.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI didn't know.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe have to keep some things to ourselves, or we'd go crazy.  This is your wife's handwriting?\n\n\nHe shows him the diary.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Can I look at that?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nOf course.\n\n\nEd takes the diary and wanders into Eve's room, flipping through it as he walks.\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nEd flips through the last pages of the diary. He\nreads for a minute. Some distant noises are coming from the neighbor's\nhouse. While we can't hear exactly what is being said, it is clear that\na man is saying something funny and a woman is laughing hysterically.\n\n\nEd reads for a minute until, astonished, he puts it down and looks up at Derm, who is standing in the doorway watching him.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI guess you never really know anyone.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYou didn't know that you're wife is pregnant?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'm sorry.  I talked to her doctor yesterday.  I thought you knew.\n\n\nMazurek comes up behind Derm and says something inaudibly in his ear.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIs it alright if Mazurek uses the bathroom?\n\n\nED\n\n\nExcuse me?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThe bathroom.  May we use the bathroom?  We might be here for a while.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  The toilet is stuffed up.  Actually.  Do you mind leaving?  I just would like to be alone.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon. I'm sorry about the intrusions into your\nprivacy, but you must understand: my first priority is finding your\nwife. There is still a great deal to go over. We might want to notify\nthe press.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe press?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIn cases like this, when we don't have many substantial leads, getting a picture of your wife on TV can be invaluably helpful.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know if I'm comfortable with that.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe still have options left, but without a thorough search of your wife's belongings, those options are extremely limited.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI want to be helpful, but I really don't see how, if\nyou think she was kidnapped, I don't see how it helps you to search\naround our things.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe don't know that she was kidnapped. We can't draw\nthose kinds of conclusions. She could have simply decided that she\nneeded some time alone. We have to consider every possibility.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI just don't see how it helps.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI don't want to argue with you.  We're trying to help you.  This is our job.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI understand.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIt is in the best interest of your wife that you let us do that job without impediment.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't want to get in the way. I just would like some\ntime alone. You can comes back tomorrow, but, please. I'm very tired. I\nknow it might seem irrational, but I haven't slept in a long time and\nthis is all extremely overwhelming. Please. I need to be alone.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nCertainly.  If I could just take those receipts.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure.  Here.  Take them all.\n\n\nThe receipts are on the desk in front of him and he hands them to Derm.\n\n\nDerm reaches out for the diary.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'd like to keep this.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThere are some things it may be better not to know, especially if your wife comes back.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI can give it to you tomorrow, if you still want it.\n\n\nEd leaves the diary on Eve's writing table and walks the officers out.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon.  Is there something wrong with your answering machine?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  It broke when I fell on it.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYou haven't been answering your phone.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt hasn't rung.\n\n\nDerm looks at the phone and sees the ringer is turned off.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nThe ringer is off.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOh.  I must have turned it off.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWhat if your wife calls?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYes.  Of course.  I wasn't thinking.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nCould you please leave the phone on from now on?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  I thought I was.  OK.  Thank you.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'll be calling to let you know how things go with Mr Simian.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Thank you.\n\n\nDerm and the officers leave.\n\n\nEd lets out a sigh of relief.  He touches his forehead and it obviously hurts.\n\n\nHe goes back into the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe opens the medicine cabinet and searches\nthrough the plethora of over-the-counter medicine crowding the shelves.\nHe takes a bottle of Midol, or some other feminine pain-killer. He\ntakes a few of them and chases them down with a handful of tap water.\n\n\nThen he turns to the toilet, lifts the lid and looks at the stuffed-up mess.\n\n\nHe rolls up his sleeve and sticks his hand in the bowl.  He searches around for the finger.\n\n\nThe phone rings.  He gives up searching and, with some wet toilet paper stuck to his arm, hurries to answer the phone.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd picks up the phone.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nMr Saxon.  This is Mrs Mastrioni, from the Dean's office.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nMr Saxon.  You are supposed to call us when you plan on missing class.  There were students waiting for you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  I know.  I'm just having some personal problems.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nAnyway, the Dean wants to see you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe Dean?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nYes.  Can you come in today?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  What does he want to see me about?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIs it about me missing classes?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nIt might be.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nIt means that if I was the Dean, and I wanted to see you, that is what it would be about.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat kind of bullshit is that?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nThere's no need to get upset, Mr Saxon.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAm I being fired?  Is that it?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nLook, I don't know.  The Dean said he wanted to see you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWell, I can't see him.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nPersonal problems?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThat's right.  Yes.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nThat's too bad.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes it is too bad.  Because I know what you're trying to do.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nReally?  What's that?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou know what?  Why don't you tell the Dean to go fuck himself?\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nMr Saxon...\n\n\nED\n\n\nAnd you go fuck yourself too.\n\n\nMRS MASTRIONI\n\n\nDoes this mean that you won't be coming to class tomorrow?\n\n\nED\n\n\nFuck you!\n\n\nEd slams the phone down.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd takes the bottle of Midol from the medicine cabinet and takes a few more.\n\n\nThen he notices a trail of pink water leading from the toilet, along the bathroom floor and into the hallway.\n\n\nHe follows the trail.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nThe trail leads up to the pinkie finger. Ed\nwatches while the finger moves, inchworm-like, across the floor, toward\nEve's room, leaving a wet trail behind it.\n\n\nEd watches for a second while he decides what to do.\n\n\nHe quickly grabs the finger and takes it to the\nkitchen sink. He drops it in the sink, pushes it down the drain and\nflicks the garbage disposal on. He turns the water on and leaves it\nrunning until it sounds like there is nothing left of the finger.\n\n\nWhen he turns it off, he sticks his hand in, searching for any remnants of the finger.  It appears to have gone down.\n\n\nHe takes the sponge and wets it.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nHe wipes up the trail of the finger, following it back into the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe looks at the toilet, which is still stuffed up.\n\n\nINT. BASEMENT\n\n\nEd searches around the basement for a plunger.  The basement is full of strange sounds, all ruminating from the exposed pipes.\n\n\nHe finds a plunger among some other tools and\nstarts back upstairs, but on his way upstairs, he finds that there is a\npuddle of water on the floor. He traces the source of the puddle to the\npipe that was only moist before. It is now dripping slowly and a large\npool of dirty water is collecting in the shallow recess of the cement\nfloor.\n\n\nEd stares into the murky, black pool.\n\n\nThere is a knock on the door upstairs and Ed turns to answer it.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\nEd answers the door and sees that it is now dark outside.\n\n\nGEOFFREY COSTAS stands outside. Geoffrey, 54, is\na wise, patient man. He is formal and calm in his manner, but these\nqualities belie a warm emotional vulnerability. Physically, he is not\nsmall or weak. One gets the impression that he wasn't always so kind.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nMr Saxon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHello.  My name is Geoffrey Costas.  I'm from Human Support Services.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm not interested.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nDetective Derm asked me to stop by.\n\n\nHe hands him a business card.  Ed takes the card and looks it over.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYou've been hit.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm fine.  I don't need a doctor.\n\n\nHe tries to hand the card back.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nOh, I'm not a physician.  I'm a psychiatrist.  But I'm not here on business.  This is my time off.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThis is a personal visit?  I don't understand.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHuman Services is a volunteer organization.  We offer assistance to victims of traumatic crimes.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat kind of assistance?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nAdvice, support, a shoulder to cry on.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhy would I want to cry on your shoulder?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nMaybe you just want someone to talk to.  It can be a lonely world when those you love are taken from you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  I don't think so.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nWell, you have my card.  If you feel like talking at another time, please feel free to call.\n\n\nED\n\n\nActually, there is something you can help me with.  I've been having trouble sleeping.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nThat's understandable, under the circumstances.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIs there something you can give me?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYou mean a prescription?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou're a doctor, aren't you?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI can't seem to find anything strong enough.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYou're anxious.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  I can't sleep.  It makes me anxious.  Or maybe I can't sleep because I'm anxious.  I don't know.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHow long has this been going on?\n\n\nED\n\n\nA long time.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nWeeks?\n\n\nED\n\n\nOh, yes.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYou must have slept some.\n\n\nED\n\n\nMaybe I do. But I don't seem to get the benefits. I\nnever feel rested. There just doesn't seem to be the time to relax\nanymore. I'm always two steps behind. I have to stop the thinking. The\nlonger I stay awake, the more my thoughts become frantic, irrational.\nIf I don't get some sleep soon, nothing is going to make any sense.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI see.  May I come in?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Come in.\n\n\nGeoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on the table inside.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nThere are times when the pressures of everyday life\nbecome overwhelming. As a doctor, I notice more and more of my patients\nexperiencing similar symptoms. I'm afraid it's a sign of the times, as\nmuch as anything else.\n\n\nED\n\n\nCan you help me?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nLike I said, I'm not here on a professional basis. Your\ninsomnia is merely a symptom of a greater unwholesomeness. A lasting\ntreatment may be extremely hard to come by. There's very little we can\nhope to accomplish with pharmaceuticals alone. However, under the\ncircumstances, I can give you something to help you sleep. Do you have\nhealth insurance?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, through work.\n\n\nGeoffrey takes a prescription pad from his briefcase and scribbles out a prescription.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nThe prescription I'm going to write for you is\nexpensive, so I recommend you save the receipt for your insurance\ncompany. I'm sure they'll cover it. These pills are quite new. I've\nbeen prescribing them to my patients who travel a great deal, for their\njet lag. They will help stabilize your internal clock by chemically\nsuppressing certain amino acids in your brain.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWill it help me sleep?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nOh, yes.  Now, take two at night, and don't take more than six in a day.  OK?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Thank you.\n\n\nGeoffrey shuts his briefcase and starts to leave.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI'm glad I could help.  How about I check in on you tomorrow afternoon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nTomorrow?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nTo see how you're doing?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I understand your position better\nthan you think. Don't shut it all out. Sometimes that fragile\nconnection to the rest of the world is all we have. I sincerely hope\nthings turn out for you. Tomorrow then?\n\n\nED\n\n\nTomorrow.\n\n\nEd shuts the door behind Geoffrey.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd works the plunger in the toilet. The water is\nstill pink from the finger, but also might be pink from the pink toilet\npaper that is now broken up and mixed in with the water.\n\n\nHe plunges the toilet a few more times and then\nstops to see if it is working. The water slowly goes down. He reaches\nbehind the toilet and turns the water back on. He flushes it and it\nseems to be working again, albeit weakly.\n\n\nHe sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes a\nbreath. The water in the tub hasn't gone down, so he takes the plunger\nand starts to work it over the drain.\n\n\nAfter a minute, he sees that it isn't working.\nHe reaches into the drain and pulls out a huge clump of scum-filled\nhair. It is repulsive to Ed. He throws it into the toilet. \n\nThe water in the bathtub still hasn't gone down.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nHe searches under the sink through an exhaustive\nsupply of cleaning supplies. He eventually pulls out a king-size\ncontainer of Drano.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe reads the back of the container quickly, then pours the whole thing down the drain.\n\n\nHe watches it for a second, waiting for it to go down.\n\n\nSlowly, then softly, the piano can be heard playing in the other room.\n\n\nEd listens to it before following it down the hallway.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nThe lamp on Eve's writing desk is on and it lights up the end of the hallway.  The music still seems to be coming from her room.\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nEd comes in and looks around the room.  There is no one playing the piano, but the music continues over the rest of the scene.\n\n\nEd's attention turns to the diary, which is\nstill sitting on the desk where he left it. Ed sits in the chair and\nstarts paging through Eve's diary. The piano continues playing.\n\n\nWe hear Eve's voice as it must have been when she was writing.\n\n\nEVE\n\n\n(V.O.)\n\n\nMore than three weeks late. Damn. I'm so stupid. I\nhaven't told George because I'm sure he would use this as an excuse to\npressure me to leave Ed. And how can I tell Ed. There's no way he could\nbe the father. We haven't had sex in months. He would know it isn't is.\n\n\nEd flips back a few pages.\n\n\nAs he does, the camera starts to travel around\nthe room, passing the piano, and then a few pictures from Eve's past,\nthen some souvenirs on a shelf.\n\n\nEVE\n\n\n(V.O.)\n\n\nSaw a movie last night with George. It was awful; just\nthe kind of movie Ed hates. I wanted to tell him about it, but I\ncouldn't. I told him I was at Susie's. George loved it, of course. I\nthink he likes every movie. Still, it was nice to go out on a date like\nthat. It was fun.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nNow the camera has turned to the empty hallway.  It slowly moves toward the bathroom.\n\n\nEVE\n\n\n(V.O.)\n\n\nEd came home in a shitty mood and started picking a\nfight with me about a coffee cup I broke last week. It was the last\nthing I needed, today especially. Sometimes I fucking hate him. He can\nbe such a shit.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nThe camera pans over the glass that has Eve's lipstick on it.\n\n\nEVE\n\n\n(V.O.)\n\n\nI can't believe what a jock George is. I knew he worked\nout, but he really takes car of himself. After we had sex, I was\nembarrassed to let him see me naked. How could I have gotten so fat?\nI'm going back to the gym tomorrow. I've really let myself go to pot.\nMaybe I'll get him a softball bat for his birthday next week.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nThe camera comes into the bathroom and passes over all of Eve's things sitting on the back of the toilet.\n\n\nEVE\n\n\n(V.O.)\n\n\nEd doesn't sleep anymore. He's beginning to scare me.\nHe takes all these pills to help him sleep, but they only make it\nworse. And he hates me. I can see it in his eyes. He blames me for\neverything that went wrong in his life. Maybe he's right. Maybe it is\nmy fault. I feel so guilty about George that I can't argue with him\nanymore. I can't keep this up much longer. Fuck it. I'm going to tell\nhim about George tomorrow. He knows anyway. He must know. He's been\nacting so weird. Poor Ed. He used to have so much ambition. And he's so\ntalented. I just wish things had turned out better.\n\n\nThe camera turns toward the bathtub, and\nfocuses slowly in on the drain. A few bubbles pop out from under the\nwater and the water starts to drain out. As the camera dollies in on\nthe drain, the last of the murky water disappears.\n\n\nEd, now standing in the bathroom, strikes a\nmatch and holds it up to the diary until the corner finally catches on\nfire. He fans out the pages so that it will catch more. \n\nWhen he can't hold it anymore, he drops it\ninto the bathtub and watches it burn. He watches it until it has burnt\nitself out, burning into a pile of thick, black ashes.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd looks up at the smoke alarm.  He tries to pull it down, but it is out of his reach.\n\n\nEd grabs a chair from the living room and stands\non it so that he can reach the alarm. He pulls the cover off the alarm\nand then the battery out and the alarm is finally silenced.\n\n\nThen he hears voices coming from outside the front door.\n\n\nHe approaches the front door cautiously, then\nputs his ear up to the door and listens. The voices are muted and\nwhispered, but Ed can still hear what is being said, although it is\nhard to tell who is talking.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nNo.  I won't.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nYou are so crazy.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nI'm crazy?  What about you?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nQuiet.  He's going to hear you.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nSo what if he hears me.  Who is he, anyway?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nGod, you are being such an asshole.\n\n\nEd opens the door quickly.\n\n\nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT\n\n\nSadie and Harvey freeze like caught children.\n\n\nHARVEY, 19, looks younger than his is; his\nfacial hair isn't capable yet of filling out his meager goatee. He\nseems hurt, like a spoiled child who hasn't gotten his way.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat's going on?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nChrist.  I'm so sorry.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nWho's this?  Is this him?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n\nWill you shut up?\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nHe's so old.\n\n\nED\n\n\nExcuse me?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nCan we just go inside?  Please?\n\n\nEd lets Sadie inside.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nSo that's it?  You're going with him now?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYou really don't understand anything.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nYou said you loved me.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nJesus.  Would you shut up?  You are so embarrassing.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nEmbarrassing?  I'll tell you what's embarrassing.  You with this fucking geriatric old man.  That's embarrassing.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou little shit.\n\n\nEd makes a move toward Harvey, but Harvey backs away quickly.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nDon't touch me!\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nLet's just go in, OK?  He'll leave.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nUser.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nStalker.  Psycho.\n\n\nHARVEY\n\n\nSlut.\n\n\nSadie slams the door on him.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nSadie stands staring at the floor.  \n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI can't believe that.  You know, he followed me here.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHe followed you?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYeah.  Do you believe it?  Oh my God.  What happened to you?\n\n\nED\n\n\nSomebody hit me.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nAre you alright?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm fine.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nWho hit you?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI really don't want to get into it.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI nearly had a heart attack when the police called me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat did they ask you?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nJust about me being here.  About what happened.\n\n\nED\n\n\nBut nothing happened.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nThat's what I told them.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThey found your sweater.  It has blood all over it.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYou're kidding.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou left it under the bed.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh, yeah.  Damn.  I don't know why I do things like that.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat if my wife had found it?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nOh.  Is she here?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  Look, Sadie.  I don't want you to get the wrong idea.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nDon't be mad. It's just that I worry too much. You\ndidn't come to class again. And you said you would. I started getting\nall these ideas. I called you, but nobody answered. I meant to bring\nyour wife's sweater back, but I forgot it.\n\n\nED\n\n\nActually, I'm glad you're here.  Can you do me a favor?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nSure.  Anything.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI have to get a prescription filled.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nNo problem.\n\n\nEd finds the prescription on his desk.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'd go myself, but I'm expecting a phone call.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nSure.\n\n\nHe hands her the prescription.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThere's a twenty-four pharmacy on Market.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI know the one.  I go there all the time.  It's like my second home.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'll give you my credit card.\n\n\nEd finds his wallet and hands her the card.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI'll be back in a minute.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nSadie skips out the door and Ed shuts it behind her.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd turns on the shower, washing the ashes down the drain.\n\n\nAfter he's watched them go down, he takes a\nsponge and cleans off the burnt mark in the tub as best he can. He\nturns the shower on, rinsing it out.\n\n\nHe turns the shower off and hears the phone is ringing.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd picks up the phone.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon?  Detective Derm.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes, hi.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI wanted to let you know that we've taken Mr Simian into custody.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI understand.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe found him at his place of work.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAt the school?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYes. We arrested him there. He'll come up for\narraignment tomorrow morning and then, as far as I can tell, he'll\nprobably be released on his own recognizance.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI see.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIt's just standard procedure, but I thought I'd keep you informed.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Thank you.  Did he say anything about Eve?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nTry to rest, Mr Saxon.  We have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI will.  Thank you.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nGood night.\n\n\nEd hangs up the phone.\n\n\nThen he hears some sounds coming from Eve's room.\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nEd takes a few steps into Eve's room.  He traces the noises to the window and looks out at the neighbor's house.\n\n\nThe light is on in the neighbor's window, and\nthere are some vague shadows moving around on the closed curtain. As\nthe noises get louder, it soon becomes clear that the neighbors are\nhaving sex.\n\n\nEd peers out at the light in the window,\nlistening to the woman's increasing moans. The woman seems to be in\nsome sort of painful, orgasmic delight. In other words, it mostly\nsounds like she is having a good time, but there should be a growing\nsuspicion that not all is right.\n\n\nWOMAN\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nOh.  Oh.  Oh!  Oh!  OH!  OH!  NO!  NO!  NO!\n\n\nEd backs slowly away from the window.  He hears someone knocking on the front door.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd opens the door and Sadie comes in holding a colorful paper bag.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nEd takes the bag from Sadie and goes into the kitchen.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nSadie follows him in.\n\n\nEd opens the pills quickly and swallows three of them with a glass of water.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nThose pills cost a lot.  They must be strong.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThey're sleeping pills.  I've been having trouble sleeping.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYou must have anxiety.  I can never get to sleep when I'm anxious.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI am anxious.  Yes.\n\n\nSadie takes some other stuff out of the bag. One\nof the items is an individually wrapped Skin-EE( fat-free cookie,\nchocolate, chocolate chip.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI got you some peroxide and stuff.  And a cookie.  I haven't eaten today.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou put it all on my credit card, right?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nActually, I paid for it.  They wouldn't take your card.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nThey said you hadn't paid your bill, on the phone.  They called the credit card people when it didn't go through.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDamn.  Well, I'll pay you back.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt's OK.  I charged it to my Dad.  I don't even pay the bill.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, those pills are expensive.  And my insurance will cover it anyway.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nPay me back later, then.  Really, it's OK.\n\n\nED\n\n\nAre you sure?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt's fine.  I swear.\n\n\nSadie looks at the cuts on his face.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYour face must hurt.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  I don't seem to feel anything.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt's nasty.\n\n\nSadie takes a closer look.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nHere.  Sit down.\n\n\nShe sits Ed down at the kitchen table, under a\nlight, and sits across from him, then takes the peroxide and some\ncotton swabs she bought at the pharmacy and starts to dress his wounds.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI've never been hit before.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nMe neither.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's not so bad, really. It's humbling, but I like the\neffect it seems to have on people. It seems to make them more\ncompassionate. There's a competitive market for suffering in the world.\nIt's difficult to stand out from the handicapped and the homeless and\nthe politically oppressed. Sometimes a little advertising helps remind\npeople that you're a human being.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt does make you look sort of cute, in a pathetic kind of way.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSadie.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nAre you really married?\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat?  You think I just made it up?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI don't know.  Some people just say they're married, you know, because maybe they think it's more respectable or something.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm not one of those people.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI didn't mean to imply anything.  It's just that you act sort of weird.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI act weird?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nNot weird, really.  Worried, I guess.  Secretive.  Like you're worried I might find out something about you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou don't want to get involved with my problems.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nMaybe I do.\n\n\nED\n\n\nBelieve me, you don't.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI didn't mean to pry.  Well, maybe I did.  I'll just put a band-aid on it.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWould you like a drink?  I'm going to have one.\n1tt1He finds a bottle of wine.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYou're not supposed to mix wine with sleeping pills.  It increases the amount of medicine that's absorbed into the bloodstream.\n1tt1Ed searches for a corkscrew and starts to open the bottle.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI need all the help I can get.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nIt's dangerous.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's just wine. I'll only have a glass.\n1tt1He offers her some and she nods. He pours her a glass. Sadie takes\nher glass into the living room. Ed downs his glass of wine and refills\nit quickly before following her.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n1tt1She sits down at his desk.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nAre you working on anything new?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  I don't write anymore.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI just don't have the time.  I have to work all day.  Time just slips by.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI know what you mean.  There's not enough time in the day.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNot as much as there used to be.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nThere used to be more?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Before I had to work there was plenty of time.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nBut you had all that stuff published.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSure, but it didn't pay very much. I had a lot of debts\nfrom school that needed to be paid off. And then, credit cards. And\nthen I got married, bought a house. Life comes with all these expenses.\nAnd poetry just doesn't pay. I thought working at the University would\nat least give me summers off.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nDoesn't it?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNot really.  No.\n1tt1There is a knock on the door.  The idea that someone else might see them together makes it awkward for both of them.\n1tt1Ed freezes for what seems like a long time; long enough for whoever it is to knock again.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI better see who that is.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nYeah.\n1tt1Ed goes over to the door and opens it cautiously.  It is Eve's friend, SUSIE.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nHi, it's me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nOh, hi Susie.\n1tt1She is about to walk in, when Ed blocks her way.  She can see Sadie sitting at Ed's desk holding a glass of wine.\n\n\nED\n\n\nEve's not here.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nOh.  She came back though, didn't she?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo, she didn't.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nOh no.  Can I come in?\n\n\nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT\n1tt1Ed, rather than let her in, pushes her outside and shuts the door behind her.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  I'm busy right now.  I called the police.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nWhat did they say?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThey're working on it.  You can call them if you want.\n1tt1Ed finds Derm's card in his pocket and hands it to her.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nAren't you worried?\n\n\nED\n\n\nOf course I'm worried. I'm just working right now. This\ngirl is one of my students. She wanted some help on an assignment. She\ndoesn't know anything about Eve being missing.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nWhat happened to you?\n\n\nED\n\n\nGeorge Simian hit me.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nGeorge?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou know him.  It figures.\n1tt1Susie starts crying.  Ed stares at her helplessly, then goes back inside.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nWait.\n1tt1Ed stops.\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nCan I come back later?\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt's late.  I just took some sleeping pills.  I haven't slept much since this all started.  Why don't you come back tomorrow?\n\n\nSUSIE\n\n\nTomorrow?\n\n\nED\n\n\nGood night, Susie.\n\n\nEd walks back in, leaving Susie standing on the porch.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\nEd waits by the door until he hears her footsteps walking away outside.\n\n\nSadie stands up, looking nervous.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Is that your wife?\n\n\nED\n2t2No.  It was a friend of hers.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2I should go.\n\n\nED\n2t2No.  Why?\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2You must be tired.  Those pills must be working.\n\n\nED\n2t2I don't think they're working at all.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Still.  You're married, right?\n\n\nED\n2t2Yeah, but, please don't go.  Please.  Time has a way of slowing down when you're around.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Really?  For me, too.\n\n\nED\n2t2So you'll stay?\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2If you want me to.\n\n\nEd comes over to her and kisses her.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Can I ask you something?\n\n\nED\n2t2What?\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Do you think my writing is good?\n\n\nED\n2t2You've done some good work.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Yeah.  C minus good.\n\n\nED\n2t2I told you, I was in a bad mood when I graded that.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2I guess so.\n\n\nShe is unresponsive at first.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\n(to herself)\n2t2What am I doing?\n\n\nThey kiss for a minute, then Ed slips his hand under the back of Sadie's sweater.\n\n\nShe kisses him again.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nSadie turns the lights off and we can only see by the light coming in from the hallway.\n\n\nEd lies on the bed and Sadie lies next to him,\nunder the covers. Ed slips his hand under the back of her sweater and\nfiddles with her bra while they kiss.\n\n\nThe gurgling sound starts up again, and while\nSadie doesn't notice, or doesn't hear it, it becomes increasingly\ndistracting to Ed. He looks to the bathroom where the noise is coming\nfrom.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nThe camera focuses in on the drain.  The water in the bathtub starts rising again.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nSadie breaks away from him, sits up and takes off her sweater.  Ed takes off his shirt.\n\n\nEd's kisses move around the side of her neck. As\nhe reaches her ear, he looks up and notices Eve's clothes sitting on\nthe chair.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nThe water is rising slowly, but we can see solid\nstuff (the ashes from the diary are clearly part of the muck) seeping\nout of the drain with the water. It is a cloudy, dark, disgusting water\nwhich probably stinks too.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM\n\n\nEd is trying to concentrate on Sadie, but he notices the closet door is open and there are some dresses blowing around inside.\n\n\nAnd the noise from the bathroom is getting louder.\n\n\nHe turns Sadie onto her back, turning himself\naway from the closet. His kisses run down her chest until he gets to\nher jeans. He unbuttons her jeans and starts to pull them off, kissing\nas he goes.\n\n\nEd has taken her pants off, but his passion and\nenthusiasm has faded, and he stops and stares off into space, towards\nthe bathroom. He is spooked.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2What's wrong?\n\n\nHe looks down and sees Sadie staring at him.\n\n\nED\n2t2I don't know.  Maybe it's those pills.  I don't know.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Just relax.  Lie back.\n\n\nSadie gently pushes him back and starts to go down on him.\n\n\nEd get more uptight.\n\n\nED\n2t2No.  Please.  Just stop.\n\n\nShe keeps trying until Ed is forced to push her away.\n\n\nED\n2t2It's just not working.  OK?\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Alright.  I'm sorry.\n\n\nSadie turns away.  She's upset.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Maybe I should go.\n\n\nED\n2t2No.  Please, don't.  It's my fault.  Please.  Don't go.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2Damn, I'm so stupid.\n\n\nED\n2t2No, it's me.  Please.\n\n\nSADIE\n2t2This was a mistake.\n\n\nSadie gets up and puts on her shirt.  She grabs the rest of her clothes and goes into the living room.\n\n\nEd stares after her, listening to her finish dressing herself and then leave.\n\n\nThe clock next to the bed is ticking loudly and the sound of the ticking continues of the next few scenes, as indicated.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nEd pours a few more pills into his hand, swallowing them with some wine from the bottle.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd looks at the bathtub, which is full of the\nmurky water. He picks up the plunger, which is still by the toilet, and\nstarts working it on the drain.\n\n\nMore stuff is coming up, making the water\ndarker, but as he relaxes the plunger, the water doesn't go down. If\nanything, the gurgling sound is louder.\n\n\nHe works the plunger some more, more vigorously\nand then, again, relaxes it and watches the drain hopefully. The\ngurgling noise seems closer and the water still does not go down.\n\n\nThen he hears something hit the front door.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd opens the front door and picks up the\nnewspaper which has just been thrown. He puts it with the other\nnewspapers, which have piled up in their plastic wraps on his desk.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe comes back into the bathroom and looks at the bathtub. \n\n\nHe puts the plunger over the drain and works it\nmuch harder and, this time, after a few seconds, there is a loud knock\nin the pipes, as if he hit something. He takes the plunger away and\nwatches the drain.\n\n\nSuddenly, a large air bubble bursts out of the drain.  He watches, but the water shows no sign of draining.\n\n\nThen, slowly, blood starts to leak into the tub from the drain.\n\n\nEd is naturally terrified by this.  He watches until it is clear that it is blood and not just more gook.\n\n\nHe puts plunger back on the drain and pumps it a\nfew more frantic times. More blood seeps out of the drain. He seems to\nbe making the problem worse.\n\n\nHe shuts the shower curtain and backs out of the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nHe spills the pills on the kitchen counter and\ncounts them quickly. There are about ten left. He pours them into his\nmouth and swallows the rest of the wine.\n\n\nThen the ticking stops.  Ed looks at a clock on the wall.  The second hand has stopped.\n\n\nHe hears voices in the other room.\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nHe looks out of the window in Eve's room. He\nsees that the light in the neighbor's window is on. The couple next\ndoor are having another argument, but this one is much more intense\nthan the last.\n\n\nWOMAN\n\n\n(O.S.)\n2t2Why do you care! You don't care! You know nothing about me! I hate\nyou! Stay away from me! I'll scream! I am not screaming now! You think\nyou're the only one? Yes, I do! I LOVE YOU! You never do that! You do\nnot! You never do anything! You think that nothing's wrong! You think\nwe live in paradise! This is what I think of this fucking house!\n\n\nThere is the sound of things breaking.\n\n\nWOMAN\n\n\n(O.S.)\n\n\nIT'S NOT MY FAULT! IT'S NOT MY FAULT! THEN DON'T! I AM\nNOT! I LOVE YOU! FUCK YOU! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT! STAY AWAY\nFROM ME! YOU RUINED MY LIFE! STAY AWAY FROM ME! STOP IT! SHUT UP! STAY\nAWAY FROM ME! NO! STOP IT! YOU SON OF A BITCH! HELP! HELP!\n\n\nThis ends with a loud, terrifying shriek.  It seems to echo around the room as Ed watches.  Then the voices stop.\n\n\nEd watches the window and sees a featureless man\nstick his head through the curtains to see if anybody is listening.\nThen he closes the window and curtains.\n\n\nThe phone rings in the other room.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nHe hurries to answer the phone.\n\n\nWhile he is on the phone, a new sound is coming from the bathroom.  It is like the gurgling sound, but also subtly different.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nMr Saxon?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIt's Detective Derm.  I'm sorry to call you so late, but I thought you would want to hear this.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nI'm afraid I have some bad news.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat is it?\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nIt's your wife.  We've found her...\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou found her.\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nWe found her body.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHer...\n\n\nDERM\n\n\nYes, sir.  In the woods, near George Simian's house, where we found her car.  I'm afraid she's dead.\n\n\nEd drops the phone.  He walks trance-like into the hallway.\n\n\nHe follows the noise into the -\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nThe noise coming from the bathroom now sounds more human, like a baby gurgling.\n\n\nAs Ed walks into the bathroom, he can see that\nthere is something in the bathtub. The shower curtain is closed, but\nbehind it, there is some sort of body moving. Ed pulls the curtain\nback. He reveals a baby, just born, lying in the tub. Most of the murky\nwater has drained and left a dirty ring around the tub.\n\n\nThe BABY is a newborn, except that its eyes are\nmaybe larger than they would be. The Baby is also SIX FEET TALL. It's\nimmense frame fills the bathtub. It is naked (it's a boy).\n\n\nEd watches with amazement. The baby looks\nincredibly real, except for its size. The stare at each other for a\nminute. The baby looks a lot like George Simian. It has his eyes.\n\n\nOther than this, it behaves like a baby. It is\nlying on its back, gurgling peacefully with his feet in the air and his\nleft hand gripping the shower curtain.\n\n\nThe baby reaches out for Ed lovingly.\n\n\nEd backs away.\n\n\nSeeing this, the baby starts crying.\n\n\nEd, panicking, approaches the baby. It is still\ncrying. Ed reaches out to touch it. He touches its arm and the baby's\ncrying starts to subside. The baby moves with typical, quick, chaotic\nmovements that, because of the baby's size, are almost threatening.\n\n\nEd puts his hand in the baby's hand. The baby\ngrips it as baby's do, but this baby's hand is about the size of Ed's.\nThe baby stops crying and returns to its curious gurgling.\n\n\nEd tries to pull his hand back, but the baby\nwon't let go. The baby, it seems, is incredibly strong. Ed pulls\nharder. He still can't get the baby to let go. Ed tries to pry the\nbaby's fingers off, and this time manages to get his hand out of the\nbaby's grip.\n\n\nBut as soon as he does, the baby starts crying again.\n\n\nHe backs out into the hallway.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd is in a panic.  The baby's cries echo around him as he backs away from the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nEd finds himself in the kitchen. He looks at his\nhands which are covered with bloody muck from the tub. He washes them\noff in the sink. He looks over at the kitchen knife which has been\ndrying in the dish rack.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd walks slowly, purposefully to the bathroom.  The crying baby gets louder as he approaches.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe comes into the bathroom, but in the tub,\ninstead of the baby, there is a grown man's body. It is Ed, staring up\nat himself from under the water. We only see a very tight shot of\nBATHTUB ED's head and part of his neck. His head is under water and he\nlooks up, unable to move.\n\n\nWe then see the reverse shot of this and it is\nalso of Ed, so that Ed is, in effect, looking up at himself through the\ncloudy water.\n\n\nThe baby cries continue, although the baby is no longer in the scene.\n\n\nFrom Bathtub Ed's point of view, we see the other Ed takes the kitchen knife and lean forward and to the right, off-camera.\n\n\nBathtub Ed, who can move his eyes, tries to look\nto his arm, where the other Ed is cutting. Soon, blood starts to mix\nwith the water, diffusing over Bathtub Ed's face.\n\n\nThe blood also diffuses over Bathtub Ed's\nP.O.V., as he looks up at the other Ed cutting him. When the other Ed\nis finished cutting, Bathtub Ed sees him put the knife aside and then\nreach down, off-camera. After a short struggle, the other Ed pulls up\nBathtub Ed's severed arm and slips it into a garbage bag he has already\nprepared.\n\n\nThe blood from Bathtub Ed's cut fills the water with dark blood, turning the film red.\n\n\nThe red dissolves into a pool of blood that is in the hallway.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd, with a bucket and sponge, is cleaning pockets of blood from the floor and walls.  He is crying while he does this.\n\n\nHe squeezes the sponge for the last time, then\ninspects the hallway as closely as he can, searching for any spots he\nmight have missed.\n\n\nThen he picks up the bucket and takes it into the bathroom.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nHe dumps the water from the bucket into the\nbathtub. The water is pink and dirty. He sits down on the edge of the\nbathtub and watches the water go down the drain.\n\n\nHe stares at the drain in a trance until he hears a knock on the front door.  He turns to listen to it in the other room.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\n\nAs he opens the bathroom door, he sees that the sun is shining in from the living room.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nGeoffrey stands patiently outside as Ed opens\nthe door. He carries his briefcase and looks dressed for work. His\nappearance is a stark contrast to the half-dressed, blood-shot Ed.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHi.  I wanted to see how you were getting along.\n\n\nED\n\n\nGetting along?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI have to say, you don't look well.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm not well.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHave you slept?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't know.  Maybe.  It's difficult to tell.  I have these lapses, but I'd hardly call it sleep.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nDid you take the pills?\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe pills are fucking useless.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nBut you took them?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI see.  May I take your blood pressure?\n\n\nED\n\n\nOK, fine.\n\n\nGeoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on\nthe table. He takes a stethoscope and the rest of his blood pressure\nkit and starts to take Ed's blood pressure.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI feel like a lab rat.  Like one of those lab rats they drug up and study.  You know what I mean?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYou feel like a rat.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThey put them in a maze and they give them shocks and\ndrugs and they see what they do. They try to prod them in the direction\nthey want them to go.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nTry to relax.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI feel like a rat who took all the turns, took all the\ndrugs, went down the right path and then, when I got to the end, they\nshocked me anyway, right up the sphincter, like it was all just a big\njoke. I guess they thought I'd be too drugged up to notice.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nIt's been a few days, hasn't it, since your wife disappeared?\n\n\nED\n\n\nDays?  Yes.  I guess.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHas there been any word from the police?\n\n\nED\n\n\nHaven't you talked to them?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nNo.  But if you'd like me to, I will, on your behalf.  They know me and I've been through this before.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWith others?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nWith others, and myself.  My wife was taken from me about three years ago.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nIt was a similar situation to yours. The police found\nher car in the parking lot of a mall. They found her body about a week\nlater in some woods nearby.\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe was murdered.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDid they ever catch the man who did it?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhy would somebody do that?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nSometimes a man, when faced with his own problems or inadequacies, takes it out on someone weaker than themselves.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nDo you feel responsible at all for your wife's disappearance?\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nPeople often blame themselves for events that they have\nno control over, especially when the events seem so random and cruel.\nAction leading up to tragedy tend to become more significant. Details\nweigh on the conscience.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI do seem to be having problems with my conscience.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI see.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDo you think that's why I can't sleep?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nCould be.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIs there anything you can give me?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nA prescription?  For your conscience?  Of course not.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThen what's the point?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nThere are other ways I can be of help.\n\n\nED\n\n\nA shoulder to cry on?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nWould you like me to call the police?  There might be some news.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe police called last night, late last night.  They found Eve's body.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nOh, no.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThey found her buried in the woods, near where they found her car.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI'm sorry.  I didn't know.\n\n\nGeoffrey's watch alarm goes off. He looks at the\ntime and then, habitually takes a shiny silver pillbox from his pocket.\nHe takes two pills out.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nExcuse me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI never knew I could feel so alone.\n\n\nGeoffrey takes a thermos from his briefcase, pours some hot tea into the lid and swallows the pills with a mouthful of tea.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHe hasn't called since last night?\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nIt's been a while.  Why don't you let me call him?  Maybe there's some news.\n\n\nWhen Ed doesn't object, Geoffrey takes his address book from his briefcase, along with a cellular phone and dials the number.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nDetective Derm, please. Hi, Charlie, it's Geoffrey. I'm\nover at Ed Saxon's house. Yeah. He was hoping to get some information\non his wife. Uh-huh. Well, he said you called him last night and told\nhim that you had found her body. Uh-huh. I see. In the woods, near\nwhere you found her car. I don't know. Yes. Well, I did give him\nsomething to help him sleep. Right. Yes.\n\n\nThen Geoffrey turns away from Ed and says a few words quietly, so that Ed can't hear.  Then...\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nYes.  Yes.  I'll tell him.  Yes.  OK.  Bye.\n\n\nGeoffrey hangs up and turns back to Ed.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHe says he never called you last night.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHe told me to tell you to wait here for him; that he's coming over.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI don't understand.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nIt is possible that you did fall asleep, that you\ndreamed the phone call. I have to say that I was surprised when you\nsaid you hadn't slept. Those pills are very effective.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThe pills.  Yes.  Maybe.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nStill, this is better, isn't it?  I mean, now there's still a chance.  Your wife could still be...There's still hope.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.  Hope.  But why is he coming over here?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHe said he had some questions to ask you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat questions?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nHe didn't say.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIf he had some questions to ask me, he could have asked me on the phone.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nCalm down, Mr Saxon.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhy did you turn away from me when you were talking to him?  What did you say?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI said you were very tired and anxious and that you seemed to be under a great deal of stress.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou're lying.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI have no reason to lie.\n\n\nED\n\n\nDon't you?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nNo.  Why do you think I'm lying?\n\n\nED\n\n\nBecause you're scared.\n\n\nGeoffrey does look scared.  He has quickly packed up his briefcase.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nMr Saxon.  Please.  I understand you're under a lot of stress.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou don't understand anything.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI came here to help you.\n\n\nED\n\n\nThen help me.  Please.\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nI've done all I can now.  I'm sorry.  I can't do any more.\n\n\nED\n\n\nBut, you'll come to see me again, won't you?\n\n\nGEOFFREY\n\n\nNo.  I don't think I will.\n\n\nGeoffrey leaves.  Ed shuts the door.\n\n\nThe phone rings.\n\n\nEd picks it up.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nIs this Ed?\n\n\nED\n\n\nGeorge.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nWhat did you do to Eve?\n\n\nED\n\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nI know you did. I saw her before she left work. We met\nin the parking lot, like we always did. She told me she was leaving\nyou. She was going to tell you when she got home.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou don't know anything about it.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nYes, I do.  I know you.  Eve talks about you.  She tell me things.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat things?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nI know about the fights you have.\n\n\nED\n\n\nShe's my wife.  We fight sometimes.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nThat's bullshit.  I know what kind of a son of bitch you can be.  She's told me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nWhat don't you tell it to the police?\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nI did.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYou think she was some sort of angel?  She was cheating on me.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nI love her.  I loved her.\n\n\nEd listens to George break down.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\nThere is a long pause.\n\n\nGEORGE\n\n\nIt's not enough.\n\n\nGeorge hangs up.\n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nThe bathroom is completely clean. There is no\nsign of any of the activity from before. Ed finds the bottle of\nprescription sleeping pills. It is empty. He takes a couple of Midol\nand swallows them dry.\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\n\nEd sits down at his desk.  He looks over the papers on his desk.  Sadie's is on top.  He looks it over.\n\n\nThe phone rings and he picks it up.\n\n\nED\n\n\nHello?\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nHello.\n\n\nED\n\n\nSadie.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI wanted to apologize.\n\n\nED\n\n\nNo.  Don't apologize.  It was me.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI shouldn't have left like that.  I don't know what came over me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt was understandable, under the circumstances.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI really wanted you to like me.\n\n\nED\n\n\nI wonder if you'll still feel the same way when you find out what kind of person I really am.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI'll still keep your poem on my wall.\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI think it's a beautiful poem.  I really do.  Are you still there?\n\n\nED\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nSADIE\n\n\nI wish things had turned out better.\n\n\nShe hangs up.  Ed stays on the phone, listening until the dial tone clicks back in.\n\n\nThen Ed hears a car pull up outside.  He follows some quiet footsteps as they walk up to the front door.\n\n\nHe sees the door knob turn quietly in the door.  The door is locked.\n\n\nEd approaches the door slowly, but suddenly, there is a crash against it.  Someone is trying to knock the door down.\n\n\nThe door is strong, and doesn't open, but the wall around it shakes.\n\n\nAfter a few seconds, there is another crash\nagainst the door. This time the wall shakes so much that Eve's picture,\nwhich hangs by the door, almost falls off its nail.\n\n\nEd looks out of the window. The window is\npositioned facing the street, but not the porch, so he cannot see who\nit is, but he can see a car parked out front, with the door still open.\nInside the car, there is a softball glove lying on the passenger seat,\nalong with something that George Simian was wearing when we last saw\nhim.\n\n\nGeorge crashes against the door again. This\ntime Eve's picture falls off the wall. It hits the ground and smashes,\nspreading broken glass around her picture.\n\n\nThe door is starting to loosen around the lock and jamb.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd backs into the hallway.  As he passes the bathroom, he can hear the gurgling sounds from the plumbing starting up again.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\n\nEd backs into the kitchen. He searches around,\nquickly finding the kitchen knife. He grabs it out of the dish rack and\nstarts walking toward the front door.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nThere's another bang on the door.  Ed passes slowly through the hallway, watching the door, holding the knife in front of him.\n\n\nThe gurgling sounds in the bathroom are deep and resonant, echoing out of the drain, around the bathroom and into the hallway.\n\n\nThere is another hard crash against the door,\nwhich breaks the jamb. The door is only being held on by the splinters\naround the lock and George starts kicking the door with his foot.\n\n\nEd backs into the basement door.  He opens it and goes into the-\n\n\nINT. BASEMENT\n\n\nHe hurries down the stairs into the darkness of\nthe basement. The pipes surround Ed with hysterical, thick, watery\nsounds. There are metallic creaks and strains which reverberate around\nthe walls of the basement as the pipes seem to expand and contract.\n\n\nA couple of inches of dark, dirty water have collected on the floor and Ed's feet get wet as he steps off the last stair.\n\n\nEd finds a place to hide in the shadows behind\nsome boxes. He stares up, as he hears the door breaking open upstairs\nand someone walking into the living room.\n\n\nWith his eyes, he follows the footsteps as they search the apartment.\n\n\nEd has hidden under a large pipe, which is\ndripping drops of dirty water onto his face. In the darkness of the\nbasement, the color of the water is unclear, but as he wipes some onto\nhis fingers, he can see it is murky and dark.\n\n\nThe basement door opens slowly, and from the\nlight upstairs, Ed can see the silhouette of George Simian standing\nwith a softball bat.\n\n\nEd grips onto his knife and watches as George\ncomes down the stairs, step by step. The water keeps dripping on the\ntop of Ed's head, running down the side of his face, but he holds\nstill.\n\n\nEd watches George come down the stairs.\n\n\nGeorge reaches the bottom and steps into the shallow water.  He peers cautiously into the shadows.  He starts walking toward Ed.\n\n\nEd withdraws as much as he can into his corner until he is in complete darkness.\n\n\nHe watches George approaching him and he slowly raises his knife.\n\n\nGeorge raises his softball bat. He takes a few\nmore steps up to Ed, but then steps blindly past him and into a deep,\ndark shadow.\n\n\nEd watches him disappear into the shadow and\nthen, makes his move. He rushes into the shadow with his knife raised\nand both he and George are engulfed in darkness.\n\n\nAfter a few seconds, Ed emerges from the\nshadow. He drops the knife into the water at his feet. As he does,\nblood runs out of the shadow, mixing with the water in the basement\nfloor.\n\n\nEd walks slowly upstairs.  The noises around him in the basement are now at their loudest.  \n\n\nINT. BATHROOM\n\n\nEd takes a long look at himself in the mirror.\nHe is wet with blood and dirt. He opens the medicine cabinet and finds\nthe sleeping pills he was using before. He opens the bottle and empties\nit into his hand. There are only about five pills left.\n\n\nHe takes the two toothbrushes from a toothpaste-crusty glass and fills it with water.  He takes the pills.\n\n\nUnsatisfied, he searches through the rest of the\nmedicine cabinet. The selection, though not particularly toxic, is a\ngood representation of standard, over-the-counter pills and tonics. He\nfinds the Midol and takes the last few from the bottle. There is a\nbottle of cold medicine which he finishes off. He drinks down a nearly\nfull bottle of pink diarrhea medicine. He finds a bottle of\nmulti-vitamins and takes a handful of those. As he finishes each one,\nhe drops the empties onto the floor of the bathroom.\n\n\nWhen he stops, he notices blood seeping out of\nthe bathtub drain. It is pure, thick, dark blood. He backs away into\nthe hallway.\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY\n\n\nEd backs into the wall and then, losing strength in his legs, lowers himself to the floor.  He keeps watching the bathtub.\n\n\nPiano music starts to seep through the gurgling noises.  Ed turns towards Eve's room.\n\n\nOn the other side of the house, outside the\nbroken door, Ed can hear Derm's car pull up. Ed watches the living room\nas Derm comes in carefully, flanked by Mazurek and Snyder.\n\n\nDerm comes over to Ed and kneels down in front of him.  Ed looks up at him helplessly.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt wasn't me.\n\n\nDerm looks at Ed's hands, which are covered in blood.\n\n\nED\n\n\nIt wasn't me.\n\n\nEd watches Derm looking at him.  Then he notices, behind Derm, blood seeping over the rim of the bathtub.\n\n\nEd turns to Eve's room, where the piano can still be heard.\n\n\nThe camera continues on where Ed can't go: down\nthe hallway to Eve's room. As it approaches, all the other noises fade\nout and the piano is all that we hear.\n\n\nEd watches from his position in the hall so that it all seems like his point of view.\n\n\nINT. EVE'S ROOM\n\n\nThe camera comes into Eve's room and turns to the piano.\n\n\nEVE is sitting at the piano, playing some music.\nWe watch her for a few seconds. She turns to the camera as she plays,\nthen continues playing.\n\n\nThen the camera turns toward the clouds painted\non the ceiling. A crack appears in the plaster and starts widening\nuntil there is an empty black space behind it. The sound of the baby\ncrying seeps in from the crack. The camera zeroes in on this black\nuntil it fills the frame. Over the blackness, we can hear the baby\ncrying until it fades out.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChasing Sleep\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Walker\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:26.344950"}
