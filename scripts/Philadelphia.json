Citizen is asked to rank\n                    professions according to the\n                    respect he holds for them... Where\n                    are the lawyers? Somewhere below\n                    personal fitness trainers and only\n                    slightly above child pornographers.\n                    If we keep suing each other, if we\n                    fail to settle the smallest\n                    difference among ourselves with\n                    mutual respect, if we continue to\n                    scrap like bucks in heat, we'll\n                    fall lower on that list. And when\n                    people lose respect for lawyers,\n                    they lose respect for the law.

With his free\nhand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an\namazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various\nparts of his body.)\n\nAndrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV.\nJIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while\nMatt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering\nthe judgment. Matt's audience is loving it.\n\nAs Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags\nfrom him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.\n\nPeople KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and\nhappiness evident in the room.\n\nON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling\neyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.\n\nON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.\n\nAndrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he\nwants Joe to sit there.\n\nJoe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.\n\nWith some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask.
