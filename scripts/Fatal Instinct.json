He's a cop. A plain clothes detective \n               who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost.\n\n               Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at \n               least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations \n               except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos \n               from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his \n               fingers.\n\n               The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED.

Ned \n               steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean.\n\n               A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a \n               recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME.\n\n               A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing.

She falls into step beside \n               him, lighting her own cigarette. A saxophone player named \n               DIZZY follows behind them, continuing to play.
