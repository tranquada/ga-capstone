I don't know a\nsingle one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?\n\n\n\nELASTIGIRL\n\nOf course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this\nat the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know\nwhat I mean?\n\n\n\nFROZONE\n\nSuperladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret\nidentity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I\nsaid, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or\nanything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a\nsuper-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.\n\n\n\nMR. INCREDIBLE\n\nNo matter how many times you save the world, it always\nmanages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,\nyou know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this\nmess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?''\n\n\n\nINTERVIEWER\n\nI could get to that point.\n\n\n\nMR.

I'm at the top of my game!\nI'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the\nworld to the men? I don't think so.

No matter what happens.\n\n\n\nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)\n\nHey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen?\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for\nsaving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,\nwho was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit\nagainst the famed superhero in Superior Court.\n\n\n\nSANSWEET'S LAWYER\n\nMr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't\nwant to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so\nquote, causes him daily pain.\n\n\n\nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)\n\nHey, I saved your life!\n\n\n\nSANSWEET\n\nYou didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what\nyou did!\n\n\n\nBOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)\n\nListen--\n\n\n\nMR. INCREDIBLE'S LAWYER\n\nMy client has no further comment at this time.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER\n\nFive days later, another suit was filed by victims of the\nel train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And\nopened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over.\n\n\n\nWOMAN\n\nIt is time for their secret identity to become their only\nidentity. Time for them to join us, or go away.\n\n\n\nANNOUNCER\n\nUnder tremendous public pressure, and the crushing\nfinancial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly\ninitiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty\nfrom responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never\nagain resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average\ncitizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world\na better place.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________SCENE\n6__________________________________________\n\n\n\nstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma'>(15 YEARS LATER)\n\n\n\nMRS.
