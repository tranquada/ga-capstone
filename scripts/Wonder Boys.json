CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON\n\n\tGrady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is \n\tin the midst of reading a story to the dozen college \n\tSTUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t...listening to her father's boots scrape like \n\t\tchalk on the ancient steps of the church, then \n\t\tgrow faint, then disappear altogether.'\n\n\tAs he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, \n\tperched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE \n\tBANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:\n\n\tWELCOME TO WORDFEST\n\n\tGRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if \n\tthey've been on a field trip to the DMV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd) \n\t\t\t(a wave of the pages) \n\t\tSo. .Anyone?\n\n\tA GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN \n\tsitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES \n\tLEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the \n\twindow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCARRIE MCWHIRTY \n\t\tLet me get this straight. The girl with the \n\t\tbig lips is depressed because, each night, when \n\t\ther father goes off to work at the bakery, her \n\t\tmother sneaks some mysterious lover into the \n\t\thouse. Not only does this girl have to listen \n\t\tto her mother working this guy in the next \n\t\troom, she has to wash the sheets each morning \n\t\tbefore Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of \n\t\tthis, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy \n\t\ttakes her to confession--only, once she gets in \n\t\tthe box, she gets a whiff of the priest and \n\t\trealizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is \n\t\tthat it?\n\n\tJames Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY \n\tOVERCOAT he wears.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCARRIE MCWHIRTY\n\t\tI mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tAll right. Let's try to keep it constructive, \n\t\tshall we? Howard, what about you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHOWARD \n\t\tI hated it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tThat's not exactly what I meant by \n\t\tconstructive, Howard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHOWARD \n\t\tI think James should try to be more \n\t\tconstructive. This is my second semester with \n\t\thim. His stories are brutal, man. They make me \n\t\twant to kill myself.\n\n\tGRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. \n\tThen--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the \n\traised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYes, Hannah?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHANNAH GREEN\n\t\tI think maybe we're missing the point. It \n\t\tseems to me James' strength as a writer is that \n\t\the doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us \n\t\tlike adults. He respects us enough to forget \n\t\tus. That takes . . . courage .\n\n\tGRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tWell put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I \n\t\tthink. \n\t\t\t(as the students rise) \n\t\tDon't forget about WordFest this weekend. And \n\t\tremember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to \n\t\ttonight's cocktail party need to have them at \n\t\tthe Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.\n\n\tHannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tThanks for that. He all right?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHANNAH GREEN\n\t\tI think so. ..What about you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tMe? Sure. Why?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHANNAH GREEN\n\t\tJust checking.\n\n\tGRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY \n\tBOOTS, then starts to exit himself. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tTurn out the light, please.\n\n\tGRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back \n\tof the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the \n\twail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.\n\n2\tINT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) \n\n\tGRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, \n\t45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful \n\tof SLICK PROGRAMS.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\t\t(calm but firm) \n\t\tNo, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for \n\t\ttoday. This means we have no programs for the \n\t\tweekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at \n\t\t9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw \n\t\tHall and have absolutely no idea where they are \n\t\tgoing. \n\t\t\t(shaking her head) \n\t\tIt's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.\n\n\tGRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. \n\tThere is the slightest of hesitations, then....\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tProfessor Tripp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tChancellor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tI got the message you called.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI got the message you called too.\n\n\tThis hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and \n\tcontinue on, without so much as a backward glance. \n\n3\tINT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING\n\n\tThe RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a \n\tJOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66 \n\tGALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another \n\tBANNER:\n\n\tWELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28\n\n4\tEXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH \n\n\tGRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest \n\tskyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. \n\n5\tINT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT\n\n\tGRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half \n\tthe length of the terminal, until...\n\n6\tINT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT\n\n\t...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the \n\ttunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black \n\tdress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.  \n\tGrinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the \n\twoman's ear, then spots Grady.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tTripp!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHow are you, Crabtree?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tBrimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss \n\t\tAntonia. . .uh. . . .\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWOMAN \n\t\tSloviak.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tI took the liberty of inviting Antonia to \n\t\ttonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. \n\t\tTrip? ?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(a slight beat) \n\t\tThe more the merrier.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK \n\t\tTerry was telling me about you on the plane. \n\t\tIt was ail so interesting.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tI was explaining to Antonia how a book comes \n\t\tto be published. What you do as a writer, what \n\t\tI do as an editor...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI sweat blood for five years and he checks for \n\t\tspelling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK \n\t\t\t(indicating Crabtree) \n\t\tThat's exactly what he said.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tWe know each other pretty well. \n\t\t\t(to Grady) \n\t\tSo where's Emily?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tEmily?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tYour wife.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tOh. We're picking her up. Downtown.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tPerfect. Well then, shall we?\n\n\tGRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the \n\tarchitecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in \n\ther spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.\n\n7\tINT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER\n\n\tGRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak \n\tsits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tDo you know how many times I've boarded an \n\t\tairplane praying someone like her would sit \n\t\tdown beside me? Particularly while I'm on my \n\t\tway to Pittsburgh.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tLay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great \n\t\tcities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tIf it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no \n\t\targument from me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tShe's a transvestite.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tYou're stoned.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tShe's still a transvestite.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tMm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tIsn't she?\n\n\tCrabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he \n\twatches the carousel spin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tSo how's the book?\n\n\tGRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so \n\tsoon. He tries to act casual.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tIt's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort \n\t\tof. ..tinkering with it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tGreat. I was hoping I could get a look at it \n\t\tsometime this weekend. Think that might be \n\t\tpossible?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . \n\t\tjuncture .\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tI thought you were tinkering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI just mean. . .\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tForget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, \n\t\tTripp. But...\n\t\t\t(pointedly)\n\t\t ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?\n\n\tGRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's \n\tface brightens again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tAh. ..well now. What do you suppose that would \n\t\tbe?\n\n\tGRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto \n\tthe carousel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tThat would be a tuba.\n\n8\tINT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8\n\n\tAs the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the \n\tgreat city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, \n\tthen glances in the rearview mirror.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tThat perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It \n\t\twouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK\n\t\tWhy yes. How did you know?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tLucky guess.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tYou didn't actually purchase this car, did \n\t\tyou. Trip??\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tIt was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE \n\t\tHe owes God money. You know, he queered \n\t\thimself for good with Esquire.\n\n\tGRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto \n\tbutane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHe said something about being between things.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tYeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken \n\t\tlegs.\n\n9\tEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER  \n\n\tA YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS \n\tUMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in \n\tfront of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her \n\tface. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger \n\twindow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHi, Tanya. \n\t\t\t(to the others) \n\t\tThis is Tanya. My wife's secretary.\n\n\tCRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and \n\tnods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTANYA \n\t\tGrady.. ..Emily's not here.\n\n\tGRADY just smiles, nods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTANYA (cont'd) \n\t\tIs there anything I can do for you?\n\n\tGRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through \n\tTanya's sad umbrella.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYou're leaking, Tanya.\n\n\tTanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tTrip? ?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tShe left me. Crabs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tLeft you...?  Who? Emily?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tThis morning. I found a note in the kitchen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tBut. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I \n\t\tmean, what are we doing here?\n\n\tGRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his \n\twindshield, turns on the ignition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI thought maybe I made it all up.\n\n10\tEXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING \n\n\tThrough the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and \n\tselect students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of \n\tcigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching \n\thalt across the street, parks in front of another fire \n\thydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a \n\tGREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK\n\t\tThat's a nice greenhouse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tIt's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tI thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, \n\t\tTripp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tPiss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tOh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always \n\t\tdo.\n\n11\tEXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE  \n\n\tAs the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, \n\triding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tWell, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you \n\t\tagain. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tChancellor. Don't you look ravishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tAren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to \n\t\twonder if you were ever going to--oh!\n\n\tAs Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches \n\tforward ...into Grady's arms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tEasy there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't \n\t\tknow how anyone actually walks in these things.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK\n\t\tPractice.\n\n\tSara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific \n\tcuriosity in her eye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI don't believe we've met...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK\n\t\tAntonia. Antonia Sloviak--\n\n\tJust then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES \n\tskitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general \n\tdirection of Grady.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tPoe!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\t\t(mildly)\n\t\tThis wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?\n\n\tPoe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the \n\thardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around \n\tand is barking at the living room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK\n\t\tWho ' s he barking at now?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHe's still barking at me. He's blind.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tPoe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.\n\n\tAs Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI need to talk to you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tThat's funny. I need to talk to you, too. \n\t\t\t(strategy in her tone)\n\t\tPerhaps you could put some of these coats in \n\t\tthe upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(reading her)\n\t\tI don't believe I know where the upstairs \n\t\tguest room is.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tWell then. I'd better show you. Terry--\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tWe'll just make ourselves at home.\n\t\t\t(kneeling by Poe) \n\t\tWon't we, Poe? Yes, yes....\n\n12\tINT. UPSTAIRS ROOM \n\n\tGRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. \n\tAUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of \n\tfamous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN \n\tIN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with \n\tPITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As \n\tSara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S \n\tPENNANT hanging over the mantle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tNew?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tWalter just got it back from the framer today.\n\n\tSara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the \n\tpennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tYou go first.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tAll right. This morning--\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tI'm pregnant.\n\n\tA flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below. \n\tGRADY starts to speak.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tI'm sure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tWell. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI think Walter would find this a little more \n\t\tthan surprising.\n\n\tGRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tEmily left me this morning.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tShe's left before...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tShe's left the room before. She always came \n\t\tback.\n\n\tSara nods. Considers this.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tSo. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry \n\t\teach other, and have this baby, right? Simple.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tSimple.\n\n\tGRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat \n\tlying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tIs that Cristaile?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\t\t(weary)\n\t\tMy God, I wear the same scent as a \n\t\ttransvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: \n\t\tshe?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tIf she's not now, Terry will make sure she is \n\t\tby the end of the evening.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tHas he asked to see the book yet?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tAnd? Are you going to tell him?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tNo. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm \n\t\tgoing to do.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\t\t(distantly) \n\t\tNeither do 1.\n\n\tGRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tSara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI guess you're going to have to chew it off \n\t\tthen.\n\n13\tINT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE   \n\n\tPoe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by \n\tMiss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, \n\treturning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds \n\tMISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tWalter! I see you've met my friend.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER GASKELL \n\t\tYes . She' s charming.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK\n\t\t\t(taking her drink)\n\t\tWalter's been telling me the most fascinating \n\t\tthings about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER GASKELL\n\t\tJoe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my \n\t\tcontention that their marriage tapped into the \n\t\tvery id of American popular culture. Joe \n\t\tDiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, \n\t\tthe Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be \n\t\tcontroversial, I personally believe every \n\t\twoman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn \n\t\tMonroe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMISS SLOVIAK\n\t\tOh, I couldn't agree more.\n\n\tNEW ANGLE\n\n\tGRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and \n\tchanges course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN \n\t(\"Q\"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's \n\tclear he is someone of interest.

REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT   \n\n\tGRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from \n\this pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around \n\tthe side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE \n\taccosts him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE \n\t\tThere you are.\n\n\tGRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he \n\tsees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the \n\tperson to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in \n\tthe kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tI could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in \n\t\there. You haven't seen it, have you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if \n\t\tI was sitting on it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYou'd recognize it if you tasted it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI doubt it, darling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t\t(angling & bottle to the light)\n\t\tWell, Q certainly will. And, given that he \n\t\twill be addressing 500 people in little over an \n\t\thour...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tYou want to keep him happy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER \n\t\tIf he' s happy. . .\n\t\t\t(kissing her as he exits) \n\t\tI'm happy.\n\n\tAs Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in \n\tthe quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, \n\tshe takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, \n\treturning to the clamor inside her house.\n\n\tGRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of \n\tLIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching \n\thim from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's \n\tgarage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught \n\teavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the \n\tporch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tJames?\n\n\tJames Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a \n\tGREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at \n\twhat appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tIt's fake.\n\n\tJames' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY \n\tpeers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The \n\tsliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED \n\tPISTOL.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tIt was my mother's. She won it in a penny \n\t\tarcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic \n\t\tschool.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tIt's very convincing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tIt used to shoot these little paper caps, but \n\t\tthey don't make them anymore. The caps.\n\n\tGRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers \n\tand slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tIt's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry \n\t\trabbits' feet...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t...You carry firearms.\n\n\tAs GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass \n\tbriefly over the jay. GRADY\n\tnotices, offers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tNo, thank you. I don't like to lose control of \n\t\tmy emotions.\n\n\tGRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tI'm not supposed to be here, in case you were \n\t\twondering. I crashed. I mean, not \n\t\tintentionally...\n\n\tJames nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be \n\tseen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER (cont'd)\n\t\t...but the other night, Hannah and I were \n\t\ttogether, at the movies, and she asked me. \n\t\tSince she was coming. So I ended up coming. \n\t\tToo.\n\n\tGRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tAre you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tNo! What gave you that idea?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tRelax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent \n\t\ther a room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tShe likes old movies like I do, that's ail.\n\t\t\t(glancing back at the window) \n\t\tBesides, she doesn't really know me. She \n\t\tthinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's \n\t\tbecause she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tMaybe it's because she's beautiful and she \n\t\tknows it and try as she might to not let that \n\t\tscrew her up, it's inevitable that it will in \n\t\tsome way.\n\n\tJames looks away from the window, at Grady.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tYou're not like my other teachers, Professor \n\t\tTripp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYou're not like my other students, James. So \n\t\twhat was the movie you two saw?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tHuh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and \n\t\tFrances Farmer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tShe went crazy, Frances Farmer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tSo did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tSounds like a good one.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\t\t(a crooked smile) \n\t\tIt's not bad.\n\n\tGRADY considers James' fragile face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tListen, James, about this afternoon. In \n\t\tworkshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a \n\t\tbit out of control.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tThey really hated it. I think they hated it \n\t\tmore than any of the other ones.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tWell...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tIt doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to \n\t\twrite.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(truly impressed) \n\t\tReally? That's remarkable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tI have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in \n\t\tbed I figure them out. The stories.\n\n\tAs James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY \n\tlooks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. \n\tLike a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against \n\tthe modest bulk of the cap gun.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYou cold, James?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\t\t(distant) \n\t\tA little.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tSo what are you doing out here?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tIt's colder in there. -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(laughing) \n\t\tYou're right.\n\n\tJames blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that \n\the's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tActually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought \n\t\t...I thought I'd come out here and take a look \n\t\tat it. You don't see one of those every day. It \n\t\tlooks like heaven...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHeaven?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tI saw a movie once. Part of it took place in \n\t\theaven. Everyone wore white and lived in \n\t\tcrystal houses. Like that. At least that's the \n\t\tway I remember it...\n\n\tAbruptly, James glances at his watch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tI should be going.\n\n\tJames turns away, then stops. He stands like this a \n\tmoment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER (cont'd) \n\t\tGoodbye, Professor Tripp.\n\n\tGRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off \n\tthen, leaving the light of the house behind.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tJames. \n\t\t\t(as he stops)\n\t\tDon't leave just yet. There's something I \n\t\tthink you ought to see.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tI'll miss my bus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tThis is worth it.\n\n\tJames looks conflicted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd) \n\t\tTrust me.\n\n15\tINT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  \n\n\tIt's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past \n\tthe departing guests and toward the stairs.        \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHANNAH GREEN\n\t\tHey, you two.\n\n\tGRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHANNAH GREEN (cont'd) \n\t\tAre you riding with me, James?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tNo, I'm going ho--\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHe's going with me.

Charles \n\t\tBoyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, \n\t\t1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an \n\t\taccident, but, you know. . . \n\t\t\t(a trace of irony)\n\t\tHe was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took \n\t\tpills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he \n\t\thung himself. He wrote his suicide note in \n\t\tlipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more \n\t\tpills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget \n\t\twhen. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot \n\t\thimself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. \n\t\tEverett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret \n\t\tSullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. \n\t\tGig Young. He shot himself and his wife in \n\t\t1978. There are more but I don't know if you \n\t\twould have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara \n\t\tBlandick? Maggie McNamara?

James \n\tblinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs \n\tshyly, looks away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tThat's just how my brain works, I guess.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tFascinating. Listen, why don't you come out \n\t\twith us after the lecture. There's a place on \n\t\tthe Hill I always get Trip to take me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tActually. ..I just want to go home.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tOh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants \n\t\tto go home. Besides, faculty will be present. \n\t\tJust think of it as a field trip.\n\n\tAs he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if \n\tto say: \"Bring him.\"   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James \n\tglacially as we CUT TO:\n\n\tBLACK\n\n\tThe dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR \n\topens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of \n\tMARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.\n\n16\tINT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE   \n\n\tGRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the \n\tphotograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-\n\tSTRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN \n\tJACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tIs that really it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tThat's really it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tThe one she wore on her wedding day?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tSo I'm told.\n\n\tJames, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide \n\tgarments, stands speechless.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(cont'd) \n\t\tGo ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tReally?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tReally.\n\n\tJames swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he \n\treaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, \n\tbarely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tThey're glass. The buttons.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tLike the lady herself.\n\n\tGRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a \n\tbit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the \n\tjacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tShe was small. Most people don't know that. \n\t\tThe shoulders are small.\n\t\t\t(touching the satin)\n\t\tIt looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time \n\t\tshe wore it. That day.

It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI guess.

PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) \n\n\tAs sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of \n\tThaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a \n\tspace between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tOkay.\n\n\tJames totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs \n\tlooking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps \n\tforward, and takes the hind legs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tHe's still a little warm.\n\n\tThey lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until \n\tthere is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tYuck.\n\n\tGRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tThat's a. big trunk.

Ah. Here we go...\n\n\tGRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-\n\tsize bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of \n\tboxers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tOh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--\n\t\tgay?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tMost of the time he is, James. Some of the \n\t\ttime he isn't. Now what do we have here?\n\n\tGRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a \n\tpair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tLooks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That \n\t\tshould take the pinch out of my ankle.\n\t\t\t(handing the bottle to James) \n\t\tHave one.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tNo thanks. I'm fine without them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tRight.

I'm sorry I said that.\n\n\tRecklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, \n\tand tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, \n\the spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill \n\tfrom the lapel of his jacket.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tHow 'bout we try that again.\n\n20\tINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER\n\n\tOn the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t...really needs no introduction. Walk down the \n\t\taisle of any airplane or by the pool of any \n\t\thotel and you'll see his face beaming back at \n\t\tyou. You all know the name, you all know the \n\t\tbooks, so welcome if you will, the man those of \n\t\tus who know him simply call.. .Q.\n\n\tAs the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the \n\tauditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an \n\topen space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID \n\twith a GOATEE .who regards him warily.\n \n\t\t\t\t\tQ \n\t\tGood evening.\n\n\tGRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, \n\twatching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting \n\tuntil the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory \n\thush. Finally, he speaks again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQ \n\t\tI am a writer.\n\n\tAs the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns.

As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, \n\tJames ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows \n\taway, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.\n\n\tGRADY blinks, turns to James.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI'll be right back.\n\n21\tINT.

GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER\n\n\tAs Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James \n\tLeer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above \n\tthe door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with \n\tonly dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He \n\ttakes the doorknob, turns it.

LIVING ROOM     \n\n\tThe room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes \n\tof light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he \n\tfinds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-\n\tshirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling \n\thand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet \n\tCoke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but \n\this eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet.

GRADY'S OFFICE\n\n\tJames Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old \n\tsleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James' \n\tknapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects \n\this ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.\n\n\tSomething yellow. Something soft.\n\n\tGRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing \n\ta magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET \n\tfrom James Leer's ratty green knapsack. \n\n\tGRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking \n\tvery tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the \n\tlight on the both of them.\n\n43\tEXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) \n\n\tGRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and \n\tplucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch \n\tstep.

EMILY'S OFFICE \n\n\tGRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, \n\tlets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and \n\twell-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of \n\tGrady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, \n\tpads and pens neatly arranged alongside.\n\n\tA BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate \n\tmosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, \n\tframed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's \n\tDHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's \n\tDaughter.\n\n\tThere are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck \n\twith friends. In a sundress with Grady.

A THUMPING is \n\theard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down \n\tthe last few steps of the stairway.

GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) \n\n\tJames, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath \n\this ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack \n\tswinging from his shoulder.

The baby is \n\tstaring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST \n\tPAPERBACK. GRADY\n\tfrowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a \n\tspray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.\n\n\tA thought evolves.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd)\n\t\t\t(the balloons)\n\t\tWhat do you think of these?\n\n\tJames takes another chug from his jug, nods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER \n\t\tNice.\n\n51\tEXT.

GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS  \n\n\tGRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches \n\tsomething on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON.

It's about half-down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYou better ease off that stuff, James. It's \n\t\tpretty acidic.\n\n\tJames takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, \n\tstudies it curiously.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJAMES LEER\n\t\tI can't help myself.

What do you \n\t\tthink's the matter with you?\n\n\tAs GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers \n\tthe ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets \n\tthe donut in precisely the same place.\n\n53\tINT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER\n\n\tThrough the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the \n\tballoon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the \n\tballoon down, and steps back, considering the placement.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA O.S.) \n\t\tFeeling guilty?\n\n\tGRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized \n\tbehind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA (cont'd) \n\t\tI can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tTotally.  I'm sorry.

In-the back, CRABTREE \n\tpuffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly \n\twith the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED \n\tPAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tNaturally you have copies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI have an alternate version of the first \n\t\tchapter. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tYou'll be all right then.

CRABTREE stands stunned.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tYou mind explaining what you just did?\n\n\tGRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping \n\tNORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tCame to my senses. CRABTREE\n\n\t\tAh. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is \n\t\tJames supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell \n\t\tto come to his?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tWalter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer \n\t\tto jail, Crabs.

It's \n\t\tcomforting to know that America's children have \n\t\tyou for a teacher.\n\n\tGRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the \n\tbuildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tNobody teaches a writer anything. You tell \n\t\tthem what you know. You tell them to find their \n\t\tvoice and stick with it, because that's all you \n\t\thave in the end. You tell the ones who have it \n\t\tto keep at it and you tell the ones who don't \n\t\tto keep at it, too. Because that's the only way \n\t\tto get where you're going. \n\t\t\t(ruefully) \n\t\tOf course, it helps if you know where you want \n\t\tto go. \n\t\t\t(thoughtfully)\n\t\tMaybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--\n\t\tthat's made the last seven years worthwhile.\n\n\tGRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles \n\tcryptically as he considers it. -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd)\n\t\tAs for James, he doesn't need me anymore...\n\n\tWithout warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd)\n\t\tHe's got you.\n\n\tCRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, \n\twatches GRADY walk away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tMe?

You're good at that.\n\n\tGRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as \n\the walks toward the buildings in the distance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tI'm sorry, Tripp.\n\n\tGRADY stops, turns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYou peeked, didn't you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tI peeked. \n\n\tGRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter \n\tanymore\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCRABTREE\n\t\tIt really had the makings, Tripp. There was a \n\t\tlot to admire. I've ...never read anything \n\t\tquite like it.\n\n\tIf there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, \n\tCrabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, \n\tand show.

Empty desks.\n\n\tHe walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two \n\tafternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill \n\tbreeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the \n\tbarren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. \n\tturns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his \n\tpocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his \n\tmanuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half \n\tlength-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner \n\tdown into a triangle along the first crease...\n\n113\tEXT. QUAD  \n\n\tA moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER \n\tAIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring \n\tthen dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.\n\n114\tINT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER\n\n\tGRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the \n\tauditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies \n\tSara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tSara!\n\n\tSara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles \n\tforward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQ\n\t\tGrady. I have to tell you. I took another look \n\t\tat Arsonist's Daughter the other night.

He picks his way \n\tbehind the back row, scanning the aisles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGIRL'S VOICS \n\t\tHey, Professor Tripp.\n\n\tIt's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. \n\tGRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- \n\tnext to her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCARRIE MCWHIRTY\n\t\tIf you're looking for Hannah, she's on the \n\t\taisle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tNo...\n\n\tBut GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the \n\taisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. \n\tThe Goatee Kid sits close beside her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCARRIE MCWHIRTY\n\t\tWho's that guy she's with?

The \n\t\tLoneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.\n\n117\tINT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^\n\n\tAs a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, \n\tGRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his \n\tsurprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the \n\tfront row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily \n\tcomplacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing \n\tCRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAnd Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for \n\t\this City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has \n\t\tfound a home with Putnam for his new Three \n\t\tRivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.\n\n\tA SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE \n\ttakes a shift in tone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tNow, this next one, I think, is especially \n\t\texciting to announce, because it concerns a \n\t\tstudent here at the university. Our own James \n\t\tLeer, a sophomore in English literature, has \n\t\tfound a publisher for his first novel, which I \n\t\tbelieve is called The Lovely Parade.\n\n\tGRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile \n\twarmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in \n\tthe ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, \n\tCarrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCARRIE MCWHIRTY \n\t\tI have a class with him.\n\n\tJames hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the \n\tAPPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCARRIE MCWHIRTY\n\t\tThe guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know \n\t\twhat I mean.\n\n\tGrady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups \n\tHi his hands around his mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tTake a bow, James!\n\n\tJames turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish \n\tgrin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and \n\ttakes his first sweet public bow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd) \n\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tWonder Boy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAnd finally--and perhaps not least \n\t\timportantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has \n\t\talso decided to publish my own book--a critical \n\t\texploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and \n\t\tJoe DiMaggio and its function in American \n\t\tmythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled \n\t\tThe Last American Marriage.     \"\n\n\tWild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, \n\twatches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.     \n\t. :\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWALTER \n\t\tUntil next year. Thank you, everyone.\n\n\tThe LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE \n\tshakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah \n\tGreen down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms \n\taround James.\n\n\tGRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when \n\tsuddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says \n\tsomething congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. \n\tGRADY blinks, scrambles up.\n\n118\tINT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER\n\n\tGRADY bursts into the corridor.'\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tSara!\n\n\tIts empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL \n\tDOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.\n\n119\tINT. NEW CORRIDOR\n\n\tGrady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He \n\tmoves to it, pushes past...\n\n120\tINT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS\n\n\t...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans \n\tout over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. \n\tsteep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of \n\tbasement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and \n\ta COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.\n\n\tGRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes \n\tagainst it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his \n\tailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- \n\tmarijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating \n\tatop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The \n\tSOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're \n\tSara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.\n\n\tIt's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYo, Traxler.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAXLER \n\t\t\t(looking up)\n\t\tHey, Professor Tripp.\n\n\tGRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tDo you get high, Sam?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAXLER\n\t\tOnly when I'm working.\n\n\tGRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.  It \n\tpinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's \n\tfeet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAXLER \n\t\tHoly shit. Are you serious?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tAs a heart attack.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAXLER\n\t\tThanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...\n\n\tGRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy \n\tnow. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on \n\ta window ledge-and as he starts to drop...\n\n\t...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON \n\tcaroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tGrady, what are you doing, you idiot?\n\n\tGRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tLooking for you.\n\n\tHe wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL \n\tGOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...\n\n\tfaintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's \n\tname, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH \n\tupward until we see that she is...\n\n\tKISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.\n\n121\tINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n\tGRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue \n\tplastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the \n\tcurtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips \n\tslowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW \n\tfall outside.\n\n\tThe DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then \n\tthe curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. \n\tHis NAMETAG says GREENHUT.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI passed out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGREENHUT\n\t\tYou did.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI've been doing that a lot lately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGREENHUT\n\t\tSo I hear.

There are only TWO BABIES \n\ton display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple \n\tand crazy with veins.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tAre these the only ones you have?\n\n\tThe nurse's eyes crinkle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd)\n\t\tKidding... \n\n124\tEXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n\tGRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at \n\tthe Gaskell house.\n\n125\tEXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER\n\n\tGRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.  \n\tDark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, \n\tstanding ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting \n\tonto its roof, melting.\n\n126\tEXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S\n\n\tGRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the \n\tglass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he \n\tpulls away, but not before leaving...\n\n\t...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the \n\tfrost of the glass.\n\n127\tEXT. STREET  127\n\n\tThe snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the \n\tstreet. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self \n\ton the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. \n\t..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little \n\tpistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, \n\tthen looks up into the sky.\n\n\tGRADY'S POV - of the SKY... \n\n\t...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters \n\tthe silence.\n\n\tNEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his \n\thand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(as if addressing God) \n\t\tIs that a suggestion?\n\n\tGRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO \n\tSHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen \n\tDS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. \n\n\tGRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts \n\thimself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara \n\tmakes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- \n\tnot without humor. Then she rolls down the window.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI'm so glad to see you, Sara.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI believe you. Did that nice doctor let you \n\t\tout? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI'm through improvising. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tTerry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? \n\t\tDid you lose it all?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI lost it ail.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tOh, Grady. You're such a putz.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tAnd you're old.\n\n\tSara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her \n\tfingers. Yanks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tOuch. How many?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tDozens. It's very sad.\n\n\tSara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes \n\twhen she looks into his, and-she glances away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tI went and looked at-some babies just now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tOh?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(trying to make her laugh)\n\t\tI guess you have to go on faith.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\t\t(she doesn't)\n\t\tSome times...\n\n\tGRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the \n\tHOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tDid you tell Walter?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI told Walter. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tDoes he still love you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tIt didn't come up. \n\n\tGRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious \n\tprofile, then turns her chin gently toward him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tWell I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I \n\t\tdidn't know it at the time, but I'd always been \n\t\twaiting for you. My whole life. Because you're \n\t\twho I need. Because nothing makes sense without \n\t\tyou. Because the best moment of every day is \n\t\tthe moment I first see your face. And because \n\t\twhen you leave a room, there's no reason to be \n\t\tin it any more. It's just a room again.\n\n\tSara cocks her head.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tDid you just make that up?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tIn the hospital. I \"was kind of excited about \n\t\tit at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy \n\t\tpainkillers.\n\n\tShe frowns good-naturedly. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd)\n\t\tEven so...it's still true. Every word.\n\n\tSara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY (cont'd)\n\t\tSara, I promise, even though commonsense might \n\t\ttell you...\n\n\tSara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA \n\t\tDon't write a page when a paragraph will do.\n\n\tGRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGRADY\n\t\tYou don't deserve me, you know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA\n\t\tI know, but sometimes... \n\n\tSara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSARA (cont'd) \n\t\tYou just go on faith.\n\n\tGRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, \n\tdrifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other \n\tside of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, \n\tthe car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft \n\tveil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are \n\tlost too, nothing more than a blur.\n\n\n\tTHE END \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWonder Boys\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Steven Kloves\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:39:02.704535"}
