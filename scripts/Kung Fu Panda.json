As they crash through the Gateway the\n          scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po\n          snatches it away using a noodle lasso.

As Tai Lung chases\n          down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the\n          fireworks-filled sky.\n<b>          \n</b>          Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The\n          scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an\n          ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who\n          sees where the scroll has landed.
