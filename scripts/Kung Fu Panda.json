Shifu looks back at the pieces and a\n          flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu\n          gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.\n          \n                                                                   76.\n          \n          \n          Shifu climbs the column to the rafters.

Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.\n          Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the\n          floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he\n          charges at Shifu.\n          \n                              TAI LUNG\n                    All I ever did, I did to make you\n                    proud! Tell me how proud you are,\n                    Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!\n          \n          THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor\n          and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames\n          extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.\n          \n                              SHIFU\n                        (weakly)\n                    I have always been proud of you.\n                    From the first moment, I've been\n                    proud of you.

He grabs Shifu by the throat.\n          \n                               TAI LUNG\n                    I don't want your apology.

You want it? Come and get\n                    it.\n          \n          Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.\n          \n          From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across\n          the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.\n          \n                               TAI LUNG\n                    Finally!\n          \n          Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,\n          sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and\n          strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to\n          run.\n          \n          Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace\n          steps.\n          \n          Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends\n          him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.\n          \n                                                                    78.\n          \n          \n          Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and\n          smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes\n          right back at Po.\n          \n                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)\n                    That scroll is mine!\n          \n          Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the\n          scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down\n          stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down\n          on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the\n          scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po\n          snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies\n          towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,\n          but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart\n          which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the\n          noodle.\n          \n          Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees\n          and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the\n          street.\n          \n          As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array\n          of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around\n          to hide the scroll.\n          \n                                 PO\n                    Lightning!\n          \n          Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po\n          uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes\n          out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll\n          rolls down the steps towards the river.\n          \n          Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases\n          down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the\n          fireworks-filled sky.\n          \n          Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The\n          scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an\n          ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who\n          sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-\n          vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is\n          shocked.\n          \n                               TAI LUNG\n                    The scroll has given him power.\n                        (then)\n                    NOOO0!!\n          \n          He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting\n          shockwave collapses the building.\n          \n                                                                    79.\n          \n          \n          Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach\n          the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and\n          unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the\n          ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating\n          punch.\n          \n          As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the\n          impact crater.\n          \n                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)\n                          (out of breath)\n                      Finally... oh yes... the power of\n                      the Dragon Scroll... is mine!\n          \n          Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it.

Po gives Tai\n          Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai\n          Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po.
