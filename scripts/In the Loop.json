Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of\n     advisors, smaller but sitting separately.\n\n     Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including\n     uniformed members of all three services.\n\n     Lots of hubbub.\n\n     SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to\n     their seats.\n\n\n\n                                                          Page 18\n\n                        \n18   CON TINUE D:                                                   18\n\n\n     They're as far away from the US delegation as it's\n     possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a\n     pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign\n     Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to\n     Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to\n     say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore\n     important I am'.\n\n                                 SIMON\n                    No-one will hear me if I say anything.\n                    How's your view? Can we swap?\n\n     Simon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see\n     anything.\n\n                                 SIMON (CONT'D)\n                           (to Judy)\n                    Can I swap with you?\n\n                                 JUDY\n                    I think the meeting's starting.\n\n     It is.\n\n                                 SIMON\n                    Well, quickly then, swap.\n\n     Simon and Judy swap seats.\n\n     The meeting is now underway.

Simon still straining to\n     see.\n\n                                 SIMON\n                    Are people thinking that?

A war committee?\n\n                            MICHAEL\n               If I can interject here, I'm aware we're\n               pushed for time. I'd like to move us on\n               agenda-wise. Our next item is\n               international relief co-ordination.\n\n     Karen is conferring with Liza, Adriano with his guy.\n\n                            KAREN\n               Have you heard of this committee?\n\n                            ADRIANO\n               What's this Liza Weld paper?\n                                                       Page 20\n\n                     \n18   CON TINUE D: (3)                                          18\n\n\n     Simon is watching, feeling the meeting is passing him by.\n\n                            SIMON\n                      (to Judy and Toby)\n               Should I say something? She invited me, I\n               should say something. If you don't say\n               something in the first 10 minutes, you\n               can end up not saying anything at all.\n\n                            JUDY\n               I don't know whether you should say\n               anything.\n\n                            SIMON\n               I'm saying something ... I think I'm\n               going to try saying something.\n\n     Simon goes to put his hand up, Toby maybe puts a calming\n     hand on his hand. They look at one another. Has Toby\n     crossed a line?\n                            KAREN\n               Look - I just think it's worth noting\n               that Ministers in The UK Government,\n                      (Liza whispers - Simon's over\n                       there)\n               such as our colleague here ...\n\n                            SIMON\n                      (pleased)\n               Is she talking about me?\n\n                            KAREN\n               Simon Foster ...\n                            SIMON\n               She's talking about me!\n\n                            KAREN\n               Has made it clear that for them currently\n               war is unforeseeable.

Karen is still talking to the meeting.\n     Simon shuts up. He'll have this out later.\n\n\n19   INT.

The United Nations.\n\n                            SIMON\n               It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it?\n\n                            JUDY\n               It could do with a few more scatter\n               cushions and a bit less asbestos.\n\n                            SIR JONATHAN\n               I don't know what you were expecting --\n               Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of\n               stonework tracery... great fountains...\n\n                            MALCOLM\n               It's a shithole. It looks like a hospice\n               for robots.\n\n     They pass a big office.\n\n                            SIR JONATHAN\n               Linton Barwick is in there. Karen Clark\n               is there. You're right here.\n\n     Sir Jonathan shows them to their office.\n                            SIR JONATHAN (CONT'D)\n               If you need anything, just whistle. You\n               know how to whistle don't you Malcolm?\n               You just put your lips together and blow.\n\n     Malcolm and Toby look at one another.\n\n                            SIR JONATHAN (CONT'D)\n               Right. I'm off upstairs to the informal\n               delegates' reception. Hope there's\n               nibbles, I'm ravenous.\n\n     Sir Jonathan leaves.\n\n                            MALCOLM\n               Nibbles? Who still says nibbles?\n\n                            TOBY\n               Fuck the nibbles, what was with the\n               homoerotic tension?\n\n     Malcolm gets a call.\n                                                      Page 94\n\n                         \n97    CON TINUE D:                                                   97\n\n\n                                  MALCOLM\n                     Jamie. Hello?\n\n      He looks at his phone.\n\n                                  MALCOLM (CONT'D)\n                     No fucking signal down here. Jesus.\n                     I'd be better off in an internet cafe in\n                     Kircoddy.\n\n      He leaves the room.\n\n\n98    INT. NUMBER 10 - SAME TIME                                      98\n\n      Jamie is on the phone, running down a corridor.\n\n                                  JAMIE\n                     Okay, your phone's off, which means\n                     you've been shot dead by a fat American,\n                     but there's been a fucktastrophe.\n                     Someone's leaked Liza Weld's Pwip Pip\n                     paper to the BBC. I reckon it'll be on\n                     the Six O'Clock news here, one o'clock\n                     your time, so it's going to fist your\n                     fucking vote apart. Missing you loads,\n                     pwip-pip, toodle-oo!\n\n\n99    EXT. UN BUILDING - DAY                                          99\n\n      Malcolm finishing listening to his voicemail, dialling\n      and running back into the building, pushing past a crowd\n      of smokers at the doorway.\n                                  MALCOLM\n                     Okay Jamie, two jobs. One: find the Pwip\n                     Pip leaker and kill them. That's one job.\n                     Job one has two parts. Job two: stop Pwip\n                     Pip coming out. Sow enough seeds of fear\n                     and doubt that the fat arses at the BBC\n                     dither till after the vote, okay? After\n                     the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take-\n                     off and everything is groovy.   I love\n                     you.\n\n\n100   INT. UN FUNCTION ROOM/BAR - CONTINUOUS                         100\n\n      Lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting. We\n      glimpse Linton, Karen, General Miller. Sir Jonathan is\n      there, mingling.\n\n      Malcolm approaches Simon, Toby, Judy and Sir Jonathan.\n\n\n\n                                                          Page 95\n\n                           \n100   CON TINUE D:                                                  100\n\n\n                                  MALCOLM\n                            (to Sir Jonathan)\n                     Do not move from this spot or I'll\n                     fucking stab you.\n\n                                   SIR JONATHAN\n                     Hm?\n\n                                  MALCOLM\n                            (to Simon)\n                     Was it you?\n\n                                  SIMON\n                     No, what? No.\n\n                                  MALCOLM\n                     But you know what I'm talking about?\n\n                                  SIMON\n                     No, but whatever it was I didn't do it.\n                                  MALCOLM\n                            (to Toby)\n                     Was it you, The-Baby-From-Eraserhead?\n\n                                   TOBY\n                     No.\n\n                                  MALCOLM\n                            (to Judy)\n                     So it must have been you Woman from The\n                     Crying Game?\n\n                                  JUDY\n                     It wasn't me. You've really got it in for\n                     me haven't you?\n\n                                  MALCOLM\n                     Someone's dropped a bollock in the\n                     noodles and I reckon it was you.\n\n                                  JUDY\n                     We've done this all before. You accused\n                     me of leaking last time and it wasn't me.\n\n                                  MALCOLM\n                     Yeah well I know you didn't leak last\n                     time. But what I reckon is you got so\n                     pissy about being accused, you leaked\n                     this time.\n\n                                  TOBY\n                     Yeah. Yeah, that does sound possible.\n\n                                  JUDY\n                     Look Springer Spaniel, keep your little\n                     wet nose out alright?\n                                                             Page 96\n\n                      \n100   CON TINUE D: (2)                                         100\n\n\n                             TOBY\n                I'm just saying psychologically speaking\n                that sounds plausible - that you might\n                build up a resentment and then pay it off\n                in some underhand way. That's just\n                something I've observed.\n\n      Malcolm's had enough goes over and grabs Sir Jonathan,\n      mid-conversation, and manhandles him away.\n\n                             MALCOLM\n                Come on, Baldermort, I need a word.\n\n      Meanwhile Judy and Toby are left alone - Toby embarrassed\n      about his comments.\n\n                             TOBY\n                       (they look at each other)\n                Sorry about that - it's just ...\n                       (mumbles)\n                something I've observed.\n\n                             JUDY\n                Wanker. It's okay. It's fine. It's\n                probably just the stress of this awful,\n                awful war.\n\n      Malcolm drags the ambassador into a corner.\n\n                             MALCOLM\n                We're in a new reality now and You've got\n                to speed things up.\n\n                             SIR JONATHAN\n                What things? Speed up what?\n                             MALCOLM\n                The debate. It needs to start at eleven\n                o'clock, not one thirty.\n\n                             SIR JONATHAN\n                Hehe. Can I perhaps briefly explain the\n                way the process works? And why that isn't\n                possible? You see through that door there\n                are a number of secretariats that are\n                currently doing what we call the washing\n                up now...\n\n                             MALCOLM\n                Just fucking do it, fishlips. Otherwise\n                you'll find yourself in some medieval\n                warzone in the Caucasus with your arse in\n                the air, trying to persuade a group of\n                men in balaclavas that sustained sexual\n                violence is not the way forward.\n\n\n                                                       Page 97\n\n                      \n100   CON TINUE D: (3)                                         100\n\n\n                             SIR JONATHAN\n                No, it can't be. I mean it could be done,\n                it just can't.\n\n                             MALCOLM\n                Then I'll do it.\n                       (motioning to a door)\n                They're through there?\n\n                             SIR JONATHAN\n                Yes but you can't go in, that would be a\n                serious breach of protocol ...\n\n      He's blocking Malcolm. Malcolm grabs his hand.\n\n                             MALCOLM\n                Then you do it. Get in there.\n\n      He is almost man-handling him in.\n                             SIR JONATHAN\n                I'm not dancing with you Malcolm.\n\n                             MALCOLM\n                I'm leading, look follow my lead.\n\n                             SIR JONATHAN\n                You're not dancing me into the\n                secretariat!\n\n      Jonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to\n      go in.\n\n      As Malcolm is leaving Miller blocks his path.\n                             MALCOLM\n                Where's the intel? Are you sure you're\n                working as hard as me? Cos I'm sweating\n                spinal fluid here.
