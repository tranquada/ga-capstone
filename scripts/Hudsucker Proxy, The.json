The person swivels around \n               and away -- his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville \n               looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs \n               merrily.\n\n               As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto \n               his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK \n               REVEALS that he is in a barber chair.\n\n               His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair \n               is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning --\n\n               -- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again.\n\n               Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a \n               slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade.\n\n               FREEZE ON Norville's laughing face.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               PULL BACK to reveal it is another front page photo next to \n               the headline: Hud Board To Street: GIVE MAN FROM MUNCIE A \n               CHANCE. Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas.\n\n               CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a \n               chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to \n               cover it.\n\n               PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a \n               tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes \n               his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts, \n               hose stockings and garters.\n\n               The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and \n               spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape.\n\n               Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.\n\n               BOARD MEMBER\n\n               laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching \n               between his hands. He joyously tosses away the tickertape.\n\n               FLOOR\n\n               where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged \n               tape.\n\n               PAN UP to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its \n               disastrous tale of good news for the board.\n\n               PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's \n               office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk, \n               Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper.\n\n               TRACK IN TOWARDS him.\n\n               On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his \n               window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles \n               by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails.\n\n               As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN \n               shows its front page headline: HUD STOCK DIPS. Subhead: Just \n               Good Is He?\n\n               TRACK IN ON the front page photo: Norville laughing, his \n               chin propped in his hand.\n\n               PHOTOGRAPH\n\n               COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing.\n\n               We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak \n               desk, newly coifed and tailored.\n\n               The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE \n               OF THE PRESIDENT.\n\n               TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office, leaving \n               Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT.\n\n               His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office.\n\n               Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him \n               exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several \n               days. He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY\n\n               In the skyline we can see the Hudsucker building topped by \n               the Hudsucker clock.\n\n               A cigar ENTERS FRAME in the f.g., then the face of the man \n               smoking it. Staring contemplatively at the Hudsucker building, \n               he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his \n               mouth and waves it, as if painting a headline.\n\n                                     EDITOR\n                         'The Einstein of Enterprise.'

The Waitress is \n               FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING \n               gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she \n               holds.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                              (bored, nasal voice)\n                         Can I get you boys anything else?\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond \n               her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face.

NORVILLE'S OFFICE\n\n               Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just \n               finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President.\n\n               The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow \n               approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he \n               is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, \n               cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the \n               doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against \n               the door and get the knob with his other hand.\n\n               The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is \n               wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode.\n\n               He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the \n               lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, \n               in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN \n               tnediserP.\n\n               Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:\n\n                                     AMY\n                         I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. \n                         It was just that horrible little \n                         elevator boy...\n\n                                     NORVILLE\n                         Not at all.

He straightens up and looks \n               at her.\n\n               NORVILLE'S POV\n\n               She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES \n               as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs.\n\n               We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside \n               his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as \n               if coming from a long way away.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n                                     NORVILLE\n                         Just a minute.\n\n               He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his \n               head between his knees, still fighting for breath.\n\n                                     AMY\n                         I don't know what came over me.

ROOM\n\n               It is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral \n               staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the \n               gloom above. It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs, \n               gears. There is no window, but on what would be the window \n               wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping \n               an interior circle.

I'm \n                         earning my keep.\n\n                                     REPORTER #5\n                         Speaking of that, Mr. Barnes, do you \n                         expect to get a raise?\n\n                                     NORVILLE\n                         Well, by anyone's account I've saved \n                         Hudsucker Industries; our stock is \n                         worth more than it's ever been. So, \n                         yes, I expect to be compensated for \n                         that.\n\n                                                           END TRACK IN ON:\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               The mean laugh. FURTHER TRACK IN ON Norville ENDS in CLOSE \n               SHOT, his hands clasped on the desktop in front of him, as \n               he finishes his hard, square-jawed, man-on-top laugh, gazing \n               flintily INTO the CAMERA.\n\n                                     NORVILLE\n                         -- ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\n                                                            PULL BACK FROM:\n\n               WEEPING EXECUTIVE\n\n               The PULL BACK FROM a blubbering executive REVEALS that we \n               are at a Board meeting. All of the Board members sit around \n               the table except for Mussburger, who, a towel around his \n               waist, is receiving a choppity-chop massage on a padded table \n               from a muscular man in a bulging T-shirt.\n\n                                     MUSSBURGER\n                         Pull yourself together, Addison.\n\n               Addison snuffles.\n\n                                     ADDISON\n                         Nobody told me!

Well, this too shall pass. \n                         Myrtle J. Mussburger didn't raise \n                         her boy to go knockkneed at the first \n                         sign of adversity. I say, we made \n                         this kid and we can break him. I \n                         say, the higher he climbs, the harder \n                         he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a \n                         future, and in it I see shame, \n                         dishonor, ignominy and disgrace.\n\n               Sure, sure, the wheel turns, the music plays, and our spin \n               ain't over yet.\n\n               NORVILLE'S OFFICE\n\n               A small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing \n               \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in \n               his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of \n               him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his \n               temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs.\n\n               A French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee \n               squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a \n               stone chisel and hammer.\n\n               A GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, \n               reading the funny papers.\n\n               At length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, \n               batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager.\n\n                                     NORVILLE\n                         Hold it!...\n\n               The musicians' playing dribbles away to silence.\n\n                                     NORVILLE\n                         ...Nobody move, nobody breathe...\n\n               All sit frozen.

She stands on a podium accepting an \n               award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets. \n               The caption says, \"Amy Archer of the Manhattan Argus Receives \n               Pulitzer Prize.\"\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               We are in Mussburger's office.

You \n                         will be thinking, Why now, when things \n                         are going so well?

These things \n                         have long since ceased to give me \n                         pleasure.
