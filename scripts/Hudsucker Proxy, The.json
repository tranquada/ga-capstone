He is apparently carrying the girl, \n               cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the \n               doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against \n               the door and get the knob with his other hand.\n\n               The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is \n               wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode.\n\n               He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the \n               lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, \n               in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN \n               tnediserP.\n\n               Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:\n\n<b>                                     AMY\n</b>                         I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. \n                         It was just that horrible little \n                         elevator boy...\n\n<b>                                     NORVILLE\n</b>                         Not at all.
