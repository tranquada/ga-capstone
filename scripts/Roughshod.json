DESERT - DAWN\n\n               FULL SHOT. The sun, spinning up from behind the dark rim of \n               eastern hills, is bleaching the cloudless, morning sky. This \n               is volcanic country, barren, desolate, forbidding. There is \n               no sign of life, no sound. Then on a distant hill, a man \n               appears, to be followed by two others. They walk steadily \n               forward.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. NARROW CANYON - DAWN\n\n               MED. SHOT. A dry watercourse threads its way through the cut \n               in the treeless hills. The sun is not high enough as yet to \n               drive night from the canyon. A man appears around a bend; \n               another and still another. They are McCall, Peters and Lednov, \n               clad in prison clothes, hatless, their heads closely cropped. \n               As Lednov's face comes into a closeup,\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. HILL - DAWN\n\n               LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. A narrow valley lies below. Through \n               it runs a cottonwood-bordered stream. Smoke curls up out of \n               the trees. Horses graze in a small meadow near the creek. \n               From O.O. comes the SOUND of heavy boots crunching across \n               the dry, eroded earth. The three men file past camera to \n               stop in the immediate F.g. and look down into the valley. \n               They exchange glances and start down.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN\n\n               MED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows. A bearded man, Cal \n               Forster, and two young fellows in their late teens squat \n               beside a campfire eating breakfast. O.s. there is the SOUND \n               of movement. Lednov moves cautiously into the scene. He has \n               a revolver in his hand.\n\n               Forster turns toward camera and fear comes into his \n               expression. Lednov fires. Forster crumples near the fire. \n               The two boys jump to their feet and reach for rifles. Lednov \n               fires again and again. McCall and Peters come into the scene, \n               both firing revolvers.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAWN\n\n               MED SHOT - ANGLED ACROSS campfire. On the fire smoulders the \n               prison clothes the convicts had worn. Smoke spirals up. In \n               the B.B. Lednov, Peters and McCall, now wearing the clothes \n               of the three Forsters, saddle the horses. CAMERA PANS AROUND \n               and ANGLES DOWN. The bodies of Forster and his sons, now \n               clad in underwear are sprawled by the fire. Forster's arm \n               lies close to the smouldering clothing.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. CREEK - DAWN\n\n               MED. LONG SHOT. Smoke climbs above the trees. Into the \n               clearing ride the three convicts, to cross it and move \n               westward. They disappear over the hill. A dust cloud marks \n               their passage. CAMERA HOLDS ON the scene and over the shot \n               comes the MAIN TITLE CARD:\n\n                                        ROUGHSHOD\n\n               EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\n               LONG SHOT. A buckboard drawn by two horses comes along the \n               road. Graham, a middle-aged rancher, is driving. As the horses \n               trot forward and dust rises above the road, the NEXT TITLE \n               CARD is shown.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. CREEK - DAY\n\n               LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Graham's buckboard moves down the \n               road toward the clearing, as the TITLE CARDS follow and \n               change. When the buckboard reaches the creek, the LAST TITLE \n               CARD is ended.\n\n               EXT. MEADOW - DAY\n\n               MED. SHOT. Graham drives the horses through the creek and \n               into the meadow. Through the trees the Forster camp can be \n               seen. Graham glances over, then suddenly pulls on the reins. \n               As the horses stop, he twists the reins around the whip stock, \n               grabs his rifle from under the seat, leaps out and hurries \n               forward toward the camp.\n\n               EXT. FORSTER CAMP - DAY\n\n               MED. SHOT. Graham hurries through the trees to stop in horror \n               near the dead men. Then very slowly he moves forward to the \n               smouldering fire. Stooping he lifts Forster's arm away from \n               the fire, then picks up one of the prison coats and looks at \n               it.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\n               MED. LONG SHOT. The surrounding hills are covered with scrub \n               pinon pine and mesquite. Graham's buckboard, moving slowly \n               up a hill, passes camera, which PANS WITH it. In the bed, \n               covered by a tarp, are the three bodies. The narrow, one-way \n               road climbs easily up the gentle hill. Beyond, a dust cloud \n               rises. As Graham's buckboard nears the crest, a surrey appears \n               and starts down. Graham pulls his team into the bank, trying \n               to make room for the surrey.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               There are four women in the two-seated surrey, which is \n               heavily loaded with trunks, hatboxes, etc. Mary Wells, the \n               loveliest of the four, is driving. She is more poised, more \n               self-assured than the others. Her clothes, though a trifle \n               showy, are attractive. She wears a large spectacular hat. \n               Helen Carter, showier, harder and more cynical, sits beside \n               her. In the seat behind are Marcia Paine, placid, younger \n               looking than her years, and Elaine Ross, a striking blonde \n               with a pale haunted face. Elaine is obviously ill. Mary is \n               riding the brake and holding the team back.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               SHOOTING PAST Graham.\n\n                                     GRAHAM\n                              (annoyed)\n                         What in thunderation --\n                              (calling)\n                         Wait a minute -- stop --\n\n               He jerks on the reins and tries to make room for the surrey. \n               A steep bank is on camera left. On camera right, the road \n               drops off into a gulley. As the surrey comes up Mary reins \n               the team in. The women all look frightened. Graham, trying \n               to force his team to pull the vehicle up the bank, is too \n               occupied to recognize the women at once. Having made just \n               enough room for the surrey, he turns and looks at the women.\n\n                                     GRAHAM\n                         All right --\n                              (then surprised)\n                         What are you girls doin' way out \n                         here?\n\n               Mary looks ahead at the narrow road and the canyon to her \n               left.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Until you came along we were going \n                         to Sonora.\n\n                                     GRAHAM\n                         What do you know about that.

CLOSE ON SURREY\n\n               Graham reaches the surrey.\n\n                                     GRAHAM\n                              (cheerfully)\n                         Slide over.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                              (getting up)\n                         I'm slidin' all the way over.\n\n               She climbs out.

Mary has moved over and Graham \n               picks up the reins. Marcia gives up and jumps out.\n\n                                     GRAHAM\n                         Nothin' to it --\n\n               He releases the brake.\n\n                                     GRAHAM\n                         -- once you know how.

No disrespect meant, Miss \n                         Wells.\n\n               Mary isn't listening. She is looking at the road. Elaine \n               closes her eyes. Helen and Marcia scurry back out of the \n               way.\n\n                                     GRAHAM\n                         Get up.\n\n               Adroitly he drives the surrey past.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               featuring buckboard. Helen and Marcia start along the road \n               past the buckboard. Helen stops and looks at its cargo in \n               horror. She grabs Marcia's arm. The girls look at each other \n               and hurry after the surrey which has stopped below the \n               buckboard.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               on surrey.

Graham looks after it, then \n               turns to go back to the buckboard, CAMERA PANNING WITH him.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. ASPEN - DAY - (MATTE SHOT)\n\n               The town lies in a lush green valley. It is surrounded by \n               meadowland and shaded by cottonwoods, alders and aspen. In \n               the F.g. Graham's buckboard moves fast down hill.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE OUT\n\n               EXT. ASPEN STREET - DAY DISSOLVE IN\n\n               FULL SHOT. In the F.g. a smallish crowd, mostly men and \n               children idle in the street in front of Mary Wells' Gambling \n               and Dance Hall. The wooden sidewalk is cluttered with those \n               articles belonging to the women that were too bulky to get \n               into the surrey. Several women stand on the porch supervising \n               the locking up of the place and the removal of the sign of \n               Mary Wells' name on it. Graham's buckboard rounds a corner \n               at a fast trot. He slows the team to let the people get out \n               of the way.\n\n               MED. SHOT ON BUCKBOARD\n\n               The team has slowed to a walk. The people give their attention \n               to the buckboard. A boy clambers up over the tailboard, sees \n               the cargo and jumps off with a frightened yell. The crowd \n               turns from the dance hall and follows the buckboard leaving \n               the women and their pious male assistants on the porch.\n\n               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               MED. FULL SHOT - ANGLED to include blacksmith shop across \n               the street. Far down the street comes Graham's buckboard \n               followed by the small crowd. The sheriff's office is a one-\n               story wooden structure. Next to it is the general store. In \n               front of the blacksmith shop stands a wagon with one wheel \n               off. In the corral alongside are eleven blooded mares. Clay \n               Phillips, his brother Steve and the blacksmith are inside \n               the shop. Clay's saddle horse is tethered to the hitching \n               rail beside two harnessed work horses.\n\n               INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY\n\n               ANGLED to include sheriff's office. The blacksmith, Sam Ellis, \n               an elderly bent man in a leather apron stands at the forge \n               in which he is heating the rim from the big wheel which lies \n               on the table nearby. Clay, a long-legged wrangler in clean \n               but faded work clothes stands near the forge pumping the \n               bellows and watching his brother, a freckled kid of sixteen \n               trying to roll a cigarette. Steve has progressed to the most \n               difficult step, that of licking and sealing the paper. Clay \n               reaches over and takes it from him. He puts the skinny \n               cylinder in his mouth and Steve lights it for him. The first \n               third of the cigarette burns with one quick flare.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         How does she draw?\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         A little hot.\n\n               Sam lifts the rim to the wheel.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         You want to get out of here before \n                         noon, maybe you should lend me a \n                         hand.\n\n               Clay, the cigarette dangling from his lips, moves over to \n               the table, picks up a hammer and helps Sam hammer the rim on \n               the wheel. Steve stands watching.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         Rate you're goin', we'll be here \n                         until winter.\n\n               Together they lift the wheel and plunge it into the tub of \n               water. Steam rises to fill the blackened shed.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (amiably grumbling)\n                         Account of you, I miss out on the \n                         only excitement Aspen's had for \n                         months.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         You're too old to watch such goin's \n                         on.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         And I'm too young.\n\n               Clay and Sam spin the wheel in the tub.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         That's right.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         I don't see no sense to makin' people \n                         leave town if they don't want to \n                         leave.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I don't either -- when people are \n                         that good-lookin'.

Steve helps him hoist the trunk into the wagon bed. \n               Steve gets back in the seat. Just as Clay is about to mount, \n               he stops and picks up a small folding daguerrotype case \n               delicately ornamented. He lifts his eyebrow, tucks the case \n               into his pocket, then mounts and starts ahead around the \n               bend.\n\n               MED. LONG SHOT\n\n               Clay's ANGLE. Ahead, off the road in the wash is the surrey \n               that passed Graham's buckboard at the fork. Clay spurs his \n               horse forward.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               on surrey. The back wheel is broken and the bed of the surrey \n               rests on the ground. The horses have been taken from the \n               traces and stand dejectedly in the hot sun. A blanket is \n               spread in the scant shade thrown by the surrey. On it lies \n               Elaine and, sitting beside her, is Marcia. A damp cloth is \n               spread across Elaine's forehead. A water bag hangs from the \n               surrey. Elaine's head is pillowed on a dainty satin cushion. \n               Helen and Mary have risen at Clay's approach and now stand \n               by the road.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Clay gallops forward to pull up near the surrey. In the b.g. \n               Steve drives the wagon around the bend. Clay dismounts.\n\n               MED.

Steve pulls the wagon to a \n               stop, jumps off, and comes running over.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Jimininy.

Clay gives her the makings. Mary \n               speaks as she casually rolls a cigarette.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         There's only four of us.\n\n               Clay motions to the remuda that grazes in the b.g.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         I've got eleven horses.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (proudly)\n                         Morgan blood.

Elaine, her eyes wide and \n               frightened, starts back as Mary takes the case from Clay and \n               opens it.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Who's the old folks?\n\n                                     ELAINE\n                              (frantic)\n                         Give it to me!\n\n               She jerks the case from Mary's hands, snaps it shut, and \n               stands staring at Mary with a strange mixture of fright, \n               anger and hysteria. Mary glances around as if to say what-\n               did-I-do? To cover the embarrassed silence, Clay kicks the \n               unbroken back wheel. The spokes rattle.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         This must have been in the family a \n                         long time.\n\n               Elaine glances at him as though he had insulted her, turns \n               and starts toward the blanket again.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (dryly)\n                         It was a gift from the citizens of \n                         Aspen.

Mareia moves to her as she slides back down on \n               the blanket, clutching the case.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         And this is Helen Carter.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         I'm Clay Phillips.\n                              (motioning)\n                         My brother Steve.\n\n               Steve tugs at his battered hat.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (shy)\n                         Pleased to meet you, ma'am.\n                              (brightly)\n                         We found your trunk.

DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\n               FULL SHOT. Dust rises over the road as the cavalcade moves \n               forward. Clay, rifle across his lap, rides in front. The \n               wagon, with Mary driving and Helen beside her on the seat, \n               follows. The two horses that pulled the surrey are tied to \n               the tail gate. Then comes the remuda with Steve bringing up \n               the rear.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Marcia and Elaine. PROCESS. Marcia sits in the bed of the \n               wagon looking back. Elaine lies under the seat.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Steve. Steve proudly carries his new rifle across his lap. \n               He whistles happily as he scans the desert country hopefully \n               for the enemy.\n\n               EXT. CAMP SITE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               FULL SHOT. Long shadows of the hills lie on the grassy meadow \n               along the stream that is bordered by cottonwoods and willows. \n               A knoll overlooks the camp site. The caravan can be seen as \n               it halts in the lush grass a few yards from the stream. The \n               girls sit lifelessly on the wagon; they seem too tired to \n               dismount. Then, finally, Marcia helps Elaine to climb stiffly \n               down. With the exception of Mary they all let themselves \n               down in the grass. Mary walks to the head of the team and \n               starts fumbling with the harness. Steve comes into the scene, \n               dismounts quickly and pulls the saddle off his horse. The \n               remuda has fanned out, the horses moving toward the water. \n               Steve crosses to Mary and takes over the job of unbuckling \n               the harness. Mary smiles gratefully and rubs her hand across \n               her face.\n\n                                     CLAY'S VOICE\n                         Steve, see the horses don't drink \n                         too much --\n\n               Steve straightens, looks towards the horses and moves off. \n               He speaks to Mary over his shoulder.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Leave that unharnessing for me, Ma'am.\n\n               Mary smiles after him, then moves across the grass, CAMERA \n               DOLLYING AHEAD of her. She sinks to her knees in the patch \n               of sand by the stream and leans down and puts her face under \n               the water. Then, sitting up, she wipes the water and dust \n               from her face with a handkerchief. Clay rides up from behind, \n               dismounts, scoops up some water from the river in the brim \n               of his hat and drinks it. For a second he watches Mary.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         There's a place down a ways, where \n                         you and the girls can wash some of \n                         that dust off.\n\n               Mary's manner is business-like. She and the girls are along \n               for the ride. She wants no favors -- wants to do her part.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Thanks.

Mary rises.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Marcia -- all of you. Come on.\n\n               She starts downstream.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               ANGLED PAST wagon. Clay tosses the saddle into the wagon \n               bed, slaps his mare on the rump. She trots off. Climbing up \n               on the wheel, he gets the grub box under the seat and lifts \n               it down. Steve comes from out of scene and starts unharnessing \n               the team.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (trying to be casual)\n                         Where'd they go?\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         Swimming.\n\n               Clay comes past him, carrying the grub box. He puts it down \n               near where some stones make a crude firebox.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         It's sort of nice having company \n                         along.

Steve stands by the stream, \n               letting the team drink. O.s. the women can be heard laughing \n               and splashing. Steve gives all his attention to what is going \n               on downstream. Clay puts wood on the fire, opens the grub \n               box. He sees Steve, takes the coffee pot out of the box and \n               heads for the stream.\n\n               MED. LONG SHOT\n\n               ANGLED PAST Steve downstream. Behind the willows the girls \n               are bathing. However they are too far away to be seen clearly \n               and the willows make a fairly effective screen. Clay walks \n               upstream and fills the coffee pot, then comes back to stand \n               for a moment beside Steve. Steve, who hadn't seen Clay until \n               now, suddenly gets very busy giving all his attention to the \n               mules.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (to mules)\n                         You boys have had enough.\n\n               He jerks them from the water and leads them away. Clay frowns \n               after him, then goes back to the wagon.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               on wagon and fire. As Clay passes the wagon, he reaches into \n               the bed and gets a couple of strips of scrap iron. These he \n               carries to the fire. He puts the iron strips across the blaze, \n               sets the coffee pot on, feeds the fire with some more wood, \n               then going back to the wagon, he takes his rifle out, throws \n               a shell into the chamber and starts off up the knoll.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. KNOLL - NIGHT\n\n               MED. SHOT. It is a moonlight night. Clay squats on his heels, \n               smoking. The rifle lies across his knees. Below can be seen \n               the campfire, and the shadowy forms of the girls as with \n               Steve's help they make up a bed under the wagon and cook the \n               evening meal. Clay suddenly reacts as O.s. a horse whinnies. \n               Standing he looks off into the darkness.\n\n               LONG SHOT\n\n               ANGLED PAST Clay. In the moonlight the trail stretches back \n               over rolling hills. Faintly can be heard the SOUND of \n               hoofbeats. Below, where the remuda grazes, a horse whinnies \n               again. Clay moves down toward the camp.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               the camp. As Clay approaches. Steve squats by the fire. He \n               has spread out a tarp in the circle of firelight and Mary is \n               setting the tin plates, cups, etc., out. Elaine, a blanket \n               around her, sits near the fire. She looks tired and ill. \n               Marcia and Helen are struggling with bed-making under the \n               wagon.\n\n                                     HELEN'S VOICE\n                         And I'm the girl who used to complain \n                         to my mother about helping with the \n                         wash.\n\n               Steve and Mary look up as Clay strides up. Clay starts kicking \n               dirt over the fire.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         Get your rifle.\n\n               Steve jumps up and hurries to the wagon.

The horseman, who has been \n               approaching from the east, tops a rise and looks off at the \n               camp. He is a shadowy figure in the palo dark. For a moment, \n               as the fire still blazes, figures are visible in the camp. \n               Then the fire goes out. The horseman dismounts, pulling his \n               rifle from his scabbard. Moving to his horse's head he puts \n               a hand on the animal's nostrils. He looks toward the camp \n               for a moment then starts cautiously along the road.\n\n               EXT. ROAD - NIGHT - (MOONLIGHT)\n\n               MED. SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH willows PAST Clay and Steve. The \n               brothers have taken up a post overlooking the road. The \n               horseman walks cautiously toward them. He stops, listening. \n               Then he drops his reins and comes forward stealthily. The \n               horse stands.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Clay and Steve.

The man, now seen clearly for the first time, stops. \n               He is Jim Clayton, a man in his twenties, chunky, round-faced, \n               stolid and not too imaginative. He wears the well-worn jeans \n               and blue shirt of the farmer. Clay and Steve come out of the \n               willows toward him.

WYATT RANCH - DAY\n\n               LONG SHOT - ANGLED THROUGH gate in barbed wire fence. The \n               ranch is nestled in a valley at the base of the Sierras. \n               Green meadowland surrounds the farm buildings which consist \n               of a cabin, barn and sheds, all in good repair and white-\n               washed, as are the corral fences and the picket fence around \n               the house, which stands in a clump of trees. The wind has \n               pushed the clouds back over the hills, but far off there is \n               still thunder. The gate in front f.g. is of barbed wire. It \n               is closed. On the fence post a board is tacked. Neatly \n               lettered on the board is the name:\n\n                                         ED WYATT\n\n               From o.s. comes the SOUND of horses moving restlessly and \n               the creaking of saddle leather, as a man swings out of the \n               saddle. Footsteps approach. A man's head and shoulders, back \n               to camera, comes into scene. He unloops the strand of bailing \n               wire and lets the gate fall open, then turns and we see his \n               face. He is Lednov. His cheek and jowls have a dark growth \n               of beard. He wears a black leather jacket and a wrangler's \n               grey hat. The clothes Forster was wearing. As he moves back \n               to his horse, CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS AROUND.\n\n               His companions, McCall and Peters, also wear black leather \n               jackets, sombre, dusty pants and hats. They are mounted on \n               matched roans. The horses are winded, lathered and dirty. It \n               is obvious they have ridden hard. Lednov strides forward and \n               as he reaches for the reins the horse shies away. Brutally \n               he jerks on the reins. The horse rears. He snatches his hat \n               from his head and whacks the horse across the nose. McCall \n               rides over and grabs the reins.

Clay's cavalcade moves forward along the trail. \n               There are cloud patches overhead and faintly in the back \n               country thunder rumbles. The mules pull the jolting wagons \n               forward in a slow trot. Clay rides ahead. Steve and the remuda \n               follow.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. WYATT RANCH - DAY\n\n               FULL SHOT.

Lednov, with a jerk of his thumb, indicates that \n               McCall is to go with him. McCall follows.

She has taken off her \n               apron and holds it in her hand. She smiles at the two men.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               ANGLED PAST Mrs. Wyatt.

She looks \n               from one to the other. Lednov pushes past her up the steps \n               and into the house. Mrs. Wyatt follows him with her glance. \n               McCall motions.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         We're in a hurry.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT.

This is the main room of the house -- a \n               living room and kitchen combined: wood-stove against one \n               wall, a sink with a pump against another, a fireplace, some \n               simple furniture and, hanging from one of the rough walls, a \n               concertina. Through an open doorway can be seen the Wyatt's \n               bedroom. Another door, closed, leads into the second bedroom. \n               The house has a warm, well-scrubbed look. Wyatt enters.\n\n               Mrs. Wyatt, stoking the stove, turns. She glances nervously \n               in the direction of the bedroom. Wyatt shifts his glance to \n               the fireplace -- there is no gun hanging from the hooks above \n               the mantel. Lednov appears in the doorway of the bedroom.\n\n                                     WYATT\n                         What are you doin' --\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         Lookin' around.\n\n               He crosses to the fireplace.

He starts \n               angrily across the room.\n\n                                     WYATT\n                         Put my guns down and get out of here --\n\n                                     MRS.

Lednov gives him a swipe with \n               the back of his hand, knocking him away easily.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         Your old woman's got sense -- you \n                         listen to her.\n\n               Mrs. Wyatt helps Ed to his feet. She puts an arm around him.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         I asked you -- these all the shells \n                         you got?\n\n                                     MRS.

Finding the box \n               of shells, he slips it in his pocket.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                              (to Ed)\n                         Get on about your chores.\n                              (to Mrs. Wyatt)\n                         And hurry that grub up.\n\n               Wyatt and his wife look at each other.

KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               Wyatt goes to the stove and starts stoking the fire. Mrs. \n               Wyatt takes the lamp from the wall bracket and goes into the \n               bedroom.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               FULL SHOT. It is a pleasant room with a large, handmade, \n               double bed, white flour sack curtains at wide windows. Mrs. \n               Wyatt puts the lamp on the dresser. Going to the bed she \n               pulls back the covers, feels the sheets.\n\n                                     MRS.

Beside the \n               dresser is a camel-back trunk. She starts to open a dresser \n               drawer, pauses and looks down at the trunk. Moving to the \n               trunk, she hesitates. Then making up her mind, she bends \n               down and throws open the trunk.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               DOWN ANGLE. A girl's clothing is neatly packed in the trunk. \n               A framed picture is face down on top of the clothing. Mrs. \n               Wyatt kneels by the trunk, pushes the dresses aside and finds \n               a nightgown. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as she rises and shakes it \n               out. It is frilly, dainty, very feminino; obviously the \n               nightdress of a young girl. She closes the trunk, turns and \n               as she goes to the bed, Wyatt comes through the door carrying \n               the towel-wrapped stove lid. She lays the nightgown on the \n               bed, takes the stove lid and puts it between the sheets. \n               Wyatt is staring down at the garment.\n\n                                     WYATT\n                              (cold)\n                         Put it back.\n\n               They face each other.

They recognize the girl. Wyatt's \n               expression hardens. Clay, carrying Elaine, pushes between \n               them into the bedroom.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               MED. SHOT. Clay carries the girl to the bed and gently puts \n               her down. Her eyes are closed. Slowly the Wyatts enter the \n               room to stand close together staring at the girl on the bed. \n               Clay suddenly realizes that something is wrong. He glances \n               up. Elaine opens her eyes and looks up at her mother and \n               father.\n\n                                     MRS.

Clay closes the door. Wyatt, dazed by the shock of seeing \n               his daughter again, stands momentarily staring at the closed \n               door. Then very slowly he turns and looks at Helen and Mary.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               his ANGLE.

He stands in front \n               of the door, staring at it. Then his hand moves to the knob. \n               Slowly he turns the knob and opens the door. The two girls \n               watch him as he hesitates on the threshold. Then he enters \n               and closes the door softly.

KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               Clay turns from the stove to the cupboard over the sink and \n               takes down a coffee cup. The door into Elaine's bedroom is \n               closed. The door into Mary's bedroom opens and Mary enters \n               the kitchen.

ELAINE'S BEDROOM\n\n               MED. SHOT. Elaine is sitting up in bed. There is a small \n               table by the bed and on it is a breakfast tray. Mrs. Wyatt \n               sits by the bed. Elaine looks happy for the first time. Mrs. \n               Wyatt is holding a cup to her lips.

To the West can be seen the bald \n               red granite domes of the higher range. O.s. there is the \n               SOUND of the cavalcade approaching. CAMERA PANS AROUND and \n               ANGLES PAST. Toward camera, comes the cavalcade, climbing \n               slowly. Far in the distance and down can be seen the waste \n               of desert and the barren hills of Nevada. Clay, a rifle across \n               his legs, is riding on one side of the wagon. Steve rides \n               beside Mary, who is driving. The remuda trails behind. Helen, \n               lying in the wagon bed, cannot be seen.\n\n               MED.

FOREST TRAIL\n\n               Here the forest has thinned out. The trail climbs a rise, \n               then drops down. Clay jogs along the trail, his rifle across \n               his knees. As he reaches the edge of the forest at the crest \n               of the rise, he suddenly pulls his horse to a stop, swings \n               around and rides back into the trees. Throwing the reins \n               over the horse's head, he swings out of the saddle and moves \n               cautiously to the crest of the hill.\n\n               LONG SHOT\n\n               Clay's ANGLE.

There \n               is some light outlining the high mountains -- treeless crags \n               and domes and spires.

She is \n               aware of his presence, but she doesn't show it. In the soft \n               light of dusk she is very lovely. Clay is conscious of her \n               lovliness. He would like to drop down beside her.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Mary. She turns her face to look at him.

The trail curves around a cliff.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               Clay. He rides around the bend in the trail. He hears \n               something. He reins the horse in. Some pebbles rattle down \n               the cliff. He looks up.\n\n               FROM CLAY'S ANGLE\n\n               The muzzle of a rifle is visible.

In the pine forest \n               at the edge of the meadow is Fowler's camp. The cavalcade is \n               driving up to the camp. There are two horses tethered in the \n               meadow.\n\n               EXT. FOWLER'S CAMP\n\n               MED. FULL SHOT. A tarp is stretched over the camp. There is \n               a crude stone fireplace, a rough table and two benches. \n               Shelves are nailed between the trees. In a small lean-to \n               there is a bunk with Fowler's bedroll on it. Fowler stands \n               watching Mary and Holen as they get out of the wagon. The \n               horses sproad out across the meadow. Steve and Clay dismount. \n               Both unsaddle. Helen, Mary and Fowler exchange glances. Then \n               the two women walk toward the camp, which is behind a screen \n               of trees.\n\n               MED.

Mary looks after her, \n               shrugs and going to the fireplace, takes moss and twigs from \n               the pile and puts them in. Clay, carrying saddle bags and \n               canteens, enters.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Got a light?\n\n               He puts them down, goes over to the fireplace and kneels to \n               light the moss. Mary has stepped back.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - LOW\n\n               As he lights the fire, the lower portion of Mary's body comes \n               into the shot. Clay becomes aware of her closeness. He rises \n               slowly. CAMERA ANGLES UP. Mary is standing facing him, almost \n               touching him. They stare at each other without speaking. \n               Both suddenly move togother. They kiss. There is a SOUND \n               over shot and they step apart, looking off.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Steve has come into scene and is looking at them.

Suddenly Clay swings around \n               and goes out of shot after his brother.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - MARY\n\n               She looks after him, clearly in love, disappointed that they \n               were interrupted. Then she turns to the fire.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Clay and Steve. CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of them as they walk toward \n               the wagon. Steve has begun to whistle blithely. Clay looks \n               sideways at him. Steve whistles even louder. They stop at \n               the wagon. CAMERA HOLDS. Steve climbs inside and hands down \n               the grub box.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         I -- I think it'll be swell.\n\n               Clay puts the grub box on the ground.

Clay \n               stares after him. Then he picks up the bed roll and moves \n               around the wagon.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Clay in the f.g. In front of Clay stretches the meadow with \n               the river beyond. The horses are grazing in the meadow. Fowler \n               can be seen hurrying toward the aspens and alders that screen \n               the river.\n\n               EXT. RIVER BANK\n\n               MED. SHOT. Here the river moves quietly down. The bank is \n               sandy. Alders and aspens screen it from the meadow. Helen \n               sits on the sand taking off her shoes and stockings. Her \n               toilet box is beside her. Something on the bank catches her \n               attention, she rises and climbs the bank. Some branches of \n               aspen cover an object. She pulls the branches away, revealing \n               a crud, miner's cradle or rocker.\n\n               MED. CLOSE\n\n               Helen stares down at the cradle.

He takes [a] \n               sack of tobacco and papers from his pocket. She reaches for \n               them. He watches her wide-eyed as she rolls a cigarette. He \n               holds a match for her.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Thanks.\n\n               She turns to the toilet case on the sand beside her, takes \n               out a comb. He glances at the box, then reaches over and \n               from it takes her powder box. He sniffs it. Without \n               irritation, as though borrowing a toy from a child, Helen \n               takes the powder box from him.\n\n                                     FOWLER\n                         That sure smells good.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         I like it.\n\n                                     FOWLER\n                         Up here in the hills, a man gets a \n                         hankering to smell powder.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Then why stay in the hills.\n\n               She looks at him then up the bank where the cradle is.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         That why?\n\n               Fowler hesitates. Helen hands him back the powder box as \n               matter-of-factly as she took it. He accepts it gratefully, \n               again putting it to his nose. Now he looks up at her, \n               regarding her calculatingly for a moment or two. Their eyes \n               meet.\n\n                                     FOWLER\n                         I guess you can keep a secret. That's \n                         a gold rocker.

Attached to the loop is a small, plump, \n               soft-leather poke. Still holding the powder box, he passes \n               her the poke. She starts to work with the thong.\n\n                                     FOWLER\n                         Look at her -- see her shine. One \n                         week's work.\n\n               Helen still struggles with the thong. He takes the poke, \n               pulls it open, pouring grains of gold into his palm. Helen \n               looks at the shining heap in his hand. Then she takes the \n               poke and pours some of the grains in her own palm. She looks \n               down at it. Her expression is calculating. She looks up at \n               Fowler and then the hard look goes away. She gives him a \n               soft smile.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. MEADOW\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - DOWN ANGLE.

Then rising he moves closer, squats \n               and rolls a cigarette. He holds it out. She licks it, then \n               puts it in her mouth. Clay lights a match, holds it out. She \n               catches his hand and holds the flame to her cigarette.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Thanks.\n\n               She still holds his hand.

Clay hesitates, then desire \n               for her is more than he can bear, so he takes her in his \n               arms. They kiss, holding the kiss for a long while.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               They break. She lies looking up.

His \n               hands crush her shoulders. Mary holds the kiss for a moment, \n               then draws back, waiting for him to say the words she wants \n               to hear. His hands pull her toward him. Mary wants the kiss -- \n               but she also wants a declaration of love. She makes one last \n               try to get it.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Tell me -- please --\n\n               Clay's grip on her shoulders tightens.

The current \n               catches the wagon. It starts drifting downstream. Mary whips \n               the mules. They swim, the current pulls them. Then the wagon \n               goes over. Mary is thrown into the water. The mules kick \n               themselves free and swim to the other bank. Mary goes under, \n               comes up and starts swimming desperately. Clay rides into \n               the SHOT. His mare hesitates at the bank. Clay spurs her and \n               she plunges in.

The brush with death has made him realize \n               how much she means to him.

Three \n               horsemen appear around a bend in the trail and ride down to \n               the riverbank. They are Lednov, McCall and Peters. Lednov's \n               horse is limping badly. They ride into the river.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               The horses swim to shore and flounder up the bank, Lednov's \n               horse last.

We feel that he might speak, but her cold \n               restraint prevents him. The wind whistles through the trees. \n               The slow plodding noise of the horses becomes more distant.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT.

Fowler is putting the supper dishes up on the \n               shelves beside the fireplace. The camp is cleaner than it \n               was earlier in the day. It is evident that he has gone to \n               great pains to make his visitor comfortable.\n\n               A mirror has been tacked up on a tree, and under it is a \n               wash basin. Fowler's rifle and shotgun are in a rack near \n               the fireplace. Helen's trunk stands open near the lean-to. \n               Helen, wearing a robe, takes some clothing from it, closes \n               the trunk.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         You can put this out of the way, \n                         Jed.

Fowler puts the last of the dishes on the \n               shelf, crosses to the trunk and moves it over to the side of \n               the lean-to.

Where'd the women go?\n\n               Fowler sinks on a bench, his head in his hands. Lednov moves \n               closer.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         When I ask questions, I like to hear \n                         answers.\n\n                                     FOWLER\n                         They went on like I told you.\n\n               EXT.

Helen freezes.\n\n               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               MED. SHOT. Lednov is staring off in the direction of Helen. \n               McCall moves to the edge of the lean-to, looking off.\n\n               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT. Helen starts forward again, more cautiously \n               than ever. She reaches a tree, turns to look back.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Helen, back to camera, is in immediate f.g. Through the trees \n               can be seen the camp and the flickering fire. She turns, and \n               then fright comes into her expression.\n\n               REVERSE SHOT\n\n               Peters stands in front of her. As he reaches out for her, \n               she tries to get away. He grabs her, wrapping his arms around \n               her.\n\n               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               MED. SHOT. From o.s. comes the SOUND of Helen and Peters \n               struggling. Fowler, hearing the SOUND, gets to his feet. \n               Lednov and McCall turn on him.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         Sit down.\n                              (calling)\n                         All right, Peters, come on over here.\n\n               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               MED. SHOT. Peters, carrying the struggling Helen, heads for \n               the camp.\n\n               EXT. CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE. Fowler makes a futile dive for Lednov. McCall \n               swings his rifle. Fowler goes down. In the b.g. Peters drags \n               the struggling Helen around the lean-to into the camp.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                              (to Fowler)\n                         So you were all alone.\n\n               He moves forward to meet Helen and Peters. Lednov reaches \n               out for Helen. Peters pulls her away.\n\n                                     PETERS\n                              (sharp)\n                         You keep your hands off.\n\n               McCall has taken his attention from Fowler and gives it to \n               Helen. Unnoticed now, Fowler is struggling back to \n               consciousness. He tries to pull himself up. McCall turns \n               back and kicks him again.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                              (yelling)\n                         Let him alone!\n\n               She rakes Peters' face with her fingernails, tries to fight \n               free. Lednov reaches out and grabs her arm. Peters knocks \n               his arm down. Free for the moment, Helen launches an attack \n               on McCall, who is getting ready to boot Fowler again. She is \n               on him like a cat, swarming all over him. He defends himself. \n               Helen is yelling furiously as she fights McCall.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Kick a guy, would you! You scum! You \n                         won't do any kickin' when they come \n                         back.\n\n               Lednov has reached her now. He wraps his arms around her and \n               pulls her away from McCall. Helen tries to fight him.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         You dirty murderers... killin' people \n                         when they're sleepin'...\n\n               Lednov pinions her arms.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         How do you know who we are?\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Everybody knows --\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                              (excited)\n                         Who brought you here?\n\n               Helen doesn't answer. Lednov starts twisting her arms.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         You said somebody was comin' back -- \n                         who's comin' back?\n\n                                     HELEN\n                              (moaning)\n                         Stop it --\n\n               As the pain increases she blurts out Clay's name.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Clay Phillips.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         Where is he?\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Up the trail.\n\n               In a fury, Lednov crushes her arm.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                         How far up the trail?\n\n                                     HELEN\n                              (moaning)\n                         I don't know -- I don't know.\n\n               He hurls her from him. She goes back against the table. Fowler \n               is trying to struggle to his feet. In blind rage, Lednov \n               raises his gun and fires. Fowler crumples. Helen looks down, \n               too horrified and terrified to scream. Lednov looks at her, \n               then almost casually he shoots her. McCall and Peters stand \n               watching as though frozen.\n\n                                     PETERS\n                              (huskily)\n                         You didn't have to do that.\n\n                                     LEDNOV\n                              (deadly)\n                         Why not? She might have got to Clay \n                         Phillips before I did.\n\n               AS HE TURNS,\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n               EXT. OPEN RIDGE FADE IN\n\n               MED. FULL SHOT - ANGLES east. Behind the ridge rises the \n               range through which the pass to Nevada cuts its way. The \n               trail which has dipped down into a canyon comes up to follow \n               the ridge a ways and then drops down again. Lednov, McCall \n               and Peters ride along the trail. Lednov, in the lead, stops \n               suddenly and looks off.\n\n               EXTREME LONG SHOT\n\n               DOWN ANGLE from Lednov's point of view. Far below is a meadow \n               and crossing it is a wagon road. This is the road from \n               Yosemite to Sonora. The road comes down the hill to the south \n               and, as the forest is open at this point, anything approaching \n               along the road can be seen for some distance. It crosses the \n               meadow and continues into the northwest. In the meadow is a \n               snake-rail corral. Clay's pack train comes out of the woods \n               above the meadow and starts down.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               McCall, Lednov and Peters. Lednov motions to his men and \n               they hurriedly ride forward into the shelter of some trees.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               the pack train. Mary, half asleep, slumps forward. Her horse \n               has stopped. Steve rides up alongside and looks over at her, \n               anxiously.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Are you all right?\n\n               Mary starts into wakefulness. She smiles at Steve.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         For the last ten miles I've been \n                         trying to figure out how to sleep \n                         sitting up. I'm getting to the point \n                         where I don't think there's any place \n                         named Sonora.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         It's a long ways yet.\n                              (arrogantly, to Clay)\n                         I figure we ought to camp.

Steve looks after him, annoyed, then \n               follows with Mary.\n\n               EXT. MEADOW\n\n               Clay leads the pack train out into the clearing and toward \n               the road. A small creek threads its way through the meadow. \n               Clay rides up to the creek and swings out of the saddle. He \n               is taking the saddle off as the others ride up.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                              (to Steve)\n                         Take the packs off. And run the horses \n                         into the corral.\n\n               He throws the saddle down, takes his rifle out of the \n               scabbard. Steve doesn't move.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         I said take the packs off.\n\n               He starts off past Mary, glances up.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Mary leans wearily forward on the pommel, too tired to \n               dismount.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                              (gruffly)\n                         I figure we'll make better time, \n                         letting the horses rest for a spell.\n\n               Mary looks down at him. She is hoping he will reach up and \n               lift her down.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         So grab yourself some sleep while \n                         you have the chance.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         If you want to go on, I can make it \n                         all right.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         Like I said, I was thinkin' of the \n                         horses.\n\n               He turns a way abruptly and goes toward the road. Mary looks \n               after him, disappointed. Steve comes over and helps her down.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               Steve and Mary. Steve spreads a tarp on the grass.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         You stretch out.

Mary looks \n               off in Clay's direction, then stretches out and pillows her \n               head on her arm. Now the sun is coming up and driving the \n               darkness out of the meadow. In the distance Clay can be seen \n               climbing up on a rise.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Clay. He climbs up on an eminence and looks back toward the \n               hills.\n\n               LONG SHOT\n\n               his ANGLE. The open ridge.

Steve is collecting wood for a fire. \n               Clay hurries down toward him.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               Steve squats beside the pile of needles, twigs and pine cones. \n               He strikes a match and sets the needles aflame. Clay hurries \n               into the scene and roughly kicks the fire out.

He kneels \n               beside the pack, rummages in them for hardtack and tinned \n               food. Steve looks after him.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Steve. He is hurt and angry. Knowing he was in the wrong \n               about the fire doesn't help matters. He'd like to go off in \n               the woods and cry, but that's out of the question. Instead \n               he follows Clay and stands above him.\n\n               MED.

Mary doesn't look back. Clay, \n               in f.g., looks after it. Dust rises. It disappears around a \n               bend in the road. Clay turns and starts across the meadow. \n               Steve looks after Clay, hesitates, then follows.\n\n               MED.

He loads the horse back, throws a blanket and \n               saddle on and cinches up the saddle. Steve watches, angry \n               and hurt. Clay steps back.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         There you are.\n\n               MED. CLOSE\n\n               the two brothers. They stare at each other.

Then understanding his brother's actions, \n               he jerks the reins and swings the horse around and rides \n               back toward the meadow.\n\n               EXT. MEADOW\n\n               MED. SHOT - Steve gallops across the meadow to the corral, \n               swings off and starts unsaddling.

Let's go.\n\n               EXT. MEADOW\n\n               LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE. Above the pines smoke rises. The \n               horses graze inside the corral. In the shadowy forest by the \n               creek, Clay's camp can be seen. A tarp has been stretched \n               over the camp. Lednov moves into the right hand side of the \n               frame and looks down.\n\n               REVERSE SHOT\n\n               Lednov stands on a rocky hill looking down in the meadow. \n               Behind him are McCall and Peters. They are screened from the \n               meadow by the rocks. Lednov turns and starts off through the \n               rocks to circle above the camp. The two men follow.

Something moves on the rocky hill above \n               and to his left. He looks up, waiting. The movement stops. \n               Clay glances around.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Below Clay, Steve lies in a cut in the rocks, watching the \n               camp.

CAMERA, SHOOTING THROUGH the \n               rifle sights, SEARCHES the forest and meadow.

Not me.\n\n               Lednov looks at McCall. From his pocket, McCall takes a coin.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Call it.\n\n                                     PETERS\n                         Heads.\n\n               McCall flips the coin, shows it to Peters.

A bullet hits near him. \n               Clay looks off in the direction where Lednov is waiting on \n               the hill west of the camp. Another SHOT is heard. A bullet \n               smacks into the rock close to Clay. It comes from McCall's \n               position southwest of the camp. Clay ducks.\n\n               EXT.

Steve has almost reached the fence. Lednov \n               fires. Steve stumbles and goes down.\n\n               MED. CLOSE\n\n               Steve. He lies still a moment, then painfully he crawls to \n               the rails and with a great effort tries to tear the rails \n               down. Lednov fires. The bullet whistles past. Steve pulls \n               the fence down, crawls away from the opening. The horses, \n               milling around the corral break through. Steve lies still, \n               face down.\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               The meadow, ANGLED PAST Clay. The horses scatter across the \n               meadow.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               Clay, now the hunter, moves toward Lednov's position. Lednov \n               fires. Clay runs and jumps into the creek. Sheltered by the \n               bank he makes his way up the creek.\n\n               MED. CLOSE\n\n               Lednov. He waits, his rifle ready. O.s. a twig snaps. \n               Cautiously he looks ahead. There is silence.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               his ANGLE. A light wind runs through the great trees. Shafts \n               of light filter through the trees, making patterns on the \n               forest floor. The light is dim, deceptive. Lednov, rifle \n               ready, searches for some sign of Clay. Then from another \n               direction comes the SOUND of movement. Lednov swings his \n               rifle in that direction, waits. The SOUND has stopped.\n\n                                     CLAY'S VOICE\n                         I'm here Lednov.\n\n               His voice echoes across the hills. Lednov sights along his \n               rifle at the direction from which the SOUND of Clay's voice \n               came. Momentarily Clay is seen as he runs from one tree to \n               another. Lednov fires.\n\n               MED. CLOSE\n\n               Clay. Clay cautiously edges around the base of a tree. He \n               picks up a stick, stops.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         Come on out.\n\n               His voice can be heard echoing across the hills. He tosses \n               the stick. Lednov fires at the SOUND of the falling stick.\n\n                                     LEDNOV'S VOICE\n                         Come and get me.\n\n               As his voice echoes across the hills Clay quickly moves into \n               the open and fires.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Lednov crumples forward as his echoing voice fades out. Clay \n               moves over to him to stand looking down.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. MEADOW\n\n               MED.

The sheriff's \n               posse, the bodies of Lednov, McCall and Wheeler slung across \n               the backs of horses, and Clay's remuda, trot down the street. \n               People come out of the hotel to watch the cavalcade pass. \n               Clay and Steve are not with the posse.

The room is cluttered. \n               The lamp, held by Clay, throws a circle of pale light down \n               on Steve. The doctor is working on Steve's shoulder and arm.\n\n               MED. CLOSE - UP ANGLE\n\n               featuring Clay. Clay suddenly averts his glance and winces \n               as the doctor probes the wound in Steve's arm.

Clay tries to steady his \n               shaking hand. He is focusing his attention on a far wall. A \n               woman's hand comes in the scene and takes the lamp from him. \n               He reacts.
