Fury.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tERIC\n</b>\t\tTime for a sacrifice.\n\n\tLao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the\n\teyes used to be.  He smiles gruesomely.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLAO\n</b>\t\tI don't need eyes to take what I\n\t\twant from you.\n\n\tHe EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's\n\tback!\n\n\tON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his\n\tsternum.

He PLUMMETS off the \n\troof edge.\n\n\tANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --  He slows, stopping when Elly\n\tis in frame.  He clutches his own chest.  Regards his own\n\tshaking hand, drenched in his won blood.  Glazed.\n\n\tON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying\n\tto get to Eric.  She flails and cries out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLY\n</b>\t\tDon't let me fall!\n\n\tCLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.\n\n<b>\tEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)\n</b>\n\tA low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).\n\n\tEric's and Elly's feet pass graves.  Eric's pace is slow, crippled, \n\tlimping.  They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal \n\tthe flowers there.\n\n\tEric is bloody and out of it.  She helps him walk.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLY\n</b>\t\tNow do you get to see her?

Promise.\n\n<b>\tMOVE WITH ERIC\n</b>\n\tSpent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never\n\tgoing to make it the few yards back to his own grave.  So close.\n\n\tHis legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.  One\n\tgroping hand tries to drag him further.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tERIC\n</b>\t\tLeave me now.\n\n<b>\tANGLE - ELLY\n</b>\n\tTears on her face.  She can't watch this.  She TURNS and drops\n\tthe flowers on Shelly's grave.\n\n<b>\tERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE\n</b>\n\tStill too far away to matter.\n\n<b>\tRESUME ERIC ON GROUND\n</b>\n\tHe gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat\n\tbefore SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.\n\n\tNo ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's\n\tblank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.\n\n<b>\tANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG\n</b>\n\tShe struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly\n\twipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.  She turns\n\ttoward Eric's grave.  Then, surprised, she looks close.\n\n<b>\tANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE\n</b>\n\tEric is gone.

The apartment is in order and perhaps we\n\tnotice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is\n\tsprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME\n\tB.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is\n\thectic but natural.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDARLA\n</b>\t\tWorktime, kiddo.  First day, new\n\t\tjob, gotta go.\n\n\tThis does not get the expected smile from Elly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDARLA (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tYou sure you're gonna be okay?\n\n\tElly turns from the window and NODS silently.\n\n<b>\tELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE\n</b>\n\tThe aforementioned grey day in the city.\n\n<b>\tANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.\n</b>\n\tDarla comes up.
