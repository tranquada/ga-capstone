A fly-vision bank of 12 TV\n\tmonitors is hot with surveillance.\n\n\tLAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,\n\talmost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is\n\tthe King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.\n\n\tAt the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,\n\tperfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop\n\tis bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a\n\tmeter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned\n\tbeneath an Artemide lamp.

An idea.  He lifts it reverently, bears it\n\tthe Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of\n\timmeasurable worth.\n\n\t\t\t\tNGO NWA\n\t\t(why give me this?)\n\n\tNonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even\n\tNwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his\n\tsternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do\n\tanything untoward.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAO\n\t\t(sinister punchline)\n\n\tLao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's\n\tchest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of\n\tastonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely \n\ttreacherous, he is extremely capable.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAO\n\t\t\t(in perfect English)\n\t\tWhen I spoke of an offering, I\n\t\tdidn't mean an offering to you.\n\n\tINT.

The apartment is in order and perhaps we\n\tnotice a few new items.  Gabriel the cat, miraculously ALIVE, is\n\tsprawled on a chair, licking himself.  Darla BUSTLES INTO FRAME\n\tB.G.  Her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done.  Her manner is\n\thectic but natural.\n\n\t\t\t\tDARLA\n\t\tWorktime, kiddo.  First day, new\n\t\tjob, gotta go.\n\n\tThis does not get the expected smile from Elly.\n\n\t\t\t\tDARLA (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou sure you're gonna be okay?\n\n\tElly turns from the window and NODS silently.\n\n\tELLY'S POV - OUTSIDE\n\n\tThe aforementioned grey day in the city.\n\n\tANGLE - DARLA AND ELLY AT THE WINDOW.\n\n\tDarla comes up.  Arm around Elly.  Cheer up; he attitude much\n\tmore connected and loving.  PUSH IN ON ELLY so we know she is\n\tclutching SHelly's ring tightly in her hand.  Darla looks past\n\tElly, out the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tDARLA\n\t\tAt least it finally stopped\n\t\training.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLY\n\t\tIt can't rain all the time.\n\n\tDarla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door.  Elly OPENS\n\ther hand to consider the ring.  She looks back out the window --\n\n\tANGLE - THE CROW ON THE LEDGE\n\n\tElly is looking right at it.  Same crow.  We're positive.  So is\n\tElly.  It TAKES WING and flies away.\n\n\tEXT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n\tAn UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES\n\tINTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.  PUSH IN on the\n\tcrow.  Watching.  Waiting.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSLOW FADE TO DEAD BLACK. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrow, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Schow\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Romance\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:19.106120"}
