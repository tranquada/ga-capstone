Marty and Abby stumble down the front stoop onto \n               the lawn.\n\n               His hand is still clamped over her mouth.

His other hand cuffs her on \n               the side of the head, spinning her around.\n\n               Marty is now clutching his broken finger with his good hand. \n               Abby kicks him in the groin.\n\n               He sinks to his knees, drops forward on one hand, and vomits.\n\n<b>               FRONT STOOP\n</b>\n               Ray is coming out the door, hitching up his pants.

Several \n               teenagers lean against cars drinking beer; inside the cars \n               we can see the vague forms of others.\n\n<b>                                     TEENAGER\n</b>                         Hey mister, how'd you break your \n                         pussyfinger?\n\n               His friends laugh.\n\n<b>               TRACK PULLING MARTY\n</b>\n               Ignoring the laughter as he walks past the cars, apparently \n               looking for someone.

He is smoking a cigarette, talking to a \n               sixteen-year-old girl in shorts and a tube top.

We follow the hand as the man advances \n               slowly and quietly across the living room.\n\n               Abby's purse comes into frame, sitting on a bureau; next to \n               it is a large tote bag. The hand rummages through the tote \n               bag briefly, then the purse. The man withdraws Abby's pearl-\n               handled revolver. He breaks it open.\n\n<b>               LOW-ANGLE CLOSE SHOT  THE MAN'S FACE\n</b>\n               It is Visser.

Three of the holes glint silver, the other three \n               are black--empty.\n\n               We hear the faint creaking of bedsprings.\n\n<b>               WIDE SHOT  LIVING ROOM\n</b>\n               Visser cocks his head, listening, and looks down the hallway. \n               He takes a couple of quiet steps across the living room and, \n               as the camera tracks up to him, opens the back door of the \n               bungalow.\n\n               We follow him outside onto the lawn.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He slows, moves \n               more cautiously, then sinks to his knees under the window. \n               As he reaches into his breast pocket the camera continues \n               tracking up to and over him, finally framing his POV through \n               the window.\n\n               On the bed inside we can dimly see Abby and Ray, asleep.\n\n               We have been hearing a faint rumble, becoming louder and \n               louder as if approaching from a distance. Just as the rumble \n               becomes deafening a sudden bright flash of light illuminates \n               the room, seeming to polarize the image of Abby and Ray in \n               bed, and we:\n\n<b>                                                                     CUT TO\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Visser stands sweating in the phone booth with the \n               receiver pressed to his ear.

We are looking from the bar, across \n               the dark empty floor, toward the pebbled windows at the front \n               of the building that catch a hard blue light from the \n               streetlamps outside. The jukebox in the middle distance glows \n               in the darkness.\n\n               A pair of headlights catches the pebbled glass and grows \n               brighter as we hear a car pull up to the bar and stop. We \n               hear a car door open and shut, then the sound of feet on \n               gravel. A huge shadow appears on the pebbled glass as the \n               figure crosses in front of the headlights. The man tries the \n               door, finds it locked, and walks back in front of the \n               headlights to cup his hands at a window. He walks back to \n               the door, and a moment later it swings open--framing him in \n               the doorway in silhouette.\n\n               We follow him as he moves across the floor, behind the bar \n               and up to the cash register. He switches on a small \n               fluorescent light clamped to the top of the cash register. \n               It is Ray.\n\n               He punches a key and the register rings open. He lifts up \n               the empty cash drawer and takes some papers from underneath \n               it.\n\n<b>               RAY'S POV\n</b>\n               As he flips through the papers; bills, receipts, no money.\n\n<b>               BACK TO RAY\n</b>\n               As he finishes flipping through the papers.\n\n<b>                                     RAY\n</b>                              (muttering)\n                         Damn...\n\n               He slips them back under the cash drawer and slams the \n               register shut. Turning from the register he glances around \n               the bar, the pauses, noticing something.\n\n<b>               RAY'S POV\n</b>\n               Light is spilling out from under the door to Marty's office.\n\n<b>               BACK TO RAY\n</b>\n               As he starts across the floor to Marty's office.\n\n<b>                                     RAY\n</b>                         Marty...\n\n               He reaches the door and knocks sharply.

The door swings open.\n\n               Over his shoulder we see Marty, still at his desk, his back \n               to us.

Ray \n               looks from the gun to Marty, slowly sets the gun down on the \n               desk. A pause. He begins to hoist Marty from the chair.\n\n               There is noise from the bar, as of someone entering.\n\n               Ray reacts.\n\n<b>               THE DOOR\n</b>\n               Separating the bar and back office.

He stoops down and tries to mop up the pool of \n               blood with his windbreaker.

The music from the bar, though \n               fainter, can still be heard.\n\n               There are three or four wooden steps going down from the \n               back door to the small gravel parking lot in back. Ray backs \n               down the stairs; Marty's feet THUMP-THUMP-THUMP down the \n               stairs after him.\n\n               The rear door of Ray's car is open. Ray heaves in Marty's \n               torso. Marty's legs rest on the ground outside the car. Ray \n               takes an ankle in each hand and pushes.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n</b>\n               As he shuts the door.

The wadded-up towel is chucked out of his window \n               into the fire. We hold on the fire as Ray's car rolls on out \n               of frame.\n\n<b>               INT.

The radio \n               is broadcasting a fundamentalist's sermon, periodically \n               interrupted by static.

Again nothing.\n\n               He disappears into the kitchenette as we hold on its open \n               doorway.

There is the rattle of a \n               can being pulled off the refrigerator rack, and the snap of \n               its pull-tab being opened. After a couple of audible slurps \n               we hear the can go back on the rack and, as the blue light \n               disappears, we hear the refrigerator door close.\n\n               Visser reappears in the doorway. He surveys the room, fixes \n               on the bathroom door, goes over, turns the knob.
