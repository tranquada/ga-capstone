I don't care if you're \n                         the Pope of Rome, President of the \n                         United States, or even Man of the \n                         Year--something can always go wrong. \n                         And go ahead, complain, tell your \n                         problems to your neighbor, ask for \n                         help--watch him fly. Now in Russia, \n                         they got it mapped out so that \n                         everyone pulls for everyone else--\n                         that's the theory, anyway. But what \n                         I know about is Texas...\n\n                                                                     CUT TO\n\n               ROAD  NIGHT\n\n               We are rushing down a rain-swept country road, listening to \n               the rhythmic swish of tires on wet asphalt.\n\n                                     VOICE-OVER\n                         And down here... you're on your own.\n\n               INT. CAR NIGHT\n\n               We are looking at the backs of two people in the front seat--\n               a man, driving, and a woman next to him.\n\n               Their conversation will be punctuated by the occasional glare \n               of oncoming headlights and the roar of the car rushing by.\n\n               The windshield wipers wave a soporific beat. The conversation \n               is halting, awkward.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         ...He gave me a little pearl-handled \n                         .38 for out first anniversary.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         ...Figured I'd better leave before I \n                         used it on him.

Rain drifts down \n               past its headlights.\n\n               Finally it pulls out and passes them slowly, their headlights \n               showing it to be a battered green Volkswagon. First the car \n               itself, then its red taillights, disappear into the rain.\n\n               BACK TO THE MAN\n\n               Cutting between him and the woman, each from behind.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         ...You know that car?\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         No.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         What's the matter?\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         I don't know...

It hits Visser \n               in the chest and bounces to the floor.\n\n               Visser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for \n               a beat. Then he roars with laughter.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         That's good... \"which rock to turn \n                         over\"... that's very good...\n\n               Sighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope.

After a moment he rises and \n               crosses the office to the window looking out on the bar.\n\n               Over Marty's shoulder we see the long bar leading up to the \n               window in perpendicular. The camera is tracking forward, \n               past Marty, to frame on the window.\n\n               A black man is just now vaulting the near end of the bar, \n               over onto the customer side.\n\n                                                              MATCH CUT TO:\n\n               MARTY'S BAR\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE  VAULTING MAN\n\n               Tracking back with him as he lands on the customer side and \n               heads across the bar.

We track behind Meurice as he makes his \n               way back toward the bar. When he reaches it, he claps a couple \n               of people on the shoulder, who make way for him. He vaults \n               back over the top, walks down the bar, and stops in from of \n               an attractive white woman sitting on a bar stool and sipping \n               a brandy.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         Where was I?\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         You we telling me about the Ring of \n                         Fire.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         Yeah, well, I may be getting in over \n                         my head here, I mean you're the \n                         geologist, but my theory for what \n                         it's worth, you got all these \n                         volcanoes and each time one pops \n                         it's the equivalent of what, twenty, \n                         thirty megatons of TNT?

What'd you say your last \n                         name was?\n\n               MARTY'S HOUSE  TRACKING DOWN HALLWAY\n\n               We are following a large German shepherd as it pads down the \n               hall toward a warmly lit room at its end. We hear only the \n               sound of the dog's paws on the hardwood floor, and the faint \n               clicking of billiard balls.\n\n               BILLIARD ROOM\n\n               It is a paneled, carpeted room with black leather furniture \n               and a nine-foot billiard table. Various stuffed animal \n               trophies are scattered around the room, including a moose \n               head mounted on one wall. Ray stands alone in the foreground, \n               shooting pool, an unlit cigarette in his mouth. The room is \n               very quiet.\n\n               In the background the German shepherd enters from the hallway, \n               sits down in a corner, and benignly watches Ray.\n\n               UPSTAIRS BEDROOM\n\n               It is expensively appointed; a brightly lit woman's bedroom. \n               Abby is opening a hinged drawer in a white antique bureau. \n               She pulls out a leather handbag, gropes nervously through \n               its contents, then puts it aside.\n\n               She crosses the room to a vanity table, takes a purse from \n               underneath, and spills its contents out on top of the table.\n\n               BILLIARD ROOM\n\n               Ray pockets a couple of balls, looks over at the dog, then \n               up at the wall at the far end of the room.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Hanging on the wall are a couple of framed photographs of \n               Marty and Abby, taken a long time ago.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Staring at the pictures. He looks back down at the pool table.\n\n               UPSTAIRS BEDROOM\n\n               Abby is sitting on a large double bed. She puts aside another \n               purse, rises and crosses the room hurriedly, and pushes back \n               the sliding doors of a long wardrobe closet. The upper shelf \n               is lined with handbags--fifteen or twenty of them. She grabs \n               the first one, looks in, tosses it aside; grabs the second, \n               looks--and stops.\n\n               HER POV\n\n               Inside the purse, a small pearl-handled gun.\n\n               BILLIARD ROOM\n\n               Ray is now standing in front of the pictures on the wall, \n               looking from one to the next.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               A picture of Abby and Marty standing together on a Gulf beach. \n               Marty is wearing a long velour beach robe, Abby is in a \n               swimming suit. Ray's hand enters frame. He traces a finger \n               down her leg.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               His head cocked to the side. After a moment his eyes shift.\n\n               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  PHOTO DETAIL\n\n               Of Marty's face. He is staring into the camera, at whoever \n               took the picture. His head is thrown back slightly; he is \n               laughing.\n\n               From offscreen in the quiet room we hear a static hum and \n               then Abby's voice over an intercom.\n\n                                     ABBY'S VOICE\n                         Ray...?\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He turns from the photograph and walks to an intercom speaker \n               next to the mounted moose's head. He presses the speaker \n               button.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Yeah...\n\n               He idly takes his unlit cigarette and sticks it in the moose's \n               mouth.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...You get what you wanted?\n\n                                     ABBY'S VOICE\n                         Yeah. Let's get out of here.\n\n               MARTY'S FRONT FOYER\n\n               We are looking across a dark, high-ceilinged foyer toward \n               the front door. Ray leans against the doorjamb, in silhouette \n               in the open doorway. He is facing a curved staircase that \n               descends into the foyer. Abby appears at the second-floor \n               landing and starts down the stairs.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Why d'you wanna leave all this?\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         You kidding?

BACK OF MARTY'S BAR\n\n               Marty is sitting on the stoop that descends from his back \n               office to a graveled back parking lot; he is framed in the \n               open doorway of his brightly lit office.

His other hand cuffs her on \n               the side of the head, spinning her around.\n\n               Marty is now clutching his broken finger with his good hand. \n               Abby kicks him in the groin.\n\n               He sinks to his knees, drops forward on one hand, and vomits.\n\n               FRONT STOOP\n\n               Ray is coming out the door, hitching up his pants. In his \n               right hand he hold Abby's pearl-handled revolver.\n\n               MARTY\n\n               Slowly gets to his feet, looking at Ray.\n\n               ABBY\n\n               She has backed away from Marty and now stands on the lawn, \n               breathing heavily. She looks from Ray to Marty.\n\n               BACK TO MARTY\n\n               Backing toward his car, a Cadillac parked at curbside, still \n               looking at Ray. He turns to get into the car.\n\n               The German shepherd lopes across the lawn and takes a clean \n               leap into the car through the open window on the passenger \n               side.\n\n               Marty turns the ignition. The engine coughs and dies. He \n               tries again; it starts.\n\n               The car roars up the street.\n\n               RAY\n\n               Watching the car. He looks at Abby.\n\n               ABBY\n\n               Still panting. Up the street we can hear Marty's car \n               alternately racing and stopping, shifting in and out of gear.  \n               His engine rumble starts to grow louder again.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Like to have seen his face when he \n                         found the dead end.\n\n               In the background we see Marty's car roar by in the opposite \n               direction.\n\n               MOUNT BONNEL  EVENING\n\n               LATERAL TRACK\n\n               Moving past a row of cars parked on an overlook near the top \n               of the mountain. Below we can see the lights of the city of \n               Austin. The lot is littered with beer cans. We hear the sound \n               of rock music coming from various car radios. Several \n               teenagers lean against cars drinking beer; inside the cars \n               we can see the vague forms of others.\n\n                                     TEENAGER\n                         Hey mister, how'd you break your \n                         pussyfinger?\n\n               His friends laugh.\n\n               TRACK PULLING MARTY\n\n               Ignoring the laughter as he walks past the cars, apparently \n               looking for someone. His right index finger is taped up in \n               an aluminum splint.\n\n               MARTY'S POV\n\n               At the end of a row of cars we see a green Volkswagon bug. \n               Leaning against the hood is Visser, still dressed in his \n               rumpled yellow suit. He is smoking a cigarette, talking to a \n               sixteen-year-old girl in shorts and a tube top. When he \n               notices Marty:\n\n                                     VISSER\n                              (to the girl)\n                         Sorry sweetheart, my date is here...\n\n               The girl drifts off. Marty enters frame and Visser turns to \n               him.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...She saw me rolling a cigarette \n                         and thought it was marijuana.\n                              (he laughs)\n                         I guess she thought I was a swinger.\n\n               Visser open the back door of the car. Marty ignores the \n               invitation, walks around to the front on the passenger side \n               and gets in.\n\n               INT. VISSER'S CAR\n\n               As Visser gets into the driver's seat. A small topless doll \n               is suspended from the rearview mirror. Visser gives it a \n               tap. As it swings back and forth two small lights, one behind \n               each breast, blink on and off.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Idnat wild?\n\n               Both men sit watching the doll intently.\n\n               Finally Marty reaches up and stops its swinging with the \n               rounded end of his splint. Visser eyes the splint.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                              (genially)\n                         Stick your finger up the wrong \n                         person's ass?\n\n               Marty is silent, but Visser is in a good mood.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         You know a friend of mine broke his \n                         hand a while back. Put in a cast. \n                         Very next day he takes a fall, \n                         protects his bad hand, falls on his \n                         good one, breaks that too. So now \n                         he's got two busted flippers and I \n                         say to him \"Creighton, I hope your \n                         wife loves you. 'Cause for the next \n                         five weeks you cannot wipe your own \n                         goddamn ass...\"\n\n               Overcome by laughter. Finally:\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...That's the test, ain't it? Test \n                         of true love--\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Got a job for you.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                              (settling down)\n                         ...Well, if the pay's right and it's \n                         legal I'll do it.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         It's not strictly legal.\n\n               Visser shrugs, lights up another cigarette with his \n               fraternally inscribed lighter and drops the lighter onto the \n               dashboard.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         If the pay's right I'll do it.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         It's, uh... it's in reference to \n                         that gentleman and my wife. The more \n                         I think about it the more irritated \n                         I get.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Yeah? Well how irritated are you?\n\n               Marty doesn't answer. Finally Visser laughs.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that.

Finally he shrugs.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         You want me to kill 'em.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I didn't say that.\n                              (a pause)\n                         Well?\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Well what?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         What do you think?\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         You're an idiot.\n\n               Marty's shoulders slump. He seems less tense, almost relieved.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         So, uh... this wouldn't interest \n                         you.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         I didn't say that. All I said was \n                         you're an idiot. Hell, you been \n                         thinking about it so much it's driving \n                         you simple.\n\n               They are staring at each other.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Ten thousand dollars I'll give you.\n\n               Visser laughs again.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         I'm supposed to do a murder--two \n                         murders--and just trust you not to \n                         go simple on me and do something \n                         stupid.

You just \n                         find a way to cover that money.\n\n               Marty is slumped in his seat, not responding to the fact \n               that Visser has just ended the conversation.\n\n               Finally he rouses himself and gets out of the car, leaving \n               Visser staring at the door he has left open behind him.\n\n               After a moment we hear Marty's footsteps approaching again, \n               and he leans back into the open door with an afterthought.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I'll take care of the money, you \n                         just make sure those bodies aren't \n                         found...

Marty leaves. After a moment, \n               Visser leans over to grab the handle of the still open door.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                              (under his breath)\n                         Sweet Jesus, you are disgusting.\n\n               The door slams.\n\n               INT. EMPTY APARTMENT  NIGHT\n\n               The apartment is dark. We are looking across a shadowy floor \n               towards a large window, through which cold blue street light \n               shines. Through the window we can see the facade of the \n               building across the street; we are three or four floors up.\n\n               We can hear the animated, accented voice of an Hispanic woman \n               approaching the apartment from the hallway behind us.\n\n                                     LANDLADY (O.S.)\n                         --big windows, paneleen and \n                         everytheen. So you want, like your \n                         own place? Like a Town House?\n\n               A crack of light shoots across the floor as we hear the \n               apartment door open behind us. A figure enters frame. As it \n               crosses into the shaft of light we see that it is Abby. She \n               moves across the dark apartment, in silhouette against the \n               window.\n\n                                     LANDLADY (O.S.)\n                         No one will bother you here, sweetie--\n\n               An overhead light is switched on and the room is bathed in \n               light. Several feet from Abby, an old man in a dirty \n               undershirt is asleep on a cot. Abby starts.\n\n               The old man grumbles, slowly sits up, squints.\n\n               With the light, the window behind Abby has become a mirror \n               of the entire room, in which we now see the matronly Landlady \n               standing by the wall switch.\n\n               The Landlady roars at the old man in Spanish. The man glowers \n               at her. The Landlady looks back at Abby.\n\n                                     LANDLADY\n                              (cheerful again)\n                         I show you around.\n\n               We follow Abby as she accompanies the landlady back into the \n               short hallway-entrance foyer.

The Landlady \n               snaps at him again in Spanish, and is again cheerful as she \n               turns back to address Abby.\n\n                                     LANDLADY\n                         ...I was just esplaineen to him that \n                         he moved out of here yesterday...\n\n               She walks to the apartment door.\n\n                                     LANDLADY\n                         ...You look around.

All of the men \n               except Meurice are conservatively dressed and apparently \n               well-to-do. An audio loop is blaring a bump-and-grind version \n               of \"Yellow Rose of Texas,\" punctuated by the crash of cymbals \n               and the thumping of toms.\n\n               Abby enters and sits into an empty chair next to Meurice.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Looks like the state legislature is \n                         out of session.\n\n               Meurice continues to stare intently off.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         I thought this is where they met.\n\n               All of the heads at the bar start to swivel, including \n               Meurice's. A couple of patrons hurriedly snatch their drinks \n               off the bar.\n\n               In the extreme foreground a stripper dances on the top of \n               the bar into frame. We crop her just above her white high-\n               heeled cowboy boots and her bare calves.\n\n               The conversation continues with Abby looking at Meurice, but \n               Meurice and everyone else at the bar looking up at a point \n               somewhere above the stripper's calves.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me \n                         with a problem.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         I am?\n\n               The stripper drops a white leatherette vest onto the bar in \n               the foreground. The audience cheers.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         You're gonna keep an eye on Marty \n                         and Ray, make sure nothing happens.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         It won't?\n\n               Two sheriff-star pasties drop onto the bar. The audience \n               cheers.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         ...Ever occur to you, Abby, that \n                         maybe I'm the wrong person to ask?\n\n               THE EXHORTER\n\n               Into his microphone.\n\n                                     EXHORTER\n                         Let's not sit on our wallets, \n                         gentlemen.

We are looking across the room toward a \n               moonlit window. Beyond, across the lawn, the lamplit street \n               is empty.\n\n               Suddenly Abby sits bolt upright into frame from the bed below.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         He's in the house.\n\n               Offscreen we hear Ray stirring in bed.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         What's the matter?\n\n               Abby twists around to look down at him.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         I could've sworn I heard something.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Door's locked. Nothing there.\n\n               He pulls her down out of frame and we hold on the window and \n               the empty lamplit street. Then Abby rises back into frame, \n               in silhouette against the window, looking down at Ray.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         I knew it.

Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.\n\n               Ray's hand rises into frame and coaxes Abby back down onto \n               the bed, revealing, through the window, a green Volkswagon \n               now parked at curbside on the lamplit street.\n\n               We hear the rustle of sheets.\n\n               As we hold on the window, we begin to hear the faint, distant \n               sound of metal scraping against metal.\n\n               HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM\n\n               We track down the dark hallway into the living room. As the \n               camera advances the sound of the scraping becomes louder.\n\n               We are moving across the living room up to the front door of \n               the bungalow. The scraping is louder still as we finally \n               frame on a close shot of the doorknob, which is jiggling \n               ever so slightly.\n\n               We hear a click as the lock finally releases.\n\n               The door swings slowly open, revealing a man's hand on the \n               outside doorknob. We follow the hand as the man advances \n               slowly and quietly across the living room.\n\n               Abby's purse comes into frame, sitting on a bureau; next to \n               it is a large tote bag. The hand rummages through the tote \n               bag briefly, then the purse. The man withdraws Abby's pearl-\n               handled revolver. He breaks it open.\n\n               LOW-ANGLE CLOSE SHOT  THE MAN'S FACE\n\n               It is Visser. As we hear a click offscreen, his face glows a \n               dim orange.\n\n               BACK TO HIS HANDS\n\n               His right holds the revolver, cylinder open, inside the purse.  \n               His left holds his cigarette lighter as he inspects the \n               chamber. Three of the holes glint silver, the other three \n               are black--empty.\n\n               We hear the faint creaking of bedsprings.\n\n               WIDE SHOT  LIVING ROOM\n\n               Visser cocks his head, listening, and looks down the hallway. \n               He takes a couple of quiet steps across the living room and, \n               as the camera tracks up to him, opens the back door of the \n               bungalow.\n\n               We follow him outside onto the lawn.\n\n               EXT. RAY'S BUNGALOW\n\n               We track behind him as he rounds the corner of the house and \n               approaches the open window to Ray's bedroom. He slows, moves \n               more cautiously, then sinks to his knees under the window. \n               As he reaches into his breast pocket the camera continues \n               tracking up to and over him, finally framing his POV through \n               the window.\n\n               On the bed inside we can dimly see Abby and Ray, asleep.\n\n               We have been hearing a faint rumble, becoming louder and \n               louder as if approaching from a distance. Just as the rumble \n               becomes deafening a sudden bright flash of light illuminates \n               the room, seeming to polarize the image of Abby and Ray in \n               bed, and we:\n\n                                                                     CUT TO\n\n               EXT. PHONE BOOTH DAY\n\n               A huge truck roars by on the street behind Visser, and with \n               it the deafening rumble recedes. It is a painfully bright \n               day. Visser stands sweating in the phone booth with the \n               receiver pressed to his ear. We hear the phone ringing at \n               the other end.\n\n               Finally, it is picked up.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Hello.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Marty?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Yeah.

Is it done?\n\n               Visser forces a chuckle.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...Yessir, you owe me some money.\n\n               MARTY'S OFFICE  NIGHT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  TWO STRINGS OF FISH\n\n               Being plopped down onto Marty's desk.\n\n               WIDER  THE OFFICE\n\n               Visser sits facing the desk. He lights himself a cigarette \n               and sets the lighter down on the desk in front of him. Marty \n               settles, fidgeting, into the chair behind it.\n\n               The bar is quiet, shut down. We hear only the whir of a fan \n               somewhere offscreen. Marty and Visser are lit by a lamp on \n               the desk between them. Light streams into the room from a \n               bathroom in the background. Visser is looking at the dead \n               fish.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                              (dully)\n                         They look good.\n\n               Marty half-rises from his seat and picks up one of the \n               strings.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Want a couple?\n\n               He drops them on Visser's side of the desk. Visser's head \n               draws back: he was only being polite.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Just the ten thousand'll be fine.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Got something to show me first?\n\n               Visser hands a 9 x 12 envelope across the desk. Marty stares \n               at it for a moment, then quickly bends back the flap and \n               takes out an 8 x 10 photograph.\n\n               THE PHOTOGRAPH\n\n               It is a black-and-white shot of Abby and Ray in Ray's bed. \n               The sheet that partially covers them is pocked with three \n               dark bullet holes and is stained with blood.\n\n               MARTY\n\n               Staring dully down at the picture.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Dead, huh?\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         So it would seem.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  THE TOP OF THE DESK\n\n               Visser is pushing the fish away from his side of the desk \n               with the eraser end of a pencil.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         What did you...\n\n               BACK TO MARTY\n\n               Still looking at the picture. He traces the outline of Abby's \n               body with his finger.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...What did you do with the bodies?\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         It's taken care of. The less you \n                         know about it the better.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Jesus, I don't believe it...\n\n               Marty slips the picture back into its 9 x 12 envelope. His \n               face is pale.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...I think I'm gonna be sick.\n\n               He rises and heads for the bathroom, still clutching the \n               envelope.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER\n\n               As his eyes follow Marty's exit. The bathroom door doesn't \n               close all the way; a narrow shaft of light slices the office \n               from the bare bulb in the bathroom.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         I'll want that picture back...\n\n               He turns to look across the desk.\n\n               VISSER'S POV\n\n               The standing safe behind the desk.\n\n               BACK TO VISSER\n\n               Still looking at the safe. Beads of sweat have popped out on \n               his forehead. He fans himself with his cowboy hat.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...and you did say somethin' about \n                         some money.\n\n               We hear a toilet flush offscreen.\n\n               LONG SHOT  MARTY'S OFFICE\n\n               As he reenters the office.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Your money, yeah.\n\n               Visser stares dully down at the desktop.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Something I got to ask you, Marty. \n                         I've been very very careful. Have \n                         you been very very careful?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Of course.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Nobody knows you hired me?\n\n               HIGH ANGLE  CORNER OF THE OFFICE\n\n               Marty is hunched over the open safe, still holding the \n               envelope. Blocking Visser's view of the safe with his body, \n               he slides the picture of Abby's and Ray's corpses from under \n               the envelope into the safe, then withdraws two packets of \n               money.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Don't be absurd, I wasn't about to \n                         tell anyone...\n\n               He shuts the safe and spins the dial.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...This is an illicit romance--we've \n                         got to trust each other to be \n                         discreet...\n\n               He walks across the room and throws the money and the envelope \n               down on the desk.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...For richer, for poorer.\n\n               Visser looks from the money down at his hands. They are \n               sweating.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Don't say that. Your marriages don't \n                         work out so hot...\n\n               He wipes his hands on his pants.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...How did you cover the money?\n\n               Marty sits and props his booted feet up on the desk.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         It's taken care of. The less you \n                         know about it the better.\n\n               He smiles.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...I just made a call about that. \n                         It'll look fine.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                              (shaking his head)\n                         I must've gone money simple.

Visser's hand is the only thing that \n               moved.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  MARTY\n\n               Staring at Visser.\n\n               After the gun blast we hear only the whir of the fan.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER\n\n               Staring at Marty.\n\n               MED SHOT  MARTY  OVER VISSER'S SHOULDER\n\n               His eyes are now shut. Otherwise he hasn't moved. A blood \n               stain is growing on the front of his shirt.\n\n               WIDE SHOT  THE OFFICE\n\n               The two face each other across the desk. Visser's gun is \n               still trained on Marty.\n\n               After a moment Visser starts fanning himself again with his \n               cowboy hat. The only movement in the frame is the slow back-\n               and-forth of the yellow hat, rhythmically in and out of shadow \n               as it catches and loses the light from the desk lamp. There \n               is a long pause.\n\n               Finally one of Marty's feet slips from the desk and hits the \n               floor with a THUD.\n\n               Visser lays the gun on the desk.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER\n\n               As he reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a \n               handkerchief. He wipes his forehead, then picks up the gun \n               and wipes it off. He leans down with the gun.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  THE GUN\n\n               As Visser places it deliberately on the floor near the desk. \n               It is Abby's pearl-handled revolver.\n\n               THE DESKTOP  FROM DESK LEVEL\n\n               As Visser straightens up in the foreground. From our head-on \n               angle shooting across the desk we can see the bright metallic \n               glint of Visser's cigarette lighter underneath the dead fish.\n\n               Visser's hands move over the near part of the desk, picking \n               up the money and the 9 x 12 picture envelope.\n\n               EXTREME HIGH SHOT  THE OFFICE\n\n               As Visser turns from the desk and walks across the room out \n               of frame. We hear the back door opening.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         Who looks stupid now.\n\n               The door slams shut.\n\n               The only sound is the whir of the fan. A pause. The camera \n               tracks slowly forward, tilting down to keep Marty and the \n               desktop centered in frame. As the camera moves the noise of \n               the fan grows louder. When Marty's body and the desk are \n               directly beneath us, the blades of the ceiling fan cut across \n               the immediate foreground and effect a:\n\n                                                                   WIPE TO:\n\n               MARTY'S BAR  LATER\n\n               It is completely still. We are looking from the bar, across \n               the dark empty floor, toward the pebbled windows at the front \n               of the building that catch a hard blue light from the \n               streetlamps outside. The jukebox in the middle distance glows \n               in the darkness.\n\n               A pair of headlights catches the pebbled glass and grows \n               brighter as we hear a car pull up to the bar and stop. We \n               hear a car door open and shut, then the sound of feet on \n               gravel. A huge shadow appears on the pebbled glass as the \n               figure crosses in front of the headlights. The man tries the \n               door, finds it locked, and walks back in front of the \n               headlights to cup his hands at a window. He walks back to \n               the door, and a moment later it swings open--framing him in \n               the doorway in silhouette.\n\n               We follow him as he moves across the floor, behind the bar \n               and up to the cash register. He switches on a small \n               fluorescent light clamped to the top of the cash register. \n               It is Ray.\n\n               He punches a key and the register rings open. He lifts up \n               the empty cash drawer and takes some papers from underneath \n               it.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               As he flips through the papers; bills, receipts, no money.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               As he finishes flipping through the papers.\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (muttering)\n                         Damn...\n\n               He slips them back under the cash drawer and slams the \n               register shut. Turning from the register he glances around \n               the bar, the pauses, noticing something.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Light is spilling out from under the door to Marty's office.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               As he starts across the floor to Marty's office.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Marty...\n\n               He reaches the door and knocks sharply. No answer. He turns \n               the knob.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Marty...\n\n               The door is locked. We hear the muffled whir of the ceiling \n               fan inside.\n\n               A pause. Ray withdraws a ring of keys from his pocket and \n               uses one on the door. The door swings open.\n\n               Over his shoulder we see Marty, still at his desk, his back \n               to us. On foot is still propped on the desk.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         What's the matter, you deaf?\n\n               No answer.\n\n               Ray stumbles toward Marty.\n\n               He stumbles slightly and we hear the sharp blast of a gun \n               and the sound of something metallic skating across the floor.\n\n               Ray, startled, steadies himself against the desk, then studies \n               Marty.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               There is a dark pool of blood under Marty's chair.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He looks back up at Marty, then walks behind his chair and \n               throws a wall switch. The room is bathed in light. His eyes \n               still on Marty, Ray crosses behind the desk.\n\n               RAY'S POV  TRACKING SHOT\n\n               The camera moves in a slow arc around the back of Marty's \n               motionless head.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Still moving. He looks away from Marty, scans the floor. He \n               gets down on his hands and knees and peers under the safe.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               There is a glinting silver circle in the darkness under the \n               safe. It is the business end of the revolver that Ray half-\n               stumbled over, half-kicked.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Still on his hands and knees. He reaches in and we hear a \n               rattle as he gropes under the safe. He withdraws the gun, \n               looks at it.\n\n               THE GUN\n\n               It is Abby's revolver.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               For a long moment he doesn't move. Then, slowly, he starts \n               to get up.\n\n               WIDER\n\n               The desk, Marty behind it, Ray straightening behind him. Ray \n               looks from the gun to Marty, slowly sets the gun down on the \n               desk. A pause. He begins to hoist Marty from the chair.\n\n               There is noise from the bar, as of someone entering.\n\n               Ray reacts.\n\n               THE DOOR\n\n               Separating the bar and back office. Ray hurries to it.\n\n                                     MEURICE (O.S.)\n                         Marty?\n\n               Footsteps approach the door.\n\n               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  RAY'S HAND ON THE DOOR BOLT\n\n               He turns it gently. The bolt clicks shut.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Meurice's footsteps draw nearer.\n\n                                     MEURICE (O.S.)\n                         Marty, ya home?\n\n               There is a rap at the door; Ray stands frozen. The doorknob \n               rattles. Ray reaches out compulsively to grab it, but stops \n               himself before actually touching it.\n\n               Now Meurice's footsteps can be heard going casually back \n               into the bar. We hold on Ray's rigidly set face.\n\n                                     MEURICE (O.S.)\n                         What day is it today, Angie?\n\n                                     WOMAN (O.S.)\n                         Tuesday.\n\n                                     MEURICE (O.S.)\n                         Tuesday is ladies' night.\n\n                                     WOMAN (O.S.)\n                         What?\n\n                                     MEURICE (O.S.)\n                         Tuesday night is ladies' night. All \n                         your drinks are free.\n\n               We hear a record drop on the jukebox and a Motown song blares.\n\n               Ray crosses to Marty's chair and takes off his nylon \n               windbreaker. He stoops down and tries to mop up the pool of \n               blood with his windbreaker. This isn't going to work.\n\n               He rises and walks over to the bathroom, the windbreaker \n               dripping blood.\n\n               MARTY'S OFFICE BATHROOM\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  FAUCET\n\n               The song continues faintly in the background. The faucet is \n               turned on and Ray's hand enters frame, holding a dirty white \n               towel under the stream of water.\n\n               BLOOD-SPATTERED FLOOR\n\n               The song continues in the background. Ray's hand enters frame \n               holding the balled-up towel. His windbreaker is wrapped \n               inside. The camera follows as he pushes it across the trail \n               of dripped blood to the pool of blood under Marty's chair.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  MARTY\n\n               He still has not moved. Ray rises into frame and takes him \n               under the armpits. He notices something on the desk in front \n               of him.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  THE GUN ON THE DESK\n\n               Ray's hand enters frame and picks it up.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  MARTY'S COAT POCKET\n\n               Ray's hand enters frame and slips the gun into Marty's pocket. \n               Marty is hoisted up.\n\n               EXT. BACK OF THE BAR / PARKING LOT\n\n               Ray appears in the doorway. The music from the bar, though \n               fainter, can still be heard.\n\n               There are three or four wooden steps going down from the \n               back door to the small gravel parking lot in back. Ray backs \n               down the stairs; Marty's feet THUMP-THUMP-THUMP down the \n               stairs after him.\n\n               The rear door of Ray's car is open. Ray heaves in Marty's \n               torso. Marty's legs rest on the ground outside the car. Ray \n               takes an ankle in each hand and pushes.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               As he shuts the door. He looks up across the parking lot.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               The incinerator belching fire and smoke. We hear its distant \n               roar over the bar song. We hear the car door slam.\n\n               HIGH-ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  TOWARD INCINERATOR\n\n               We are looking down on Ray's car as the camera tracks behind \n               it towards the incinerator. At the cut the roar of the \n               incinerator is suddenly louder. It grows louder still as we \n               approach it.\n\n               Ray's car draws even with the incinerator without slowing or \n               stopping. The wadded-up towel is chucked out of his window \n               into the fire. We hold on the fire as Ray's car rolls on out \n               of frame.\n\n               INT. RAY'S CAR\n\n               As he drives down a deserted country highway. We hear the \n               rhythmic sound of the wheels clomping over asphalt. The radio \n               is broadcasting a fundamentalist's sermon, periodically \n               interrupted by static. Ray is sweating.\n\n                                     EVANGELIST\n                         --so there were three signs, the \n                         second of which is Famine, this famine \n                         which I have already pointed out is \n                         devastatin' Africa and the Indian \n                         subcontinent. And the third of these \n                         signs is earthquakes. Now I don't \n                         know why he threw that in but if you \n                         talk to a geologist, and I've talked \n                         to many, he'll tell you that \n                         earthquake activity--\n\n               Ray twists around and looks in the back seat.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Marty is lying inert.\n\n                                     EVANGELIST\n                         --has increased almost eighty percent \n                         in the past two years, and what's \n                         more, in two years' time we'll be \n                         experiencin' what's knows as the \n                         Jupiter Effect--\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He looks back at the road. A car roars by.\n\n                                     EVANGELIST\n                         --wherein all the planets of the \n                         known universe will be aligned up \n                         causin' an incredible buildup of \n                         destructive gravitational force. Now \n                         in Matthew Chapter Six, Verse Eighteen \n                         the Lord out and tells us that these \n                         are the signs by which we shall know \n                         that He is at our door. There are \n                         many good people disagree with me, \n                         but it's my belief that this \n                         Antichrist is alive today and livin' \n                         somewhere in Europe, in that ten-\n                         nation alliance I spoke of, bein' \n                         groomed for his task--\n\n               Ray switches off the radio.\n\n               We hear the sound of faint, labored breathing.\n\n               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               His jaw tightens. He whips his head toward the back seat. \n               His head snaps forward again and he slams on the brakes.\n\n               The car screeches to a halt.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY\n\n               LONG SHOT  THE CAR\n\n               As Ray's door flies open. He is bolting from the car. The \n               camera, at waist level, tracks toward him as he races out \n               into the field that abuts the highway.\n\n               Fifty yards in he finally stops, panting, framed from a low \n               angle. His breath vaporizes in the crisp night air. We hear \n               only his breath and the chirring of crickets. He is looking \n               back toward the road.\n\n               RAY'S POV  LONG SHOT  THE CAR\n\n               Standing abandoned on the shoulder of the deserted highway. \n               Its headlights cast a lonely beam up the road. No movement.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               His panting slows. He is in a cold sweat. After a long moment, \n               he starts walking slowly, reluctantly, back toward the car.\n\n               RAY'S POV  TRACKING\n\n               Toward the car. Still no sign of movement.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He slows as he draws up to the back of the car. He looks in \n               the back window.\n\n               RAY'S POV  BACK SEAT OF THE CAR\n\n               It is empty.\n\n               The door on the highway side is ajar.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               No reaction.\n\n               He walks around the back of the car onto the highway. He \n               looks up the road.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Marty is crawling up the road on his hands and knees, leaving \n               a trail of blood. The headlights of Ray's car give a \n               fantastically long shadow.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Still no reaction. He gets into the driver's seat and stares \n               through the windshield as he gropes for the ignition key.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Marty, crawling.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He throws the car into drive, looks at his target, thinks--\n               decides. He pulls the key out of the ignition and goes around \n               to the trunk of the car. He opens it and pulls out a shovel.\n\n               MARTY  LOW ANGLE\n\n               From in front. The headlights glare behind him. His breath \n               vaporizes. In the background Ray is walking toward him, \n               dragging the shovel, which scrapes along the asphalt. As Ray \n               moves into the foreground and turns to face Marty only his \n               lower legs and the shovel are in frame.\n\n               The shovel rises out of frame.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               Both hands hold the shovel tensed over his shoulder. He stares \n               down at Marty. A long pause. We hear a distant rumble.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY'S FEET\n\n               Inches away from Marty. Marty's hand slides forward and wraps \n               around one of Ray's ankles.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He shudders. He adjusts his grip on the shovel.\n\n               The rumble grows louder.\n\n               RAY'S FEET\n\n               He jerks his foot away, breaking Marty's grasp.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Looks up from Marty. The rumble grows louder.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Headlight beams, although not yet the headlights themselves, \n               are visible a long way down the road.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Staring down the road. Finally he lowers the shovel, walks \n               back to the car and throws it viciously into the trunk, walks \n               back up into the foreground and stoops down.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  MARTY\n\n               As Ray grabs him under the armpits and starts dragging him \n               back to the car. Just before Ray heaves him into the back \n               seat, Marty coughs weakly. A fine spray of blood comes out \n               with the cough.\n\n               The engine rumble is quite loud now.\n\n               MED SHOT  RAY  FROM ACROSS THE ROOF OF THE CAR\n\n               As he slams the back door shut. He presses himself against \n               the side of the car. Headlights glare over him; the truck \n               roars by just behind him.\n\n               EXT. OPEN FIELD\n\n               FULL SHOT  RAY'S CAR\n\n               Sudden quiet at the cut. We are looking at Ray's car in \n               profile, parked in the middle of a deserted field. From \n               offscreen we hear the sound of a shovel biting into earth.\n\n               We track laterally down the car, along the beam of its \n               headlights, to finally frame Ray as he climbs out of the \n               shallow grave he has just finished digging.\n\n               He plants the shovel and walks back to the car.\n\n               VERY WIDE SHOT\n\n               The grave in the middle background; the car's headlights \n               beyond it.\n\n               Ray is dragging Marty toward the grave. He dumps him in.\n\n               HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE\n\n               As Marty thumps to the bottom, face up.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               As he bends over to pick up the shovel, dripping sweat. We \n               hear the shovel biting into earth.\n\n               HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE\n\n               Ray, in the foreground, pitches the first shovelful of earth \n               onto Marty. Marty moves slightly.\n\n               LOW SHOT  RAY\n\n               As he pauses, looking down into the grave. He stoops down \n               and resumes shoveling, bobbing in and out of frame as he \n               hurls dirt into the grave.\n\n               BACK TO HIGH SHOT\n\n               As Ray shovels, Marty is moving under the loose dirt. A faint, \n               inarticulate noise comes from the grave.\n\n               Almost imperceptibly, Marty's right arm starts to rise.\n\n               LOW SHOT  FROM INSIDE THE GRAVE\n\n               Ray stands on the lip of the grave, hunched over his shovel, \n               crisply illuminated by the headlights. In the shadowy \n               foreground Marty's arm rises, extended toward Ray. He is \n               clutching Abby's gun in his splint-fingered hand.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               As he straightens up and stands motionless, expressionless, \n               watching Marty, making no attempt to get out of the way.\n\n               HIGH SHOT  MARTY\n\n               The gun extended into the foreground. His index finger \n               splinted, he slides his middle finger over the trigger of \n               the gun.\n\n               LOW SHOT  RAY\n\n               Watching.\n\n               HIGH SHOT  MARTY\n\n               The gun trembling in the foreground. His knuckle whitens \n               over the trigger.\n\n               The trigger releases and we hear the dull click of an empty \n               chamber.\n\n               LOW SHOT  RAY\n\n               Staring blankly down at Marty.\n\n               SIDE SHOT\n\n               Of Marty's gun hand as Ray slowly sinks down on the lip of \n               the grave, bracing himself with the shovel. His hand reaches \n               for Marty's. Marty squeezes off two more empty chambers. \n               Ray's hand slowly closes over the barrel of the gun.\n\n               As he pulls, the gun slides from Marty's fingers.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  THE BLADE OF THE SHOVEL\n\n               Biting into the earth.\n\n               MED SHOT  RAY\n\n               Furiously shoveling dirt into the grave.\n\n               HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE\n\n               Marty barely visible under the dirt.\n\n               MED SHOT  RAY\n\n               Shoveling, panting.\n\n               HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE\n\n               Half full.\n\n               MED SHOT  RAY\n\n               Working furiously. His breath comes in short gasps.\n\n               HIGH SHOT  THE GRAVE\n\n               It is filled. Ray is packing down the earth, slamming the \n               shovel furiously against the bare patch of earth.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  THE BLADE OF THE SHOVEL\n\n               Being slammed down against the earth. Again and again.\n\n               EXT. OPEN FIELD  SUNRISE\n\n               The staccato beat of the shovel slamming against earth drops \n               out at the cut. There is perfect quiet. The sun is just \n               peeping over the horizon. In the foreground Ray is sitting \n               in the open door of his car, smoking a cigarette. His gaze \n               is fixed on a spot offscreen.\n\n               HIS POV\n\n               A house. Quite near by.\n\n               The house and its perfect green rectangle of lawn are set \n               incongruously in the middle of the open field.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Staring, without emotion.\n\n               He takes one last, fierce drag on the cigarette, then flicks \n               it away. He takes the shovel, walks over to the grave and \n               stares at it for several seconds, shovel clasped firmly in \n               both hands.\n\n               He walks back to the car.\n\n               HIGH SHOT\n\n               House, car and grave. Ray throws the shovel into the car, \n               gets in, and turns the ignition.\n\n               The engine coughs weakly and dies.\n\n               He tries again. Same result.\n\n               One more time. The engine coughs, sputters, and fires to \n               life. The car runs over the grave and rattles on across the \n               rutted field towards the highway in the distance.\n\n               INT. RAY'S CAR  DAWN\n\n               As Ray drives down the straight empty highway in the flat \n               early-morning light.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               Pale and unblinking.\n\n               RAY'S POV  THE HIGHWAY\n\n               In the distance we see a beat-up white station wagon \n               approaching. It's headlights wink on, then off again.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He squints at the approaching car.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               The car is closer. It's headlights wink again.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               His jaw tightens. He stares intently at the car. Then, \n               abruptly, he looks down at his dashboard.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  HEADLIGHT KNOB ON THE DASHBOARD\n\n               His headlights are on. Ray's hand enters frame and pushes in \n               the knob.\n\n               SIDE ANGLE  RAY\n\n               Watching the approaching station wagon. As it passes we catch \n               a glimpse of its occupant. He grins and cocks a you-got-it \n               finger at Ray before roaring out of frame.\n\n               EXT. DESERTED GAS STATION\n\n               HIGH ANGLE\n\n               The station hasn't opened yet. Ray's car, empty, stands alone \n               in the lot. Flat prairie stretches to the horizon. No movement \n               in the frame.\n\n               At the cut we hear the faint sound of a phone ringing through \n               a receiver. After four or five rings the phone is picked up \n               and we begin a slow crane down.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                              (through phone; \n                              sleepily)\n                         Hello?\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (present; very hoarsely)\n                         Abby... you all right?\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Ray?...

I better get off now.\n\n               The continuing crane down reveals Ray in a phone booth in \n               the foreground.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Okay, see ya...

ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               Her sleeping head on a pillow. Offscreen we hear a door open \n               and shut. A moment later Ray's dirt-caked hand comes into \n               frame and gently brushes a wisp of hair back for Abby's face. \n               We hear Ray walk across the apartment and a moment later the \n               sound of water running.\n\n               Abby stirs. She looks offscreen.\n\n               LONG SHOT  RAY\n\n               Standing in the doorway to the bathroom. He is wiping his \n               hands on a towel.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                              (sleepily)\n                         ...Ray?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         You're bad.\n\n               Still half asleep, Abby smiles.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...What?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I said you're bad.\n\n               There is a long pause.

He leans back and props his legs up on \n               the table. He is staring across the room at Abby.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         We're both bad.\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n               BLACK\n\n               As we hear the click of a pull-string the camera is dropping: \n               down past an orange safe light, down the length of the string, \n               down to a metal darkroom tray where two short strips of \n               negative are burning.\n\n               Visser's hand and yellow sleeve cuff (now orange) enter frame, \n               with an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph. The photograph is \n               dropped into the tray. As it burns we see that it is the \n               same picture of Abby's and Ray's \"corpses\" as Visser showed \n               Marty, except that in this print the bullet holes and blood \n               are less convincingly brushed in.\n\n               Another print is dropped into the tray and ignites. In this \n               one we see bullet holes but no blood.\n\n               A third print is dropped in and ignites. It is the original \n               undoctored shot of Abby and Ray asleep in bed.\n\n               Visser's hands enter frame holding the picture-envelope that \n               he took away from Marty's office. Visser rips it in half and \n               is about to drop it into the tray, but stops abruptly.\n\n               There is posterboard, not a photograph, peeking out of the \n               torn envelope.\n\n               Visser's hands pull the two halves of the placard from the \n               envelope and fit them together. The stenciled 8 x 10 placard \n               says: \"All Employees Must Wash Hands Before Resuming Work.\"\n\n               LOW-ANGLE CLOSE SHOT  VISSER\n\n               Staring at the placard in disbelief.\n\n               After a moment his hand rises into frame to deposit a \n               cigarette in his mouth. His hand drops back down, groping in \n               a pocket.\n\n               His hand jumps back into frame, empty; he thumps at his breast \n               pockets; he can't find his lighter.\n\n               He wheels and exits frame. The light snaps off. A door slams \n               shut.\n\n               ABBY'S APARTMENT  DAY\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               He has dozed off in his chair.

Staring at her he slowly rises to \n               his feet and then remains still.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         I...

He is \n               perfectly still. For a long time he can't speak.\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (quietly)\n                         ...Don't lie to me, Abby--\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Still worked up.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         How can I be lying if I don't even \n                         know--\n\n               The ring of the telephone cuts her off. She looks at the \n               phone, pauses for a moment, then continues, struggling.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...I mean if you and him had a fight \n                         or something, I don't care, as long \n                         as you...\n\n               Her voice trails off.\n\n               The telephone won't stop ringing. Abby and Ray are staring \n               at each other, seemingly oblivious to it. Finally:\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...Pick it up.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  TELEPHONE\n\n               Still ringing.

Abby shifts the phone to her other ear, listening hard. \n               It is the same sound we heard earlier when she picked up the \n               phone at Ray's house.\n\n               As before, the line clicks dead.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                              (looking at Ray)\n                         ...Welp, that was him.\n\n               There is a long moment of silence. Then Ray's voice comes \n               from across the room:\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...Who?\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Marty.\n\n               There is silence again.\n\n               LONG SHOT  THE APARTMENT\n\n               Ray shifts in front of the window. He laughs humorlessly. \n               The laugh stops abruptly.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...What's going on with you two?\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (quietly)\n                         All right...\n\n               He starts across the room.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...You can call him back, whoever it \n                         was...\n\n               He is heading for the door.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...I'll get out of your way.\n\n               He pauses at the foyer and pulls Abby's gun out of his pocket. \n               He sets it on a shelf by the door.\n\n               ABBY\n\n               Watching.

We tilt down from the \n               ceiling to reveal that we are in the living room of Ray's \n               bungalow.\n\n               In the foreground Visser sits in a chair with the cradled \n               telephone in his lap, facing the front door, which stands \n               open in the background. The contents of Abby's tote bag lie \n               strewn on the bureau next to Visser. Her purse is not there. \n               After a moment Visser rouses himself and starts to sweep the \n               articles back into the tote bag.\n\n               INT. MEURICE'S APARTMENT  DAY\n\n               LOW WIDE SHOT  LIVING ROOM\n\n               It is dark, lit only by the morning light leaking in around \n               the drawn blinds. It is a small modern apartment such as one \n               sees in large apartment complexes--shag carpeting, built-in \n               bar. In the extreme foreground the small red \"Power\" light \n               of a telephone answering machine glows in the darkness.\n\n               The front door opens in the background, spilling bright \n               sunlight. Meurice stoops down, picks up two newspapers, \n               enters, and shuts the door. He walks toward the camera and \n               his hand enters frame in extreme foreground to punch the \n               rewind button on the machine. His hand leaves frame. A few \n               pieces of mail are flipped down onto the machine table, piece \n               by piece, as the machine rewinds. He reaches down again and \n               hits playback. After a beep:\n\n                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n                         Hi Meurice, this is Helene, Helene \n                         Trend, and I'm calling 'cause I wanna \n                         know just what the hell that remark \n                         you made about Sylvia's supposed to \n                         mean...\n\n               Mail continues to flip down onto the table, piece by piece.\n\n                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n                         ...She says you're full of shit and \n                         frankly I believe her.

When he raises it the fingertip is red--the \n               seat still wet with blood.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               Looking down at the seat. He backs out of the car and walks \n               up the driveway to his house.\n\n               INT. RAY'S LIVING ROOM\n\n               As he comes through the screen door. It bangs shut behind \n               him. As he crosses the living room we see, and he hears, \n               Meurice's Trans Am pulling up and stopping at the foot of \n               the lawn. Ray turns and looks out the window.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  CLOSET DOOR\n\n               Ray throws it open and hurriedly pulls out the first thing \n               at hand--a sheet. We hear the door of the Trans Am open and \n               slam shut.\n\n               EXT. RAY'S BUNGALOW\n\n               TRACKING SHOT  ON RAY\n\n               Exiting the house as the screen door bangs and shudders behind \n               him. He hurries down the walk.\n\n               TRACKING SHOT  RAY'S POV\n\n               Meurice is rounding the bottom of the lawn and starting up \n               the drive toward the incriminating car. Its back door is \n               standing ajar.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         I hope you're planning on leaving \n                         town.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Reacting to the line as he reaches the car.

His right hand rises into frame to deposit \n               another unlit cigarette in his mouth. Offscreen, Meurice \n               calls from the end of the drive:\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         I'm not laughing at this, Ray Bob, \n                         so you know it's no fucking joke.\n\n               We hear his car door slam. After a moment Ray exits frame, \n               heading for the house. The camera tracks slowly in to the \n               back window of the car.\n\n               Traces of blood are starting to seep up from the upholstery \n               into the sheet.\n\n               INT. MARTY'S HOUSE  DAY\n\n               LOW WIDE SHOT  FRONT FOYER\n\n               We are looking across the tiled floor toward the front \n               doorway. The room has the dim gray cast of daytime inside a \n               shuttered house. We hold on the empty foyer as we hear an \n               intermittent high whining sound. We hear the padding of feet \n               on carpet, and then the clatter of nails on tile as Opal, \n               Marty's German shepherd, trots into frame and circles the \n               foyer, still whining. She jumps up and scratches desperately \n               at the front door.\n\n               A slow, rhythmic pounding is very faint on the track.\n\n               EXT. MARTY'S BAR  DUSK\n\n               Abby has just gotten out of her car and is walking up to the \n               front of the darkened bar. The faint, rhythmic thumping \n               continues over the cut, its source somewhere offscreen. As \n               Abby takes a key out of her purse and lets herself into the \n               bar, the thumping stops.\n\n               INT. MARTY'S BAR\n\n               Abby switches on the lights, looks around, goes to the back-\n               office door. Locked. As she fits her key into the lock:\n\n                                     ABBY\n                              (quietly)\n                         Marty?\n\n               The door swings open, fanning a shaft of light onto the \n               darkened room.\n\n               MARTY'S OFFICE BATHROOM\n\n               We are looking from the inside at the bathroom door that \n               won't close all the way. As the light fans into the office \n               beyond and seeps in through the crack of the bathroom door, \n               we see Visser's sleeve cuff and his hand pressing against \n               the door, to hold it near-shut.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Standing in the office doorway. We pull her into the room. \n               She stops abruptly, looking past the camera, and wrinkles \n               her nose.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Marty's fish, now half-decayed, still lie on the desk.\n\n               Some of the desk drawers stand open, with some of their \n               contents strewn across the surface of the desk.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               She takes a step forward. We hear the crunch of glass \n               underfoot. She looks down at the floor.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Shards of broken glass lie on the floor.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               She looks up from the floor toward the back door.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               The pane of the back-door window closest to the knob has \n               been shattered from the outside, scattering broken glass \n               into the office.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               She crosses slowly to the desk, staring at the rotted fish. \n               She looks up from the desk.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               On the standing safe behind the desk lies a white towel. \n               Abby's hand enters frame ans picks up the towel.\n\n               In slow motion a hammer that's been wrapped inside slips out \n               of the towel, falls end-over-end, hits the floor with a dull \n               thud.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Stooping down to pick up the hammer. At eye level as she \n               stoops down is the combination dial to the safe. The dial \n               has been battered by the hammer. Abby looks from the hammer \n               to the floor under the desk chair.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Blood stains.\n\n               ABBY\n\n               Staring down at the floor. She rises and looks at the desk. \n               As she rises we hear glass under her feet.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               The dead fish. Beyond them, on the floor around the desk, \n               broken glass.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Staring.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               The dead fish.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               She seems to be falling slowly backwards. The camera falls \n               with her, keeping her in close shot. Her head hits a pillow. \n               We pull back slowly to reveal that she is lying on the bed \n               in her apartment, staring across the room. She lies motionless \n               on the bad, her eyes wide.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Across the darkened apartment we see the curtainless windows, \n               and beyond them, across the lamplit street, the facade of \n               the opposite building.\n\n               LONG SHOT  ABBY\n\n               Lying still. After a moment she gets out of bed, crosses to \n               the front door of the apartment, locks it, then walks \n               unsteadily back to the bed.\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               SAME LONG SHOT  ABBY IN BED\n\n               She opens her eyes, lies still for a moment, coughs. She \n               gets out of bed and walks across the still dark apartment to \n               the bathroom. She shuts the bathroom door.\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               Abby looks at herself in the mirror above the sink, then \n               turns on the tap water. From a neighboring apartment we hear \n               a dull rhythmic thumping on the wall. She pauses, listens \n               for a moment, then starts to splash water on her face.\n\n               From somewhere offscreen we hear the sharp sound of glass \n               shattering. It reverberates for a moment, then dies. Abby \n               looks up at the bathroom door. We hear a scraping at the \n               lock of her apartment door. Abby listens.\n\n               Suddenly we hear the lock springing open, and the front door \n               swinging on its hinges.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               Startled. She shuts off the water and stands motionless. \n               Droplets of water are streaming down her face.\n\n               We hear the sound of footsteps in the next room, crunching \n               across broken glass.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Ray...?\n\n               There is no answer. After a moment we hear bedsprings creak \n               in the next room. Abby opens the bathroom door and walks \n               out.\n\n               MAIN ROOM\n\n               A shaft of light slices across the floor from the open \n               bathroom door. Broken glass glints on the floor. In the semi-\n               darkness we can see that someone is sitting on the bed. The \n               person looks up.\n\n               It is Marty.\n\n               Abby recoils.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Lover-boy oughta lock his door.\n\n               Abby looks nervously at Marty. Droplets of water are still \n               running down her face. She brushes one from her eye.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I love you...\n\n               He smiles thinly.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...That's a stupid thing to say, \n                         right?\n\n               Abby takes a step back.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         I... I love you too.\n\n               Still smiling, Marty shakes his head.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         No. You're just saying that because \n                         you're scared...\n\n               He stands. We hear glass under his feet. He unbuttons the \n               middle button of his coat and reaches inside.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...You left your weapon behind.\n\n               He withdraws something from an inside pocket and tosses it \n               to her.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY'S HANDS\n\n               As she catches the object. It is her compact.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               She looks from her hands up to Marty.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         He'll kill you too.\n\n               Marty gags, leans forward, doubles over to vomit--blood.\n\n               The blood washes over the floor at his feet.\n\n               ABBY\n\n               Bolts upright in bead with a muffled groan. Sweat pours down \n               her face. She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye and looks \n               around.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Moonlight glints through the windows across the hardwood \n               floor. Through the windows we can see the facade of the \n               opposite building. The apartment is dark and still, just as \n               we left it before she fell asleep.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               She slumps back onto the bed. One hand gropes down out of \n               frame and comes up holding an illuminated alarm clock. She \n               looks at it, drops it back to the floor.\n\n               She turns on her side and stares across the room toward the \n               window.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               The window.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:\n\n               SAME WINDOW  SAME ANGLE  PRE-DAWN\n\n               It is still not quite light. The few lights that shined in \n               the windows of the opposite building before are now off; the \n               facade of the building is a flat, undetailed gray.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               Still lying on her side on the bed, her eyes open, staring \n               at the window.\n\n               BACK TO LONG SHOT  WINDOW\n\n               After a moment Abby enters frame. She picks her coat off a \n               chair and puts it on.\n\n               We hear a car door slam.\n\n               EXT. RAY'S BUNGALOW  PRE-DAWN\n\n               Abby has just gotten out of her car in the foreground and is \n               crossing the lawn to the house. Down the road the street \n               lights are still on. One light burns in the house, in the \n               window of Ray's bedroom. Abby approaches it.\n\n               THROUGH THE WINDOW\n\n               Over Abby's shoulder, as she leans against the sill of the \n               open window and looks inside.\n\n               Ray sits on the bed in the empty room, smoking a cigarette, \n               his profile to the window, gazing fixedly at the wall.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Ray.\n\n               Ray starts and looks toward the window, squinting.\n\n               INT.

All personal effects \n               have been removed.\n\n               Abby looks around, bewildered, as Ray enters from the hallway.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...Where is everything?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         In the trunk.\n\n               Abby, still standing in front of the door, looks at him \n               uncomprehendingly. Ray walks over to a couple of cardboard \n               boxes stacked in the corner.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...In the car.\n\n               He ties a knot around the top carton with a piece of cord, \n               then cuts the cord with a collapsible fishing knife.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...You leaving?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Isn't that what you want?\n\n               She slowly shakes her head.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Wanna come with me?\n\n               He leans back against the boxes, watching her.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...But first I gotta know what \n                         happened.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         What do you want to know?\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         You broke into the bar. You wanted \n                         to get your money. You and Marty had \n                         a fight. Something happened...\n\n               Ray shakes his head, smiling. Abby squints at him, looking \n               for help.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe \n                         a burglar broke in, and you found--\n\n                                     RAY\n                         With your gun?...\n\n               He puts the knife in his pocket and walks over to the door. \n               As he approaches her:\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...Nobody broke in, Abby. I'll tell \n                         you the truth...\n\n               Ray faces Abby in front of the door.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...Truth is, I've felt sick the last \n                         couple of days.

Ray's hand gropes for the cross-\n               slat on the screen door. Finally:\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...The truth is... he was alive when \n                         I buried him.\n\n               Abby stares.\n\n               An object materializes in the sky beyond them. It is flipping \n               end-over-end in slow motion, moving toward Abby and Ray and \n               the screen door. Abby and Ray, each staring at the other, \n               fail to notice until--\n\n               THWACK--it bounces off the screen.\n\n               Abby starts; Ray doesn't.\n\n               The spell is broken, Abby pushes hesitantly at the screen \n               door. Ray's hand slides off the cross-slat; he makes no move \n               to stop her.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  THE FRONT STOOP\n\n               As Abby steps over the rolled-up newspaper that hit the screen \n               door.\n\n               TRACKING SHOT  ON ABBY\n\n               Hurrying down the driveway to get to her car. A low rumble \n               is building on the soundtrack. Abby glances at Ray's car as \n               she passes it.\n\n               ABBY'S POV  TRACKING FORWARD  THE CAR\n\n               More blood has seeped into and dried on the dropsheet covering \n               the back seat. The bass rumble grows louder, punctuated by a \n               rhythmic thumping.\n\n               EXT. MEURICE'S APARTMENT  DAY\n\n               OVER ABBY'S SHOULDER\n\n               As she pounds frantically on the door--the sound continuing \n               over the cut. After a moment the door edges open.\n\n               Meurice is standing in the doorway in a long bathrobe. A \n               sleeper's blindfold is pushed up over his forehead.\n\n                                     MEURICE\n                         Abby.

We hear engine rumble. Abby twists \n               her head back, following Meurice. As we hear the table lamp \n               being switched off we:\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY  NIGHT\n\n               POV FROM A CAR\n\n               The engine rumble continues over the cut. There is no other \n               traffic on the highway. A light fog covers the road. A green \n               highway sign says: \"San Antonio 73 mi.\" We hear a car radio \n               playing softly.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               Driving. He is gently lit by the light from the dashboard. \n               He reaches forward to turn off the radio. The only sound now \n               is the hum of the engine and the rhythmic clomping of tires \n               on pavement. The look and sound of the scene are close to \n               those of the first scene of the movie.\n\n               Ray takes a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his \n               mouth, but leaves it unlit.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               The headlights of an approaching car materialize in the fog. \n               The car passes with a roar.\n\n               Up ahead a traffic light is turning amber.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               The engine hum drops as he slows. We hear the low engine \n               rumble and the squeaking brakes of another car. Ray is now \n               stopped in front of the deserted intersection. He looks up \n               in his rearview mirror.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Another car is stopped just behind him, the fog floating up \n               past its headlights. The headlights halate in the fog; none \n               of the rest of the car is visible.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               The unlit cigarette still in his mouth. He looks down from \n               the rearview mirror to the intersection ahead of him. There \n               is a long pause, during which we hear only the steady purr \n               of Ray's car and the knocking rumble of the car behind him.\n\n               Ray looks up at the traffic light.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               The light is just turning from red to green.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY'S FOOT ON BRAKE\n\n               He takes his foot off the brake, hesitates for a moment, the \n               replaces it on the brake.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               He looks up in his rearview mirror.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               The headlights of the other car remain motionless behind \n               him. The car makes no move to pass.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               He slowly takes the cigarette from his mouth and drops it \n               onto the seat next to him. His eyes shift from the rearview \n               mirror to the traffic light.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               Green fog floats past the green light.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               His face frozen. He turns slowly to look behind.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               The other car is still motionless. We hear the muted rumble \n               of its engine.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               His eyes shift back to the mirror. He gropes for his window \n               handle and slowly rolls it down. He sticks out his left arm, \n               eyes still on the rearview mirror, and waves for the other \n               car to go around him.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               The other car remains still for a moment. White fog floats \n               up beyond the red fog created by Ray's brake lights.\n\n               Finally the car pulls out slowly to the left to pass.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Watching the car pass.\n\n               RAY'S POV\n\n               As the car pulls out into the light from the intersection \n               and Ray's headlights, we see that it is a battered green \n               Volkswagon. First the car itself, and then its red tail \n               lights, disappear into the fog.\n\n               BACK TO RAY\n\n               Watching, for a long moment.\n\n               Finally he takes his foot off the brake, turns the steering \n               wheel hard left and hangs a U-turn.\n\n               MARTY'S LIVING ROOM  WIDE\n\n               A light is switched on in the expensively appointed room. \n               Meurice enters, walking silently on the carpet, looking around \n               the room. He throws the light off at the far end and leaves.\n\n               MARTY'S BEDROOM  WIDE\n\n               The door swings open.  Meurice throws the switch near the \n               door and the room is bathed in light. We are once again in \n               the bedroom where we earlier saw Abby looking through her \n               purses.\n\n               We start to hear the faint buzzing of a fly.\n\n               Meurice glances around, throws off the light, and shuts the \n               door. Black.\n\n               MARTY'S OFFICE\n\n               Somewhere offscreen a light is switched on and we are looking \n               in close shot at the dead fish.\n\n               The sound of the fly is louder with the cut.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               Standing in the doorway from the bar, staring down at the \n               fish.\n\n               WIDE SHOT  THE OFFICE\n\n               Ray glances around at the broken glass lying on the floor. \n               His gaze shifts to the safe and the hammer in front of it. \n               He walks over to the safe and stoops down.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY AT SAFE\n\n               He works its battered dial and it swings open.

For a moment he stares \n               down at it, then wheels abruptly and leaves frame.\n\n               INT. RAY'S CAR\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  RAY\n\n               Driving.

The white \n               room is bathed in bright, shadowless light. As Meurice steps \n               into the kitchen his foot strikes something on the floor \n               below frame, which clatters hollowly away.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  PLASTIC DOG-FOOD BOWL\n\n               The empty bowl skids into a wall, bounces back, and wobbles, \n               spinning on its bottom rim.\n\n               MARTY'S BILLIARD ROOM\n\n               DUTCH-TILT\n\n               TRACKING SHOT  TOWARD MOUNTED MOOSE HEAD\n\n               On a low skewed axis the camera is tracking in toward the \n               impassive trophy head on Marty's billiard-room wall.\n\n               The moose still has Ray's cigarette protruding from its mouth.\n\n               REVERSE TRACKING SHOT  MEURICE\n\n               As he walks toward the moose, head cocked to one side, \n               frowning quizzically up.\n\n               He hears something, and looks through the door to his left.\n\n               MEURICE'S POV\n\n               The long shadowy hall.

Through the \n               window we see the facade of the building across the street. \n               Abby enters frame in the foreground, in silhouette against \n               the window, and throws an overhead light switch. The bright \n               light reveals Ray standing by the window, looking out.\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (abruptly)\n                         Turn it off.\n\n               Abby jumps, startled.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Ray...\n\n               EXT. ROOF OF FACING APARTMENT BUILDING\n\n               From the roof of the building across the street we are looking \n               down on the facade of Abby's building. Most of its windows \n               are dark, but in a brightly lit fourth-floor window we can \n               clearly see Abby and Ray.\n\n               A man is on the roof in the foreground, hitching a rifle to \n               his shoulder.\n\n               INT.

He can see in.\n\n               EXT. FACING ROOF\n\n               Ray and Abby are once again clearly visible. Ray is starting \n               across the room.\n\n               INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               Abby takes a fearful step back as Ray strides toward the \n               light switch, next to her.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                              (abruptly)\n                         --If you do anything the neighbors'll \n                         hear.\n\n               This brings Ray up short.

It registers \n               that it is him she's afraid of.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         You think...\n\n               He shakes his head.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         ...Abby. I meant it... when I \n                         called...\n\n               Abby takes another step back.

The gun shot hits Ray in the back, \n               knocking him to the floor. He lies still.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               She stares dumbly down at Ray. She looks slowly up to the \n               window.\n\n               THE WINDOW\n\n               It has a gaping black hole. The sound of shattering glass \n               still reverberates in the apartment. Small shards of glass \n               chink down from the window and shatter on the floor.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Staring at the window, paralyzed--almost in a trance. Quiet \n               except for the chinking of glass.\n\n               EXT. FACING ROOF\n\n               We are looking through the telescopic sight of a high-powered \n               rifle. The rifle sweeps up from Ray's body across the brightly \n               lit room, and centers Abby, still staring at the window, in \n               the cross hairs.\n\n               INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               We are looking past Abby toward the shattered window at the \n               far end of the room. A brass lamp stands in the foreground, \n               between Abby and the camera. Abby still stands paralyzed.\n\n               Glass has stopped chinking from the window to the floor; \n               there is a painful silence.\n\n               Suddenly Abby dives to the floor just as CRASH the rest of \n               the window falls away and PING the brass lamp somersaults \n               toward us from the impact of the bullet.\n\n               The window is now completely gone--just a black hole in the \n               brightly lit wall.\n\n               ABBY\n\n               Scrambles into a corner at the window end of the room. The \n               only sound is her heavy breathing. She looks over at Ray, \n               then up at the bulb on the ceiling.\n\n               ABBY'S POV  CEILING BULB\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Breathing heavily, almost hysterical.

She throws \n               it at the ceiling bulb.\n\n               We hear the bulb shatter and the room goes black.\n\n               Abby rises and makes her way cautiously across the glass-\n               littered floor toward Ray. She stoops over him.\n\n               LOW SHOT  THE DARK APARTMENT\n\n               Its front door in background. Abby rises into frame and backs \n               toward the doorway, staring down at the floor. One of her \n               hands is covered with blood.\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         Ray--\n\n               She winces and almost loses her balance as we hear a piece \n               of glass crunching under her bare floor. She turns and moves \n               to the front door, favoring one foot, and throws the door \n               open.\n\n               HALLWAY\n\n               Abby lurches from her apartment and pounds on the neighboring \n               door.

The \n               heel of her shod foot is throwing her weight onto her bad \n               foot; she kicks off the shoe.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               As she reaches the top of the stairs. She takes one step \n               down, then brings herself up short. She looks over the railing \n               down the stairwell. It is quiet. An innocent-sounding cough \n               echoes somewhere in the building.\n\n               We hear the sound of footsteps from somewhere below.\n\n               Abby turns and hobbles back to her apartment. The bareness \n               of the hallway sets off her abandoned shoe.\n\n               ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               As she enters and slams the door behind her. She scrabbles \n               at the lock, finally manages to get it shut, then turns and \n               looks frantically around.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Ray is lying still in the darkness.\n\n               We can hear footsteps approaching up the hallway.\n\n               Abby enters frame and kneels down next to Ray. She fumbles \n               around him briefly in the darkness.\n\n               The doorknob rattles. Abby freezes, listening, trying to \n               control her breath. After a moment we hear a scraping at the \n               lock.\n\n               Abby moves to the bathroom adjoining the main room and shuts \n               the door behind her.\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               It is very small. Abby presses her palms against the door \n               and slowly eases her ear against the door to listen. The \n               scraping in the apartment door lock continues. Sweat streams \n               down Abby's face. She brushes a drop from her eye.\n\n               We hear the snap of the lock springing open, and the front \n               door swinging on its hinges.\n\n               CLOSER ON ABBY\n\n               Her ear pressed to the door. From the next room we hear the \n               sound of footsteps crunching across broken glass.\n\n               Abby backs away from the door, stares at it, then turns and \n               moves to the bathroom window. She looks out.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               A sheer drop to the narrow backyard of the building four \n               stories below. Next to Abby's window is another window, \n               separated from hers only by the breadth of the wall, that \n               separates the two apartments.\n\n               ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               Visser hunches, hands on knees, over Ray, who lies on the \n               floor out of frame.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                              (grimly)\n                         All right...\n\n               He hunkers down closer to Ray.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...You got some of my personal \n                         property.\n\n               He is rummaging through Ray's pockets but comes up empty-\n               handed.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...One of you does.\n\n               Visser looks down at Ray, glances around the room, looks \n               back down at Ray.\n\n                                     VISSER\n                         ...I don't know what the hell you \n                         two thought you were gonna pull.\n\n               His hand, gripping something, flashes down out of frame. We \n               hear a dull crunch.\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               Abby has drawn her head back from the bathroom window. She \n               moves back to the door and braces herself against it.\n\n               ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               Visser straightens up from Ray's body. He drops something to \n               the floor, out of frame, that lands with a thud.\n\n               He goes over to the light switch on the wall and flips it \n               back and forth. No light.\n\n               He goes over to the brass lamp, sets it upright, tries its \n               switch. Again nothing.\n\n               He disappears into the kitchenette as we hold on its open \n               doorway. After a moment we hear a refrigerator hum as a cold \n               blue light plays in the doorway. There is the rattle of a \n               can being pulled off the refrigerator rack, and the snap of \n               its pull-tab being opened. After a couple of audible slurps \n               we hear the can go back on the rack and, as the blue light \n               disappears, we hear the refrigerator door close.\n\n               Visser reappears in the doorway. He surveys the room, fixes \n               on the bathroom door, goes over, turns the knob. The door \n               swings open.\n\n               He walks in.\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               Visser looks around the cramped space. The shower curtain is \n               drawn. He casually draws it back. The shower is empty.\n\n               He goes to the window and leans out.\n\n               VISSER'S POV\n\n               The sheer drop below; the other window to one side.\n\n               BACK TO VISSER\n\n               He draws his head back in, presses his palms against the \n               adjacent wall, and eases his ear to the wall to listen.\n\n               Perfect quiet.\n\n               After a moment he goes back to the window, braces himself \n               against the sash, and sticks his arm out--groping for the \n               window of the adjacent apartment.\n\n               EXT. ABBY'S BUILDING / BATHROOM WINDOW\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S FACE\n\n               Pressing against the glass as he leans against the upper \n               half of the bathroom window.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S HAND\n\n               It finds the adjacent window and starts to raise it.\n\n               BACK TO VISSER'S FACE\n\n               Again we see him through the window. His jaw is set as he \n               gropes offscreen.\n\n               Suddenly his body jerks violently forward, his head smacking \n               against the glass and cracking it.\n\n                                                              QUICK CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

His hand is nailed into the \n               apartment next door. He is in pain.\n\n               ADJACENT APARTMENT\n\n               Abby back slowly from the window, staring at the hand. From \n               the ground below we hear the faint and echoing sounds of the \n               shards of glass shattering against pavement.\n\n               ABBY'S POV  THE WINDOW\n\n               Visser's pinned hand is writhing.\n\n               As we hear a muffled CRACK, a circle of light opens with a \n               puff of plaster dust in the wall that separates the two \n               apartments. A line of light shoots across the dark apartment \n               from the bright bathroom next door.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Staring at the wall. We hear a second CRACK.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               A second hole has opened in the wall, letting through a second \n               shaft of light.\n\n               Four more sharp reports in rapid succession: With each gun \n               blast a bright circle opens and a new shaft of light \n               penetrates the dark apartment.\n\n               Finally we hear the CLICK of an empty chamber, and the clatter \n               of the empty gun being dropped to the floor of the bathroom \n               next door.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               Staring at the lines of light that crisscross the apartment.\n\n               There is a long moment of silence, then a sudden THUMP.\n\n               ABBY'S POV  THE WALL\n\n               Six circles of light.\n\n               The circles go black momentarily as there is another THUMP. \n               And another. Each time Visser pounds his fist against the \n               wall, there is a muffled THUMP and his swinging arm strobes \n               the bullet holes.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               She turns and hobbles toward the door of apartment. The \n               muffled thumping continues, as in her dream.\n\n               HALLWAY\n\n               As Abby emerges from the adjacent apartment. She stops and \n               looks down the hall.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               The stairway is at the far end of the hall. The door of her \n               own darkened apartment stands slightly ajar.\n\n               ADJACENT APARTMENT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  THE WALL\n\n               The bullet holes strobing. The pounding, more purposeful \n               now, grows louder and more intense.\n\n               Finally, with a crash, Visser's fist penetrates the wall in \n               an explosion of light and dust.\n\n               HALLWAY\n\n               We pull Abby as she limps hesitantly down the hall.\n\n               ADJACENT APARTMENT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S HAND\n\n               Waving aimlessly through the ambient dust. He is blindly \n               groping for the sill--and the knife that pins his other hand.\n\n               His outstretched middle finger just grazes the handle of the \n               knife.\n\n               ABBY'S HALLWAY / APARTMENT\n\n               Pulling Abby as she draws even with the door of her apartment.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Her pearl-handled revolver sits on the shelf just inside the \n               door, where Ray left it. It catches the light from the hall.\n\n               ADJACENT APARTMENT\n\n               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S FINGERTIPS\n\n               The side of his middle finger rubs against the knife handle; \n               the tip of his index finger barely touches it. Visser's \n               fingers are trembling, indicating that his arm is stretched \n               to its uttermost.\n\n               A surge against the wall gives his fingers another inch or \n               so and they curl around the handle of the knife.\n\n               ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               As she steps in from the hallway to pick up the gun. She \n               looks around the apartment.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               The window of the apartment, its glass now completely gone, \n               lets in streetlight. Ray's corpse is a dark form in the middle \n               of the floor. A bright shaft of light slices across the room \n               from offscreen. It glints on the shards of glass that litter \n               the floor, just as in Abby's dream.\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER\n\n               As he slowly, quietly draws his hand in from the hole in the \n               wall. He is holding the knife.\n\n               He turns slowly to face the door, listening.\n\n               ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               She steadies herself against the wall and turns to look toward \n               the bathroom.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               The bathroom door stands slightly ajar. The interior of the \n               bathroom is a bright band in the shadowy recesses of the \n               back of the apartment.\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER\n\n               Moving quietly toward the door.\n\n               ABBY'S APARTMENT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY\n\n               Staring, almost transfixed, at the bathroom door. She raises \n               the gun, trembling, and trains it on the band of light.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               Visser's shadow falls across the crack in the doorway.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               She shifts the gun slightly and fires.\n\n               ABBY'S POV\n\n               With the roar of the gun, a small circle of light opens in \n               the door. As the door waffles under the impact, we hear Visser \n               collapsing behind it.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Leaning against the facing wall. She lowers the gun. She \n               slides down the wall to finally rest seated on the floor. \n               She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye.\n\n               HER POV\n\n               The cracked bathroom door spilling light.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               A pause. After a moment, her voice comes out half-choked:\n\n                                     ABBY\n                         ...I ain't afraid of you, Marty.\n\n               HER POV\n\n               The bathroom door. Quiet for a long moment.\n\n               Then, from inside the bathroom, we hear laughter.\n\n               BACK TO ABBY\n\n               Staring at the door. We hear the laughter subside, to leave \n               the sound of labored breathing.
