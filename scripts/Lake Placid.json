BLACK LAKE - NIGHT\n\n     The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts\n     off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  The loon\n     continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake,\n     the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely\n     call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,\n     silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as:\n\n     Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing \"I CAN\n     SEE CLEARLY NOW.\" Then--\n\n     OVER BLACK\n\n                         KEOUGH (O.S.)\n               And they pay you for this?

Whether it's algae or\n     dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky.\n\n\n     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Keough unwraps the second Twinkie.\n\n\n     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Walt continues to swim.\n\n     HIS P.O.V.\n\n     Not much to look at.  Then suddenly... no, just a snapping\n     turtle swimming away.  Walt descends a little deeper.  He loves\n     it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere\n     else.  Next best thing to meditation.  Suddenly, he stops\n     kicking.\n\n     HIS EYES FOCUS\n\n     A black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length.\n\n     RESUME\n\n     Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake\n     seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,\n     misses.  Shit.  Walt's look says \"what the fuck?\"  A beat.  Then\n     the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he\n     looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down\n     there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not\n     alone, we can feel he's not alone.\n\n     He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,\n     looking back at him.  What's with these snakes?  Walt decides\n     he'll go back to the boat.  Then... BOOM.  Something hits him...\n     and it's no snake.\n\n\n     EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Keough.  Oblivious.  Waiting.

He swims frantically for a beat\n     before he's suddenly yanked under again.  Then he surfaces,\n     thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat.  He takes hold of\n     him and pulls him on board.  Actually... what's left of him.\n     There's nothing below the waist.  Walt is just a bleeding torso,\n     though still conscious.\n\n                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)\n                    (going into shock)\n               Jesus Christ.\n\n     ANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND\n\n     clenching around Keough's arm.\n\n     ANGLE WALT'S FACE\n\n     He knows he's done.

Her scream is only\n     partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.\n\n     After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.

LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT\n\n     The teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol'\n     flirtatious time.  As they splash and frolic and cop their\n     feels, we ANGLE... about fifty yards away.  Two eyes pop above\n     the surface... followed by the snout.  GO TO:\n\n     THE CROC'S P.O.V.\n\n     Six fresh delicious teenagers.  Midnight buffet.\n\n     RESUME\n\n     the croc as he slowly starts to move.  The teenagers start to\n     take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the\n     shoreline.  As they laugh and yell, Danny swings on a long\n     rope... landing with a splash.  About ten feet from the croc,\n     waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface.  He could\n     easily go for Danny... but he somehow knows the service will get\n     better.  As Danny swims back to shore, Janine takes hold of the\n     rope.\n\n                         JANINE\n               Here I come.  Ready or not.\n\n     And she swings away... a better swing than Danny's... and she\n     splashes down about five feet from the eyes.  Again, the eyes\n     don't move.  The teenagers cheer Janine's record-setting swing\n     as Tom takes hold of the rope.\n\n                         STEVE\n               All or nothing, Tom.\n\n                         TOM\n               From the jaws of defeat...\n\n     And he flies away.  It's a leap to die for.  As he splashes\n     down... gulp.  Like a seal grabbing a fish... and Tommy has\n     vanished.  The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when\n     Tommy fails to resurface.  A beat.

Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though\n     it's impossible to discern why.  The crocodile seems poised to\n     finish him.  There's a slight GROWL.\n\n     And then suddenly, a small underwater POP, followed by an\n     EXPLOSION out of the water.  it's an inflatable life vest and as\n     it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.\n\n     As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the\n     chopper.  In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the\n     croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.\n\n     Hector's up on the chopper's ski.\n\n                         HECTOR\n               Move over!!\n\n     The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws\n     snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two.  Hector\n     dives into the chopper, screaming.\n\n                         GARE\n               Go!!\n\n     She REVS the CHOPPER.  The croc comes up again, chomping down on\n     one of the landing skis.  Both Gare and Hector scream as the\n     whole helicopter is jerked mightily.\n\n                         GARE (CONT'D)\n                    (screaming)\n               Go!!!\n\n                         HECTOR\n               I'm trying!!!\n\n     The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to\n     thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  Gare\n     FIRES her REVOLVER.  It might as well shoot BB's.  The croc is \n     undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up\n     and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.\n\n                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n     EXT.

His head is two feet from Hector\n     and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector.\n\n                         HECTOR (CONT'D)\n               I can't see him, but this is\n               definitely blood.  Maybe you got\n               him.\n\n     And as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector\n     screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and\n     charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give\n     Hector some cover.\n\n     Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He\n     climbs in.\n\n                         KEOUGH\n               Where is he?!\n\n                         HECTOR\n               I don't know!\n\n     No sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs\n     toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other\n     side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin\n     and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes\n     right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but\n     wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.\n\n                         KEOUGH\n               Hector!!\n\n     But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again,\n     swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land.\n\n                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)\n                    (taking aim)\n               Alright.  Game over.\n\n     But the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.\n     And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger.\n\n                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)\n                    (to Kelly)\n               Should I?\n\n                         KELLY\n               Wait.\n\n     RESUME\n\n     The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.\n     But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate.\n     He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two\n     ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.\n\n                         KELLY\n               I think the drugs are kicking in.\n\n     Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to\n     free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that\n     cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even\n     more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot\n     exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he\n     just cannot go on anymore.\n\n     Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with\n     caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile.\n\n     ANGLE THE CROC\n\n     He's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his\n     eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten.\n\n     ANGLE THE PRINCIPLES\n\n     There's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness.\n\n                         JACK\n               I don't think we really want to\n               wait for him to catch his breath.\n\n     It continues to breathe heavily.\n\n                         KELLY\n               He's through fighting.  Look at\n               him.\n\n                         JACK\n               I don't care.  Hank.  End it.\n\n     Keough raises his cannon.\n\n                         HECTOR\n               No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.\n\n                         JACK\n               Yeah and every time we think\n               there's no more danger--\n\n     Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the\n     water, seizing Hector.  Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings\n     him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.\n     Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit.\n\n     It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing\n     into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit\n     Kelly.\n\n     They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's\n     bleeding.\n\n                         HECTOR\n               I'm okay.\n\n                         KELLY\n               You're not okay, your leg's a mess.\n\n                         JACK\n               Get him onto shore.\n\n                         KELLY\n               He heeds a tourniquet.\n\n     Keough quickly peels off his shirt.  Gives it to Kelly, who goes\n     to work.\n\n                         KELLY (CONT'D)\n               You're gonna be okay.\n\n                         HECTOR\n               Guess I finally got bit.\n\n                         KELLY\n               Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix\n               it.\n\n     A sudden ROAR.  Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see...\n     the big croc.  Maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  GASPING in\n     the crashed chopper.  Jack and Keough approach.\n\n                         KEOUGH\n                    (quietly; re the big croc)\n               He's done.

The Paramedics board Hector.

That's about as much affection as you get\n     from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly.\n\n                         KELLY\n               I'm sure this would offend you on\n               principal but... could we keep in\n               touch?\n\n                         KEOUGH\n               I guess.\n\n     And she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush,\n     boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack.\n\n                         KELLY\n               Well...\n\n                         JACK\n               You wanna ride in my truck?\n\n                         GARE\n                    (arriving)\n               Your truck is jammed.

The croc is gone.  Things are quiet.  Kelly stands down\n     by the water, staring out.\n\n     HER P.O.V.\n\n     Hypnotic beauty.  The lake doesn't even ripple.  She soaks it in\n     as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to\n     this again.  She HEARS every BIRD.  Including a DISTANT LOON.\n     Serenity has returned.  Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping\n     out, four, five, six skips.  Kelly turns around.  Jack stands\n     there.  They hold a look.\n\n                         JACK\n               I thought I should say goodbye to\n               the lake too.\n\n     He approaches.

I haven't found\n               somebody in my world.

They break.\n     And then he holds her.  Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an\n     AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n     EXT.
