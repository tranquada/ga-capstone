But she doesn't see\n     anything.  She scans the surface closely.\n\n\n<b>     EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n     The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than\n     the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing\n     extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks\n     up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a\n     cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head\n     for the surface.  He swims upward.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.

He continues to\n     breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises\n     up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim.\n     The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets\n     a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other\n     way, upon which his face goes rigid.\n\n<b>     HIS P.O.V.\n</b>\n     About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at\n     him.\n\n<b>     ANGLE HECTOR\n</b>\n     ashen.\n\n<b>                         HECTOR\n</b>                    (weakly)\n               Oh.... my.\n\n     The croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his\n     snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare\n     move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the\n     idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling\n     any spiritual voids.

And his\n     deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little\n     motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will\n     cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for.\n     To be judged by this symbol of mythology.\n\n     He backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly,\n     their eyes are locked.

Least of all Hector.\n\n<b>                         HECTOR (CONT'D)\n</b>               I can't see him, but this is\n               definitely blood.

Keough leaps off the truck and\n     charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give\n     Hector some cover.\n\n     Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He\n     climbs in.\n\n<b>                         KEOUGH\n</b>               Where is he?!\n\n<b>                         HECTOR\n</b>               I don't know!\n\n     No sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs\n     toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other\n     side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin\n     and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes\n     right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but\n     wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.\n\n<b>                         KEOUGH\n</b>               Hector!!\n\n     But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.

As unbelievable as that\n     cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even\n     more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot\n     exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he\n     just cannot go on anymore.\n\n     Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with\n     caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile.\n\n<b>     ANGLE THE CROC\n</b>\n     He's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his\n     eyes... we can see it.

Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings\n     him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.\n     Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit.\n\n     It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing\n     into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit\n     Kelly.\n\n     They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's\n     bleeding.\n\n<b>                         HECTOR\n</b>               I'm okay.\n\n<b>                         KELLY\n</b>               You're not okay, your leg's a mess.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Get him onto shore.\n\n<b>                         KELLY\n</b>               He heeds a tourniquet.\n\n     Keough quickly peels off his shirt.
