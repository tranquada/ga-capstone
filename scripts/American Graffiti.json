The eerie light glows brighter and \n               illuminates a single huge number--11. We hear static and a \n               large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across the \n               screen.\n\n               Pulling back slowly, we watch the glowing band traverse back \n               and forth over the amber light and past more numbers appearing--\n               70... 90... 110... 130. And we begin to hear voices--strange \n               songs, fading conversations and snatches of music drifting \n               with static.\n\n               Pulling back further, we realize it is a car radio filling \n               the screen and radio stations we're hearing, until the \n               indicator stops. There's a pause...and suddenly we are hit \n               by a blasting-out-of-the-past, Rocking and Rolling, turn-up-\n               the-volume, pounding Intro to a Vintage 1962 Golden Week-End \n               Radio Show--back when things were simpler and the music was \n               better.\n\n               And now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary \n               Wolfman Jack hits the airwaves, his gravel voice shrieking \n               and growling while the music pumps and grinds...\n\n<b>                                     WOLFMAN\n</b>                         Awwrigght, baay-haay-baay!

A large neon sign \n               buzzes in the foreground... MEL'S DRIVE-IN, while in the \n               background, \"Rock Around The Clock\" blares from the radio of \n               a beautiful decked and channeled, white with red trim, tuck-\n               and-rolled '58 Chevy Impala that glides into the drive-in. \n               Main titles appear over action. Steve Bolander stops the \n               elegant machine and gets out. He looks around, then walks to \n               the front of the car and leans against the flame-covered \n               hood. Steve is eighteen, good-looking in a conservative, \n               button-down, short-sleeved shirt. Most likely to succeed, \n               president of his graduating class. He looks around the empty \n               drive-in, then hears a funny little horn.\n\n               A Vespa scooter bumps into the lot. A young kid waves at him--\n               and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly \n               topples. Terry Fields (\"The Toad\") maneuvers the scooter \n               next to Steve's Chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the \n               trash can before stopping. Terry grins sheepishly. He's \n               seventeen, short but plenty loud, both vocally and \n               sartorically in his pink and black shirt, levis, and white \n               bucks. He looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks he's \n               projecting an air of supercool.\n\n               Steve watches Terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp \n               his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead. He \n               unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to \n               look tough.\n\n               Terry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating \n               Steve who pays him no mind. In the background, we hear the \n               Wolfman howling with the music. The record ends and a barrage \n               of humor begins from Wolfman Jack. The Wolfman is an unseen \n               companion to all the kids. Witty and knowledgeable about the \n               trivia that counts, he's their best friend, confidant, and \n               guardian angel.\n\n               Now, a grey, insect-like Citroen deux-chevaux putters into \n               the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot. Steve \n               and Terry watch Curt Henderson get out.\n\n               Curt stands by his little car. He's seventeen, a curly \n               bespectacled, scraggly kid with a summer-grown moustache and \n               a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts. Curt thinks of \n               himself as the town cynic. In reality, he's a hopeless \n               romantic. He starts over to his buddies.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night \n                         in town, you guys gonna have a little \n                         bash before you leave?\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         The Moose have been lookin' for you \n                         all day, man.\n\n               Steve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an envelope \n               without saying anything. Curt opens it slowly and pulls out \n               a check.\n\n<b>                                     CURT\n</b>                              (sarcastic)\n                         Oh great...\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Whadaya got, whadaya got? Wow--two \n                         thousand dollars. Two thousand doll--\n<b>                         !!\n</b>\n               Steve looks at Curt suspiciously; Curt seems somehow guilty.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         Mr. Jenning couldn't find you, so he \n                         gave it to me to give to you. He \n                         said he's sorry it's so late, but \n                         it's the first scholarship the Moose \n                         Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he \n                         says they're all very proud of you.\n\n               Curt hands the envelope back to Steve.\n\n<b>                                     CURT\n</b>                         Well... ah... why don't you hold \n                         onto it for a while?\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         What's with you? It's yours! Take \n                         it!

Ah, I think we'd better \n                         have a talk. I've gotten-\n\n               Suddenly a horn honks and they all turn. Laurie Henderson \n               pulls into the drive-in and waves to them. She is driving \n               the family's '58 Edsel.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         Your sister calls.

Steve ignores her. \n               There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         You chicken fink.\n\n<b>                                     CURT\n</b>                         Wait, let me explain--\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         You can't back out now! After all we \n                         went through to get accepted. We're \n                         finally getting out of this turkey \n                         town and now you want to crawl back \n                         into your cell--look, I gotta talk \n                         to Laurie.\n                              (he hands the check \n                              back to Curt)\n                         Now take it. We're leaving in the \n                         morning. Okay?\n\n               Suddenly, there's an ear-splitting roar and they all turn as \n               a yellow '32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped, lowered and sporting \n               a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot. The low slung classic rumbles \n               and parks at the rear of the drive in.\n\n               Big John Milner, twenty-two, sits in his Ford, tough and \n               indifferent, puffing on a Camel. He wears a white T-shirt \n               and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a ducktail. A \n               cowboy in a deuce coupe--simple, sentimental and cocksure of \n               himself.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         You wanna end up like John?

She's \n               wearing a letterman's sweater with a large \"Class of '62\" \n               emblazoned on the shoulder. Steve goes to her and they hug.\n\n               On the radio, the music ends, and the Wolfman's intro tune \n               comes on.\n\n<b>                                     RADIO\n</b>                              (singing)\n                         \"Here comes the Wolfman--Wolfman \n                         Jack!\"\n\n<b>                                     WOLFMAN (V.O.)\n</b>                         Oh, We're gonna rock and roll \n                         ourselves to death baby.

A continual line of hot \n               rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked cars, \n               then returns to the maindrag. Carhops glide by on roller \n               skates. Curt and John are fooling around in front of the \n               deuce coupe. A horn honks and they turn as a '60 Ford with \n               three girls in it slows by them. A girl leans out the window \n               and smiles.\n\n<b>                                     GIRL\n</b>                         Hi John!\n\n               The girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom \n               off.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Not too good, huh?\n\n<b>                                     CURT\n</b>                         Why is it every girl that comes around \n                         here is ugly?

Budda Macrae, a car hop, leans \n               down to attach a tray to Steve's window, showing off her \n               tight blouse.\n\n<b>                                     BUDDA\n</b>                         A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate \n                         mountain.

Budda takes the other \n               tray around the car, almost shoves it in the window where \n               Laurie is sitting.\n\n<b>                                     BUDDA\n</b>                         One fries--grab it before I drop it.\n\n               She gives Laurie an antagonistic look and goes off. Steve \n               laughs. Laurie smiles. She's seventeen, very pretty, with \n               big doe-eyes, and a short bobbed hairdo. She pushes up the \n               sleeves on Steve's letterman sweater, which is sizes too \n               large for her. His class ring glints on a chain around her \n               neck. Laurie is sweet, the image of vulnerability, but with \n               a practical and self-preserving mind beneath.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         Where was I?\n\n<b>                                     LAURIE\n</b>                         Um, how you thought high school \n                         romances were goofy and we started \n                         going together just because you \n                         thought I was kinda cute and funny, \n                         but then you suddenly realized you \n                         were in love with me, it was \n                         serious... and ah... oh, you were \n                         leadin' up to somethin' kinda big.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         You make it sound like I'm giving \n                         dictation. Well, seriously, what I \n                         meant was, that ah... since we do \n                         care for each other so much, and \n                         since we should really consider \n                         ourselves as adults.

He stops smiling. They \n               listen to the radio for an awkward moment. Laurie struggles \n               to hold back her tears. With obvious difficulty, she turns \n               to him and smiles. He's expected something different and \n               doesn't know what to do, so he smiles back.\n\n<b>                                     LAURIE\n</b>                         I think you're right.

The Wolfman howls an intro \n               to \"Gee\" by the Crows. Outside, skooting around the drive-in \n               after Budda, Terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as she \n               delivers a tray to a car.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         ...and I have a really sharp record \n                         collection. I even have \"Pledging My \n                         Love\" by Johnny Ace. Anyway, how can \n                         you love Nelson when he's going out \n                         with Marilyn Gator.

Hi, Steve!\n\n               Her tone changes immediately. Terry looks sour and turns \n               around to Steve who's getting out of the chevy. Budda leaves, \n               wiggling her butt for Steve.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         She's a little conceited--just playing \n                         hard to get.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         Listen, I came over here to talk to \n                         you about--\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Any time, buddy.

At night, \n               it is transformed into an endless parade of kids in flamed, \n               lowered and customed machines who rumble down the one way \n               street, through the seemingly adultless, heat-drugged little \n               town.\n\n               Police cars glide ominously with the flow of traffic. In \n               parked cars, couples neck between flashing headlights. Guys \n               looking cool in a '56 Chevy sit in the slouched position of \n               the true Low Rider--and over it all the music and the Wolfman \n               can be heard. Just now, it's \"Runaway\" by Del Shannon.\n\n               John travels with the flow of traffic, watching some dopey \n               guys shooting squirt guns from a moving car. John drives the \n               deuce coupe effortlessly. He looks over at a car pacing \n               alongside of his own.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Hey, Zudo.\n\n               A sweaty looking guy turns and nods from the window.\n\n<b>                                     PAZUDO\n</b>                         Hey, Milner.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Hey, man, what happened to your \n                         flathead?\n\n<b>                                     PAZUDO\n</b>                         Huh?\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         What happened to your flathead?\n\n<b>                                     PAZUDO\n</b>                         Ah, your mother!\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         What?\n\n<b>                                     PAZUDO\n</b>                         Your mother.

Sitting low in his \n               seat, he looks around, his face aglow, experiencing a new \n               world from the inside of a really fine car. This is the \n               greatest thing that has happened to Terry in seventeen long \n               years of being a short loser.\n\n               Terry turns a corner and another car pulls alongside.

Terry accounts the slight to jealousy. Then he forgets \n               it and enjoys driving the beautiful Chevy again. Another car \n               pulls alongside of him as he cruises along slowly.\n\n<b>                                     GIRL\n</b>                         Hey, kid.\n\n               Terry looks over at the car cruising next to him. In the \n               back seat, a guy has dropped his trousers and is pushing his \n               bare buttocks against the side window--a classic BA complete \n               with pressed ham. Terry looks away, wondering why this is \n               still happening to him, even in his new car.\n\n<b>               TRAVELING G STREET-LAURIE'S '58 EDSEL\n</b>\n               Curt is in the back seat gazing out the window at the dark \n               main street of the small farm community. Steve and Laurie \n               are talking quietly in the front seat. Laurie is sitting \n               near the window and it sounds like Steve is convincing her \n               to move over. Laurie finally does. His arm goes around her \n               and her head rests on his shoulder.\n\n               Curt is laughing as the Wolfman harasses someone on the radio. \n               The Wolfman is placing a call.\n\n<b>                                     WOLFMAN (V.O.)\n</b>                         Here we go with another call out of \n                         the station.

Curt \n               glances over at a classic white '56 Thunderbird and sits up. \n               In the T-bird, a girl watches him. Blonde, beautiful, her \n               hair, backlit by a used car lot, seems to glow, making her \n               look almost ethereal. Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of \n               scaring her away. She smiles faintly---then says something, \n               so softly it's lost...\n\n<b>                                     CURT\n</b>                         What?\n\n               Curt struggles to lower his window.

I think \n                         she said, \"I love you.\"\n\n               Curt looks at his sister and Steve in the front seat. They \n               are bored by his romantic visions.\n\n<b>                                     CURT\n</b>                         That means nothing to you people? \n                         You have no romance, no soul? She--\n                         someone wants me. Someone roaming \n                         the streets wants me!

Curt sits back and shakes his head.\n\n<b>               PARKING LOT\n</b>\n               Big John sits in his deuce coupe, backed into the parking \n               lot of the Acme Fall-out Shelter Co., the prime spot in town \n               for girl watching. A guy in wrap-around dark glasses leans \n               by the car next to John. They watch a group of laughing girls \n               cruise by in a Studebaker.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Oh, oh.

John accelerates \n               and pulls alongside the Studebaker. The girl in the front \n               seat rolls down her window.

One of the \n               girls dangles a bra out the back window, and they all break \n               into hysterical laughter. The girls try to accelerate ahead, \n               but John stays alongside their car.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Aw, come on...

A girl rushes out from the Studey \n               and runs around the back of John's coupe. She opens the door \n               and climbs in fast as the light changes.\n\n               The Studebaker pulls off fast. John pushes through the gears \n               and turns and smiles at his pick-up, as \"That'll Be the Day\" \n               plays on the Wolfman Jack Show.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         So, you're Judy's little sister.\n\n               Carol Morrison shakes her head. She is thirteen years old, \n               very cute--wearing blue jeans, sneakers and a \"Dewey Webber \n               Surf Board\" T-shirt which hangs to her knees. John seems \n               slightly panicked.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Ah, shit,--how old are you?\n\n<b>                                     CAROL\n</b>                         Old enough.

It's \n                         just that you're a little young for \n                         me.\n\n<b>                                     CAROL\n</b>                         I am not!

He adjusts his \n               waterfall curl as the Wolfman dedicates a list of songs. He \n               passes a group of guys bullshitting around the raised hood \n               of a souped-up parked car.\n\n               Terry cruises alongside two girls in a Ford. He revs the \n               engine to get their attention and once he has it he motions \n               to roll down their window. They flip him the bird instead \n               and he lets them pass.\n\n               Terry pulls up to a stop light. The car next to him is a '56 \n               Ford--a good opponent and besides, the kid driving looks \n               younger than Terry.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         What you got in there, kid?\n\n<b>                                     KID\n</b>                         More than you can handle.\n\n               Terry revs his engine. So does the Ford. The tension mounts. \n               The green arrow for the left turn lane flashes on, the car \n               on Terry's other side moves off, and before he can control \n               his reflexes, Terry, too, has shot into the intersection \n               while the light remains red! Terry quickly shifts and returns \n               to the starting position. The other driver is grinning.\n\n               Terry is flustered and embarrassed. Terry revs the Chevy a \n               couple more times, concentration intently this time on the \n               right light.\n\n               Green!... The Ford bolts into the intersection. Terry likewise \n               floors the gas pedal and goes crashing backwards into a large \n               Buick. Terry is stunned for a moment, then realizes he forgot \n               to shift into first. He fumbles to get the car into first \n               gear.\n\n               A distinguished looking man comes up to his window after \n               inspecting the damage. Terry tries to escape, but in his \n               panic the engine dies. He struggles to start it.\n\n<b>                                     OLDER MAN\n</b>                         Excuse me, but I think we've had an \n                         accident.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Well, goddamnit, I won't report you \n                         this time, but next time just watch \n                         it, will ya?\n\n               Terry roars off in a cloud of indignant smoke, leaving the \n               gentleman standing in the street looking dismayed.

He rubs a small scratch \n               on the back fender, but it won't disappear.

He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts \n               to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes.

The driver, Bob Falfa, has a gum-chewing girlfriend \n               sitting almost on top of him. Terry challenges the '55 Chevy \n               by revving his engine.\n\n               Bob Falfa doesn't even look over. He revs his engine--which \n               sounds like a cross between a Boeing 707 and a SuperChief. \n               Terry can't believe it.

His mouth \n               drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl. Debbie, \n               nineteen, with blonde hair, wearing a blue and white spaghetti-\n               strap dress, strolls along the sidewalk.\n\n               Terry rolls the powerful engine, but she ignores him.

He quickly whips out his comb, touches up his hair and \n               settles down into a comfortable slouch.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Okay, honey, here I come--James Dean \n                         lives!\n\n               He hits the clutch, roars the engine a couple more times and \n               then--disaster. Debbie passes behind some rough looking dudes \n               on motorcycles, parked along the curb.

Terry \n               watches and then waves to Debbie in the car that everything \n               is cool.\n\n               As he waits for the bum to come back out, the first man in \n               the suit exits.

Terry goes over to \n               the window of the liquor store and looks to see how the wino's \n               doing with his booze. Terry sees the liquor store owner \n               setting four bottles of cheap wine on the counter.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                              (gesturing through \n                              the window from \n                              outside)\n                         Hey, no.

Terry smiles weakly and goes back to \n               try his luck again at the liquor store.\n\n               He stops in front of the door as a young guy with numerous \n               tattoos on his bulging arms approaches the liquor store.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Hi--excuse me.

Terry waves excitedly to \n               Debbie, lowering his pants a bit. Suddenly, there's a gunshot! \n               Terry whirls to see the young man stuffing cash from the \n               register into his pockets, backing away with a smoking gun. \n               He rushes out of the store, tossing the bottle to Terry and \n               running off into the night. Suddenly, the owner emerges from \n               behind the counter, shooting wildly.

They walk through a valley of twisted, \n               rusting piles of squashed, mashed and crushed automobiles. \n               John sticks his hand into his pockets moodily and stops and \n               looks at one of the burnt-out cars.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         That's Freddy Benson's Vette... he \n                         got his head on with some drunk. \n                         Never had a chance.

Twelve \n               silent images of Ricky Nelson on \"Ozzie and Harriet\" glow in \n               the dark showroom.

He does a double take. \n               Through the narrow window he sees the Thunderbird passing in \n               the opposite direction. Curt swivels and watches through the \n               back window as the T-bird disappears around a corner. Then, \n               he shakes his head.

He turns her around \n               and gently kisses here. They begin to make out, Laurie seeming \n               a little desperate. Steve pushes her slowly down on the seat. \n               He moves on top of here and his hand begins to wander.\n\n<b>                                     LAURIE\n</b>                         Steve!

She \n               struggles for a few moments, then goes limp, not responding. \n               He pulls away angrily.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         What's wrong?

The door \n               swings open and she shoves Steve out. Then she starts the \n               engine and drives away, leaving Steve standing there in the \n               darkness. In the distance, he hears the laughter of other \n               couples and the drifting music from their radios.\n\n<b>               THE CANAL ROAD\n</b>\n               Terry and Debbie walk slowly along the dark canal.

Inside the car, Holstein sits with another \n               officer who's dozing.

He ducks, \n               carrying a length of metal cable in his hand. Curt wanders \n               behind him.

Taking cover, \n               Curt makes another break toward a car--and trips and falls.\n\n               In the cop car, Holstein thinks he hears something. He opens \n               the door and gets out. Adjusting his billy club, he paces \n               around the used car lot officiously, while Curt hides behind \n               a Falcon and peeks out from behind a fender. He sees Holstein \n               walking back toward the squad car. The cop opens the door \n               again and climbs in. The echoing sound of the calls coming \n               over the police radio blend with the Wolfman's howling as \n               cars pass with their radios blaring.\n\n               Curt is inching forward with the cable, toward the squad \n               car. In the background, a slow freight train can be heard \n               starting to move across the valley. Curt ties the cable to a \n               post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car \n               with the cable.\n\n               Underneath the car, Curt inches on his back and then reaches \n               up and attaches the cable to the rear axle of the car.\n\n<b>               MAIN STREET\n</b>\n               Terry and Debbie are walking across the street, Terry looks \n               miserable and disconsolate about the loss of the Chevy he \n               possessed for three short hours.

THe red lights start flashing and the siren \n               wails. The patrol car shifts into gear and leaps forward. \n               Suddenly, there's a horrendous metallic screech, the patrol \n               car hurtles up and out, airborne for a moment--then noses \n               down and bounces along the pavement, sending out sparks as \n               it slides to a stop.\n\n               The driver is stunned and frozen to the wheel. Holstein \n               manages to remove his dark glasses and looks back. There, \n               sitting quietly in the middle of the parking lot, is their \n               trans-axle and two rear wheels. The patrol car sits on the \n               ground at a twenty degree angle, while its engine whines \n               impotently at top speed.\n\n               On the radio, the all-seeing Wolfman gives an evil laugh--\n\n<b>                                     WOLFMAN (V.O.)\n</b>                         Oh, I can't believe it.

Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population \n               sleeps through the night. John pulls the coupe to the curb \n               and turns off the engine. He turns out the lights.\n\n               Inside the car, there's silence.

She looks over to see Bob Falfa's car pacing \n               her. He's alone now and grinning at her. Laurie ignores him. \n               They drive along further. Falfa roars his engine, but she \n               still doesn't give him any attention. He gives up and pulls \n               off.\n\n               Laurie thinks a while, pouting. She pulls alongside Falfa at \n               the next light. He isn't looking at her. She toots her horn \n               and he turns. Laurie motions him to pull over.\n\n               Falfa looks surprised. The light changes, and he follows her \n               to the curb. Laurie takes a deep breath, and with a determined \n               look, gets out and walks back to his car. She gets in and \n               closes the door. They start off.

Debbie is sitting on the hood of a car, \n               swinging her legs and chewing gum. The people all seem to be \n               watching something on the ground behind the car. Coughing is \n               heard, then gagging, and the unmistakable sounds of someone \n               being sick.\n\n               At the back door of the bar even the cooks are looking and \n               pointing. We hear more coughing and vomiting. A guy slides \n               up on the hood next to Debbie.\n\n<b>                                     GUY\n</b>                         I never seen a guy lose so much.

An old woman moves close \n               to the old man and he puts an arm around her sentimentally.\n\n<b>                                     OLD WOMAN\n</b>                         Staying on his hands and knees like \n                         that...\n                              (she grins)\n                         He looks like a dog, doesn't he? \n                         Looks like old Ginger.\n\n<b>                                     OLD MAN\n</b>                         Sicker than a dog, that's for sure.\n\n               The people drift off, leaving Debbie sitting alone on the \n               car. Now, Terry slowly emerges, pulling himself up the hood \n               of the car. His face is white. He lies across the hood trying \n               to catch his breath.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Ohh rats, I feel like--\n                              (he notices a car \n                              nearby and pushes \n                              himself up)\n                         Wait a second... hey!\n\n               He staggers across the lot toward Steve's Chevy!

An attendant nods, looking at the \n               roaring engine.\n\n<b>                                     ATTENDANT\n</b>                         Took the header plugs off.

As the wires connect, the radio comes to \n               life and the Wolfman growls.\n\n<b>                                     WOLFMAN (V.O.)\n</b>                         Who is this on the Wolfman telephone?\n\n               There's the sound of a phone ringing, then the unmistakable \n               voice of the Big Bopper answering.\n\n<b>                                     BIG BOPPER (V.O.)\n</b>                         Hellooo, baaaby--\n\n               Just then, Terry looks up and sees one large badass looking \n               at him. Terry gets up slowly and sees another big guy standing \n               nearby. The first badass reaches in and grabs Terry by the \n               shirt. He pulls him from the car. Terry is smiling weakly.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Ah, hi--this is my car.

Now, easy will you? Easy!\n\n               They throw him back and forth and start to rough him up \n               seriously. Debbie is running around helplessly while they \n               pummel Terry. Then, she sees the yellow deuce coupe passing.\n\n               John glances out his window and notices the fight behind the \n               Come On Inn. He punches it and wheels into a fast U-turn.\n\n               The hoods have quit playing with Terry and are punching him. \n               Terry's still on his feet, mostly because he's drunk and \n               staggering away from a lot of the blows; also, Debbie is \n               screaming and pelting the assailants with her purse.\n\n<b>                                     DEBBIE\n</b>                         Stop it, stop it, stop it!

The punk lands on his ass.

There's a low rumbling sound \n               and the girls turn as John's deuce coupe glides into the \n               stall next to them.

He goes and opens his \n               hood, making a last-minute check on something. Terry sits \n               down gently on a curb by John. Debbie has been talking with \n               some other boys. Eventually she wanders up slowly and looks \n               at Terry.

Curt watches the deserted landscape when suddenly, \n               the radio increases in volume and he turns it down. Then it \n               begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes more \n               powerful. Then Curt sees it.\n\n               He stops the car and gets out. He stands looking at an \n               isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight. Curt \n               looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward the \n               stars, its black wires humming in the stillness.\n\n               Curt starts up the gravel walk to the door. Under the glare \n               of a naked spotlight, he sees a small intercom which plays \n               soft Rock and Roll. He hesitates, then pushes a buzzer.

Then, he laughs \n               and howls again, starting to sing a song called \"Bluebirds \n               on My Dingaling,\" pounding out the rhythm on the console.\n\n<b>                                     CURT\n</b>                         Wolfman...\n\n               He backs away, leaving the Wolfman, who's on his feet now, \n               screaming out the end of the song, dancing by himself in the \n               little glass room, from which his voice radiates out through \n               the night and around the world...\n\n<b>               MEL'S DRIVE-IN\n</b>\n               John is working under the hood of the deuce coupe when Falfa's \n               Chevy drives into the parking lot.

Everything is quiet now, only the crickets \n               ignoring the solemnity of the scene, and still singing. Terry \n               jumps out of John's car, John hands him the flashlight and \n               he takes up a position in front of the two cars.\n\n               John looks over at Falfa, who's arguing with Laurie.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Hey--Laurie, what in the hell are \n                         you doing in there?

Terry has his hands over his head and is coughing \n               in a cloud of smoke as they pass. John beats Falfa off the \n               line.\n\n               Out on the road, as they hit third gear, the cars are almost \n               neck and neck. Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to \n               death. Falfa looks insane as he tromps it.\n\n               John hits fourth at about eighty-five. Falfa does likewise--\n               but starts to fish-tail. Laurie closes her eyes, almost crying--\n               Falfa regains control nervously.\n\n               Falfa's engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to \n               get the edge on John. The cars rocket through the dawn light \n               along the flashing white line until suddenly Falfa's car \n               blows a tire, his front wheel slips off and the car shoots \n               off into a tomato field, hits an irrigation ditch and begins \n               flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke--\n\n               John sees the Chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt, \n               swimming through an unbelievable U-turn and high tailing it \n               back to the crash site. He is out of the car like a bullet, \n               running across the dirty cloddy field. The crash car is \n               beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is \n               panicked.\n\n               Meanwhile, the spectators have arrived, including Steve, who \n               jumps from his car and is running across the field.\n\n               Steve and John arrive at the fire at approximately the same \n               time. They stop, the flames are getting higher, burning up \n               into the trees now. Steve looks around wildly--he sees John \n               and goes at him.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         You stupid sonofabitch, she was in \n                         that car! Why did you have--\n\n               He takes a couple of swings at John, who finally manages to \n               tackle him around the waist. They both get up looking at the \n               flaming wreckage. Then John moves around the side, crouching, \n               trying to see past the flames--suddenly, he stands and motions \n               to Steve to come over. They both circle the wreck.\n\n               Around behind the flaming car Falfa is standing in a state \n               of shock watching the car go up in smoke, while Laurie is \n               circling him, screaming and beating him with her purse.\n\n<b>                                     LAURIE\n</b>                         I said I didn't--you lousy greasy \n                         jerk!

Steve runs over and \n               grabs her, pulling her away. She fights at Steve, too, not \n               knowing what's going on.\n\n<b>                                     LAURIE\n</b>                         No, no, no.

She throws her \n               arms around him as the crowd develops along the irrigation \n               ditch to watch the flaming car.\n\n<b>                                     LAURIE\n</b>                         Oh, Steven!

Terry runs up, trotting \n               alongside John like a puppy.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Jeez, did you show him!

The stewardess smiles as he passes her. Above the \n               door of the plane it reads RADAR EQUIPPED. Curt looks back \n               again, then goes inside. The plane takes off down the runway \n               and then climbs up into the sky.\n\n<b>               INSIDE THE PLANE\n</b>\n               Curt listens to the radio as the plane takes off. It's playing \n               \"Goodnight Sweetheart.\" As the plane climbs and banks over \n               the valley, the music fades and the station drifts between \n               static and other stations...and then it's gone. Curt turns \n               off the radio and looks out the window.\n\n               As the plane banks, through the window Curt sees the white \n               Thunderbird crossing beneath on the small grey ribbon of \n               highway. Curt watches it. Then the plane's shadow ripples \n               over the car and it, too, is gone.\n\n<b>               THE BLUE SKY\n</b>\n               As the plane flies off against the blue sky we see cameos of \n               Curt and his friends:\n\n               John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964. \n               Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in \n               December 1965.\n               Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California. \n               Curt Henderson is a writer living in Canada.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>American Graffiti</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=George Lucas\" title=\"Scripts by George Lucas\">George Lucas</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Gloria Katz\" title=\"Scripts by Gloria Katz\">Gloria Katz</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Willard Huyck\" title=\"Scripts by Willard Huyck\">Willard Huyck</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/American Graffiti Script.html#comments\" title=\"American Graffiti comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:58:27.202820"}
