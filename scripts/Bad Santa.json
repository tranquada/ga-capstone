The Kid's bedroom is no \n               longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. We PAN OFF of \n               it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a \n               little bulletin board.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIE (V.O.)\n</b>                         ...Anyway, just in case they took it \n                         as evidence I am also sending you a \n                         T-shirt.

Anyways...\n\n               Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom \n               and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room.

I forgot I asked you to \n                         do it but it's a good thing you did \n                         or Santa's little helper would've \n                         plugged his ass.

That, plus \n                         everyone agreeing that the Phoenix \n                         police department shooting an unarmed \n                         Santa was even more fucked-up than \n                         Rodney King. The cops are treating \n                         me like fucking royalty now which is \n                         new in my experience.
