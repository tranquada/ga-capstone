The Creature \n               dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length \n               and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick \n               copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and \n               neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, \n               coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary \n               slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous \n               array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. \n\n               Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward \n               the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly \n               above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all \n               unlike the Da Vinci...\n\n               And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it \n               spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding \n               in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it \n               along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after \n               table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING \n               BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and \n               sinister shadows...\n\n               ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper \n               sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He \n               positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature \n               down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the \n               steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape.\n\n               Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, \n               unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- \n               tight guide holes.

A long glass tube, \n               two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on \n               a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam \n               wrenched out like a Polaroid plate.\n\n               He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going \n               knuckle-white on the wooden handle.

An eternity \n               passes in the space of a heartbeat.\n\n               The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, \n               thrashing and gagging. Murky fluid cascading in all \n               directions. The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, \n               trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding \n               like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging \n               Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with \n               electricity. Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying \n               to break the Creature's grip...\n\n               ...and the whole thing tips over. Victor reels back, falling \n               as the vat SLAMS to the ground, cascading its murky contents, \n               washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body \n               tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping \n               electrical discharges into the air. Victor scrambles back, \n               slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking \n               his legs away.

Gripped by seizures and convulsions. Vomiting \n               murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the \n               fluid. Swiping the air with palsied hands. Malfunctional.\n\n               VICTOR stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring \n               down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife \n               to this ghastly birth.

Panicking. He snatches a hammer \n               from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's \n               head. THUD! Again and again. Beating the thing down, pounding \n               it into submission. The Creature finally collapses, sliding \n               down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and \n               jerking in its own afterbirth.\n\n               Silence now.\n\n               A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined \n               lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a \n               dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room, \n               jerking wild shadows across the walls.\n\n               Victor steps over the Creature. Dazed. He drops the hammer. \n               It clatters to the floor. He stops to jot a final entry:\n\n<b>                                     VICTOR\n</b>                         Massive birth defects.

An extended beat. A rush of empathy. The Creature \n               reaches out. The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. \n               The BARKING draws closer. HUNTERS shouting.

The Creature gets swept along, gasping and \n               choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched \n               protectively to his chest.\n\n               Finally the water starts to settle. He manages to lash out \n               and secure a handhold. He pulls himself up, clambering over \n               the rocks and staggering onto firm soil. He collapses to his \n               knees, dripping water and heaving for breath. He lowers the \n               fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape... only to \n               realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands. \n               He crushed it to death trying to save it.

He slogs \n               to the crest of a ridge. There's a small house in the valley \n               below. A peasant dwelling.

FOOTSTEPS \n               come clumping across the floor. The Creature reels back and \n               dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and \n               swings open.

A pail is upended. Slop pours into \n               the trough. Felix walks away. The pigs scurry to eat. The \n               Creature leans forward intently. Food?\n\n               He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. They \n               jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. \n               He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his \n               chin. Not much on taste, but it's edible.\n\n               He stops, hearing the recorder MUSIC again, turning toward \n               the sound. He follows it, crawling back into the darkest \n               recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house.

He lunges to the \n               desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen \n               beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up.

Never giving up.\n\n               The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the \n               wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's \n               way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across \n               the River Styx.

A massive BALL OF FLAME \n               engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. \n               Blossoming. Roiling.\n\n               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as:\n\n               THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant \n               wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair \n               going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, \n               peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from \n               bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. \n               Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps \n               it never will...\n\n               FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight \n               trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams \n               echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance.\n\n               WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The \n               borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers \n               of lightning kiss the world. Softly:\n\n<b>                                     WALTON\n</b>                         Home\n\n<b>               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT\n</b>\n               HIGH AERIAL SHOT.
