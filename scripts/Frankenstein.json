Breathlessly cold. Even the \n               sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon. Pellets of \n               snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a \n               desolate arctic wind. It's as if Hell had erupted through \n               the floor of the Earth in the form of ice. Nothing could \n               survive here. Nothing. \n\n               SLOW PAN reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at \n               a permanent list. Silent.

Axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming \n               into the ice, throwing up frozen chips. The men are near \n               collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces. The dogs are \n               nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow.

The lead husky \n               rises to its feet, hackles up, HOWLING at some unseen thing \n               in the distance. The other dogs start rising around him, \n               joining in, staring off across the ice.\n\n                                     GRIGORI\n                         There's something out there.\n\n               The dogs are going berserk. The lead husky breaks free and \n               launches himself across the ice. The men scramble to restrain \n               the animals, but three more break away and take off after \n               their leader. Walton snatches up his rifle.\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         You five come with me!

The dogs come howling across the \n               ice toward us. The men trail substantially behind.\n\n               BOOM DOWN to the icy boulders f.g. A massive hand comes \n               briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin \n               rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal \n               surgical scars marring the wrist. A HUGE DARK FIGURE wipes \n               frame, fleeing into the rocks. The dogs come bounding past \n               in pursuit, snarling and slavering.\n\n               THE RUNNING MEN hear an INHUMAN HOWL rise amidst those of \n               the dogs. A vicious free-for-all echoes from the rocks.\n\n               Barking gives way to shrill squeals. An object is launched \n               from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc.\n\n               Some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground \n               with tremendous impact before them...\n\n               ...and they find themselves staring in horror At the sight \n               of the lead dog. Silence now. Those who have fallen, rise.\n\n               Walton cocks his rifle. The group proceeds, picks and axes \n               held ready, slowly skirting the rocks...\n\n               ...and the massacre is revealed. Blood-stained ice. Dead, \n               mangled animals strewn about. One twitching survivor crawls \n               toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its \n               entrails in a red smear.\n\n                                     GRIGORI\n                         Look.\n\n               They follow his gaze. Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, \n               ascending the rocks. Most are smeared and vague... but one \n               is clearly a bare human footprint. Several men cross \n               themselves. Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the \n               surviving dog. BLAM! A single bullet to the brain ends its \n               misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice.

Justine comes scurrying \n               up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh \n               load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, \n               trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably \n               blocked by Mrs. Moritz.\n\n                                     MRS.

Victor's \n               father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward \n               them.

The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark \n               against a steely gray sky. Victor and Elizabeth stand apart \n               from the others, staring at the casket.

The first thing Victor \n               and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to \n               big windows where the light would be best during the day. \n               Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of \n               subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, \n               all quite excellent.\n\n               The rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter \n               with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up \n               his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of \n               tables crammed with experiments and clutter.\n\n                                     WALDMAN\n                         You know for thousands of years the \n                         Chinese have based their medical \n                         science on the belief that the human \n                         body is a chemical engine run by \n                         electricity?

Waldman roots through a tray of \n               knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle.\n\n                                     WALDMAN\n                         Their doctors treat patients by \n                         inserting needles like these into \n                         the flesh at various key points to \n                         manipulate these electric streams.\n\n               He directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the \n               wall.

Copper mounting pins \n               trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in \n               turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries.\n\n               Waldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as \n               the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as \n               Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet \n               flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe.\n\n                                     WALDMAN\n                         Magic.

TILT DOWN to reveal a magnificent \n               miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than \n               three inches high within its penciled oval.\n\n               Waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, \n               jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally \n               large behind the magnifying lenses. Victor sits patiently \n               for the portrait, suffused with daylight.\n\n               Henry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. \n               Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. He clearly \n               hates people looking over his shoulder.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (deadpan)\n                         Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?\n\n               Waldman heaves a long-suffering sigh. He abruptly jabs his \n               brush at Henry's nose, daubing it with paint. Dignity upheld \n               he resumes his careful work as Victor laughs.\n\n               INT - WALDMAN'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Victor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains \n               of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's \n               company.

Victor looks \n               after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. \n               He glances down. A thin knife. Victor looks to Waldman. \n               Puzzled.

He sees the finished \n               locket lying open on a table, picks it up, studies the \n               beautiful miniature portrait it contains. Snaps it shut.\n\n               He looks up, eyes falling upon the Da Vinci print hanging on \n               the wall. He stares.

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING and a \n               CRASH OF THUNDER. The dead man still hangs from the scaffold, \n               lashed by the wind.\n\n               Victor looms from the storm, hands jammed in the pocket of \n               his greatcoat. He pulls out a thin, glittering blade. The \n               very weapon which took Waldman's life.

Gaunt and hollow- \n               eyed. Exhausted and obsessed. Wearing a butcher's apron. \n               Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms. Maggots are \n               swarming in the flesh.

Dead \n               tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a \n               slow-burning flame.

Most of us are getting out \n                         while we still can.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         You'll be leaving then.\n                              (beat)\n                         Just as well. You never were cut out \n                         for this, Henry. Goodbye.\n\n               And the door slams shut. The bolt is thrown. Henry pounds.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO \n                         REASON!\n\n               Nothing. Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and \n               heads back down the stairs.\n\n               EXT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - STREET - DAY\n\n               Henry exits into a nightmare. REFUGEES are streaming from \n               the city, horses and wagons, people on foot, carrying their \n               possessions. Henry steps into the street and is nearly run \n               down by a carriage.\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         OUT OF THE WAY!\n\n               Henry glances up to see Schiller at the reins, struggling to \n               control the animals as the carriage eases past.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Schiller? You're leaving? Where's \n                         all that high talk about treating \n                         the sick?\n\n                                     SCHILLER\n                              (icy)\n                         To hell with them. And you.\n\n               He snaps the reins, not caring who he runs down. The carriage \n               lurches away, scattering refugees before it.\n\n               Henry keeps walking. Jostled by the hostile crowd. Looking \n               around. Dazed. Dead bodies are stacked along the street like \n               cordwood, waiting for the death carts. ANGLE WIDENS as Henry \n               stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned \n               at the human suffering around him as we\n\n                                                                   FADE TO:\n\n               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT\n\n               Victor glances at the clock. Scribbles in his journal:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Time running out. Rate of decay \n                         accelerating. Must strike now... or \n                         start again from scratch.\n\n               He gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab \n               before him... but now the Creature lies on a full body-length \n               steel grate. Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling \n               above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped \n               with glittering needles big enough to knit with.\n\n               Victor glances up at the Da Vinci. The Study of Man has been \n               daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. Victor dips \n               a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing \n               identical marks on the body before him...\n\n               Now he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these \n               spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good \n               contact. The forearms, the neck, the rib cage...\n\n               Now he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners \n               of the steel grate...\n\n               Now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig \n               into the air. It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, \n               wires and all...\n\n               HIGH WIDE ANGLE\n\n               ...and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's \n               gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab. The Creature \n               dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length \n               and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick \n               copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and \n               neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, \n               coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary \n               slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous \n               array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. \n\n               Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward \n               the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly \n               above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all \n               unlike the Da Vinci...\n\n               And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it \n               spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding \n               in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it \n               along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after \n               table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING \n               BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and \n               sinister shadows...\n\n               ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper \n               sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He \n               positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature \n               down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the \n               steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape.\n\n               Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, \n               unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- \n               tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, \n               grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also \n               suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with \n               reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he \n               swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place \n               with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, \n               spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the \n               sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster.\n\n               The frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, \n               zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear:\n\n               Frankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking \n               the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble.\n\n               Frankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes \n               checking on his creation drifting in the murk.\n\n               Frankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, \n               supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they \n               send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables \n               along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge.\n\n               Frankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING \n               painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. \n               Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle.\n\n               Over it goes. WHAM! Overdrive.\n\n               The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first \n               jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with \n               energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through \n               the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking.\n\n               Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, \n               two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on \n               a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam \n               wrenched out like a Polaroid plate.\n\n               He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going \n               knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- \n               tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. \n               And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this \n               twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, \n               with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming \n               phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, \n               wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm...\n\n               EEL POV (IN THE TUBE)\n\n               ...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster \n               and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the \n               creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless \n               gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage. \n               The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to \n               side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open \n               and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges.\n\n               Frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, \n               watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                              (muffled through the \n                              glass)\n                         Live, you bastard!\n\n               A huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing \n               and spasming against the glass.\n\n               FRANKENSTEIN jerks his head back, stunned. The fingers are \n               scratching. He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting \n               the whole thing down. It cycles off, whining into silence\n\n               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS\n\n               ...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp \n               and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off.\n\n               FRANKENSTEIN stares at the sarcophagus. Realizing his creation \n               has stopped moving. Nothing now. He sags to his knees, utterly \n               devastated at the loss of his dream. Nothing.\n\n               It was all for nothing...\n\n               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS\n\n               ...And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. Its \n               mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries \n               to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid.\n\n               FRANKENSTEIN is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his \n               hands. A SOFT TAP. He glances over his fingers. Thinking he \n               imagined it. No. There's another tap. And another.\n\n               We see it in his eyes. Sheer joy and stunned exultation.\n\n               Triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. A bare whisper:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         It's alive. It's alive.\n\n               And then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the \n               sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. THUMP- \n               THUMP-THUMP! Pounding from within. Head ramming against the \n               inner lid. He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the \n               wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning \n               man within. He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope \n               to hoist the lid away...\n\n               ...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled \n               from below with rocket-booster force. The massive copper \n               shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, \n               demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and \n               thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry \n               and splintering coat rack. Victor's greatcoat goes flying.\n\n               Silence. Frankenstein is frozen. Staring at the roiling \n               surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. An eternity \n               passes in the space of a heartbeat.\n\n               The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, \n               thrashing and gagging. Murky fluid cascading in all \n               directions. The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, \n               trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding \n               like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging \n               Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with \n               electricity. Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying \n               to break the Creature's grip...\n\n               ...and the whole thing tips over. Victor reels back, falling \n               as the vat SLAMS to the ground, cascading its murky contents, \n               washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body \n               tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping \n               electrical discharges into the air. Victor scrambles back, \n               slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking \n               his legs away. He finds his traction and scrambles to his \n               feet.\n\n               The Creature is grasping and crawling toward him. Flopping \n               and jerking. Gripped by seizures and convulsions. Vomiting \n               murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the \n               fluid. Swiping the air with palsied hands. Malfunctional.\n\n               VICTOR stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring \n               down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife \n               to this ghastly birth. Softly:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         What have I done?\n\n               The Creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching \n               his clothes, pawing him.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         LET GO OF ME!\n\n               Victor can't break free. Panicking. He snatches a hammer \n               from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's \n               head. THUD! Again and again. Beating the thing down, pounding \n               it into submission. The Creature finally collapses, sliding \n               down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and \n               jerking in its own afterbirth.\n\n               Silence now.\n\n               A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined \n               lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a \n               dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room, \n               jerking wild shadows across the walls.\n\n               Victor steps over the Creature. Dazed. He drops the hammer. \n               It clatters to the floor. He stops to jot a final entry:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Massive birth defects. Result is \n                         malfunctional and vile.\n                              (beat)\n                         Have chosen to abort.\n\n               He walks stiffly away, disappears into the bedroom...\n\n               INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               ...where he staggers to the canopied bed, beyond exhausted, \n               and collapses face-down into oblivion. Weeping.\n\n                                                                   FADE TO:\n\n               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The wee hours. Rain pattering desolately on the roof. Victor \n               sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. Through a crack in \n               the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, \n               throwing a twisted spill of light. A shadow appears.\n\n               Entering. Shambling and gliding across the floor. Silent and \n               furtive. Creeping toward the bed.\n\n               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Moving into close-up. Sleeping.\n\n               Unaware. The shadow falls across his face. Beat. His eyes \n               fly open. An intake of breath. Paralyzed.\n\n               Sensing the presence. Feeling the shadow. Working himself up \n               to something. Perhaps a scream. He can stand it no longer, \n               thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside...\n\n               ...and the Creature is there, Looming like a specter of death. \n               Naked. Beseeching. Dull yellow eyes trying to understand. \n               Victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase CRASHING \n               to the floor. The Creature circles, seeking him, threatening \n               to cut off his path to the door.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Stay away!\n\n               He darts past the thing, careening out into the lab. The \n               Creature whips around, unsteady for a moment, then follows \n               him with surprising speed.\n\n               INT - LAB - NIGHT\n\n               Victor races through the lab with the Creature hobbling \n               behind, trying to catch up. Victor hurling lab equipment, \n               tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down.\n\n               Victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the \n               Creature's face. The Creature presses against the wood with \n               pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone.\n\n               He sinks to the floor. Abandoned. Shivering with cold. Sees \n               Victor's greatcoat where it fell. Grabs it.

He needs a plan. He presses on.\n\n               INT - SHOP - NIGHT\n\n               Victor appears at the window. TILT DOWN to reveal an array \n               of gleaming swords lying in their velvet display. Victor \n               hurls a brick through the glass. Snatches up a sword.\n\n               INT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Victor careens in from the storm, drenched, racing up the \n               stairs, sword glittering in his grasp. He gets to the top of \n               the stairs...\n\n               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT\n\n               ...only to discover the door torn off it's hinges. He enters, \n               stunned. The thing is gone.\n\n               EXT - STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Victor races back into the storm. Searching. Slogging grimly \n               on. Lashed by the wind and rain. Mocked by the lightning. \n               He'll never give up. Not until he finds the thing and takes \n               back the life he gave it. He dwindles from view, vanishing \n               into the gale as we\n\n                                                                   FADE TO:\n\n               EXT - ALLEY - MORNING\n\n               Gray and drizzly. Heaps of wet garbage. Crawling rats. There's \n               a shifting, heaving motion. The vermin scatter as the waking \n               Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like \n               a frightened child peering from under a blanket. Lost and \n               confused.\n\n               He scrabbles through the garbage for something to eat. He \n               finds a rotted scrap, chews it anxiously. Ravenous.\n\n               TWO FERAL DOGS appear, grizzled denizens of the city's gutters \n               and back-alleys, peering with insolent eyes. Watching him \n               eat. Assessing his potential as a threat. The Creature stares \n               ingenuously back. Not knowing to be afraid.\n\n               The lead dog curls his lips back with a guttural SNARL. The \n               Creature draws back sharply with a fearful MOAN. That's all \n               it takes. The dogs are on him, snarling and snapping, the \n               food torn from his hands. The dogs dart away, growling and \n               fighting over the scrap.\n\n               The Creature is left whimpering and shaken. He pushes to his \n               feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and \n               pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar \n               against the cold. He hears a distant CLANGING.\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out \n                         your deeeaaad!\n\n               A death cart clatters slowly past the mouth of the alley, \n               DRIVER ringing his bell. It makes no sense to the Creature, \n               but it's a sign of human life. He presses on...\n\n               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY\n\n               ...and emerges into the square as ANGLE WIDENS. There's a \n               fair amount of activity. People are still leaving the city, \n               though the earlier flood has thinned. Some citizens are still \n               trying to go about their normal lives. VENDORS are calling \n               out, selling food. The Creature moves through the square, \n               unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. People \n               trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little \n               attention.\n\n               The Creature pauses, sniffing the air. An aroma draws him to \n               a vendor's stand. Loaves of bread are laid out. He hunches \n               down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. Chewing.\n\n               It's good. A bigger bite. Snatching up more.\n\n                                     WOMAN (O.S.)\n                         Here! What do you think you're doing?\n\n               The Creature glances up. The VENDOR'S WIFE is within arm's \n               reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him.\n\n               Mouth gaping. Too stunned to scream.\n\n               The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's \n               going to take them away. He remembers his recent experience \n               with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: \n               he curls his lips back and snarls.\n\n               He's rewarded with a PIERCING SHRIEK. The Creature jumps \n               back, startled. This wasn't the desired effect. The woman \n               SCREAMS like she'll never stop. He turns to run away...\n\n               ...and plows right into the stream of refugees. He goes \n               sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his \n               loaves. Confusion all around. People converge angrily. A \n               ROUGH MAN grabs his hair, jerking him upright...\n\n                                     ROUGH MAN\n                         Stupid bastard!\n\n               ...and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, \n               whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. \n               Screams and panic. The Creature whips around, seeing horrified \n               faces on all sides...\n\n               He's the cholera! He's the one been spreadin' the plague!\n\n               ...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. \n               Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning \n               him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. They surround \n               him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. He tries to crawl, \n               whimpering for them to stop.\n\n                                     VENDOR'S WIFE\n                         BURN HIM! BURN HIM!\n\n               The Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling \n               back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob \n               sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. He \n               gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, \n               scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. He's \n               wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. Men \n               start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. A \n               torch is lit, swung toward him. Feel the heat.\n\n               The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete \n               bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, \n               bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. He \n               breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat \n               billowing. The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, \n               hurling rocks and sticks.\n\n               EXT - STREETS/ALLEYS - DAY\n\n               The Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many \n               cuts and bruises. He turns a corner, collapses against a \n               wall to catch his breath. He can hear them coming, shouting. \n               They'll be here any second.\n\n               He sees a death cart heaped with bodies. He hurls himself up \n               on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses. \n               The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley. The death \n               cart WORKERS appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, \n               gaping fearfully at the confusion. They scramble into their \n               seats, snap the reins. The cart rattles off as we\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT - STREET - DAY\n\n               Elsewhere in Ingolstadt. Death carts and devastation. This \n               part of town was hit hard. Bodies are heaped in gutters, \n               stacked along the walls. People are huddled in doorways, \n               quaking with sickness and pestilence. CART WORKERS move among \n               them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks.\n\n               WORKER #1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking \n               them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy \n               burlap. He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the \n               wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever. The \n               worker's eyes widen. Stunned. He calls over his shoulder:\n\n                                     WORKER #1\n                         Over here!\n\n               WORKER #2 hurries over. Stares down.

He leans down and \n               grabs Victor, trying to rouse him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Victor! \n\n               Worker #2 also sweeps his mask aside.

One, two, three!\n\n               They hoist Victor off the ground by his arms and legs and \n               carry him into the street. Victor rouses, feels himself being \n               carried. He sees a death cart looming ahead, stacked with \n               heaps of reeking dead. Staring.

PAN WITH IT to \n               reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque. Here's where the dead \n               are brought to be burned en masse. Fires are burning. Smoke \n               is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. Soot is \n               drifting like black snow.  BODIES  are dumped into a slit- \n               trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. Barrels are kicked \n               over. Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking.\n\n               One of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. The \n               Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of \n               oil. He knows what that means. He pushes free, clambering \n               over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, \n               loose soil crumbling under his fingertips...\n\n               ON THE LIP OF THE TRENCH\n\n               ...as WORKERS prepare to light the blaze. A MAN turns toward \n               the trench with a burning torch... And then the Creature \n               erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, \n               The man SCREAMS. The Creature SCREAMS even louder, cowering \n               back. The man hurls the torch. The Creature ducks as it goes \n               spinning over his head into the trench.\n\n               WA-BOOOM! A massive wall of flame punches sky-ward. The \n               Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up \n               in horror. He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, \n               running from this ghastly place of flames and death...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT - WOODS - DAY\n\n               The Creature comes blundering into view. On the move. He \n               knows not where. Just away, He arrives at a pond. Water.\n\n               He's thirsty. He scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping \n               it up with his hands. He pauses, noticing his broken \n               reflection. The water settles and his face comes clearly \n               into view. He throws his hands up and SHRIEKS, terrified at \n               his own reflection...\n\n               ...and then he realizes it's him down there. He stirs the \n               water with his fingertips to make sure. He reaches up, \n               touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it...\n\n               ...and utterly heartbroken. He drops his face into his hand \n               and weeps helplessly. BARKING DOGS in the distance. He looks \n               up, thinking they're after him. A moan of grief. He pushes \n               to his feet.\n\n               TRACKING THE CREATURE  faster and faster through the trees, \n               running from this world he's been born into. Gasping for \n               breath. Crashing through branches.\n\n               The BARKING draws closer. He hurls himself into a thicket, \n               scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves. \n               Panic. Exhaustion. Mortal terror. He flinches as something \n               comes CRASHING through the brush nearby. The legs of a DOE \n               come into view. Staggering. Falling. Thrashing down into a \n               cushion of dead leaves. Two arrows protrude from her heaving \n               side.\n\n               A tiny FAWN stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, \n               frothing with exhaustion and terror. Waiting for his mother \n               to rise. Her thrashing grows weaker. Dying.\n\n               The Creature moans at the sight. The fawn turns, meets his \n               gaze. An extended beat. A rush of empathy. The Creature \n               reaches out. The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. \n               The BARKING draws closer. HUNTERS shouting. The Creature's \n               fingertips make contact with the fawn...\n\n               A pack of the biggest, nastiest Staffordshire terriers you've \n               ever seen throw themselves HOWLING AND SNARLING onto the \n               doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, The Creature lets \n               out a SHRIEK, snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, \n               crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his \n               chest. The dogs take off after him.\n\n               DOLLYING THE CREATURE\n\n               Running full-tilt, SHRIEKING in terror all the way. Trying \n               to save the fawn. Trying to save himself. The dogs are \n               snapping at his heels, trying to sever his hamstrings and \n               bring him down.

The dogs \n               are left behind. The Creature gets swept along, gasping and \n               choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched \n               protectively to his chest.\n\n               Finally the water starts to settle. He manages to lash out \n               and secure a handhold. He pulls himself up, clambering over \n               the rocks and staggering onto firm soil. He collapses to his \n               knees, dripping water and heaving for breath. He lowers the \n               fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape... only to \n               realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands. \n               He crushed it to death trying to save it. He lays it down, \n               moaning, trying to understand.

Hungry. Wet. Tired.\n\n               The Creature pauses, hearing FAINT MUSIC drifting on the \n               breeze: the lovely flute-like sounds of a recorder. He slogs \n               to the crest of a ridge. There's a small house in the valley \n               below. A peasant dwelling. Smoke drifts from the chimney. \n               That's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive \n               rendition of our movie's WALTZ/LOVE THEME).\n\n               The Creature proceeds down the ridge... drawn by the music \n               and the promise of warmth.\n\n               HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The Creature approaches cautiously. Furtive. He eases to a \n               window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back. Listening. The \n               tune ends. We hear the pleasant murmur of VOICES. FOOTSTEPS \n               come clumping across the floor. The Creature reels back and \n               dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and \n               swings open. FELIX exits, a poor man trying to scratch an \n               honest living from the soil.

The \n               Creature watches through the wire and wood as Felix approaches \n               and stops, only his legs visible. Feed is scattered through \n               the wire. The chickens begins to eat. The Creature backs up\n\n               PIGSTY - DUSK\n\n               ...and finds himself in the company of PIGS. The animals \n               GRUNT and SQUEAL in alarm.\n\n                                     FELIX (O.S.)\n                         Yes, yes, I'm coming...\n\n               The Creature scurries further back into the shadows as Felix's \n               feet stop just outside. A pail is upended. Slop pours into \n               the trough. Felix walks away. The pigs scurry to eat. The \n               Creature leans forward intently. Food?\n\n               He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. They \n               jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. \n               He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his \n               chin. Not much on taste, but it's edible.\n\n               He stops, hearing the recorder MUSIC again, turning toward \n               the sound. He follows it, crawling back into the darkest \n               recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house. He \n               places his eye to a chink between the logs...\n\n               ...and sees GRANDFATHER playing the instrument near a \n               fireplace of glowing embers. The Creature shifts for another \n               view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner. Felix \n               and his wife MARIE are helped by their children, MAGGIE AND \n               THOMAS, ages 6 and 8\n\n                                     MARIE\n                         Bring Grandfather to the table.\n\n               The old man stops playing as the children scurry over. As \n               Maggie helps him to his feet, Thomas tosses another log on \n               the fire. It BLAZES UP. Fire and sparks. In the pigsty, the \n               Creature draws back with a fearful moan...\n\n               ...that nobody but GRANDFATHER hears, He pauses to gaze \n               blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering \n               what it might have been. Probably nothing. He lets the \n               children lead him toward the table. The meal is brought from \n               the stove and ladled out.\n\n               The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling \n               it from here. A string of drool spills from his mouth. It's \n               humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast \n               compared to pig slop...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Victor lies sleeping.

A shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his \n               face. Victor's eyes fly open.

We find \n               Victor at his desk, reading a letter:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         \"...but it's been so long since I've \n                         heard from you.

Before you know it, a wild \n               snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter.\n\n               THE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having \n               the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. \n               Softly:\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         It's snnowwinng.\n\n               EXT - HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow.

They jump to their feet and \n               hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed \n               to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, \n               Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         That one!

Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of \n               ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and \n               laughter.

The Creature shifts to \n               the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light.\n\n               The children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out \n               into the darkness:\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         Merry Christmas!\n\n               The door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries \n               closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with \n               a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board \n               is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering \n               of a glowing angel and a message:\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         For the...

He uncovers the plate to \n               reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies.\n\n               He's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad.\n\n               He picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes \n               going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts \n               huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. \n               Screw potatoes and turnips.\n\n               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING\n\n               The children race out the door to find the plate empty.

He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, \n               and pulls out what's been there all along:\n\n               Victor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds \n               the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from \n               the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head \n               this way and that.

The old man \n               waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a \n               spot to listen.

The rendering includes \n               suture marks where the pieces were joined.\n\n               The Creature gazes for a long time. His finger traces the \n               penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso. Eyes going \n               wider. Revelation slowly dawning. No. It can't be. it's too \n               horrible to conceive...\n\n               ...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge \n               of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm...

And the \n               door swings open. The Creature whips his head. There stands \n               Maggie. Eyes going wide. Breath catching in her throat. She \n               lets out an ear-splitting SHRIEK! The Creature throws himself \n               on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading:\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         Don't let them hate me!\n\n               Felix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose \n               in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the \n               children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the \n               Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling \n               to the floor, the old man shouting, the children SHRIEKING, \n               Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, \n               again and again, trying to kill the thing...\n\n                                     GRANDFATHER\n                         Leave him alone!\n\n               ...the CREATURE SCREAMING and taking the blows, writhing \n               across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his \n               pleading hands.

Stark trees. A figure in a greatcoat. Head bowed \n               with misery. Leaning against a tree. Trying to catch his \n               breath. Can't. Crying too hard. He sinks to his knees, hands \n               clutched bitterly to his heaving chest. Wondering why the \n               anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat.\n\n               A realization. He pulls the little red silk flower from the \n               inside pocket. It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen \n               palm like gentle magic. Or hope. Yes.\n\n               HOUSE - DUSK\n\n               The sky is brewing. The Creature runs across the courtyard \n               toward the house, breathless, holding his palm out. See? \n               Here's the flower you gave me. Don't you understand?\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         It's me!

He dashes to the house\n\n               HOUSE - DUSK\n\n               ...and bursts in to find it empty. Items have been scattered \n               and left behind.

A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. \n               The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. \n               He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a \n               satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's \n               recorder jammed in his belt.\n\n               A HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning \n               the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along \n               with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting \n               as the house is consumed...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               MONT BLANC - DAY\n\n               Massive pale gray feet walking through the snow.

Greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind.\n\n               THE CREATURE rises from below the crest and gazes down.\n\n               Glowering with triumph at achieving his goal.

He \n               clambers over a low fence, heading into the miles of wooded \n               acreage behind the house. His favorite shortcut.\n\n               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - LATE DAY\n\n               Willie hurries/dawdles along as kids do, the precious locket \n               clutched in his hands, admiring it. He can't get over the \n               fact that his brother's finally coming home.\n\n               He pauses, hearing FAINT TONES carried on the breeze, eerie \n               and flute-like. A recorder. Curious, he follows the sounds \n               further and further into the woods...\n\n               EXT - POND - LATE DAY\n\n               ...and comes into view of the pond. There's a FIGURE sitting \n               half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the \n               water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly-\n               pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar \n               WALTZ/LOVE THEME.)\n\n               Willie draws closer. Curious. Not wanting to intrude, but \n               listening to the music. The figure in the reeds still hasn't \n               noticed him...\n\n               ...And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right \n               out of a storybook. Willie's eyes go wide. The locket drops \n               from his fingers into the dust. The boy turns and runs as \n               the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet:\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         Wait! Don't be afraid!\n\n               The boy keeps running. The Creature comes shambling up from \n               the pond, still calling after him. He picks up the dropped \n               object. As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket.\n\n               At the small painting it contains. Victor Frankenstein. He \n               raises his gaze after the fleeing boy. Maybe Willie does \n               have reason to be afraid.\n\n               The Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, \n               teeth grinding in greater and greater rage.

Victor \n               looms from the darkness, staring.\n\n               And then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs \n               his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up \n               into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous \n               necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. \n               He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, \n               draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to-\n               eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin.

The Creature raises his \n               arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look \n               there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating \n               Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then \n               the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness.  \n               Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, \n               gazing at the scaffold, horrified.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Oh God. Oh God! No!

TILT UP \n               to the mountain. Shrouded in snow. Waiting.\n\n               MONT BLANC - DAY\n\n               A lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge...\n\n               Victor ascends the mountain. The mountain is brutal and \n               unforgiving. Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the \n               glacier. A bitter wind blows...\n\n               They plod on. Searching. Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding \n               before our eyes. Primeval and vast...\n\n               The horse suddenly spooks. Victor calms him. Staring. Is \n               that a figure down there? He shades his eyes against the \n               cutting sleet. Somebody in the distance. Down there on the \n               snow field. A tiny speck. Watching him.\n\n               The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great \n               bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box \n               from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the \n               snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair \n               of revolvers.\n\n               He glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of \n               white. Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the \n               flintlocks of both, turning slowly around. Gazing at the \n               rocks and crags. Searching.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         WHERE ARE YOU?\n\n               He hears nothing but his own voice echoing back... and then \n               FEET CRUNCHING through the snow. He turns. The Creature is \n               running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, \n               greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings.\n\n               Victor raises the first pistol. Hesitates. As frightened and \n               angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the \n               achievement of actually having created life.\n\n               He pulls the trigger. BOOM! A huge flash of powder, an \n               eruption of smoke. The Creature dodges the shot, still coming. \n               Victor raises the other gun. BOOM! Another flash of smoke. \n               Still the Creature comes.\n\n               Victor. Frantic. Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, \n               firing. BOOM! A miss. BOOM! Another miss. Spinning. cocking.\n\n               Firing. BOOM! BOOM! Spinning. Cocking...\n\n               ...And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean \n               out of his hands. The guns sail through the air, spinning \n               off across the ice. Victor panics, turns to run... And slips \n               over the edge of the precipice.\n\n               Victor falls SCREAMING, arms and legs windmilling through a \n               30-foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. He looks \n               up. The Creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge \n               to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a \n               cat-like crouch. He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him \n               sliding across the ice with a mighty heave...\n\n               INT - ICE CAVE - DAY\n\n               ...right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling \n               and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to \n               sprawl heavily to the cave floor.\n\n               Winded. Battered. Barely able to move. He glances up to see \n               the cave filled with possessions. Books. Provisions. Extra \n               clothing. The embers of a fire burn low. There is even a \n               rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates.\n\n               A huge shadow fills the cave entrance. The storybook ogre is \n               coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. \n               Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as \n               the Creature enters...\n\n               ...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers \n               down.

Magnificent and canopied. Kneeling together, \n               bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining...\n\n               Elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. Victor \n               sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up \n               the nightgown, making her shudder with desire...\n\n               ...and a SHOT FIRES. Victor jerks up. He can hear SHOUTING.\n\n               He rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed \n               and ready on the nightstand.\n\n                                     ELIZABETH\n                         Victor!\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Open this door for no-one!\n\n               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT\n\n               Victor sails past the GUARD at the entrance, brandishing his \n               pistols.

He scurries  silently up, further and further into \n               the tree... closer and closer to the balcony.\n\n               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT\n\n               Elizabeth.

The Creature \n               enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow.

Breath catching in his throat. The \n               French doors are swaying in the wind.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Elizabeth.\n\n               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT\n\n               Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves \n               inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She \n               makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, \n               spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light \n               of the fireplace.\n\n               The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes \n               between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She \n               peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing:\n\n                                     ELIZABETH\n                         You don't want to hurt me.\n\n               He averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty.\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         You're more lovely than I could ever \n                         have imagined.\n\n               FOOTSTEPS come pounding up the stairs.

He spins her around so he won't \n               have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. \n               He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest \n               with pile-driver force...\n\n               INT - LANDING (OUTSIDE ROOM) - NIGHT\n\n               ...and her SCREAM is cut short.

The Creature \n               whips toward them, fist glistening with blood...\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         I keep my promises.\n\n               ...and he races across the room as the men OPEN FIRE, \n               shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade \n               of shots. But the Creature is too fast. He hits the leaded \n               window head-on with the force of an anvil...\n\n               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT\n\n               ...and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of \n               shattering glass. He drops 40 feet to the grass below and \n               vanishes like the breeze, greatcoat whipping into darkness.\n\n               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT\n\n               Victor rushes to the bad and lets loose the most PRIMAL SCREAM \n               OF ALL. He sweeps his limp, murdered bride into his arms, \n               cradling her to his breast, screams trailing off into wracking \n               moans and sobs of despair:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                              (softly)\n                         Oh God... he took her heart... he \n                         took her heart from me...\n\n               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT\n\n               The men make way as Victor carries his dead wife through the \n               downpour. He puts her in the coach. Dazed.\n\n               EXT - ROAD - NIGHT\n\n               The coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a \n               frenzy, faster and faster.\n\n               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT\n\n               Victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop. Victor jumps \n               down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps. Henry \n               appears, rushing out into the rain. Victor goes right past \n               him...\n\n               MANSION - NIGHT\n\n               ...and carries Elizabeth through the silent halls.\n\n               ATTIC - NIGHT\n\n               The door swings in. Victor stands dripping. Holding Elizabeth. \n               Gazing at the gleam of copper...\n\n               MONTAGE:\n\n               And we launch into the final throbbing madness. Victor hacking \n               and chopping. Discarding pieces. Sewing the creation, yanking \n               the catgut tight. Ramming the needles deep. Hoisting the \n               body in the air. Slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening \n               the bolts. Powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the \n               switch. Screaming at God as the LIGHTNING FLASHES and the \n               body convulses. Wind and rain sweeping through the lab, \n               battering a window open and shut, open and shut. Lowering \n               the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb. Releasing the \n               eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the \n               spasming egg The body. Convulsing. Lashing. Screaming in the \n               copper womb. Hair whipping in the fluid...\n\n               Victor shuts down the machinery. He opens the tank and reaches \n               into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves. He pulls out \n               his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle \n               a newborn infant's...\n\n               ...And wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal \n               Elizabeth's face, Massive suture marks bisect her neck and \n               collarbone where pieces were joined. A whisper:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Live.\n\n               Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to \n               draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. She erupts, thrashing \n               in the vat. He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start \n               her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft \n               murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave \n               violently to dispel the fluid...\n\n               He lifts her gently out. Wipes off the muck as she shivers \n               and shakes, spasms easing off. Cleansing her face. Clasping \n               her hand in his. Comfort and strength...\n\n               Helping her to her feet. Jerky and unsure. Lean on me.\n\n               Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, \n               draping it... and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up \n               with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. A whisper:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Say my name.\n\n               Blank. Dazed. Stunned. Not a flicker of recognition.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you \n                         remember. Say my name.\n\n               Nothing. He leans forward... and kisses her dead lips.\n\n               Gentle as a sigh. A flicker in her eyes?\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         You must. You must.\n\n               Maybe his imagination. Still whispering:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Say my name. Say you remember.\n\n               And slowly... ever so slowly... she raises her bony white \n               hand before her eyes... staring at it... trying to puzzle it \n               out... its meaning... perhaps the vaguest shred of \n               recognition... and the hand continues to rise... creeping \n               slowly toward his shoulder... and coming to rest there. He \n               smiles, blinking back tears...\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Yes. I'll help you remember.\n\n               And he takes her other hand in his. At first it's \n               imperceptible... just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, \n               perhaps just a shift of balance... and then it grows into \n               the vaguest sway... and tears are glistening in Victor's \n               eyes as she begins to move. Lurching. Faltering. Unsure.\n\n               You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for \n               guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong.\n\n               Trace memories.\n\n               A waltz.\n\n               And here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and \n               hair-raisingly demented image of the film: Frankenstein dances \n               with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to \n               remember, please remember, and now our WALTZ/LOVE THEME really \n               comes back to haunt us as the MUSIC SWELLS, incredibly lush \n               and deranged, dissonant and echoing through Victor's head, \n               music only he can hear...\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.\n\n               ...and the worst part? The very worst thing of all? There on \n               the shelf. A large formaldehyde jar. Justine's severed head. \n               Watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes. \n               Watching them dance. Still a wallflower? No. She's finally \n               finishing her dance with Victor... most of her, anyway. Under \n               the circumstances, it'll have to do...\n\n               ...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in \n               glorious circles as a dazzling array of LIGHTNING bathes \n               them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening \n               across the walls, INSANE MUSIC swelling louder and louder, \n               climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo \n               with jagged glass claws...\n\n               ...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in. \n               Music echoes abruptly away into silence. Nothing now but \n               rain and distant thunder. In the doorway:\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         She's beautiful.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         She's not for you.\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. \n                         Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper \n                         suitor.\n\n               The Creature raises his hand. Beckoning. She takes a faltering \n               step. Drawn to him.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         Elizabeth, no!\n                              (she turns, puzzled)\n                         Say my name.\n\n               Her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain-damaged \n               child who's wet the bed. She knows she's supposed to \n               remember... but can't remember what remembering means.\n\n               They both motion to her. Murmuring. Begging. She's caught \n               between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war.\n\n               Please... come with me. Please... remember. She finally tilts \n               toward the Creature. Gazing into his eyes. Studying his face. \n               Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. A beat. A \n               frown. A puzzlement. This isn't right. People don't look \n               like this. They're not stitched together out of pieces of \n               flesh like a patchwork.\n\n               She looks at her own hands. Dead and white. Not even hers.\n\n               One belongs to Justine. Another to a prostitute, suture scars \n               marring the wrist. She looks down at herself. The dead, \n               sagging breasts. The body that isn't hers either. Realization \n               creeping into her eyes. Realization and horror. Turning to \n               Victor. Why do I look like this? What's happened to me? Oh \n               God, what's happened to me?\n\n                                     ELIZABETH\n                         Vic... tor?\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         ...no...\n\n               ...and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest \n               pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. \n               She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to \n               find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to \n               peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her \n               own eyes.\n\n               Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering \n               toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. \n               The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside.\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         GET AWAY FROM HER!

She remembers. Not much, but enough. She breaks away \n               from them as they grapple, still SHRIEKING as she sails across \n               the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying...\n\n               ...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before \n               they can stop her.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         NO!\n\n               She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay \n               with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. \n               But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing \n               in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her... \n               loathing for herself for what she's become.\n\n               It turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no \n               part of it... or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp \n               in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. \n               WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts \n               past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead \n               flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as \n               she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the \n               Creature racing after her...\n\n               INT - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               ...and she sails down the hallway, setting FIRE to everything \n               she passes, SCREAMING for the final torment to end. She hurls \n               herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she \n               plummets to the floor far below. A pillar of flame leaps up \n               on impact.\n\n               VICTOR AND THE CREATURE face each other as flames sweep the \n               walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in \n               Hell.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         You killed her! You killed her!\n\n               He hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning \n               down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. The Creature gazes \n               down at his Maker one last time...\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         We killed her.\n\n               And then vanishes through the smoke and flames.\n\n               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY\n\n               The once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath \n               a merciless gray sky. Charred beams and drifting smoke are \n               all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family.\n\n               Victor stands gazing at the house. A windswept, hollow man \n               Bundled in a rough coat. Flintlock rifle dangling at his \n               side. Henry moves into frame some distance behind. Softly:\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Victor.\n\n               No reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard.\n\n               He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack \n               horse. The animal stands saddled and ready.\n\n               He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a \n               restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a \n               stranger... and then his features soften.\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         All that I once loved lies in a \n                         shallow grave.

Wishing he could grab the \n               dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered... but knowing \n               the thread is a bittersweet illusion. A bare whisper:\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                         You should have been my father's \n                         son.

Henry runs after him, shouting:\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         VICTOR! COME BACK!\n\n               But Victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance. \n               The past is dead. Henry watches Victor until he's gone from \n               sight, as Willie did so long ago...\n\n               EXT - MONT BLANC GLACIER - DAY\n\n               The solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept \n               glacier ...\n\n               INT - THE CREATURE'S CAVE - DAY\n\n               Victor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled.

Pristine... save for the long trail of \n               footprints stretching off before us.\n\n               Victor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy \n               horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor.\n\n               He slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by \n               the reins.

The eyes glaze. A \n               peaceful death. Walton rises. Puts on his heavy coat to ward \n               off the chill. Exits the cabin.\n\n               EXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - TWILIGHT\n\n               Grigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the \n               ice. His coat is open.

Could it be the dead man? He \n               glances down. Wet footprints lead across the floor.\n\n               He eases forward. The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into \n               view. A DARK FIGURE is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding \n               the corpse's hand. Walton is stunned.\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         Who are you?\n\n               The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim \n               yellow light:\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         He never gave me a name.\n\n               Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath. He lunges to the \n               desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen \n               beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up. Eyes dancing with \n               fear and speculation. The Creature makes no move.

Walton silently reads \n               a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small \n               campfire drifts past.\n\n               Walton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances \n               to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other \n               men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it.\n\n               Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He \n               dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men \n               back away, preparing for the coming blaze...\n\n               ...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The \n               men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their \n               bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in \n               frame. Loping slowly over the ice.

If you say so. The men grow more \n               unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. \n               Men start backing toward the ship.\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         Stand fast.

Walton moves forward...\n\n               ...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads \n               as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some \n               fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again.\n\n               It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an \n               earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and \n               force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK!\n\n               Ice cascading skyward.\n\n                                     OLD SAILOR\n                         THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!\n\n                                     GRIGORI\n                              (whips toward Walton)\n                         TORCH THE DAMN THING!\n\n               Walton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The \n               torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back.\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         BACK TO THE SHIP!\n\n               The men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full \n               retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for \n               miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton \n               to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A \n               heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go \n               for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve...\n\n                                     GRIGORI\n                         LEAVE IT!\n\n               ...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift \n               opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course \n               across the ice, separating them from the torch.\n\n               They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the \n               others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels.\n\n               THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein \n               snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice.\n\n               NO\n\n               He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a \n               massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of \n               cascading water and spinning fragments.\n\n               THE NEVSKY\n\n               The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to \n               the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side.\n\n               WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the \n               ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see:\n\n               THE CREATURE\n\n               racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a \n               wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him \n               from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.\n\n               THE NEVSKY\n\n               breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, \n               triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew \n               hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet \n               into the icy water.\n\n               THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped \n               on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to \n               plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice \n               crashing down after him. Gone.\n\n               WALTON AND GRIGORI  are knocked flat as a fissure appears \n               between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a \n               teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back \n               but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping \n               maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him.\n\n               Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag \n               him off... but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the \n               ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori \n               thunderously into the drink.\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         GRIGORI!\n\n               THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as \n               she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching \n               the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to \n               the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their \n               fellows from the water, hauling them to safety.\n\n               FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on \n               its own ice floe.\n\n               THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning.\n\n               ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL\n\n               Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces \n               of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming:\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         GRIGORI!\n\n               The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and \n               strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms \n               thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight \n               of his own clothing.\n\n               Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water \n               himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's \n               dying right in front of Walton's eyes.\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!\n\n               Too late. Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing \n               for good beneath the frigid water. Gone. Walton throws his \n               head back with a bellow of anguish...\n\n               ...and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And \n               impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against \n               the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. He \n               gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... \n               and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and \n               up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath \n               him. The face of a nightmare.\n\n               The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air \n               right into Walton's arms. Both men go sprawling. Walton \n               scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature.\n\n               The monster is exhausted. Near his limit. Walton thrusts out \n               his arm, fingers grasping to help.\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         Swim.\n\n               The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting \n               away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to \n               him. Come. Grab my hand.\n\n               The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the \n               torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps \n               him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice.\n\n               CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered \n               by ice floes on all sides. Going under.\n\n               WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated \n               ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding \n               nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught.\n\n               Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water \n               and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard.\n\n               BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony \n               fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand.\n\n               The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion \n               and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high.\n\n               Swims grimly on.\n\n               ABOARD THE NEVSKY\n\n               The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men \n               shivering with exposure. Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing \n               off. The men crowd to his-side.\n\n               THE CREATURE swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch \n               held high to keep it burning. Relentlessly determined. This \n               is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. Gasping and \n               sinking beneath the surface...\n\n               ...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe \n               upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre. He hauls himself \n               from the water. Moving now in a slow-motion litany of \n               exhaustion. Climbing the pyre. Scaling the wood. Seeking the \n               top. Never giving up.\n\n               The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the \n               wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's \n               way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across \n               the River Styx. Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his \n               creation's knees, content to be shown the way...\n\n               The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading \n               his arms wide in sublime triumph. Feeling the wind on his \n               skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. Cold. \n               So very cold.\n\n               He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, \n               pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. He looks \n               down. At Frankenstein. The oil-soaked canvas. The saturated \n               wood. There's that smell. Yes. He scoops Victor up with his \n               free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother \n               comforting a baby.\n\n               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror. Realization dawning:\n\n                                     GRIGORI (SOFTLY)\n                         Don't do it...\n                              (screaming)\n                         FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!\n\n               THE CREATURE\n\n               turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering \n               in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the \n               sympathy held so long sought. A whisper:\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         For God's sake... I will.\n\n               And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him. White-hot \n               ignition. Ultimate redemption. WHUMP! A massive BALL OF FLAME \n               engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. \n               Blossoming. Roiling.\n\n               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as:\n\n               THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant \n               wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair \n               going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, \n               peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from \n               bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. \n               Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps \n               it never will...\n\n               FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight \n               trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams \n               echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance.\n\n               WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The \n               borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers \n               of lightning kiss the world. Softly:\n\n                                     WALTON\n                         Home\n\n               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT\n\n               HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The \n               Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through \n               a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrankenstein\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Steph Lady\u00a0\u00a0Frank Darabont\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Romance\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:22.626617"}
