BIXLER\n\n                                 MR. BIXLER\n                The great way, is not difficult for those \n                with no preferences, with the absence of both \n                love and hate, everything becomes clear and \n                undisguised. That was written by a Chinese \n                Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I \n                choose to bring that up in a creative writing \n                class? Because, the absence of judgment helps \n                us to appreciate reality. In other words, I \n                want you to listen to your classmates writing, \n                with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's \n                gonna go first?\n\n                                 GUY\n                I got one.\n\n        He gets up\n\n                I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a \n                picture for you to see, I picked a rose for \n                you to smell, I planted grass for you to \n                touch, But you did not hear my song, You did \n                not see my picture, You did not smell my rose \n                and YOU did not touch my grass.\n\n                Woman\n                Maybe she was outta town?\n\n                                 GUY#2\n                That's not funny, his poem is about futility, \n                we toil in unrewarded obscurity.\n\n                                 MR.
