GAS STATION - DAY\n</b>\nA small desert gas station/mini-mart just off the\nhighway. A sign over the building: \"Last Gas For 30\nMiles.\" The Cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood\nraised.\n\nJeff comes out of the mini-mart, carrying a   plastic quart\nof oil. He unscrews the cap and starts to    fill the\ncrankcase, careful not to spill on the new   engine. In\nthe b.g., Amy is visible inside the store,   browsing a\nmagazine rack.\n\n\n<b>INT.

The other man\nremains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up.\n\nEarl is a beefy man about Jeff's age. He wears a sweat-\nstained Western hat, cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the\nsleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. He\nsaunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat,\nlooking over Jeff's shoulder.\n\nJeff senses something behind him, turns.

Red swings an elbow into Jeff's\nface -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw!\n\nThe steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck\ninches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice.\n\nRed gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering\nwheel continues to move counter-clockwise...\n\n\n<b>ON BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely.\nInstead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up\nand over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the\nFord under its massive weight.\n\n\n<b>IN PETERBILT\n</b>\nRed has both hands around Jeff's windpipe.    He glances up\nfor a second, reacts, but it's too late.\n\n\n<b>ON BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the\nFord, using the pickup like a ramp!\n\n\n<b>IN FORD\n</b>\nAmy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened\nunder the Peterbilt's weight!\n\n\n<b>ON BRIDGE\n</b>\nFor an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang\nin the air... then the truck is falling!\n\n\n<b>IN PETERBILT\n</b>\nRed and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still\nflailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first\ninto the gorge.\n\nThen it jerks to a halt in mid-air!\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                       113.\n</b>\n<b>ON BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on\nthe thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete\nrailing.\n\nThe Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge!\n\n\n<b>IN PETERBILT\n</b>\nJeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him.\nLoose objects from the cab rain against the windshield.\n\nThey grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply,\nforcing it at an impossible angle.

Red is about to deliver another\nblow when...\n\n... the windshield falls away! The loose items in the\ncab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below.\n\nJeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to\nthe center support column. His legs dangle over the\nhood.\n\nRed slips through the opening, his hand locking on the\nsteering wheel at the last instant.\n\nThe windshield sails away into the gorge.\n\n\n<b>ON BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under\nthe weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly.\n\n\n<b>ON PETERBILT\n</b>\nJeff feels the truck shifting. He grabs the windshield\nwiper blade with his free hand. The blade snaps away.\n\nRed is clinging to the steering wheel. He flails at Jeff\nwith his feet, swearing. Jeff is barely out of reach.\n\nJeff looks to the side. There is a grabhandle on the\ncorner of the cab. He reaches with his free hand and\nseizes the handle.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                      114.\n</b>\n<b>ON BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe REBAR GROANS.

He reaches for the passenger\nside door handle, working his way up toward the bridge.\n\n\n<b>REBAR\n</b>\ngives away once more and --\n\n\n<b>JEFF\n</b>\nscales the cab, finding more handholds.   He climbs past\nthe passenger door.\n\nBehind him, Red is working his way higher in the same\nmanner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the\ncab.\n\nJeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment.\nRed grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release\nbutton.\n\nThe passenger door flies open!\n\nRed falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the\nopen passenger door, suspended over the gorge.\n\n\n<b>IN FORD\n</b>\nAmy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to\nthe edge.
