BOMBARDED NEIGHBORHOOD (WAR-TORN COUNTRY) - DAY\n\nOn the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man TV\ncrew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all\nwearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, JEFFREY\nTAYLOR, works to repair his malfunctioning minicam.\n\nThroughout this sequence, ROD, the reporter, types on a\nlaptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around\nhim.\n\nHOWARD, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering\ncautiously over the crest of the rubble through\nbinoculars.\n\nBeyond him we see an empty street. It is lined with\nbuildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the\nf.g., a ruined high-rise at the end of the street,\nbillboards in an unrecognizable foreign language.\n\n                         HOWARD\n           How about it, Jeff?\n\nJeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed.\n\n                           JEFF\n           Done.\n\nJeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over\nthe loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard.\n\n\nEXT.

On the\nwalls, blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling\nposes, plus many black-and-white scenery stills.\n\nJeff's bag is unopened on the floor. We see two nearly\nfull wine glasses on a table. The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN a\nhallway TO the open bedroom door.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nMore framed photographs.\n\nAmy lies in bed, curled up against a pillow. The sheets\nare tangled in post-coital disarray, the only sign of\ndisorder in this neatly arranged room.\n\n                                                         6.\n\nCLOSER\n\nAmy stirs, reaching her hand out toward the other side of\nthe bed, which is empty.

DARKROOM - NIGHT\n\nA walk-in closet has been converted into a small\nphotographic darkroom. Moist 8 X 10 prints hang from a\nclothesline, bathed in a warm red glow. The images are\nmoody black and white landscapes.\n\nJeff stands over the developer, timing a print. Amy\nenters through a thick black curtain behind him.

If you want a\n          ride, there's a little diner up\n          the road. Belle's. They got a\n          pay phone.

Runaways,\n          deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks\n          hiding from the I.R.S. -- all\n          vanishing without a trace.\n\nJeff stares at the faces.\n\n                        DEPUTY CARVER\n          Now I'm not saying she's one of\n          them.

Maybe she came in,\n          maybe she didn't. All I know is,\n          I didn't see her.\n\nJeff looks around, not particularly trusting the\nBartender's skills of observation. He grinds his jaw.\n\nThe other customers at the bar have been watching all\nthis. One of them, an older grizzled BARFLY, looks up at\nJeff.\n\n                        BARFLY\n                 (confidentially)\n          None of my business, mister. But\n          if I was you I'd take a look in\n          the ladies room.\n\nThe Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer.\nSnickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes\nwhen Jeff glances at them. Jeff knows this is almost\ncertainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance.\n\nWhile the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the\ndoor of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks. His\nknock is answered by a wordless sound, HALF-GROAN, HALF-\nGASP.\n\n                          JEFF\n          Amy?\n\nSilence. Jeff tries the door. It's locked. He rattles\nit. Another GROAN. Jeff puts his shoulder against the\ndoor, heaves inward. The door swings open, revealing --\n\n                                                       42.\n\nINSIDE BATHROOM\n\nFlo, bent over the toilet, vomiting.

The barflies\nchuckle among themselves.\n\nJeff strides angrily for the exit. He stops at the door,\ntakes one last look around. No one seems to be paying\nhim much attention. He turns to leave...\n\n... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on\nit. There's something wrong here...\n\nHe stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye\ncontact? Are they hiding something?\n\nHe scrutinizes more closely...\n\nThere is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table\nshoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze\never since Jeff walked in.\n\nAnd then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight,\nsweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee.\n\nOr what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book\nat the bar? Probably an ex-con.\n\nWhile Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind,\na trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The\nBartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the\ncarbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and\nanother in a pile by the cash register.\n\nJeff stares, an idea forming...\n\nHe approaches the bar.\n\n                        JEFF\n          I want to see your order slips.\n\n                         BARTENDER\n          What?\n\n                        JEFF\n          You write down the names.

Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand\nclamps onto his.\n\n                        BARTENDER\n          Mister, I've had just about enough\n          of you.\n\n                        JEFF\n          Let me see the fucking slips.\n\nIn one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts\nthe receipts. He starts going through them, fast,\nlooking at names. TULLY, MARK, FLO, ANDY and...\n\nJeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a\nSmith & Wesson revolver.\n\n                        BARTENDER\n          Now, mister, you're going to have\n          to leave.\n\nJeff takes a step back.

Up ahead, the river\nruns over rapids before passing around a bend.\n\nEarl hears an ENGINE and turns. A huge moving van has\narrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine.\n\nHe shouts to the DRIVER, pointing downriver.\n\n                          EARL\n            He's getting away!\n\nThe Driver shouts something inaudible.

He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and\nswallowing a mouthful of water.\n\nA downed tree hangs over the river. Jeff grabs\ndesperately and takes hold of a branch. He's got it!\n\nHanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object\nfloating past in the water: the \"90,000 Donuts\" pack.\n\nJeff tries to haul himself from the river. The BRANCH\nbends under his weight. Then it comes free with a CRACK!\n\nJeff is carried downstream on the rushing water.\n\n\nON BANK\n\nEarl works his way along the shore.

He drops to his knees, retching.\n\nClutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver.\nFor the moment, there is no sign of Earl. But he could\nappear anytime.\n\nJeff gets to his feet, wincing. He looks up at the rocky\ncanyon wall bordering the river.

A TELEVISION somersaults across the\nroom and EXPLODES. Amy slams into a wall.\n\nThe speeding Peterbilt shears away a section of the\ntrailer home with a horrible RIPPING sound!\n\nThe trailer home is suddenly open to the sky.\n\n\nINT. TRUCK CAB - DAY\n\nRed puts the truck into a hard turn, circling for another\nrun at the devastated trailer.\n\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME - DAY\n\nJeff struggles to his knees.\n\n                             JEFF\n          Amy?!\n\nAmy is crawling over the debris. Jeff pulls her to her\nfeet. He grabs the rifle and car keys.\n\n                             JEFF\n          C'mon!\n\nThey stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer.\n\n\nINT. TRUCK CAB - DAY\n\nRed sees Amy and Jeff flee the trailer and head for the\nutility pickup. He throws the Peterbilt into a turn.\n\n\nYARD\n\nAmy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an\naging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted\ntoolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nJeff keys the ignition. The ENGINE SPUTTERS. Amy whips\naround to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side.\n\n                             AMY\n          Jeff, go!    Go!\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        104.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nJeff turns the key. The ENGINE CATCHES!   He throws the\nFord in gear and floors the gas.\n\nThe Ford shoots out of the Peterbilt's path!\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe FORD PEELS OUT of the driveway and joins the road,\nspewing exhaust. It's an old vehicle that doesn't\nmaneuver well.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nJeff mashes the gas pedal. The ENGINE STRAINS,\nBACKFIRING. Amy looks back, sees the Peterbilt joining\nthe road.\n\n                         AMY\n           Can't this thing go any faster?!\n\nA SHOTGUN BLAST SHATTERS the passenger WINDOW! Amy\nscreams as glass showers the cab. Jeff swerves wildly.\n\n                         JEFF\n           What the fuck?!\n\nHe swivels his head right, sees --\n\n\nFIREBIRD\n\nkicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the Ford\non the right-hand shoulder.\n\nThe driver, Billy, is levelling a shotgun through the\nwindow.\n\n\nJEFF\n\ncranks the wheel.\n\n                          JEFF\n           Get down!\n\n\nIN FIREBIRD\n\nBilly triggers a BLAST!\n\n                                                       105.\n\nAMY\n\nyelps as the passenger-side MIRROR DISINTEGRATES!    She\nwhips around, sees --\n\n\nCADILLAC DEVILLE\n\npulling even with them on Jeff's side. The drive, Al,\nleers as he spins the wheel and creases the Ford --\nCRUNCH!\n\n\nJEFF\n\nraises the PISTOL and FIRES!\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird\nas they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the\nrear.\n\n\nJEFF\n\nlets out a cry as they carom off the Cadillac. Blood\nflows in a trickle down his neck. Amy sees it,\npanicking.\n\n                        AMY\n          Jeff!\n\n                         JEFF\n          It's glass!   Use the rifle!\n\nAmy raises the rifle, thrusts the barrel awkwardly out\nthe window and aims at Billy. She FIRES wildly -- BANG!\n\n\nBILLY\n\ngrins as the SHOT WHISTLES past harmlessly. He reloads\nthe SHOTGUN, snaps it shut and RETURNS FIRE -- BLAM!\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe BLAST hits the Ford's side-mounted toolbox.     The door\nflies open. Tools scatter on the road!\n\n                                                      106.\n\nBILLY\n\nveers away, swearing, as hammers and chisels and power\ntools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path.\n\nThe front end of the extension ladder comes free from the\nlumber rack and hinges into his path, SMASHING the\nWINDSHIELD!\n\n                         BILLY\n          Sonofabitch!\n\nBilly swears and jerks the wheel, steering away. He\nglances up suddenly, sees Jeff aiming the pistol.\n\nThe PISTOL FIRES!\n\nBilly slams backward against the headrest, hit in the\nface. There's blood everywhere. The car careens toward\nthe shoulder.\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe Firebird hits a mound of earth, flies through the air\nand lands with a CRASH!\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed sees the crash, scowling. He presses the gas and\npulls closer, taking Billy's place alongside the Ford.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nAmy sees the Peterbilt advancing. Whipping her head to\nthe other side, she sees Al raising a pistol.\n\n                         AMY\n          Look out!\n\nAl jacks the trigger -- BLAM!    BLAM!\n\n\nON PETERBILT\n\na STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to\nthe trailer. The HOSE HISSES and whips through the air!\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing. Up\nahead is a long, curving downgrade. He taps the brakes.\nThere is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor.\n\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     107.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                              RED\n             Sonofabitch --\n\nHe realizes:    The trailer's got no brakes.\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe Peterbilt descends the grade, letting out a RAPID-\nFIRE BLAT of BACKFIRES. It's gaining speed, bearing down\non the Ford.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nAmy turns in the seat, terrified. The truck looms\ncloser. Jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor.\n\n                              JEFF\n             Hang on!\n\nThey are flying into a hairy curve.\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies\nthe brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward.\n\nThe Peterbilt races into the curve.\n\nRed has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk\njackknifing or the truck will fly off the road\naltogether.\n\nHe hits the brakes!\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt, tires smoking,\ncab and trailer folding at right angles!\n\nThen, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab!\n\n\nIN CADILLAC\n\nFlanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees\nthe trailer come untethered from the cab.\n\nNow the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly\nback and forth across the blacktop.\n\nAl tries to swerve away. The trailer streaks toward him.\nAl SLAMS on the BRAKES, screaming!\n\n                                                        108.\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe trailer piles into the Cadillac. There is a huge\nIMPACT as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap\nmetal!\n\nAnd just as this is happening...\n\n\nPETERBILT\n\nblasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with\na CRUNCH of METAL and taillights!\n\n\nJEFF\n\nslams against the wheel. Amy is thrown against the\ndashboard. The Ford is being propelled downhill by the\nPeterbilt.\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed\nas they hurtle down the grade.\n\n\nJEFF\n\njams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and\nFIRES at Red in the truck. BULLETS PING off the grille.\n\nThe GUN CLICKS empty.\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed hits the brakes, but it's no use. The bumpers are\nmeshed. The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding\nsideways.\n\nUp ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge.\n\n\nHIGHWAY\n\nThe Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge. The big\ntruck glances off a railing. The vehicles suddenly come\nunlocked.\n\nThe FORD plows into the concrete railing with a CRASH!\n\nThe PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away,\nSKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the\nopposite railing!\n\n                                                        109.\n\nINSIDE ROAD\n\nJeff grimaces. In front of them, the concrete railing\nhas broken away. Debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of\nthe gorge. The Ford's right front tire hangs in the air.\n\nJeff looks at Amy.   She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes\nwide.\n\n                           JEFF\n          You all right?\n\nAmy looks back at him.   She expels a long breath and\nnods.\n\nJeff forces his upper body through the driver's window\nand looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt.\n\n\nJEFF'S POV - PETERBILT\n\nIt's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. The\nengine is dead. STEAM HISSES from the crumpled radiator.\nOne tire is shredded.\n\nThere is blood on the broken windshield.\n\n\nBACK TO JEFF\n\nsitting in the driver's window. He squints toward the\ntruck, searching for any sign of Red. There is none.\n\n                         AMY (O.S.)\n          Jeff...\n\n                         JEFF\n          Yeah?\n\n                        AMY (O.S.)\n          Jeff... I can't get out...\n\nJeff drops back into the cab. The dashboard is crushed\nagainst Amy's legs. She tries to wriggle free.\n\n                         JEFF\n          What is it?\n\n                        AMY\n                 (wriggling)\n          It's just...

He climbs out of the Ford, runs around to\nAmy's side and yanks the door. It comes open with a\nCREAK of METAL.\n\nBehind Jeff on the bridge, a MOTOR KICKS OVER.   He\nwhirls.\n\n\nJEFF'S POV - PETERBILT\n\nEXHAUST BELCHES from the smokestacks. Red is behind the\nwheel. His face is covered with blood. He stares\nhatefully.\n\nWith a RASP of GEARS, the Peterbilt lurches forward.\n\n\nBACK TO JEFF\n\nHe pushes against the dashboard with life-or-death\nurgency.\n\n                          JEFF\n            C'mon, Amy, push!\n\nAmy struggles and struggles to free her legs.\n\n                          JEFF\n            Push, goddammit!\n\nAmy glances toward the Peterbilt, terrified.\n\n\nPETERBILT\n\ncreeps toward the Ford. The truck's grille is smashed.\nOne wheel RIM SCRAPES the asphalt. It gains speed.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nJeff crawls over Amy and tries pushing with his legs.\nShe winces as the metal cuts into her skin. Jeff\nstrains.\n\n                           AMY\n                    (turning, reacting)\n            Jeff!\n\n                                                       111.\n\nPETERBILT\n\nrams the rear of the FORD -- CRASH! It jars the pickup\nfarther through broken concrete guardrail.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nJeff and Amy are thrown forward by the impact. The\nPeterbilt's ENGINE ROARS. It's pushing them over the\nedge!\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed's eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces\nthe pickup farther through the broken railing.\n\n\nFORD\n\nlurches through the widening gap in the railing.\nConcrete sails into the canyon. The front tires hang\nover the void.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nJeff strains against the dashboard. It won't give.     He\nwhips around, swearing, and leaps from the Ford.\n\n                           AMY\n                    (panicked)\n            Jeff?\n\n\nON BRIDGE\n\nJeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the driver's side\nrunning board, grasping the door handle.\n\nRed heaves the door open suddenly. It strikes Jeff's\nhead with a crack! He falls backward to the ground.\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed presses the gas, yelling over the ENGINE ROAR. The\nrailing is giving way. He sees Jeff struggling to his\nfeet.\n\n                          RED\n            You think you can come into my\n            life and fuck with me?

Jeff is no longer visible.   Red frowns.\n\nSuddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff\nsurges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes!\n\nThey grapple in the cab. Red swings an elbow into Jeff's\nface -- crack. Jeff drives a fist to his jaw!\n\nThe steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck\ninches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice.\n\nRed gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering\nwheel continues to move counter-clockwise...\n\n\nON BRIDGE\n\nThe truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely.\nInstead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up\nand over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the\nFord under its massive weight.\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed has both hands around Jeff's windpipe.    He glances up\nfor a second, reacts, but it's too late.\n\n\nON BRIDGE\n\nThe Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the\nFord, using the pickup like a ramp!\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nAmy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened\nunder the Peterbilt's weight!\n\n\nON BRIDGE\n\nFor an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang\nin the air... then the truck is falling!\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nRed and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still\nflailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first\ninto the gorge.\n\nThen it jerks to a halt in mid-air!\n\n                                                       113.\n\nON BRIDGE\n\nThe left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on\nthe thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete\nrailing.\n\nThe Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge!\n\n\nIN PETERBILT\n\nJeff slams into the windshield. Red lands on top of him.\nLoose objects from the cab rain against the windshield.\n\nThey grapple. Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply,\nforcing it at an impossible angle. Their faces are\ninches apart.\n\n                          RED\n            You think you can fuck with me?!\n\nHe headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack! Blood erupts from\nJeff's nose and mouth. Red is about to deliver another\nblow when...\n\n... the windshield falls away! The loose items in the\ncab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below.\n\nJeff drops through the windshield opening. He clings to\nthe center support column. His legs dangle over the\nhood.\n\nRed slips through the opening, his hand locking on the\nsteering wheel at the last instant.\n\nThe windshield sails away into the gorge.\n\n\nON BRIDGE\n\nThe iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under\nthe weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly.\n\n\nON PETERBILT\n\nJeff feels the truck shifting. He grabs the windshield\nwiper blade with his free hand. The blade snaps away.\n\nRed is clinging to the steering wheel. He flails at Jeff\nwith his feet, swearing. Jeff is barely out of reach.\n\nJeff looks to the side. There is a grabhandle on the\ncorner of the cab. He reaches with his free hand and\nseizes the handle.\n\n                                                      114.\n\nON BRIDGE\n\nThe REBAR GROANS. The truck is wedged against the Ford.\nAs the truck slips, it forces the Ford closer to the\nedge.\n\n\nON PETERBILT\n\nJeff clings to the handle. He reaches for the passenger\nside door handle, working his way up toward the bridge.\n\n\nREBAR\n\ngives away once more and --\n\n\nJEFF\n\nscales the cab, finding more handholds.   He climbs past\nthe passenger door.\n\nBehind him, Red is working his way higher in the same\nmanner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the\ncab.\n\nJeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment.\nRed grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release\nbutton.\n\nThe passenger door flies open!\n\nRed falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the\nopen passenger door, suspended over the gorge.\n\n\nIN FORD\n\nAmy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to\nthe edge. She struggles to free her legs from the\ndashboard.\n\n                          AMY\n            Oh God... Jeff...\n\n\nJEFF\n\nclimbs higher. The Peterbilt slips again.    Below, Red\nloses his grip and almost falls.\n\nJeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of\nexertion. He runs to the passenger side of the Ford.\n\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        115.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nThe Ford teeters precariously.

As long as no witnesses\n             survived, it's an untraceable\n             crime.\n                    (looking at them)\n             You were just a couple of the\n             lucky ones.\n\nUp ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the\nroad. A cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over.\n\nJeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression.   It\nseems like a million years ago...\n\nThe FBI Agent shakes his head, disdainful.\n\n                       FBI\n                (re: media)\n         C'mon -- let's get you folks out\n         of here before things really get\n         hairy.\n\nHe escorts them to a waiting sedan. As they climb in,\nJeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene\none last time.\n\nHe gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied\nnews crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready,\nrunning alongside the departing sedan, shouting\nquestions.\n\nThrough the rear window, we see Jeff putting his arm\naround Amy, pulling her close as we hear:\n\n                        AMY\n          Promise me one thing...\n\n                          JEFF\n          Name it.\n\n                        AMY\n          Next time... we fly.\n\n\nEXT. HOUSE - AERIAL - DAY\n\nOver this last line, the sedan drives away, and we CLIMB\nHIGHER and HIGHER AWAY FROM the bristling crime scene\nuntil the ranch house is just one in a town of modest\nhouses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in\nevery direction.\n                                           FADE OUT.\n                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Mostow\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:21:41.234616"}
