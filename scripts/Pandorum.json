The door bursts open and BOWER scampers\r\n          out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the\r\n          floor, naked and gasping.

A SHUDDER travels through\r\n          the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...\r\n          A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's\r\n          cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope\r\n          out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.\r\n          We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown\r\n          with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...\r\n          SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.\r\n          He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A\r\n          drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his\r\n          sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from\r\n          his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into\r\n          his mouth as possible.\r\n          After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the\r\n          floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.\r\n          He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He\r\n          leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the\r\n          name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.\r\n          The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside\r\n          there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BOWER (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Payton? Lieutenant...

He taps the keys on a computer terminal.\r\n          Nothing.
