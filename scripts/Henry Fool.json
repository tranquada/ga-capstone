He stands \n               there in the doorway catching his breath.\n\n               His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small \n               portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away \n               in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different \n               channel.\n\n<b>                                     FAY\n</b>                              (to Simon)\n                         Where the hell have you been?\n                              (to Mary)\n                         Mom, come on and eat.\n\n<b>                                     MARY\n</b>                         I'm not hungry.\n\n<b>                                     FAY\n</b>                              (pissed)\n                         Then why'd I cook!\n\n               Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in \n               the evening.\n\n<b>                                     MARY\n</b>                         I don't know why you cooked!

She glares at her \n               brother.\n\n<b>                                     FAY\n</b>                         Sit down and eat, Simon.\n\n               Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl \n               of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. \n               Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay \n               gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the \n               bowl and eats some more.\n\n               Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container \n               of milk on the table and drinks straight from it.\n\n               He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the \n               table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of \n               cheese roll out.\n\n               He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach \n               while...\n\n               Fay and Mary look on in disgust.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n</b>\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. \n               He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach \n               and spits, sickened.\n\n               He looks up, though, and sees...\n\n               A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing \n               there in the street watching him.\n\n               Simon tries to smile at her.\n\n               But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.\n\n               He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering \n               his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill, \n               he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement.\n\n               Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting \n               dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.\n\n<b>                                     FAY\n</b>                         God, I wanna get fucked.\n\n               Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.\n\n<b>                                     FAY\n</b>                         You OK?\n\n               Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks \n               back at his sister.\n\n               Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.\n\n<b>                                     FAY\n</b>                         See ya later.\n\n               Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he \n               seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks \n               his head, sits perfectly still and listens.\n\n               He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a \n               giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles.\n\n               Titles begin.\n\n               Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, \n               the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, \n               he focuses on...\n\n               The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood.\n\n               Music starts.\n\n               He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the \n               pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on \n               the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of \n               the music over the scene.\n\n               Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and...\n\n               Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears...\n\n               The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life.\n\n               Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens \n               his eyes and sees...\n\n               A man approaching. The music swells up full.\n\n               Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in \n               wonder at...\n\n               This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak \n               striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a \n               windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled \n               tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders.\n\n               Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road.\n\n               Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops.\n\n               Titles finish.\n\n               Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the \n               house.\n\n               Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood \n               and then down at Simon.\n\n<b>                                     HENRY\n</b>                         Get up off your knees.\n\n               He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off \n               towards his new home.\n\n<b>               EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n</b>\n               Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to \n               his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying \n               the suitcases.\n\n<b>               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n</b>\n               Moments later.\n\n               The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw \n               by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs.\n\n               Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the \n               main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair \n               and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove.\n\n               Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually \n               quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon.\n\n<b>                                     HENRY\n</b>                         Where you gotta go to get a six-pack \n                         of beer around here?\n\n<b>               INT.

Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his \n               tracks when he sees...\n\n               Warren and Amy.\n\n               He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler.\n\n               Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple \n               of vampires.\n\n               Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the \n               counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening.\n\n               Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at...\n\n               Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull.\n\n               Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, \n               but...\n\n               Warren shoves himself between it and Simon.\n\n               Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at \n               Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down \n               her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering \n               back over her shoulder, she hisses...\n\n<b>                                     AMY\n</b>                         Kiss my ass.\n\n               Simon is nonplussed.\n\n               Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets...\n\n               A red light flashing above the stockroom door.\n\n               Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's \n               bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and \n               has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass.\n\n               But then...

He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and \n               tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside \n               and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture \n               of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the \n               edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and \n               torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit \n               it back into the book.\n\n               He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites \n               his lip and tries again.\n\n               He sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and \n               looks back over his shoulder to see...\n\n               Amy throws a bottle at his head.\n\n               Smash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his \n               neck.\n\n               Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out \n               of the puddle and smacking him in the head.\n\n               Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which \n               she sets aflame with her lighter.\n\n               Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the \n               ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him.\n\n               Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch.\n\n               Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, \n               while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy.\n\n               Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the \n               rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming \n               torch in his face.\n\n<b>                                     SIMON\n</b>                              (weakly, unheard)\n                         One of you is gunna lose an eye.\n\n               Amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline.

He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps \n               back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks \n               away.\n\n               Warren looks back at Simon, troubled.\n\n               He hangs there still, glaring at him.\n\n               Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. \n               Amy looks ill.\n\n<b>                                     WARREN\n</b>                         Fuck.\n\n<b>                                     AMY\n</b>                         Take me home.\n\n<b>               INT.

He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly \n               admires it.

She is dressed \n               for travel and has her coat hung over her arm, a suitcase in \n               her hand. She smiles at him, then looks from the boy to \n               someone across the room and...\n\n               Ned follows her gaze to find...\n\n               Simon, standing there before him, a suitcase in his hand as \n               well. He looks down at Ned with a calm, intrigued expression.\n\n               The boy looks up at him in awe.\n\n               Simon steps forward, pauses, then...\n\n<b>                                     SIMON\n</b>                         Get up off your knees.\n\n               He does.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He looks on in horror \n               at...\n\n               Henry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak. \n               Mr Deng is wrapping his chest in bandages.\n\n               Simon pauses, then comes closer. He reaches out and touches \n               Henry's shoulder, standing there looking down at his friend. \n               Henry looks up at him, pauses and then gestures vaguely with \n               his hand.\n\n<b>                                     HENRY\n</b>                         Look, Simon, the world's a scary \n                         place.

Coming out \n               into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on \n               his own. He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with \n               difficulty.\n\n<b>                                     HENRY\n</b>                         Gotta light?\n\n               Ned does.

Then he stands \n               before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across \n               her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently \n               and waits for his last line of crap.\n\n<b>                                     HENRY\n</b>                         I love you, Fay.\n\n<b>                                     FAY\n</b>                              (rolls her eyes)\n                         Yeah, well, tough.\n\n               But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses \n               her passionately on the mouth.\n\n               Moments later, they all help Henry into Bu\u00f1uel's car and \n               Simon gets in behind the wheel.
