This is his quality private time.\n\n               Then he hears something and looks up.\n\n               He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances \n               and sees...\n\n               Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having \n               sex.\n\n               Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then...\n\n                                     WARREN\n                              (to Amy)\n                         You want some?\n\n               Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up.\n\n               Simon is fascinated.

The \n               boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt.\n\n               Simon can't believe this.

THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon runs up and throws open the screen door. He stands \n               there in the doorway catching his breath.\n\n               His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small \n               portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away \n               in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different \n               channel.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (to Simon)\n                         Where the hell have you been?\n                              (to Mary)\n                         Mom, come on and eat.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         I'm not hungry.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (pissed)\n                         Then why'd I cook!\n\n               Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in \n               the evening.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         I don't know why you cooked! I don't \n                         know why you bother!\n\n               Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her \n               brother.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Sit down and eat, Simon.\n\n               Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl \n               of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. \n               Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay \n               gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the \n               bowl and eats some more.\n\n               Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container \n               of milk on the table and drinks straight from it.\n\n               He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the \n               table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of \n               cheese roll out.\n\n               He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach \n               while...\n\n               Fay and Mary look on in disgust.\n\n               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. \n               He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach \n               and spits, sickened.\n\n               He looks up, though, and sees...\n\n               A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing \n               there in the street watching him.\n\n               Simon tries to smile at her.\n\n               But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.\n\n               He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering \n               his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill, \n               he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement.\n\n               Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting \n               dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         God, I wanna get fucked.\n\n               Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         You OK?\n\n               Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks \n               back at his sister.\n\n               Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         See ya later.\n\n               Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he \n               seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks \n               his head, sits perfectly still and listens.\n\n               He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a \n               giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles.\n\n               Titles begin.\n\n               Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, \n               the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, \n               he focuses on...\n\n               The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood.\n\n               Music starts.\n\n               He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the \n               pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on \n               the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of \n               the music over the scene.\n\n               Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and...\n\n               Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears...\n\n               The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life.\n\n               Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens \n               his eyes and sees...\n\n               A man approaching. The music swells up full.\n\n               Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in \n               wonder at...\n\n               This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak \n               striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a \n               windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled \n               tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders.\n\n               Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road.\n\n               Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops.\n\n               Titles finish.\n\n               Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the \n               house.\n\n               Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood \n               and then down at Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Get up off your knees.\n\n               He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off \n               towards his new home.\n\n               EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to \n               his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying \n               the suitcases.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw \n               by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs.\n\n               Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the \n               main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair \n               and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove.\n\n               Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually \n               quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Where you gotta go to get a six-pack \n                         of beer around here?\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               This is a convenience store with a number of tables at which \n               to eat donuts.\n\n               Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the \n               Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the \n               safety of the counter.\n\n                                     AMY\n                         Say something.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                              (calling)\n                         She's mute.\n\n                                     AMY\n                         What?\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         She don't -- you know -- talk.\n\n               Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's \n               gaze to the door.\n\n               Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his \n               tracks when he sees...\n\n               Warren and Amy.\n\n               He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler.\n\n               Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple \n               of vampires.\n\n               Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the \n               counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening.\n\n               Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at...\n\n               Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull.\n\n               Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, \n               but...\n\n               Warren shoves himself between it and Simon.\n\n               Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at \n               Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down \n               her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering \n               back over her shoulder, she hisses...\n\n                                     AMY\n                         Kiss my ass.\n\n               Simon is nonplussed.\n\n               Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets...\n\n               A red light flashing above the stockroom door.\n\n               Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's \n               bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and \n               has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass.\n\n               But then... Simon throws up all over her.\n\n               Warren falls back in disgust.\n\n               Gnoc covers her face with her hands.\n\n               Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming \n               bloody murder.\n\n               Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as \n               Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down \n               around her ankles.\n\n               Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door \n               holding a shovel and ready to fight.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                              (scared)\n                         Oh, shit!\n\n               Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the \n               store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws \n               open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating \n               delinquents...\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                              (in Vietnamese)\n                         Stay the hell out of my store, you \n                         good-for-nothing punks!\n\n               Having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming \n               at Simon.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         Look at this! What's going on here? \n                         Simon, get up off the floor! Is this \n                         beer paid for?\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\n               Later.\n\n               Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then \n               watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases. It is filled \n               with dozens of old, worn notebooks. Henry stacks them on the \n               mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling \n               and bright.\n\n               Simon steps over and looks at...\n\n               The name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (off-screen)\n                         Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the \n                         end.\n\n               Simon looks over and sees...\n\n               Henry's silhouette against the fire. He steps forward into \n               the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor. \n               He hands one to Simon.\n\n               Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his \n               eyes to Henry.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Where do you come from?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Nowhere in particular.\n\n               He winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely \n               impressed with himself.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I go where I will and I do what I \n                         must.\n                              (stops, drinks)\n                         That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've \n                         what you might call... 'in exile'.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Why are you in trouble?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (stopping)\n                         An honest man is always in trouble, \n                         Simon. Remember that.\n\n               Simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. Henry \n               stands in a dim corner across the room.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         How do you know my name?\n\n               Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. \n               He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts \n               his finger and points to...\n\n               Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt.\n\n               Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks.\n\n               Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his \n               shoulder, laughing mischievously.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (stopping him)\n                         I am not retarded.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (pauses)\n                         Well... I'll take your word for that.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (explaining)\n                         People. I mean. They think. You know. \n                         Because.\n\n               He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up \n               gesticulating curiously with his hands. This finally dissolves \n               into a dumb stare into empty space.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I see.\n\n               Simon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from \n               off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves \n               them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to \n               Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Here. Take this. And...\n\n               He searches his pockets and finds a pencil.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         ...this. Keep them with you at all \n                         times. You ever feel like you got \n                         something to say and you can't get \n                         it out, stop and write it down. OK?\n\n               Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for \n               another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of \n               notebooks on the mantelpiece.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What are these?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (proudly, returning)\n                         This? This is my life's work. My \n                         memoirs. My 'Confession'.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (carefully)\n                         What have you done?\n\n               Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (wistfully)\n                         I've been bad.

The details of my \n                         exploits are only a pretext for a \n                         far more expansive consideration of \n                         general truths.\n                              (contemplating the \n                              notebooks)\n                         What is this? It's a philosophy. A \n                         poetics. A politics, if you will. A \n                         literature of protest. A novel of \n                         ideas. A pornographic magazine of \n                         truly comic-book proportions. It is, \n                         in the end, whatever the hell I want \n                         it to be. And when I'm through with \n                         it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide \n                         straight through the world's own \n                         idea of itself!\n\n               He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash \n               outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're \n               throwing bottles at the house.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (throwing down his \n                              cigarette)\n                         Come on, let's go break their arms!\n\n               Simon jumps up.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         No!\n\n               Henry stops. Simon looks away and sits back down.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (pauses)\n                         If I'm quiet.\n\n               He is ashamed of himself.\n\n               Henry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend \n               with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He \n               lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close \n               by Simon. They sit there in silence a while, then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Once. I forget where I was. Central \n                         America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid \n                         job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and \n                         water so foul the natives wouldn't \n                         even piss in it. This crowd of drunken \n                         motherfuckers hired by the local \n                         drug cartel shows up at my hotel \n                         room and threatens to tear me limb \n                         from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, \n                         OK, you've got me outnumbered four \n                         to one and you're gunna kill me here \n                         tonight and not a soul in this dimly \n                         lit world is ever gunna notice I'm \n                         gone. Fine. But one of you... one of \n                         you... one of you is gunna have his \n                         eye torn out. Period. Silence. I \n                         repeat myself. One of you poor, \n                         underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye \n                         ripped out of its socket. I promise. \n                         It's a small thing, perhaps, all \n                         things considered. But I will succeed. \n                         Because it's the only thing I have \n                         left to do in this world. So why \n                         don't you just take a good look at \n                         one another one last time and think \n                         it over for a few minutes more.\n                              (smokes, waits)\n                         They sober up a little, look at their \n                         shoes in confusion, then step out \n                         into the hall to talk among \n                         themselves.\n\n               Henry stares into the flames and falls silent. Simon is \n               riveted. He leans forward, on the edge of his seat...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (winking)\n                         Well, here I am, still, after all.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE. UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT\n\n               Later that night.\n\n               Simon climbs the stairs and stops when he hears raunchy sex \n               from his sister's room. He stands outside her door and \n               listens.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (off)\n                         Did you throw up all over some girl?\n\n               Simon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her room, \n               sitting on the edge of her bed, smoking. He approaches and \n               stands in her doorway.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         They were throwing bottles at the \n                         house.\n\n               Simon says nothing. He looks down at his feet.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (gesturing to Fay's \n                              room)\n                         She's got some ex-con in there she \n                         met at the bar. Tattoos all over \n                         himself and a big red bloated nose.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Did you take your pills?\n\n               Now she says nothing. She smokes and looks away.\n\n               Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication. He \n               runs a glass of water and brings it in to her.\n\n               She swallows the pills and washes them back with water.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         You want me to tell her to be quiet?\n\n               She looks away, unconcerned and cynical.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         What's the use? She might as well \n                         get it while she can. She's not always \n                         gunna have the ass she has now, you \n                         know. That's just how life is.\n\n               She throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light. \n               Simon stands there in the dark.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits \n               at the table. He listens to the traffic on the highway and \n               stares off into space. Finally, he takes the notebook Henry \n               gave him from his pocket and places it before him. But then \n               he just gazes off into the dim living-room and scratches his \n               head. Returning his attention to the notebook, he digs down \n               into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil.\n\n               He opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover. \n               Lifting the pencil, he pauses and stares at the blank page. \n               Then, after more intense hesitation, he brings the pencil's \n               dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins \n               writing in a slow, laborious hand.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n               The next morning.\n\n               Henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee \n               and some jelly donuts. Simon jumps up from where he sits \n               asleep over his notebook at the table.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, \n                         huh? Here, have a donut. Can you \n                         lend me twenty dollars?\n\n               Simon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and \n               reaches for his wallet.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Thanks. Where's the library in the \n                         scruffy little burgh?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (handing him cash)\n                         Down the highway about a mile and a \n                         half and then make a left.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Excellent! I'm polishing up the final \n                         chapters of my 'Confession' and I \n                         need a reasonably well-stocked \n                         reference section.\n\n               He lifts up Simon's notebook.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What's this?\n\n               Simon hesitates, shyly.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. \n                         Maybe.\n\n               He gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor. Henry flips through \n               the book, impressed. It is full from cover to cover, every \n               page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl. Henry frowns, \n               intrigued. Then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Can I take this?\n\n               Simon looks up, terrified. But his friend puts him at ease.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I'll correct the spelling.\n\n               EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY\n\n               Later that day.\n\n               Simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing \n               garbage.\n\n               EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               That evening.\n\n               Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of \n               soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and \n               tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside \n               and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture \n               of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the \n               edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and \n               torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit \n               it back into the book.\n\n               He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites \n               his lip and tries again.\n\n               He sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and \n               looks back over his shoulder to see...\n\n               Amy throws a bottle at his head.\n\n               Smash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his \n               neck.\n\n               Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out \n               of the puddle and smacking him in the head.\n\n               Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which \n               she sets aflame with her lighter.\n\n               Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the \n               ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him.\n\n               Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch.\n\n               Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, \n               while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy.\n\n               Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the \n               rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming \n               torch in his face.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (weakly, unheard)\n                         One of you is gunna lose an eye.\n\n               Amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline. Simon pulls himself \n               to his feet as she splashes him with fuel. Warren is waving \n               the torch deliriously above his head.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (screaming)\n                         One of you is gunna lose an eye!\n\n               Warren stops.\n\n               Amy steps back and lowers the gas can.\n\n               Simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses \n               and continues...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         One of you. I promise.\n\n               Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which \n               is too hot to handle. He drops it.\n\n               Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused.\n\n               Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his \n               hands and stares straight at Warren.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         You can set me on fire.

He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps \n               back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks \n               away.\n\n               Warren looks back at Simon, troubled.\n\n               He hangs there still, glaring at him.\n\n               Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. \n               Amy looks ill.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Fuck.\n\n                                     AMY\n                         Take me home.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Henry is at one of the tables, correcting the spelling in \n               Simon's notebook, when he looks up and sees...\n\n               Simon stumble in, beaten and bruised, dropping his classics \n               to the floor. Henry and Mr Deng rush over to him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (scared)\n                         Simon!

Like you said. I told \n                         them. And I knew I could do it.\n\n               He passes out. Henry looks at Mr Deng.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         You should take him home. He smells \n                         like a toilet.\n\n               Henry nods, agreeing, then lifts Simon off the floor. Mr \n               Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend out \n               into the parking lot.\n\n               Meanwhile, Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and \n               places them beside Simon's notebook, where it still sits \n               open on the table. She looks at it, then reads. She lifts it \n               off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply \n               engrossed.\n\n               Mr Deng watches as Henry departs with Simon, then comes back \n               into the store and stops, startled, when he sees...\n\n               Gnoc sitting there, staring off into space, the notebook \n               open in her hands before her, singing quietly.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Twenty minutes later.\n\n               Fay is in the bathroom helping Simon out of his clothes, \n               trying to clean his wounds.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (calling)\n                         Shit, Mom, we gotta get him to a \n                         hospital!\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         No!\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Oh, shut up!

She puts it in a drawer and cringes as Henry plays \n               one note on the piano.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Stop that.\n\n               He fixes her with a steady, knowing stare which causes her \n               to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her neck. She \n               steps back, exposed, when there's a knock at the door.

Henry sits on his legs and gently raises \n               the broken arm.\n\n               Outside the door, Fay bites her knuckles. Further down the \n               hall, Mary listens from her bedroom.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Okay. You ready?\n\n               Simon nods. Henry grabs hold of the arm, swallows and braces \n               himself. Simon waits, then Henry tugs the arm straight.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Aaagghhh!!!!!!!\n\n               Fay turns and runs down the stairs. Mary backs away into her \n               room and shuts the door.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n               Later that night.\n\n               Henry comes downstairs and stops, tired. Fay is sitting at \n               the table with a bottle of gin and two glasses. She has dolled \n               herself up a little and Henry likes what he sees. He looks \n               her over and she smiles. He sits. She pours. They drink.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         So, do you have, like, you know, a \n                         girlfriend, Henry?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         No.\n\n               They drink again in silence. He lights her cigarette and \n               they watch each other closely. Finally, Fay leans on the \n               table and twirls a strand of her hair between her fingers.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Do you find me attractive?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Yes, I do.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         I look young for my age, don't I?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         How old are you?\n\n                                     FAY\n                         How old do you think I am?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You look young.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (playfully)\n                         How young?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I don't know.

I mean, do I look more \n                         like twenty, or... you know, thirty?\n\n               He drinks and studies her. She presents her profile. Finally, \n               he leans back.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Thirty.\n\n               Fay jumps up, furious.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Listen, you geek, after a couple of \n                         drinks plenty of people mistake me \n                         for eighteen!\n\n               She grabs her bag and storms out of the house. Henry watches \n               her go, then chuckles deviously and splashes himself another \n               drink.\n\n               EXT.

She adjusts her waitress uniform and \n               looks mildly offended.\n\n                                     VICKY\n                         Well, I don't know, Warren.

I'm trying to \n                         change.\n\n               Vicky is hard-pressed. She wants to believe him, but knows \n               better. She thinks about it while...\n\n               Henry passes by and approaches the store.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Same time.\n\n               Henry enters and takes Simon's notebook from his pocket. He \n               flips through a few pages and selects one in particular.\n\n               He tears it out of the book and tapes it up beside the \n               register so customers can read it. He winks at Gnoc. She \n               smiles shyly and makes him a coffee. He takes it and moves \n               off to a table just as...\n\n               Vicky enters. She starts accumulating groceries, placing \n               them on the counter one item at a time.\n\n               Henry settles down and watches as...\n\n               Vicky returns to the counter with a bottle of orange juice \n               and notices the poem. She reads, holding the orange juice \n               out to her side.\n\n               Gnoc starts to ring up the other purchases as her father \n               comes up behind her, busying himself with an inventory of \n               the cigarettes.\n\n               Vicky's lip starts to tremble as she reads, a horrified \n               expression clouding her face. Finally...\n\n               Smash!!!! She drops the bottle of orange juice and stands \n               back. Mr Deng and Gnoc jump back, alarmed.\n\n               Henry tilts his head and pays close attention.\n\n                                     VICKY\n                              (screaming at Mr Deng)\n                         How dare you put something like this \n                         up where anyone can see it!\n\n               Mr Deng looks from her to the poem and then over at Henry. \n               Henry urges the man to stand up for himself.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                              (to Vicky)\n                         It's poetry.\n\n                                     VICKY\n                         It's pornography!

He sits, worried, as Gnoc comes out \n               from behind the counter and begins mopping up the mess.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Later.\n\n               Henry is at the kitchen table with Simon, working on the \n               poem.

There's 'There'. T-H-E-R-E. \n                         There are the donuts. Then there's T-\n                         H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It \n                         is their donut. Then, finally, there's \n                         'they're'. T-H-E-Y-'-R-E. A \n                         contraction, meaning they are. They're \n                         the donut people.

We are the servants of our \n                         muse and we toil where she commands.\n\n               Simon looks past him and Henry follows his gaze to find...\n\n               Mary standing at the foot of the stairs, listening to them. \n               She says nothing. She looks Henry up and down, then shakes \n               her head disdainfully and grunts.

His eyes brighten when he sees...\n\n               Fay sitting there wearing only her towel. He knocks. She \n               looks back over her shoulder and sees him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Evening, Fay.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (disdainfully)\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I've got these books for Simon.\n\n               She turns away.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Well, leave 'em there on the counter, \n                         then.\n\n               He comes in and stacks the books near the sink. Fay pretends \n               to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair \n               anyway, to show more shoulder.\n\n               This is not lost on Henry, who tarries and leans back against \n               the counter, salivating.\n\n               Fay flips through her magazine and Henry steps closer and \n               leans against the fridge.\n\n               She casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her \n               attention to the TV. She senses him step aside and follows \n               his movements without turning. Suddenly his hand appears \n               from behind her and gently strokes her hair. She freezes, \n               waits, wonders...\n\n               He leans his face down beside her. She looks at him. He looks \n               at her, then down to...\n\n               Her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair. His \n               hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things.\n\n               Her mouth drops open.\n\n               He looks back up at her. He grins.\n\n               Fay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around \n               herself.\n\n               Henry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out \n               of his face and shivers with lust.\n\n               Fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, \n               making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride.\n\n               Henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs.\n\n               He stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze.\n\n               She readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs \n               defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar.\n\n               Henry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, \n               grabs his crotch and repositions his hard-on. He takes a \n               step up the stairs, then stops. He looks over to the couch \n               and sees...\n\n               Mary, lying there, sedately amazed.\n\n               He pauses, then grins.\n\n               Mary blinks and smiles sleepily.\n\n               INT.

Seeing \n               Simon, he waves and approaches.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Hey, Simon, you a registered voter?\n\n               Simon hesitates, but then nods uncertainly. Warren hands him \n               a flyer. This year when you go to the polls, I want you to \n               consider Congressman Owen Feer. He wants to restore America \n               to its position of unmatched wealth, power and opportunity; \n               to revitalize American civilization and lead the human race \n               to even greater levels of freedom, prosperity and security! \n               He's a good man.\n\n               He steps over to the register and pays for his beer. Mr Deng \n               glares at him, distrustfully. Warren stops on his way out \n               and snarls at the old man...\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Immigrant.\n\n               He leaves.

When this thing \n                         is ready, I'll recommend he reads \n                         it. He'll respect my opinion.\n\n               Simon takes this in, then looks down at his hands and proceeds \n               carefully.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         A man was here today looking for \n                         you.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (alert)\n                         What man?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I don't know. He drove by the house \n                         a few times.\n\n               Henry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair. Jumping \n               to his feet, he paces maniacally.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Why do they torment me like this? \n                         Why? They're like a bunch of fucking \n                         mosquitoes!\n\n               A customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What do they want from you?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         They want to suffocate me, Simon! \n                         They wanna extinguish me like a flame!\n\n               Some kid named Tim, sitting at another table, turns around \n               and asks...\n\n                                     TIM\n                         But why?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         They're afraid, that's why! They're \n                         afraid of what I might do! What I \n                         might say! Think! They're afraid of \n                         my ideas!\n\n               He drinks, then returns and sits beside Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You and I are alike in this way, \n                         Simon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Yeah?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         We're outsiders. We think and feel \n                         too much and too deeply. And the \n                         world can't handle that. Our mere \n                         existence is a threat to its illusion \n                         of security. Sure, they'll name a \n                         wing of a new library after us when \n                         we're dead! But now... Now, when \n                         we're alive... Now, they wanna burn \n                         us at the stake!\n\n               He drinks, burps, then slams down the can. He glances over \n               at Tim who is still looking on.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Scram.\n\n               Tim hesitates, but then obeys. He gets up and leaves. Henry \n               returns to Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         For example, I made love to your \n                         mother about half an hour ago and \n                         now I'm beginning to think that maybe \n                         it wasn't such a good idea.\n\n               Simon blinks. Henry adds...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I mean to say, I think Fay may be \n                         jealous.\n\n               Simon is deeply confused. He looks ill. He stands and takes \n               a few steps away, staring at the floor.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I don't want to think about this.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Bad move, Simon.\n\n               Simon stops and looks at him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (pointing at him)\n                         A poet has got to be able to think \n                         about anything.\n\n               Simon pauses, then comes closer to Henry and stops.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Am I really a poet?\n\n               Henry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the \n               top of his voice.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Of course you are! A great poet! But \n                         you need experience. You need to do \n                         something to be ashamed of every \n                         once in a while, for cryin' out loud.\n\n               He walks to the door.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Come on! Let's go out! There's a den \n                         of iniquity right across the street! \n                         You got any money?\n\n               He strides out of the store.\n\n               Simon stands there, stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the old \n               man wipes off the table with a wet rag.\n\n               INT. THE INFERNO -- NIGHT\n\n               Later that night.\n\n               Henry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy-drunk \n               topless dancers. The place is rocking and the crowd cheers \n               them on.\n\n               Simon sits perched on a stool, gripping the bar with white \n               knuckles and clutching a beer, looking on in terror as...\n\n               Henry starts stripping.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n               Later that night.\n\n               Simon stumbles in and heads upstairs. But he stops, seeing...\n\n               Mary, sitting on the top step, smoking. She looks guilty and \n               tense. So does Simon.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         That man's a bad influence.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         On who?\n\n               She gets up and storms into her room.\n\n               INT. FAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when \n               he sees...\n\n               Fay, passed out drunk on her bed. Her clothes are half off \n               and her lipstick smeared. She still grips a bottle of tequila \n               in her hand.\n\n               Simon hesitates, but then goes in and removes her shoes. He \n               gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed.\n\n               Her bare limbs have their effect on Simon and he finds himself \n               staring at her thigh.\n\n               He reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked-\n               up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind. He catches himself, \n               snaps his hand away and covers Fay with a blanket.\n\n               He flees.\n\n               INT. SIMON'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon is alone in the room with his bed.\n\n               The pale sheets beckon.\n\n               He is flushed. He blinks.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               He creeps down the stairs with an arm-load of books. Sitting \n               at the table, he wrenches a nearby lamp into a more useful \n               position and begins to read.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               The next morning.\n\n               Henry stumbles up the stoop carrying a laptop computer, its \n               various accessories and a couple of coffees.\n\n               He lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen \n               counter.\n\n               Simon is asleep on the couch, still in his clothes.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (shoving him)\n                         Simon. Hey, Simon.\n                              (Simon wakes)\n                         Come on. I got ya some coffee.\n\n               Henry trudges back to the kitchen, where he whips out his \n               red pen and immediately begins to correct Simon's poem.\n\n               Simon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table. \n               Seeing the computer...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What's this?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         It's a computer. You write on it.\n\n               He reaches into his pocket.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Here's the manual.\n\n               Simon looks over the computer and flips through the manual.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Where'd you get it?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I stole it. Now listen. Remember how \n                         yesterday we discussed the relative \n                         desirability of cadence in relation \n                         to the readability of...\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (off)\n                         Oh, shit! Not you again!\n\n               Fay is on the stairs, hungover and disgusted. Henry throws \n               up his hands and gets up to go.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Simon, I can't work under these \n                         conditions.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Yeah! Get outta here, you freak!\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Get a life!\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Eat shit and die, Henry!\n\n               Mary throws open her bedroom door.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (screaming)\n                         Beast!

Simon \n               runs out after Henry.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon follows Henry out into the street and over towards \n               World Of Donuts...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, wait up!\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I am not a rapist!\n\n               But Henry stops short, seeing...\n\n               Officer Bu\u00f1uel enter World of Donuts.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Shit. Come on, this way.\n\n               And he runs down the street in the opposite direction. Simon \n               hangs back, but then follows...\n\n               INT. CHURCH -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               They scramble in and Henry is out of breath. He slumps down \n               into a pew.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Keep a look out. Tell me when he's \n                         gone.\n\n               Simon does, but then...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, what's going on? Who is that \n                         guy? What's he want?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         He wants to help me! He wants to be \n                         my friend.\n\n               He pats his pockets, looking for his smokes. Simon looks on, \n               baffled. He comes closer.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Help you with what?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (suddenly)\n                         Shhh!\n\n               He hears something, stands and moves further into the church. \n               Simon hesitates, but then follows. They hear someone crying. \n               Finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find...\n\n               A young priest named Father Hawkes. He's a wreck. He looks \n               up from his quiet sobbing and sees...\n\n               Henry and Simon standing there looking on with embarrassed \n               distaste. He lowers his head in shame.

With one final \n               cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, \n               slicks back his hair and strides off.

He nearly bumps into a girl and \n               they stop and look at one another. He tries to hold her gaze \n               for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and \n               stalks to a table. He sits and leans over the page.\n\n               After a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at...\n\n               Another girl, sitting further down the table. She looks up \n               from her reading and returns his gaze.\n\n               He smiles at her.\n\n               She gets up and leaves.\n\n               Simon frowns, confounded and returns to his book. He takes \n               out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees \n               instead...\n\n               A third girl sitting at another table, listening to her \n               Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer.\n\n               He finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to \n               his book. But he can't help himself and glances back over at \n               her.\n\n               With a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (voice-over)\n                         Why is it this beautiful girl makes \n                         me sad?

She happens to look up and their \n               eyes meet. She smiles. Horrified, he looks down.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Why don't I smile when she looks at \n                         me? I look away. Ashamed of myself.\n\n               He watches her again, thinks, then writes...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Her figure makes me violent.

Ask Henry.\n\n               He writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, \n               then stops and looks back over at the girl.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (voice-over)\n                         I can't breathe.\n\n               He tears out the page and folds it in half. Then he gets up \n               and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in \n               her work. She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset \n               with a pleasant smile. He places his note on the table before \n               her, then turns and walks quickly away.\n\n               The girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and \n               reads...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (voice-over)\n                         Why do I do this to myself?

I know the answers \n                         myself. This isn't a page of notes. \n                         It's a letter. A letter to you. A \n                         desperate act. You are a miracle to \n                         me. I can't breathe.\n\n               By now, Simon is gone from the library.

Yes, I was caught... \n                         once. I was caught in flagranti \n                         delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old \n                         girl named Susan.

You bother because you \n                         know the poem is excellent!\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Do I?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Of course you do!\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I'm not so sure sometimes.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Can you sit there, look me straight \n                         in the eye, and tell me you don't \n                         think this poem is great? That it is \n                         not at once a work of great lyrical \n                         beauty and ethical depth? That it is \n                         not a genuine, highly individual, \n                         and profound meditation on the miracle \n                         of existence?\n\n               Simon holds the stare, overwhelmed.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I, ah...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Can you?\n\n               Simon looks away, thinks a moment, then looks back at Henry.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         No. I can't.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         So, you see, you have no choice!\n\n               He goes back into the bathroom. Simon thinks a while, then...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (calling)\n                         Can you recommend it to your friend, \n                         the publisher?\n\n               No response.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry? Can you recommend the poem to \n                         him?\n\n               Still no response. Simon gets up and stands in the bathroom \n               doorway. Henry is shaving.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I mean, I think it's finished and, \n                         for better or worse, it is book \n                         length.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         That might not be as easy as it seems.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Why?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Well, it's been a long time.

They're \n                         upsetting. I'm a controversial man.\n\n               He walks around the bathroom, gesticulating.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You see, what I'm doing is too \n                         radical. Too uncompromising. It'll \n                         take time for people to see its value. \n                         It's ahead of its time, perhaps, or \n                         maybe just...\n                              (stops)\n                         A recommendation from me might do \n                         you as much harm as it does good.\n\n               Simon patiently absorbs all this, then walks through the \n               kitchen and looks across at the 'Confession' notebooks.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, why can't I read the \n                         'Confession'?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Because certain work needs to be \n                         experienced all at once in order for \n                         one to appreciate the full force of \n                         its character.\n\n               INT.

THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Mary is sitting, brooding in front of the TV, which displays \n               only static white noise. She turns it off with the remote \n               and sits in silence for a moment.\n\n               She gets off the couch and moves to the kitchen table, where \n               Fay's computer sits. She goes over and reaches up above the \n               fridge, opening the cabinet containing Simon's notebooks.\n\n               She hesitates, then takes them down and holds them in her \n               hands, as if to begin reading. But then she puts them back.\n\n               She walks over to the piano and stands there, hesitating, \n               before slowly sitting down and opening it. She lifts her \n               hands to play, then pauses and looks around behind her, making \n               sure no one is there.\n\n               But, finally, she turns back and begins playing.\n\n               She plays a sad-sounding modern classical piece with rusty \n               accomplishment. At one time she was probably quite good.\n\n               She plays for a while, gradually letting herself become moved \n               by the music. But then she stops, pauses, and looks behind \n               her.\n\n               Simon is standing in the kitchen. He has been deeply affected \n               by her playing.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Please don't stop.\n\n               She stares him down a moment longer, then looks away and \n               closes the piano. She returns to the couch and switches on \n               the TV.\n\n               Simon comes closer. He sits.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         That was nice what you were playing.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Yes, it was nice. But it was \n                         unremarkable.\n\n               Simon waits. Eventually...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Does that matter?\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (looking right at him)\n                         Yes. It does.\n\n               She gets up off the couch and goes upstairs. She slams her \n               bedroom door and leaves Simon alone on the couch. He thinks. \n               Then, he gets up and goes into the kitchen.\n\n               He takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet \n               above the refrigerator and goes to the door. He pauses, \n               clutches the poem and goes out.\n\n               EXT. SUBWAY STATION -- DAY\n\n               Simon waits, clutching his poem to his side, as a train pulls \n               into the station. Excited and determined, he gets on.\n\n               INT. TRAIN -- DAY\n\n               Simon travels to New York City. He finds an envelope on the \n               floor to put the poem in.\n\n               INT. MARY'S ROOM -- DAY\n\n               Mary wakes up and sits on the edge of the bed, feeling \n               regretful about her tone of voice with Simon.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Mary comes down into the kitchen and listens.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Simon?\n\n               No answer. She steps over to the cabinet and almost takes \n               down Simon's notebook. But doesn't. She grabs her pills and \n               is about to take them. But then she stops. She puts them \n               down and goes to the cabinet. She takes down Simon's notebooks \n               and sits at the table, pauses, then pulls them closer and \n               begins to read.\n\n               INT.

He walks \n               hesitantly up to the receptionist, a bright and spirited \n               young woman named Laura.\n\n                                     LAURA\n                         Hi, I'll take that.\n\n               Simon steps back defensively.\n\n                                     LAURA\n                         Aren't you the messenger?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         No.\n\n                                     LAURA\n                         Are you here to fix the plumbing?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I'm here to see Mr. Angus James.\n\n                                     LAURA\n                              (amused)\n                         Are you?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I'm not a plumber.

Look, this is \n                         profoundly irrelevant material. This \n                         is only my opinion. But it's an \n                         opinion I value highly.

You have talent, \n                         I admit. You have an innate sense of \n                         the musicality of language. A good \n                         ear, maybe.

He's \n               gone. Simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet.

The \n                         nose of the fish.\n\n               Mr Deng brings over the coffee.

THE GRIM HOUSE -- EVENING\n\n               Simon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street \n               and pauses in front of his house.

She looks over at him and he sees \n               she's been crying. He comes into the room and she sits up on \n               the edge of the bed.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Did you see him?\n\n                                     FAY\n                         He came by this afternoon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Did you talk?\n\n                                     FAY\n                         No.\n\n               He comes over and sits beside her.

Simon awkwardly touches her \n               shoulder, then moves his hand away. Fay pulls herself \n               together, sniffles and goes into the bathroom.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE, AT THE PIANO\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon comes downstairs and finds Henry at the piano. He looks \n               ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso. \n               He is staring sickly at 'the ring'.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Simon, I don't feel so good.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What's wrong?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I feel all kinda clammy.

He presses his hand against his \n               chest, holds his head, then stares at the ring.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         How much you think I can get for \n                         this?\n\n               He looks at Simon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (pauses)\n                         Henry, Fay's pregnant.\n\n               Henry looks at him.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Fay's pregnant with your child.\n\n               Henry lets this sink in. He stands and the room tilts. White \n               with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Fay is in the shower as...\n\n               Henry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and \n               trousers. She starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower \n               curtain. He drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet \n               just in time to begin shitting his brains out. Fay crouches, \n               terrified and disgusted, in the shower.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Jesus, Henry!\n\n               Henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent \n               and messy blast of noise and foul air.\n\n               Fay covers her face and whimpers sickly.\n\n               Finally, he's done. He hangs with his face out over his knees, \n               sick, exhausted and in shock. Fay wraps herself in a towel \n               and steps out of the shower. She creeps carefully around him \n               and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Hey, Henry.

He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly \n               admires it.

Once inside, he shakes them off and they \n               stand back. He huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out \n               of his eyes. He paces back and forth like a caged animal, \n               then stops, sees...\n\n               Fay, at the altar, waiting with Simon.

You could \n                         use that.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         So it's a good deal?\n\n                                     FATHER HAWKES\n                         Of course it's good.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         So I should take it?\n\n                                     FATHER HAWKES\n                         No. Try to get him up to a hundred \n                         and fifty thousand.\n\n               EXT. JUNKYARD -- DAY\n\n               Evening.\n\n               Henry stalks along, all fired up. Simon tries his best to \n               keep up with him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I've let myself down, Simon! I've \n                         let myself be caught in the bloody \n                         maw of banal necessity! How did I \n                         get here? How did this happen to me? \n                         I'm going to be somebody's father! I \n                         need time to think. To write. Time \n                         to finish my 'Confession'! I can't \n                         work for a living! It's impossible! \n                         I tried once. My genius will be wasted \n                         trying to make ends meet!\n\n               He collapses extravagantly.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         This is how great men topple, Simon. \n                         Their hearts are in the right place \n                         too much of the time! They get \n                         sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How \n                         could I have been so careless!\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, please, let me read the \n                         'Confession'.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         No. Not now. It's not done. I'm all \n                         washed up. I'm finished!\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Angus James is convinced my poem is \n                         going to make him incredibly wealthy. \n                         He'll read your book and seriously \n                         consider publishing it. If I ask him \n                         to. I'm certain.\n\n               Henry glances back at his friend, digesting this. He thinks \n               it over, then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Really? You really think so?\n\n               Having finally got through to him, Simon comes forward, \n               anxious to help Henry.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I'll insist he publish the \n                         'Confession'.\n\n               He paces back and forth, thrusting out his chest, for the \n               first time in his life displaying something like pride or \n               arrogance.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (adds)\n                         Or I won't let him publish my poem.\n\n               Henry sits there watching Simon, impressed with this evidence \n               of increased self-esteem. He realizes the profundity of the \n               gesture.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You'd do that? You'd do that for me?\n\n               Simon stares off into the distance.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         You saved my life.\n\n               Henry is moved. He stands and comes forward. He grabs his \n               friend by the shoulders and turns him around.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Do you realize what you're saying?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (pausing)\n                         I owe you everything.\n\n               Henry steps away, considering, then looks back at Simon and \n               extends his hand.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         OK.\n\n               Simon smiles. Henry smiles. They shake hands.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               Simon enters, comes forward into the room and pauses, looking \n               off at...\n\n               The stack of twelve books that comprise the 'Confession'.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE/BACKYARD -- DAY\n\n               Henry stands outside, watching his door.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               Simon lifts the first volume, opens it and begins reading. \n               He sits.\n\n               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY\n\n               Henry paces, drinking and smoking nervously.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\n               Simon strides the length of the living room, reading. He \n               stops, frowns.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\n               Simon reads in front of the fire.\n\n               EXT. BACKYARD/GARAGE -- NIGHT\n\n               Bu\u00f1uel, Hawkes and Mr Deng sleep sitting up as Henry talks \n               to himself. Fay leans out the back door and interrupts him. \n               He looks at her, but says nothing. She sighs and goes back \n               inside: turning off the lights.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               The next morning.\n\n               Simon sits wearily reading the final page of volume twelve \n               as the morning sun streaks into the room. Finally, he finishes \n               and slowly closes the book. He stands and crosses the room. \n               Leaning against the wall, he removes his glasses and rubs \n               his aching eyes.\n\n               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY\n\n               Simon steps out of Henry's apartment and sees Henry asleep \n               on the back stoop.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Simon stares into a glass of water. Fay sits ten feet away, \n               waiting. Finally...\n\n                                     FAY\n                         It's really that bad?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         It's terrible.\n\n               INT. ANGUS JAMES' OFFICE -- DAY\n\n               The 'Confession' lies on the big desk. Angus' hand comes \n               down upon it.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         You've read this?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         And you want me to consider publishing \n                         it?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         As part of our deal?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         Simon, this book, it's... It's really \n                         quite bad.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         That's what you said about my poem.\n\n               Angus pauses and figures. He changes the subject.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         I'm offering you a very real \n                         expression of my faith in your \n                         writing. Two hundred thousand dollars \n                         and a sixty/forty split.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         But just exactly what is the nature \n                         of your faith in my writing?\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         Look, Simon, you don't require my \n                         admiration. You require my experience \n                         as a publisher. And that experience \n                         leads me to believe your poem will \n                         make more money than any book of \n                         poetry ever published. In history. \n                         Virtually make you a household name \n                         within two years. You'll never have \n                         to work on a garbage truck again, I \n                         assure you. Or do anything else for \n                         that matter. Whereas this 'Confession' \n                         by Henry Fool...\n\n               He is at a loss for words.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         The most I can say for this is... \n                         The man is a scoundrel.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         He taught me everything I know.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         No! He encouraged all that was \n                         expressive in you to become manifest. \n                         He inspired you to act. He influenced \n                         your perception.\n\n               Simon waits a while, staring at his shoes.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         How about if my advance is only a \n                         hundred thousand?\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         It's not about money, Simon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         We could split the royalties \n                         seventy/thirty.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         I will not publish Henry Fool's \n                         'Confession'.\n\n               Simon sits and lets this sink in. Angus waits, then...\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         Will you sign the contract?\n\n               Simon continues looking out at the city. Angus waits, but \n               there is no response. Finally, Simon turns, pauses and slowly \n               crosses the room.\n\n               He sits at the table and looks down at the contract.\n\n               He signs.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n               Fay is in labor. Henry helps her into her coat as they rush \n               for the door.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Henry runs into the store and stands there, panicked, looking \n               at Hawkes, Bu\u00f1uel and Mr Deng. Gnoc runs out to get Fay.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Henry and Gnoc load Fay into the van. The van pulls out.\n\n               INT. VAN -- DAY\n\n               Henry drives recklessly. Fay rolls around in the back.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY\n\n               Fay is in a wheelchair being rushed down the hall. She is \n               gripping Henry's hand as he runs along beside her.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM -- DAY\n\n               Fay gasps and sweats as the Doctor and Nurse prepare her. \n               She is scared. She looks over at...\n\n               Henry, looking in through the window. He looks scared too.\n\n               Fay is sedated by gas.\n\n               Henry is taken away by the Nurse.\n\n               Fay stares up at the ceiling.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Henry is asleep on a row of waiting-room chairs, exhausted.\n\n               Simon comes running up the hall and finds him. It's late and \n               no one is around. He sits down beside Henry and shakes him.\n\n               Henry wakes.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Simon? You're here.\n\n               He sits up and Simon sits beside him.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (coughs)\n                         It's a boy.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         And Fay?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         She's alright.\n\n               Simon sits back, relieved. Then he remembers the rain-soaked \n               shopping bag he has with him. He pulls out a couple of cans \n               of beer and hands one to Henry.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Thanks.\n\n               They look around, seasoned conspirators and make sure the \n               coast is clear.

GARAGE -- NIGHT\n\n               The place is abandoned.\n\n               Henry comes in and, just as he is laying down to go to sleep \n               on an old couch, finds Pearl age fourteen.\n\n               She is hardened and disturbed, but frequently vulnerable and \n               scared; a troubled kid.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What are you doing here, Pearl?\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         You want some?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (pauses)\n                         Some what?\n\n               Pearl comes towards him. He is kneeling with his face at her \n               crotch level when she reaches him. She holds out a bottle of \n               cheap rot-gut wine. Realizing, he takes it and drinks. He \n               winces.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Shit!\n\n               Pearl laughs and falls back onto the couch, her sweater \n               hanging off her shoulder and her skirt hiked up and displaying \n               her underwear.\n\n               Henry stands and searches for something to sit on.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         Come sit here.\n\n               She pats the couch beside her.\n\n               He comes over, eyeing her carefully and sits. He hands back \n               the bottle. She drinks, winces and sits staring at the flames.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         That's what my dad always says.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What?\n\n                                     PEARL\n                              (dead)\n                         'You want some?'\n\n               Henry looks away, uncomfortable. She slides her gaze over to \n               him, their eyes meet, and she pins him to the spot.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         People say you were once in jail for \n                         having sex with a girl my age.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         That was a long time ago.\n\n               He gets up and stands at the window. Pearl age fourteen \n               watches him closely as she drinks, then...\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         You want some?\n\n               He looks over at her and she slides her coat off her shoulder. \n               Henry is sweating.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You oughta get outta here, Pearl.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         I was here first.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Go home.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         You go home.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Fine.\n\n               And he starts to leave.

He looks around the \n               room, then focuses on the girl.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Warren beat up your mom?\n\n               Pearl stares at the floor. She glances over at him, then \n               back down at the bottle gripped in her hands. She nods.\n\n               Henry pauses, then comes across the room, lowering himself \n               tentatively to the couch.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Is she alright?\n\n               She says nothing for a moment, then...\n\n                                     PEARL\n                              (sadly)\n                         Do you think I'm pretty?\n\n               Henry lifts his hand and covers his face. He looks up at the \n               ceiling and sighs. He returns to Pearl...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Does she need help?\n\n               Pearl reaches over and grabs his thigh. Looking up at him, \n               with tears rolling down her face, she suggests...\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         I'll suck your cock if you kill him \n                         for me.\n\n               Henry jumps away from her and Pearl throws herself down on \n               the couch, covering her face.\n\n               INT.

She looks away.\n\n               Henry looks at Warren, pauses, then gives him a sharp, hard \n               shove.\n\n               Warren stands back against the wall, pauses, then erupts \n               into viciousness.\n\n               He grabs Henry and throws him violently down the hall, where \n               he hits the wall and collapses.\n\n               As Henry gets to his knees, Warren kicks him in the ribs. \n               Henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor. Warren \n               kicks him in the side of the head.\n\n               Vicky sits back down on the bed, covering her ears.\n\n               Warren beats the hell out of Henry, kicking him in the face \n               and ribs whenever he manages to get up on his hands and knees. \n               Henry crawls under the kitchen table for safety. Warren grabs \n               his feet and drags him out. As he is dragged across the floor, \n               Henry finds a screwdriver and grabs it. He rolls over on his \n               back as...\n\n               Warren lunges down at him again and...\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Ah.\n\n               Warren is stabbed in the heart.\n\n               Henry can't believe it.\n\n               Warren can't believe it.

Simon and Ned climb out and Laura leans out \n               of the window.\n\n                                     LAURA\n                         Promise me you'll be on that plane \n                         at seven, Simon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I'll see you in Stockholm.\n\n               They kiss. The taxi pulls away. Simon comes down beside Ned, \n               takes the boy by the shoulders and whispers in his ear.\n\n               The kid takes off.\n\n               Simon looks over at World of Donuts and sees Gnoc waiting \n               there at the door.\n\n               EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Gnoc leads Simon out through the kitchen. A band is seen \n               doing a sound check, inside.\n\n               Bu\u00f1uel and Hawkes are waiting there, looking concerned.\n\n               Simon gives Bu\u00f1uel his passport.\n\n               Bu\u00f1uel nods and leaves.\n\n               Hawkes and Gnoc open the cellar doors.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS BASEMENT -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon is lead down the stairs and stops. He looks on in horror \n               at...\n\n               Henry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak. \n               Mr Deng is wrapping his chest in bandages.\n\n               Simon pauses, then comes closer. He reaches out and touches \n               Henry's shoulder, standing there looking down at his friend. \n               Henry looks up at him, pauses and then gestures vaguely with \n               his hand.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Look, Simon, the world's a scary \n                         place. I admit it. But it's not my \n                         fault. I swear!\n\n               Simon thinks about this and looks away.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I'm sorry, Henry.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Don't be. You had things to do.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         So did you.\n\n               Henry thinks about that, sighs and looks away.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Fay packs up the many books of the 'Confession' into one of \n               the old suitcases Henry first came to town with. She slams \n               it shut.\n\n               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Ned runs along the street and stops at the police car. He \n               points down the street with great urgency. The cops jump in \n               their cars and take off. He then looks over at...\n\n               Fay, leaving the house with Henry's suitcase.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS BACK ALLEY -- DAY\n\n               Same time.\n\n               Bu\u00f1uel backs his car into the alley behind World of Donuts. \n               Stepping out of the car he hands Simon back the passport.\n\n               Simon checks it and then looks up to see...\n\n               Father Hawkes and Mr Deng helping Henry outside. Coming out \n               into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on \n               his own. He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with \n               difficulty.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Gotta light?\n\n               Ned does. He has his own Zippo lighter and he proudly lights \n               his dad's cigarette.\n\n               Henry smokes, hugs Ned, then leans back and pauses. Finally...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Take care of your mom and don't start \n                         trouble you can't finish.\n\n               Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder. Then he stands \n               before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across \n               her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently \n               and waits for his last line of crap.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I love you, Fay.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (rolls her eyes)\n                         Yeah, well, tough.\n\n               But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses \n               her passionately on the mouth.\n\n               Moments later, they all help Henry into Bu\u00f1uel's car and \n               Simon gets in behind the wheel. The doors slam shut and Simon \n               steers the car slowly up the alley. Henry gazes out at Fay \n               running along beside the car with the rest of the \n               neighborhood, some of them laughing, some of them crying...\n\n               EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL -- DAY\n\n               Simon pulls up at the curb and jumps out. He helps Henry \n               climb out and together they enter the terminal.\n\n               INT. AIRLINE TICKET COUNTER -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Henry steps up.\n\n                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK\n                         Passport and ticket, please.\n\n               Henry hands them over. He glances back at...\n\n               Simon, waiting.\n\n               The clerk compares Henry to the picture in the passport, \n               checks again, then...\n\n                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK\n                              (recognizes)\n                         It's an honor to meet you, Mr Grim. \n                         Really.

Look, thanks, but..\n\n                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK\n                         Yes. Of course.\n\n               She types something more into the computer, then looks up \n               urgently.\n\n                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK\n                         You'll have to hurry, sir. They're \n                         holding the plane for you on the \n                         runway.\n\n               INT. AIRPORT GATE -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Airline representatives come rushing up with walkie-talkies \n               to meet Henry and Simon as they run through the terminal.\n\n                                     AIRLINE REP #1\n                         This way, please, this way! This \n                         way, Mr Grim! This way! Excuse me!\n\n               As they are ushered up towards the gate, Henry stops and \n               looks off at the security guards and ground crew waiting for \n               him, certain they can spot him as a wanted criminal.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (shoves him)\n                         Go on.\n\n               Henry is ushered through security. They take his ticket and \n               check his passport again. They take his suitcase and place \n               it on the conveyor belt. He passes through the metal detector. \n               They pass the metal detector wand over him and he stands \n               there with his hands outstretched, as...\n\n               Simon waits and watches.\n\n               The suitcase rolls out from the x-ray machine and as Henry \n               grabs it, he stops and looks across the security checkpoint \n               at...\n\n               Simon, standing there. He steps forward anxiously.\n\n               Henry lingers, speechless, but the airline representatives \n               are at his side...\n\n                                     AIRLINE REP\n                         Mr Grim, please, the plane is waiting! \n                         We have to hurry!\n\n               They drag him away, but Henry looks back as...\n\n               Simon stops and watches.\n\n               EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               The plane is waiting out on the asphalt and the airline \n               representative runs straight for it, calling back over her \n               shoulder to Henry...\n\n                                     AIRLINE REP\n                         This way, Mr Grim! This way!\n\n               Runway technicians rush to their positions, but Henry hangs \n               back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his \n               shoulder at...\n\n               Simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal.\n\n               He stops and waits.\n\n               Simon raises his hand in farewell and...\n\n               Henry raises his in reply.\n\n               Then Simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent \n               amongst the roar of the runway, says...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (unheard)\n                         Run.\n\n               And Henry understands. He lowers his hand, waits just a \n               moment, then turns and looks out at...\n\n               The airplane. The airline representative is shouting at him \n               from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie-\n               talkie.\n\n               He glances back once more at Simon. Then...\n\n               Henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself \n               towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with \n               every step he takes.\n\n                                                               CUT TO BLACK\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Fool\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Hal Hartley\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:52.391352"}
