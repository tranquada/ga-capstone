STUYVESANT TOWN HOUSING PROJECT -- DAY.\n</b>\tUnder the credits, the CAMERA PANS slowly across the project, \n\tcapturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment \n\thouses. Seven o'clock in the morning.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM\n</b>\tThe bedroom of a two-and-a-half-room apartment in the housing \n\tproject. It is early morning, but the shades are drawn and \n\tthe room is dark. CAMERA moves slowly across the room, over \n\tthe large double bed on which Charlie and Helen Samson, a \n\tyoung couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. They are \n\tsleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each \n\tother. One of Helen's pajama-clad legs projects from under \n\tthe light covers. We close in on Charlie's sleeping face.\n<b> \n</b>\tThe alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts \n\tinto a soft relentless buzz. Charlie's eyes open. There is a \n\tmuffled movement at his side, and Helen gets up on one elbow. \n\tThen she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted -- a rather \n\tpretty girl in rumpled pajamas -- to the alarm clock and \n\tturns it off. Charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he \n\tcan watch her. She pads back to the bed now and stands at the \n\tfoot, looking down at her husband. She produces a smile, then \n\tturns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the \n\twall switch. A shaft of light now pours into the bedroom.\n<b> \n</b>\tCharlie sits up in bed. His shoes and socks are on the floor \n\tby his feet. He reaches down and starts to put them on. \n\tSuddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, Helen's rather \n\tvague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song. \n\tThen it stops as abruptly as it began. Charlie's head slowly \n\tturns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of \n\tputting on his socks. His face is expressionless, but there \n\tis no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world \n\ttoday.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty-nine, clad \n\tonly in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, \n\this head hanging, his shoulders slumped. Behind him, the \n\tsudden noise of rushing tap water, then off. Then his wife \n\tcomes back into the bedroom. She is carrying a bath towel \n\twith which she is drying her face. Finished, she drops the \n\ttowel on the bed and begins to dress. A moment later, she \n\tpads around the corner of the bed to Charlie's front. She \n\tis still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has \n\texchanged the trousers for a half-slip. Charlie hasn't moved \n\ta muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the \n\tfloor.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tYou think it's too early to call \n\t\tmy mother?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n<b> \n</b>\tCharlie shrugs without looking up. Helen goes out of the \n\tbedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a \n\ttelephone table with a telephone on it. She dials, waits. In \n\tthe bedroom, Charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\t\t(on phone) \n\t\tHello, Ma, did I wake you up? This \n\t\tis Helen.... Well, I'll be going to \n\t\twork, and I wanted to get ahold of \n\t\tyou before I left. I called you last \n\t\tnight. Where were you and Pop anyway? \n\t\tI kept calling you every half hour \n\t\tup till one o'clock.... Oh, yeah? Did \n\t\tyou have a nice time? ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\tCAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN FOR CLOSEUP\n</b>\tof Charlie in bedroom.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN'S VOICE\n</b>\t\tWell, listen, Ma, I got something to \n\t\ttell you. I'm pregnant.... Yeah, \n\t\tpregnant.... Of course I'm sure. \n\t\tI've got the report back from the \n\t\tlaboratory.... No, you wouldn't know \n\t\thim, Doctor Axelrod.... Second month. \n\t\tHe says I can expect the baby in \n\t\tFebruary.... Well, Grandma, act a \n\t\tlittle excited, will you? ... You \n\t\tbet I'm excited....\n<b> \n</b><b>\tCLOSEUP OF CHARLIE \n</b>\tHe is not excited. If anything he is miserable. His bowed \n\thead rises slowly. The eyes open. He stares abstractedly \n\tahead for a moment. Then he sighs a profound sigh of \n\tresignation. Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly \n\tsinks back to its previous abjection. \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b>\n<b>\tINTERIOR. THE KITCHEN -- HALF HOUR LATER \n</b>\tHelen, dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two \n\tcups of instant coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan \n\tinto the two cups. The toaster is ticking. A packaged loaf \n\tof white bread is open on the cupboard shelf. Finished with \n\tpouring the water, Helen sets the saucepan back on the stove \n\tand comes out into the dining area. The dinette table is \n\tcovered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large \n\taccounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous \n\tnumbers, a ruler, several pencils and a pen, an ash tray \n\tglutted with cigarettes, a cup and saucer. \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\t\t(calling to the bedroom)\n\t\tDo you need any of this or can I \n\t\ttake them off the table? \n\n\tCharlie appears in the bedroom doorway, dressed and washed \n\tnow, a neat, clean young man in a white shirt and neatly \n\tknotted tie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI'll clean that up in a minute.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe disappears back into the bedroom. Helen picks up the ash \n\ttray and the cup and saucer.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tHow late were you up last night?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE'S VOICE\n</b>\t\tAbout two.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM \n</b>\tCharlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a \n\tfew dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting \n\tthem into his trouser pockets. The blinds of the bedroom \n\twindow have been opened, and the high August sun streams in, \n\twhitening Charlie's face. After he has pocketed his odds and \n\tends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all \n\tsorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an \n\topened notebook. He stands a moment looking down into the \n\topen notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits \n\tsome of his notes to memory. He turns a page of the notebook \n\tback to check something and then goes back to the previous \n\tpage. Now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest \n\tof drawers. The drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings \n\tand other feminine things. He finds a small roll of bills and \n\ttakes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing \n\tthe dresser drawer. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI'm taking five bucks from your \n\t\tdrawer. \n\n\tHe pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his \n\tface and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining \n\tarea.\n\n<b>\tINTERIOR. THE DINING AREA\n</b>\tHelen is seated at the dinette table, sipping coffee and \n\treading yesterday's newspaper. There are two cups of coffee \n\ton the table.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tA guy in my office is getting \n\t\tmarried, and I got clipped four \n\t\tbucks for his wedding present.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe begins assembling the mass of papers and textbooks on the \n\ttable.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tWho's getting married?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tArnold.

You can miss one \n\t\tnight, Charlie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tNo, these bachelor parties get kind \n\t\tof wild sometimes. The whole \n\t\tphilosophy is: it's the groom's last \n\t\tnight of freedom. So it gets kind of \n\t\twild sometimes.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tThat's a good philosophy to start a \n\t\tmarriage with.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWell, a bunch of guys get together, \n\t\tthey like to tear up the town a \n\t\tlittle.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe has assembled his notes and notebooks and texts in a pile \n\ton the table, ready to take with him. He sits down and \n\tbegins sipping his coffee. Helen looks back to her newspaper, \n\tfrowning a little, then looks up at Charlie again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tI think you oughta go, Charlie. I \n\t\tknow you're upset about the baby.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI'm not upset about the baby.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tCome on, Charlie. I know how you \n\t\tfeel. Listen, you don't have to \n\t\tpretend you're excited about the \n\t\tbaby. We weren't exactly planning \n\t\ton a baby right now ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI'm not upset about the baby.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tIt's a shock. I had some bad days \n\t\tbefore I told you. I said: \"Oh, boy, \n\t\tthat's all we need. A baby.\" Then I \n\t\tsaid to myself: \"If I'm having a \n\t\tbaby, I'm having a baby. That's all \n\t\tthere is to it.\" And I like the idea. \n\t\tWe're going to have a family, \n\t\tCharlie. I like the idea.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWell, give me a couple of days to \n\t\tget used to the idea. I'll be all \n\t\tright.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tI know you will, Charlie. That's why \n\t\tI think you ought to go to this \n\t\tbachelor party tonight.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(bursting out) \n\t\tI don't want to go to this bachelor \n\t\tparty.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe looks down at his coffee, embarrassed at the outburst.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry I yelled.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tDon't be silly.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI better get going. Kenny's probably \n\t\twaiting for me now. I'm sorry I \n\t\tyelled like that.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tWhat are you sorry about? Don't I \n\t\tyell at you all the time?\n<b> \n</b>\tWE STAY ON HELEN, as she reads her newspaper, but there is \n\ta faint frown on her face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. LOCAL PLATFORM EASTSIDE IRT SUBWAY\n</b>\tAn express train hurtles southward. We see it flashing by \n\tthrough the concrete pillars of the subway. \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tIRT EXPRESS HURTLING SOUTHWARD\n</b>\tCharlie and another young man, named Kenneth, are seated in \n\ta crowded subway car. People are standing tightly in the \n\taisles. Kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty-odd. He \n\thas his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to \n\tthe August heat. Charlie is neatly and coolly dressed. He \n\thas two notebooks and a battered text in his lap. He is \n\treading the text. Two young white-collar workers on their \n\tway to work. They ride along silently for a moment. Kenneth \n\tis rather stealthily concerned with a full-busted young \n\twoman who is standing directly in front of him, holding on \n\tto a strap. It is summertime, and the girls all wear light \n\tsummer frocks. There is a feeling of wistful sensuality to \n\tthe scene.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tYou going to Arnold's bachelor party?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI don't think so, Kennie. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI got two classes tonight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tYeah, I was going to go, but I think \n\t\tI better not, because my kid, the \n\t\tyoung one, the girl, she's been \n\t\tacting up again lately. She's got \n\t\tsome kind of allergy, the doctors \n\t\tdon't know what.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tThese bachelor parties get kind of \n\t\twild sometimes. Eddie Watkins is \n\t\tmaking all the arrangements. He's \n\t\tprobably got us lined up with a \n\t\tbunch of chorus girls.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tYeah, do you think so?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tYou know Eddie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tYeah, boy, he really lives it up, \n\t\tdon't he? Did you see that blonde \n\t\twho picked him up for lunch last \n\t\tweek? Boy, sometimes I wish I was a \n\t\tbachelor. Well, you know what I mean. \n\t\tI never seem to get out of the house \n\t\tany more, you know what I mean? \n\t\tAbout once a week, I go to the \n\t\tmovies. We never even see the whole \n\t\tpicture. My wife starts worrying \n\t\tabout the kids. My youngest kid, the \n\t\tgirl, she's got some kind of rash. \n\t\tWe don't know what it is. I never \n\t\tseem to see anybody any more. Do you \n\t\tknow how long it is since I've seen \n\t\tWillie Duff? I haven't seen Willie \n\t\tin about six months. My wife can't \n\t\tstand his wife. You ever seen her, \n\t\tWillie's wife?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tNo, I didn't know Willie too well. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tBoy, wait'll you have kids, boy. \n\t\tYou'll never get out of the house.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tHelen's pregnant now.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tNo kidding.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tYeah.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tOh, that's wonderful, Charlie, \n\t\tthat's wonderful! \n\n\tThe two young husbands look down again at their hands and \n\tride along silently. Kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the \n\tgirl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention \n\tdrift down the length of the car.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tHey, there's a guy down there, \n\t\ttrying to pick up a girl down there.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe is referring to a Young Fellow who elbowed his way down \n\tthrough the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he \n\tnoticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down \n\tfrom Kenneth. The Girl is reading a newspaper. The Young \n\tFellow stares at her. The Girl, aware of this sudden \n\tattention, looks briefly up from her newspaper. The Young \n\tFellow smiles pleasantly. The Girl, with a show of \n\tannoyance, looks back to her newspaper.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tWere you with us about eight years \n\t\tago when I picked up that chick in \n\t\tfront of the bus stop in Paterson, \n\t\tNew Jersey?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWhen was this?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tYeah, you were there. You were with \n\t\tthat girl from Brooklyn. We just \n\t\tcame from Palisades Amusement Park, \n\t\tand we were driving Frankie Klein's \n\t\tgirl home, and the car broke down \n\t\tright in the middle of Route One.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(beginning to laugh) \n\t\tOh, yeah.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\t\t(laughing) \n\t\tAnd Frankie opened up the hood and \n\t\tthe water cap blew right up in the \n\t\tair.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tAnd the cop came over ... \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tThat's right, the cop. He thought \n\t\tFrankie shot off a gun....\n<b> \n</b>\tThey are both laughing audibly now at the memory.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tHe was going to pull us all in. Oh, \n\t\tman!\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tFrankie, he was funny.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tOh, that was a lot of fun, those \n\t\tdays.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tYeah, they were.\n<b> \n</b>\tThe little spasm of laughter is over. A sort of ruefulness \n\tsettles down on the two young husbands. Kenneth looks lazily \n\tdown the aisle to see how the Young Fellow is making out \n\twith The Girl. He seems to be making out all right. They are \n\tlooking steadily at each other now. Kenneth turns back to \n\tCharlie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tHey, this guy's making out all right. \n\t\tShe's giving him the eye now.\n\n\tCharlie leans forward to see this progress.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\t\t(looking out the \n\t\t\twindow at the passing \n\t\t\tlocal station) \n\t\tWhere are we now, Prince Street? I \n\t\tbet you he picks her up before we \n\t\thit Chambers Street.\n<b> \n</b>\tSomehow this has a sobering effect on the two young husbands. \n\tAgain they sit silently as the train buckets along.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tBoy, I'm bushed today. I was up till \n\t\ttwo o'clock last night on this thing \n\t\there. I'm getting to be a nervous \n\t\twreck. I snarled at Helen this \n\t\tmorning. I think this whole night \n\t\tschool business is getting me down. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tI don't see how you do it.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tNeither do I. I thought I was \n\t\tthrough with it. The plan was for me \n\t\tto quit work and go to college full \n\t\ttime and cram through in a year or \n\t\tso. But now we got this kid coming, \n\t\tand Helen's going to have to quit \n\t\ther job, and that sets me back where \n\t\tI started from. Another five years \n\t\tof this, summers included.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tI couldn't do it, man, I'll tell you \n\t\tthat. I wish I could, but I couldn't.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tOh, what am I griping about? This is \n\t\tthe life I picked out for myself. \n\t\tBut it's a grind, boy, I tell you. \n\n\tThey sit silently again. The train hurtles along and then \n\tsuddenly slows as it approaches a stop. There is a rustle of \n\tmovement among the passengers in the subway car. A few \n\tpeople start edging toward the doors. The Girl reading the \n\tnewspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly \n\tin the Young Fellow's face. They regard each other.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG FELLOW\n</b>\t\t\t(to the girl)\n\t\tExcuse me, can you tell me how to \n\t\tget to the Nassau Street exit?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tWell ... well, at the top of the \n\t\tstairs, you'll see all the signs.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG FELLOW\n</b>\t\tAre you getting off here?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tYes.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG FELLOW\n</b>\t\tWell, I'll follow you then. That'll \n\t\tbe easier, if you don't mind.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tNo, not at all.\n<b> \n</b>\tThey start to crowd down the aisle. The train is chugging \n\tinto the Chambers Street station, and we can see the \n\tyellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces. \n\tThe two young husbands, who had been following the byplay \n\tbetween The Girl and the Young Fellow, now watch them slowly \n\texit. There is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both \n\ttheir faces.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b>\n<b>\tEXTERIOR. THE OFFICE\n</b>\tWe look down on the bookkeeping department of a life \n\tinsurance company in downtown Manhattan area around Pine \n\tStreet. It is a fairly large room, large enough to hold \n\televen desks. But you get the feeling that this is one of \n\tthe smaller offices on the floor. You get the feeling that \n\tthis company occupies three or four floors of this building. \n\tDespite the size of the office, it has a cluttered look. \n\tEach desk has piles of paper on it, and all the impedimenta \n\tof the bookkeeper -- the pens and pencils, the adding \n\tmachine, the telephone. Some of the desks have typewriters. \n\tAlong the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall \n\tbins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers. At \n\tthe far end of the room, there is a row of windows, but it \n\tis still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights \n\ton all day. They are on now. There are two middle-aged \n\twomen standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather \n\theavy-set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a \n\tdesk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although \n\tit is still ten minutes shy of eight-thirty.\n<b> \n</b>\tKenneth and Charlie enter. Ad lib hellos between them and \n\tthe two middle-aged women. Charlie moves to the coat rack to \n\thang up his jacket, drops off his books on his desk, starts \n\tfor the coat rack. Behind Charlie, we see Kenneth, carrying \n\this jacket, moving to his desk, up where the middle-aged man \n\tis working.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tHiya, Walter.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tHiya, Walter.\n<b> \n</b>\tWalter, the middle-aged man, nods his good mornings.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\t\t(poking in his desk \n\t\t\tdrawer; amiably) \n\t\tWalter, what time do you come in in \n\t\tthe mornings?

I get \n\t\tthe feeling sometimes, you stay here \n\t\tovernight. \n\n\tWalter merely nods, doesn't bother to look up from the work. \n\tKenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer, unwraps it. Two \n\tmore women, gray-haired and bespectacled, come into the \n\toffice. There is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background. \n\tCharlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tArnold in yet?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\tHe starts his vacation today. He's \n\t\tgetting married Sunday, you know.\n<b> \n</b>\tCLOSEUP of Charlie looking out the window into the bright \n\tAugust morning. His face is just a little ruffled by a \n\tfrown, and there is a kind of pain in his eyes. Behind him, \n\tWalter and Kenneth.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\t\t(a nervous, anxious man) \n\t\tWell, the doctor was over last night. \n\t\tBrought over the X rays; brought \n\t\tover the allergy tests.

Asafetida. \n\t\tNow, they call it asthma, and you \n\t\thave to go to Arizona. I said to him: \n\t\t\"Doctor, you're a professional man, \n\t\tfour years of college, premedical \n\t\tschool, Bellevue, several diplomas. \n\t\tAnswer me a question.

I said: \"For \n\t\theaven's sakes, you listen to \n\t\tdoctors, we'll all be dead.\" My son, \n\t\tHarold, believe me, he's going to be \n\t\ta doctor. That's some racket, boy. \n\t\tSixty-eight dollars.\n<b> \n</b>\tCLOSEUP of Charlie, still at the window, when a bell \n\tsuddenly clangs, indicating the start of the workday. The \n\tsudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes \n\tbriefly against the noise.  Walter, in background, who had \n\trisen and was bent over Kenneth's desk, darts nervously back \n\tto his own desk.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\tYou better get to work.

I have a feeling.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe hunches over his ledgers again, his anxious, harried face \n\tdrawn into intense wrinkles of concentration. Several other \n\twomen have come into the office by now, and there is a \n\tgeneral movement to the desks. There is the click of a \n\ttypewriter, and Walter runs his fingers glibly over the \n\tadding machine on his desk. The day has started.\n<b> \n</b>\tAfter a moment, Charlie turns from the window and comes back \n\tto his desk, sinks down onto his chair.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b>\n<b>\tINTERIOR. THE OFFICE -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER\n</b>\tWe look down on the bookkeeping department. All the desks \n\tare occupied but two. There are six women and our three men. \n\tThe office is silent with industry, everybody's head bent \n\tover his desk. There is the occasional punctuation of an \n\tadding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing.\n<b> \n</b>\tOur three men are bent over their tally sheets, worksheets, \n\tand ledgers, occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate \n\tsomething on the adding machine. After a moment, Walter says:\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\t\t(without looking \n\t\t\tup from his work) \n\t\tYou fellows going to Arnold's party \n\t\ttonight? \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\t\t(without looking up) \n\t\tNo, I'm not going, are you?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\tNo. Eddie already hooked me for four \n\t\tbucks for Arnold's present.

I just said that \n\t\tif I knew Eddie, we'd probably wind \n\t\tup with some of his crazy girl \n\t\tfriends. \n\n\tWalter looks back down to his work again. \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tI don't know where he gets all these \n\t\tgirls. He's a screwy looking jerk.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\tDid you see that blonde who was up \n\t\there looking for him last week?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tYeah.

I walk \n\t\tout of here, and I got three kids \n\t\tand a wife, all of them with their \n\t\tpalms out. I lost two bucks playing \n\t\tpoker at my house last week.

If that ever happened to me, I \n\t\tthink I'd kill myself. What does \n\t\tEddie care? So he scrambles around \n\t\tfor another job. Flaherty told me \n\t\tlast week I had too many days off. \n\t\tI told him I was sick in bed. What \n\t\tdo you want me to do?\n<b> \n</b>\tHe turns back again to his work, his face creased with \n\tanxiety. The three men work silently for a moment. Then the \n\toffice door opens, and a man of about thirty-five, a little \n\tstout, but rather casual in his dress, wearing steel-rimmed \n\tglasses, enters. This is Eddie Watkins, the office bachelor. \n\tHe seems to have had very little sleep the night before. His \n\teyes, behind the wire-rimmed glasses, are heavy-lidded. A \n\tcigarette dangles listlessly, from his mouth. There is \n\tsomething of the bacchanalian libertine about Eddie. There \n\tis a perfunctory exchange of hellos and good mornings, \n\testablishing that this is Eddie. He shuffles with ineffable \n\tweariness to his desk.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\tHi, Eddie, you're early today, only \n\t\ttwenty minutes late, what happened?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\t\t(muttering through \n\t\t\treluctant lips) \n\t\tFlaherty come in yet?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tKENNETH\n</b>\t\tNo.\n<b> \n</b>\tEddie sits down at his desk, pulls his cigarette \n\tautomatically for a moment.

He picks up the phone. \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tMary, give me an outside line....\n\t\t\t(he pauses, checks \n\t\t\tthe number in the \n\t\t\tphone book again, \n\t\t\tdials, waits) \n\t\tHello, is this Leathercraft on \n\t\tMadison Avenue? ...

Well, he didn't know either, \n\t\tso he said: \"Come on over to my \n\t\tgirl's house with me tonight. \n\t\tThey're making all the arrangements \n\t\tfor the wedding now.\" So I called \n\t\tyou and left a message at the desk \n\t\tsaying I couldn't get over till \n\t\tabout ten o'clock....

He's \n\t\tcome all the way down from Boston \n\t\twith his whole family to go to the \n\t\twedding. The only trouble was, he \n\t\twasn't invited.

There are a number of restaurants \n\tdotting the street with their little striped awnings and \n\tmodest neons. If we are on our toes, we notice one neon that \n\treads: \"LOUIE'S.\"\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR.

They all \n\tseem to be in the best of spirits. The new member of the cast \n\tis Arnold, the groom, a towheaded, pleasant-looking young man \n\tof thirty, shy to the point of being noticeable. Of all the \n\tmen at the party, he is the quietest. He sits, a smile nailed \n\tonto his face, turning his head from one friend to another as \n\tthey talk, enjoying the rare privilege of being liked. The \n\tdinner is over. During the ensuing scene, a bus boy continues \n\tto remove the used dishes. Several large bottles of beer and \n\ttwo fifths of Scotch are on the table. There is a welter of \n\tvariously assorted glasses. Eddie, Walter, and Kenneth are \n\tsmoking cigars, Charlie a cigarette. The Groom is not \n\tsmoking.  We have cut into the scene during a jumble of \n\tconversation. Walter is talking to Charlie, whose head is \n\tbent toward the older man.

I cried for two weeks. \n\t\tI don't know what to do about it, \n\t\tHelen. Should I bring it out in the \n\t\topen with Mike or should I just keep \n\t\tmy mouth shut like the other time? \n\t\tBecause he's not going to leave me. \n\t\tEven if he doesn't care about me, \n\t\the has his kids to think about. We \n\t\tmarried too young. That was our big \n\t\tmistake.

In \n\tthis shaft of light, we can see Eddie moving from behind the \n\tprojector to the wall switch and turning on the lights. The \n\troom is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint \n\tagainst the sudden glare. They have all changed their \n\tpositions and taken off their jackets and loosened their \n\tties. They are lolling about. CAMERA LOOKS DOWN TO THE FLOOR \n\tto take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an \n\topened fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of \n\tcigarettes, a cup and saucer, somebody's shoes, somebody's \n\tjacket that has fallen off the back of a chair.

Helen sits curled at one \n\tend, head down listening to Julie, who has been talking and \n\tprobably crying a little since we last saw them forty-five \n\tminutes ago. Julie is seated with her legs stretched out in \n\tfront of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch. \n\tShe is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard \n\toutburst over with.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tJULIE\n</b>\t\t...

He spends his whole youth trying \n\t\tto be a doctor, a lawyer, an \n\t\taccountant.

In \n\t\tthe end, they have nice homes in New \n\t\tRochelle, and a maid, and their \n\t\tmaids are happier than they are. But \n\t\tsometimes it does work. It can be \n\t\tdone, Helen.

It's just -- \n\t\tit's just I feel we're not really \n\t\tclose any more. I mean, he comes \n\t\thome from school, lots of times I'm \n\t\tasleep already.

I don't know if you \n\t\tremember me in those days, but it \n\t\twas rough. I used to go out every \n\t\tnight, put a load on, and make a \n\t\tpass at any girl who looked at me. \n\t\tAnd I mean any. Big, tall, short, \n\t\tfat, anything. Well, one night I \n\t\tpicked up some tomato somewheres, \n\t\tand we were sitting in a bar or \n\t\tsomewheres, and I kept calling her \n\t\tAlice all night.

THIRD STREET\n</b>\tOur bachelor party, now down to four carousers, ambles along \n\tthe rather filled sidewalk, looking at the cardboard cutouts \n\tof the strippers in the windows of the night clubs.\n<b> \n</b>\tThe four men pause before one of the strip-joints, examining \n\tthe cardboard cutout and billboard which promises first-rate \n\tentertainment inside.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR.

There is a strip going on. \n\tIt doesn't look very interesting. \n\n\tOur four men are huddled over a very small table in one of \n\tthose Third Street clip-joints. It is a dark little hovel, \n\tbut a blue stage light drifts across the table, vaguely \n\tilluminating our four celebrators. Behind them, a strip \n\ttease is in progress. Every now and then, an almost stout \n\twoman in her forties, garish in the blue spotlight, dressed \n\tin a white satin ill-fitting gown, moves in and out of our \n\tview. Half the tables and wall booths are occupied. There is \n\ta horseshoe bar off in the recesses of the club. A three-\n\tpiece band is playing spiritlessly.\n<b> \n</b>\tWalter is gone, deep in some painful, drunken world of his \n\town. Charlie rubs his eyes as if to keep his senses awake. \n\tArnold, who is soggy, is leaning toward Eddie, who alone of \n\tthe four men is giving any attention to the show.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tSo what do you think of my girl, \n\t\tEddie? You met her. Be honest with \n\t\tme. Tell me the truth. I had the \n\t\tfeeling you didn't like her.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tCome on, come on, Arnold.

This girl, I'm supposed \n\t\tto marry, she's all right, but I'm \n\t\tnot really attracted to her, you \n\t\tknow what I mean? That's important,\n\t\tisn't it?

She's some \n\t\tkind of tenth cousin. She's all \n\t\tright. She's quiet. I kissed her a \n\t\tcouple of times. She just sat there \n\t\tand I kissed her. I think she \n\t\texpected more. She even asked me \n\t\tthat. She said to me: \"Are you \n\t\tafraid of me?\" I really don't go out \n\t\twith women much. You know.

STREET -- NIGHT\n</b>\tOur four amble along Washington Square North, headed west. \n\tIn the background, the high apartment houses. It is about \n\tmidnight now, and there are a number of people around, and \n\tthere are lots of lights in the windows. There is still the \n\tfeeling of life. However, some of the wind has gone out of \n\tour bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on \n\tLexington Avenue. Now, of course, there are only four of \n\tthem, and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about \n\tthem.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT\n</b>\tThe four men straggle along Tenth Street east of Seventh \n\tAvenue. This is a dark little street. Off at the \n\tintersection, you can see Seventh Avenue and an occasional \n\tcar moving downtown, but West Tenth Street right now seems \n\tan empty, sleeping street of dark and old little apartment \n\thouses. The houses sometimes have little stoops. On one of \n\tthe stoops, there is a woman sitting. She is in her thirties, \n\tnot attractive nor unattractive. She wears a light summer \n\tfrock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the \n\tidea of pushing the other one off too. As the four men \n\tapproach her, she looks up, half quizzically, half \n\tquestioningly. The four men note her in passing and seem to \n\tcontinue on, but then come to a dragging halt about ten \n\tpaces down.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tCLOSE GROUP SHOT OF THE FOUR MEN.\n</b><b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tI think we've got one for you, \n\t\tArnold.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tOne what?\n<b> \n</b>\tEddie looks back to the woman on the stoop. They all turn to \n\tlook. Actually, Charlie has ambled a few paces even further \n\tdown and doesn't know quite why they've stopped.

Arnold looks briefly at The Woman and then \n\taway again.\n<b> \n</b>\tShe turns and goes up the steps into the building, her \n\tleather heels clicking on the stone steps. Arnold, head \n\tdown, and Charlie, a little sheepishly, follow her.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. THE HOUSE\n</b>\tA dark, ill-lit hallway. A flight of stairs going up, wooden \n\trailings, worn carpeting. The Woman starts up the stairs, \n\tthe two men following her.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE WOMAN \n</b>\t\t\t(as she goes) \n\t\tSsshhh....\n<b> \n</b>\tArnold, wetting his lips, nods. The Woman reaches the first \n\tlanding.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. LANDING\n</b>\tThe Woman has come around to one of the three doors on the \n\tlanding and is inserting a key into a lock. Arnold and \n\tCharlie appear now at the head of the stairway. The Woman \n\tgoes into her room, leaving the door open. A moment later, \n\ta shaft of light streams out into the landing. For a moment, \n\tnothing happens. Then Arnold and Charlie amble slowly down \n\tthe landing to the open doorway and shaft of light.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tHey, Arnold, you don't have to go \n\t\tthrough with this.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tI think I should.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI'll wait out here for you, okay?\n<b> \n</b>\tArnold nods and goes into the room. He closes the door. \n\tCharlie takes out a cigarette and lights it and inhales \n\tdeeply. He feels a little sordid. There is the sound of \n\tsteps, muffled by the carpeting, coming down the stairs. A \n\tman appears coming down from the floor above. He gives \n\tCharlie a quick look and continues on down the landing to \n\tthe stairs and down again. Charlie scowls at the floor. He \n\tsmokes his cigarette.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. THE WOMAN'S ROOM\n</b>\tIt is a furnished room for which the woman pays eleven \n\tdollars a week. It is not particularly unkempt or tarty. \n\tThere is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on \n\tan end table. There is a studio couch with a neat spread and \n\tthrow pillows on it. The Woman stands expressionlessly in \n\tfront of the old chest of drawers. She has kicked off one \n\tshoe and she is now kicking off the other. She starts to say \n\tsomething:\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE WOMAN\n</b>\t\tListen, I don't want you to think I \n\t\tdon't have a job. I got a job. I \n\t\twork.\n<b> \n</b>\tShe stops abruptly as Arnold, who is sitting, eyes averted, \n\ton a straight-back wooden chair, suddenly stands up and \n\tmoves toward the door.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE WOMAN\n</b>\t\tWhat's the matter?\n<b> \n</b>\tArnold's lips open to form words, but nothing comes out, and \n\the clamps his mouth tight and just stands, miserable and \n\twretched. His hand makes a nervous, spasmodic, involuntary \n\tgesture, and he quickly clenches his fist. Beads of sweat \n\tare on his forehead. \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE WOMAN\n</b>\t\tAre you afraid of me?\n<b> \n</b>\tArnold's head has started to shake nervously, and he opens \n\tthe door and steps out into the landing. The Woman, \n\tbeginning to get angry, follows him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. LANDING\n</b>\tCharlie looks up at the opening of the door and Arnold's \n\tentrance. The Woman stands in the doorway. Arnold moves \n\tquickly past Charlie about halfway down the landing, white-\n\tfaced and trembling.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE WOMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(getting a \n\t\t\tlittle shrill) \n\t\tWhat's the matter? Hey. Hey, you. \n\t\tHey, you, what's the matter?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tLet's go.\n\t\t\t(to The Woman) \n\t\tWhat's the trouble?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE WOMAN\n</b>\t\tI don't know.

All right, all \n\t\tright.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE WOMAN\n</b>\t\tHow about that, huh?\n<b> \n</b>\tShe turns angrily, goes back into her room (ad libbing as \n\tshe crosses) and slams the door. Charlie moves down the \n\tlanding to Arnold, who looks at him wide-eyed, almost in \n\tterror.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWhat happened, Arnold?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tI don't know. I'm just scared.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tYeah, I don't blame you, I'd be \n\t\tscared too like this. I don't know \n\t\twhy we dragged you up here in the \n\t\tfirst place. It's a barbaric custom. \n\t\tCome on.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe has taken Arnold's arm and would lead him down the \n\tstairs, but Arnold pauses again at the first step.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tDon't tell Eddie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tNo I won't, Arnold.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tWhy don't we just sit here for ten\n\t\tminutes or so? \n\n\tCharlie frowns, then shrugs.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tAll right, Arnold.\n<b> \n</b>\tThey both sit slowly on the steps. Arnold is still trembling \n\tfrom the whole terrifying experience.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tDon't ever tell anybody.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tIt's nothing to be ashamed of.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tPlease, Charlie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI won't tell anybody.\n<b> \n</b>\tA man's voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE\n</b>\t\tAnything wrong down there? \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(calling back) \n\t\tNo. No. Nothing wrong.\n<b> \n</b>\tCharlie sits. CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to both men. The whole \n\texperience has depressed Charlie, and it shows on his face.\n<b> \n</b>\tCAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK so that we get the small, sordid \n\tfeeling of the two men, somewhat tight, sitting on a dirty \n\till-lit staircase outside a whore's bedroom.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\tINTERIOR. CORNER BAR\n</b>\tNeighborhood bar with about ten people in it. Eddie and \n\tWalter are two of them. Eddie is playing on one of those \n\tbowling machines. He seems surly, ill-tempered, restless.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tHey Walter -- you know what we \n\t\tought to do, don't you? We ought to \n\t\tgo to that party. Remember that girl \n\t\tCharlie picked up on Tenth Street?\n<b> \n</b>\tWalter, who is so drunk he is sober, looks up at Eddie with \n\tblurred eyes.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tWALTER\n</b>\t\tI'm going to die, do you know that?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tNot tonight, Walter.

Oh, these \n\t\tparties are mad, man. All the women \n\t\twear pajamas, and all the men wear \n\t\tbeards. Everybody sits on the floor. \n\t\tArnold, you got any money? I spent \n\t\tmy last buck on those drinks. How \n\t\tabout you, Charlie?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\t\t(assessing his assets) \n\t\tI got a little over a buck.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tWhat are we, all out?

He finds it, brings it out, \n\topens the door carefully, goes into his apartment.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT\n</b>\tCharlie comes in. The dining area is lit, and there is the \n\tlamp lit in the living room. As Charlie moves to the living \n\troom, we can see that Helen is seated on the couch, \n\twatching television. The gray-white light of the television \n\tset drifts out into the room. Helen is in her pajamas and \n\tshe has washed for bed; her face is devoid of make-up. She \n\tis half-watching television; the rest of her attention is \n\tdevoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of \n\tmanicure. She looks up as Charlie comes into the living \n\troom, smiles.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tHiya, have a nice time?\n<b> \n</b>\tCharlie shrugs. He is depressed and can't conceal it.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI'm taking ten bucks. A couple of \n\t\tthe guys are waiting outside.

He stands, watching the \n\ttelevision set out of which is now pouring the end of an \n\tanimated cartoon commercial. Then the familiar tinkling \n\tmusic sets in, the inscription, \"The Late Show\" appears on \n\tthe screen, and the announcer's voice informs us that we are \n\tnow going back to the late show, starring Rex Harrison in \n\t\"Strictly Dishonorable.\" The whole thing brings a wince of \n\tpain to Charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily \n\tthrough the little foyer into the darkened bedroom. Enough \n\tlight flows in from the other rooms to show Charlie going to \n\tthe drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a \n\tten-dollar bill. He returns the other bills, closes the \n\tdrawer and just stands there, suddenly so weak and exhausted \n\tthat he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of \n\tdrawers.\n<b> \n</b>\tBack in the living room, Helen still sits, a slight frown \n\tnow indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood \n\ther husband is in. She continues with her nails for a moment. \n\tThen, wondering what is keeping her husband, she stands and \n\tgoes to the bedroom doorway and looks in.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM\n</b>\tCharlie is seated on the bed, hunched, in deep depression. \n\tHe is holding the ten-dollar bill. His eyes are open, but \n\tthere is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face.

And this \n\t\tbaby because it's you, too.\n<b> \n</b>\tShe closes her eyes again to hide the warm flow of tears in \n\ther eyes and stops talking rather than cry. Charlie sits, \n\tunmoved and wretched, his shoulders hunched, his head \n\tslumped forward. After a moment, he turns and reaches \n\tforward, quite frightened, to touch her arm.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\t\t(dully) \n\t\tLeave me alone, Charlie.\n<b> \n</b>\tHe stands and goes to the bedroom window and looks out. \n\tHelen turns on her side so that her back is to him. At the \n\tsound of her moving, Charlie turns his head, but sensing the \n\trejection in her back, he turns back and looks out the \n\twindow again. The silence is thick between them.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(looking out \n\t\t\tthe window) \n\t\tI decided I'd quit school and ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tI don't care ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI decided I'd quit school and come \n\t\thome in the evenings like everybody \n\t\telse and live a normal life.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\t\t(staring at the \n\t\t\twall ahead of her) \n\t\tI don't care what you do, Charlie. \n\n\tHe stands another moment.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI don't care what I do either.\n<b> \n</b>\tHelen neither moves nor makes a response.

Charlie follows a few paces \n\tbehind. Eddie pushes both elevator buttons. Charlie nods, \n\tlooks down at the tiling at his feet, fairly sick within \n\thimself, oppressed and guilty. The light in the elevator \n\twindow shows, and Eddie opens the door.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWait a minute.

The door closes, and, a moment \n\tlater, the light of the elevator cage disappears downward.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE DUPLEX APARTMENT\n</b>\tThis is one of those duplex apartments on West Tenth Street \n\twhich consists of one huge living room that is two stories \n\thigh and you need a little rolling stepladder to reach the \n\tbooks on the upper shelves of the built-in bookcases. There \n\tis a little wrought-iron stairway that leads to the second \n\tfloor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms. \n\n\tApartments like these, as is the case in this one, are \n\tusually lived in by two girls, one of whom is a secretary in \n\tan advertising agency and the other a model for a garment \n\tmanufacturing firm. Both girls are in their early thirties \n\tand are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the \n\tliving room, carrying drinks, laughing up a storm, pausing \n\tat the little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase. \n\tThey rather think of themselves as Madame de Sta\u00ebls with \n\ttheir own salon of bright young people, for most of the men \n\tand women at the party are in some way connected with the \n\tarts, probably in an avant garde way. It is a little \n\tdifficult to tell this by looking at them because avant \n\tgarde artists have become obsessed with dressing like \n\tbusinessmen, but if you can hear the talk as we can, you get \n\tthe point fast enough. We pick up phrases like: \"I really \n\tfind it difficult to think of Tennessee Williams as a \n\tserious artist,\" or \"My teacher thinks all tenors are frogs \n\texcept Gigli,\" or \"I don't see how you can say that; his \n\tdesigns fairly throb with sex.\" There are, as Eddie \n\tpredicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly \n\tgirls, circled in the swirl of their Ann Fogarty dresses, \n\tand there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair \n\tpulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the \n\twrought-iron railing that separates the dropped living room \n\tfrom the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about \n\tpositions at the dancing bar. There is someone at the piano \n\tbanging away, shouting his songs, but he is completely \n\tinaudible five feet away. A few people lean over the piano, \n\tapparently exhilarated by the songs. Thin blankets of smoke \n\twreathe their way up to the two-story-high ceiling. We catch \n\tsome more phrases: \"I thought Truman Capote was supposed to \n\tbe here.\" -- \"Truman's in Russia, I think.\" -- \"Good \n\theavens, what can the Russians want with Truman Capote?\" -- \n\t\"Oh, I never read anything published in this country.\" \"Oh, \n\tI mean, the paper-bound Paris edition.\" In short, this is a \n\treal chi-chi wingding where all the furniture is too low, \n\tand the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table \n\tis made out of an orange crate.\n\n\tSomewhere, through the jumble of the party, we can hear the \n\tdoorbell chime. A young woman, at one of the little knots of \n\tpeople, perks her ears and says: \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n</b>\t\tI'm sure that's the police again.\n<b> \n</b>\tShe's very proud of this. She turns and weaves her way \n\tthrough the crowded room, carrying her drink. She goes up \n\tthe step to the entrance foyer, turns to her left, picks her \n\tway over two middle-aged men who are both throwing a pitch \n\tat a fairly tight girl of eighteen, past the kitchen, which \n\tis a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is \n\toccupied at the moment by two intense women in their late \n\tthirties wrapped in deep discussion, up past two young men \n\twho have no immediate use for girls, to the front door of \n\tthe apartment. She opens the door.\n<b> \n</b>\tGROUP SHOT of Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie from the Hostess's \n\tpoint of view. Not exactly a heartening sight to most \n\thostesses, three fairly loaded young men with their collars \n\tunbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n</b>\t\t\t(beaming) \n\t\tAre you coming to complain about the \n\t\tnoise?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tDo we look like complainers?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHOSTESS \n</b>\t\tI don't know who you are, but come \n\t\tin, come in. I don't know half the \n\t\tpeople who are here tonight. \n\n\tThey enter a little warily and ill-at-ease, peering into the \n\tjammed room.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n</b>\t\tThe police have been here twice. The \n\t\tfirst fellow was just adorable. We \n\t\tgave him a drink, and he's upstairs \n\t\tin a bedroom now, for all I know.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tIs that right?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHOSTESS\n</b>\t\tIf you want something to drink, \n\t\tyou'll just have to go into the \n\t\tkitchen and get it yourself. The \n\t\tplace is just mad. Do you write, \n\t\tpaint or sing?\n<b> \n</b>\tEddie spreads his arms in all-inclusive expansiveness.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tEverything.\n<b> \n</b>\tBut the hostess has already bent to chat with two women, one \n\told, one young, sitting on the floor. Our three cavaliers \n\tlook at each other and then look out over the wild, jumbled \n\troom.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tBoy, do you get invited to a party \n\t\tlike this or do you get committed?\n<b> \n</b>\tA passing young man who overhears this, pokes his head into \n\tthe group and says to Charlie with a flashing smile:\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tYOUNG CHAP\n</b>\t\tI heard that. It's awfully funny. \n\n\tCharlie regards the smiling young chap.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tBeat it.\n<b> \n</b>\tThe chap's smile flashes off and he scurries away. Eddie \n\trubs his palms and surveys the women in the crowded room \n\twith a measuring eye.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tThis is going to be like shooting \n\t\tducks. Pick out your duck, men.\n<b> \n</b>\tWetting his lips, he starts out for some girl he has decided \n\ton across the room.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT -- HALF HOUR LATER \n</b>\n\tHIGH SHOT showing progress of party, still crowded, still \n\thigh. If we look sharp we can see Charlie seated on the \n\tfloor in the rear of the shot, his back against the wall.\n<b> \n</b>\tCLOSER SHOT of Charlie sitting morosely, back against the \n\twall, regarding his drink with sodden eyes. The chatter of \n\tthe party, an occasional shrill laugh.\n\n\tFULL SHOT of Eddie coming out of the kitchen, carrying two \n\tdrinks. He picks his way through the people to the living \n\troom with the general intention of getting to the \n\tarrangement of divans around the coffee table, when he spots \n\tCharlie and moves across to him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tHey, what's the matter, Charlie? \n\t\t\t(squats down \n\t\t\tbeside Charlie)\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(without looking up) \n\t\tLet's get out of here, Eddie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tThe last time I saw you, you was \n\t\twith that girl you picked up.

I'll see you. \n\n\tCharlie nods as Eddie moves off. He returns his morose \n\tattention back to his glass of liquor. Then his eyes close, \n\tand his face, though impassive, shows pain. After a moment, \n\the opens his eyes and slowly clambers to his feet and makes \n\this way, a little unsteadily, through the living room in the \n\tdirection of the kitchen. In the background we can hear the \n\tpiano and somebody singing indistinguishable lyrics. Charlie \n\tgets to the kitchen door and looks in. Arnold is at the tiny \n\tkitchen table, head on the table, out cold. The kitchen is \n\tin a state of havoc.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tHey Arnold-- You okay, Arnold? \n\n\tArnold makes no answer. Charlie regards his prostrated \n\tfriend expressionlessly for a moment. Then turns and \n\tshuffles aimlessly back to the group around the piano in the \n\tliving room. He looks over to the stairway again. The \n\tExistentialist is alone now, The Landlord having gone for \n\tthe moment. She is looking at Charlie, and he drops his eyes. \n\tHe turns away from the piano and moves out a few steps into \n\tthe middle of the living room. He moves to the stairway. \n\tThe Existentialist looks up at him as he approaches, Charlie \n\tkind of nods to her, and, for a moment, she just sits and he \n\tjust stands. Then ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tThat old man I was talking to before? \n\t\tThat's my landlord. About ten thirty \n\t\tlast night, someone began pounding on \n\t\tmy door. So I got up and opened the \n\t\tdoor, and there was this white-haired \n\t\tman with  a pince-nez standing there. \n\t\tI said: \"What do you want?\" So he \n\t\tsaid: \"I'm the landlord, and I want \n\t\tthe rent.\" Well, I just looked at him \n\t\tbecause the landlord I knew was a \n\t\tHungarian man named Frank, who was \n\t\tcrazy about me, and the issue of rent \n\t\tnever came up, you see. Well, it \n\t\tturned out that this man with the \n\t\tpince-nez had just bought the \n\t\tbuilding the day before and he kept \n\t\tgrabbing my arm and saying he wanted \n\t\tthe rent. Well, then I got the point, \n\t\tof course. Well, meanwhile, a boy \n\t\tnamed Bob I knew had come over. He's \n\t\tengaged to a Javanese girl with \n\t\twonderful planes in her face who \n\t\tlives at the International House. \n\t\tBut he's crazy about me and he drops \n\t\tin about twice a week. Well, \n\t\tmeanwhile, my new landlord was \n\t\tgrabbing my arm and kept quoting \n\t\tpoetry to me which he was trying to \n\t\tpass off as his own. He was an \n\t\tabsolute fraud. He scotched the \n\t\twhole thing from Baudelaire. \"Tu \n\t\tmettrais.\" You know that one. Well, \n\t\the kept screaming about the rent -- \n\t\tI didn't like him, you know -- and I \n\t\tcalled this boy named George who \n\t\tused to live in Poughkeepsie when I \n\t\twas going to Vassar, and he's crazy \n\t\tabout me. He lives in St. Luke's \n\t\tplace now, but he goes to \n\t\tPoughkeepsie every Wednesday to see \n\t\this mother, he's got an Oedipus, so \n\t\tthat was out. Well, my new landlord \n\t\tkept telling me how much he was in \n\t\tlove with me. I said: \"How \n\t\texistentialist can you get? You just \n\t\tmet me five minutes ago.\" He was \n\t\tabsolutely crazy about me.\n<b> \n</b>\tCharlie has been sort of half-listening to all this. His \n\tattention, if any at all, has been vaguely given to the \n\tgirl's bare arms, the lines of her body. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(resigned) \n\t\tYou have an apartment around here \n\t\tsomewheres? \n\t\t\t(looks up to \n\t\t\tsecond floor) \n\t\tWhat's up there? What kind of rooms \n\t\tare up there?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tSo, I finally got to sleep around \n\t\tsix thirty.... \n\n\tCharlie bends down to her, takes her arm.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tCome on, let's go. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\t\t(wrenching her \n\t\t\tarm away) \n\t\tNo! Oh, stop trying to be so \n\t\tprimitive. \n\n\tCharlie straightens with an irritated sigh.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tI find you very unpleasant. \n\n\tHe stands, she sits in sullen silence.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tThere's nothing upstairs. \n\t\t\t(suddenly rises, \n\t\t\tmumbles) \n\t\tOh, I don't care.\n<b> \n</b>\tShe starts up the stairs, Charlie following close behind her. \n\tThey pick their way past the other people sitting on the \n\tstairs to the second-floor landing. They walk in hostile \n\tsilence down the landing to the bedroom door, which she \n\topens.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM\n</b>\tIt is a tiny bedroom. The bed is covered with purses and \n\tsummer stoles and other guest things. An uncovered, \n\timprovised closet, really a rack of hanging dresses and \n\tthings, gives the room an overburdened look. Charlie comes \n\tinto the room after her, closes the door, looks for the \n\tlatch. She pushes some of the things on the bed aside and \n\tsits down and waits while Charlie latches the door, a matter \n\tof turning a bent nail into locking position. She begins to \n\tprattle again.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tSo I finally got to sleep around six \n\t\tthirty this morning. At nine thirty, \n\t\tsomeone began pounding on my door \n\t\tagain. I got out of bed and opened \n\t\tthe door, and there was my landlord \n\t\twith the pince-nez wearing a blue \n\t\tsilk kimono. \"Oh, for heaven's \n\t\tsakes,\" I said, \"what do you want \n\t\tnow?\" He said: \"I'm the landlord, \n\t\tand I want the rent.\" I said: \n\t\t\"You're an old man, go to sleep.\" \n\t\tThen the phone rang. It was a boy \n\t\tnamed Andrew I know who teaches \n\t\tphysics at Columbia University, and \n\t\the's insanely jealous. He's married \n\t\tand has four children, but he keeps \n\t\tbadgering me to run away with him to \n\t\tNicaragua, throw up his professorship \n\t\tand all that. Well, my landlord began \n\t\tshouting some garbled Baudelaire at \n\t\tthe top of his lungs, and a little \n\t\tVerlaine, and a little Huysmans. He \n\t\tapparently has some kind of fetish \n\t\tabout French decadents. And \n\t\tnaturally, Andrew heard him, and he \n\t\tgot furious, and he said: \"Who's that \n\t\tI hear?\" I said, \"That's the \n\t\tlandlord.\" He said: \"What does he \n\t\twant?\" I said: \"He wants the rent.\" \n\t\tWell, at this point, I felt like \n\t\tchucking the whole business and \n\t\tgoing back to Bessemer City and \n\t\tgoing to work in my father's \n\t\thardware store.\n<b> \n</b>\tCharlie has stood a moment, listening to this bizarre story. \n\tThen he has busied himself cleaning a place beside The \n\tExistentialist on the bed. He brings an end to the rococo \n\tnarration by putting his arms around The Existentialist and \n\tin a moment, she responds hungrily.\n<b> \n</b>\tCLOSEUP of Charlie and The Existentialist in a desperate \n\tembrace.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\t\t(muttering) \n\t\tJust say you love me.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tJust say you love me. You don't have \n\t\tto mean it. \n\n\tHe tries to kiss her again, himself charged high at the \n\tmoment, but she turns her face away from him. The dialogue \n\tis intense, whispered, hungry.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tNo, don't. ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWhat's the matter?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tSay you love me....\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tCome on.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tSay you love me....\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tCome on....\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tNo ...\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI love you!

You go out the \n\t\tdoor and turn to your right. You \n\t\tknow the one I mean?  \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tYes, I know.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHE EXISTENTIALIST\n</b>\t\tWell, you go there and I'll be there \n\t\tas fast as I can. Now, wait for me \n\t\tnow, because I can't stand being \n\t\talone at night. You'll like me. I'm \n\t\tsupposed to be very amusing. All \n\t\tright?\n<b> \n</b>\tShe turns abruptly and goes out the door. He stands for a \n\tmoment and then follows. He stands on the upper landing, \n\twatching her pick her way down the stairs into the living \n\troom.\n<b> \n</b>\tShe looks quickly around the room, apparently finds whom she \n\tis looking for, and moves quickly to a little group of men, \n\tone of whom is about sixty years old with a thin elegance \n\tand a cruel face, the landlord. He has several young men \n\taround him, all rather frail, Ivy-Leagueish. She joins the \n\tgroup, to the distaste of the young men, and is immediately \n\tvoluble and gesticulatory. After a moment, Charlie lets his \n\teyes wander over the room, apparently sees Eddie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(calling down) \n\t\tHey, Eddie ...\n<b> \n</b>\tApparently, Eddie doesn't hear him. Charlie frowns and \n\tbegins making his own way down the stairs to the living room.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR. LIVING ROOM -- GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT\n</b>\tCharlie moves down the stairs into the living room proper. \n\tHe makes his way to Eddie, who is still sitting in the back \n\tof the room, throwing an intense pitch at his girl, talking \n\tquickly, smiling, gesturing. \n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(muttering) \n\t\tEddie, I'm cutting out.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\t\t(standing, low voice) \n\t\tWait a minute, I'll go with you.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tI don't want to take you away from \n\t\tyour girl, Eddie.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tAah, this one lives out in Long \n\t\tIsland with her mother.

They pass The Existentialist en \n\troute. She is saying: \"... this boy named Charlie, I never \n\tsaw him before in my life, has been clutching at me all \n\tevening. He's absolutely insane about me.\" Charlie leans \n\tinto the kitchen where Arnold is awake now, seated at the \n\tsmall kitchen table, staring gauntly, unseeingly at his \n\tfingers on the white porcelain-topped table. There are two \n\tmen, one middle-aged, one young, having a whispered chat \n\tover the sink.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\t\t(over Charlie's \n\t\t\tshoulder) \n\t\tHey, Arnold, come on.\n<b> \n</b>\tArnold stands obediently, almost dumbly. He squeezes around \n\tthe table, his face soddenly expressionless, to join Eddie \n\tand Charlie in the kitchen doorway. Eddie is saying to \n\tCharlie:\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tEDDIE\n</b>\t\tWell, it wasn't a bad party. We \n\t\tkilled a couple of hours anyway.\n<b> \n</b>\tThe three men push their way past three women in their \n\tthirties, who are standing in the little hallway before the \n\tfront door, in earnest brow-furrowed conversation with each \n\tother. Charlie opens the door, and the three morose \n\tcarousers go out into the dark street.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tEXTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT -- NIGHT \n</b>\tThe three carousers come out into the street. The door \n\tcloses behind them. The night air is hot and muggy. They \n\twalk down the street toward the corner where only the light \n\tof the corner bar gives any indication of life. There is a \n\tnewspaper on the sidewalk which Eddie bends down to pick up, \n\tand the three men straggle to a halt. Eddie opens the paper \n\tto the sports pages and starts to read by the light of the \n\tstreet lamp. Arnold moves a step to the lamp and leans \n\tagainst it. Charlie stands in the middle of the sidewalk, a \n\tmelancholy, pondering young man. The evening seems to have \n\tcome to a dead halt. After a moment, Eddie starts walking \n\tagain, reading the paper as he does. The others slowly \n\tgather themselves and follow him.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tINTERIOR.

We are in the bar on the corner of Tenth \n\tand Sixth, almost entirely empty except for Charlie, Eddie, \n\tArnold, and the bartender. The three carousers are leaning \n\twearily on the bar over their beers; the only other person \n\tin the bar is a worn, battered old veteran of the streets, a \n\twoman in her forties, bespectacled, who is perched on a bar \n\tstool at the far end of the bar, gloomily reading a \n\tnewspaper.

We got \n\t\tthree guys, for Pete's sake, who can \n\t\toutplay anybody the Yankees put on \n\t\tsecond. \n\n\tArnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at \n\tthe far end of the counter.

Charlie is standing a few \n\tpaces away from him in the middle of the sidewalk, a deeply \n\tunhappy figure in his own right.

He is crying quietly, unashamedly, his \n\tshoulders shaking ever so little.  Behind him, Arnold is bent \n\tover the railing of the stoop, weak and spent.\n<b> \n</b>\tANOTHER SHOT of the two men.

Arnold is sprawled across the straw seat, \n\tone leg buckled beneath him, the other on the floor. He is \n\tsleeping heavily.

Charlie and Arnold \n\tshuffle down the landing to apartment 3D. They pause outside \n\tthe door.

That's what love is, \n\t\tArnold, when you have somebody else \n\t\tin the world you want to be happy. \n\t\tMy wife, Arnold, I don't know what \n\t\tI'd do without her. Arnold, I've got \n\t\ta tough grind ahead of me. Work all \n\t\tday, I'll go to night school at night. \n\t\tBut my wife knows that I need this to \n\t\tbe happy, and she does everything she \n\t\tknows to help me. And we've got a \n\t\tbaby coming. But if you love that \n\t\tbaby and you love your wife, then \n\t\tit's easy. Everything seems so easy \n\t\tto me now -- I don't know why I even \n\t\tthought of quitting.\n\t\t\t(tears have welled \n\t\t\tin his eyes, and he \n\t\t\thurriedly puts his \n\t\t\thand to his face \n\t\t\tshading his reddening \n\t\t\teyes) \n\t\tArnold, I want my wife so much right \n\t\tnow.

From \n\t\tloving a woman, from really wanting\n\t\ta woman. Arnold, what I'm trying to \n\t\ttell you is life is nothing if you \n\t\tdon't love somebody but life is \n\t\twonderful if you do love somebody. \n\t\tArnold, I want my wife so much right \n\t\tnow ...\n<b> \n</b>\tArnold is a little embarrassed by his friend's display of \n\temotion and, frankly, hasn't understood a word Charlie was \n\ttalking about.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tI'm going to tell her about that \n\t\twoman tonight and everything.

Charlie has plunged \n\tdown into the darkness of the floor below. Arnold turns and \n\tsighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment. He \n\trings the bell lightly, takes a deep breath. A moment, and \n\tthe door opens. A girl of about thirty-five, bespectacled, \n\trather plain, with a sensitive face, stands in the doorway. \n\tArnold stands, his head down in shame.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tARNOLD\n</b>\t\tHello, Louise.
