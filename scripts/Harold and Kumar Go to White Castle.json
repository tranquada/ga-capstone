What are the hell are we gonna\n                      do now?!\n               Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their\n               direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops\n               in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins\n               walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon\n               as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES.\n\n          \n\n                              DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   56.\n\n          \n\n          \n               It's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties,\n               wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE\n               BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE.

Even his haircut is\n               freaky. He has a SKULLET (A MULLET BUT WITH NO HAIR ON TOP).\n               HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out.\n\n          80   EXT.

KUMAR looks back over at\n          FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.\n\n                              KUMAR\n                        (whispering)\n                 Oh my God!

You think\n                 that just because you're whispering, he\n                 can't hear what you're saying? He's two\n                 feet away from us. He can hear this\n                 entire conversation.

Not\n                 with all that crust in his ear.\n          HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then\n          looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard\n          a thing. Harold seems relieved.\n\n                              FREAK SHOW\n                 I heard every word you said.\n          FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't\n          know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact\n          that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.\n\n          \n\n                               DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   58.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          82   EXT.

But\n                 he had the most amazing voice -- like a\n                 baby canary.\n          Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- \"are we\n          talking about the same Freakshow?\"\n\n                              LIANE\n                 Well, one day after Easter service, I\n                 told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and\n                 he just mustered up some courage and\n                 asked me out. The rest is history. And\n                 we've been in love ever since.\n          HAROLD ponders this for a moment.

Or better\n                      yet, arrest him. Lock him up!\n               With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees\n               Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends\n               up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!\n\n                                      HAROLD\n                      Oh shit.\n\n          92   INT.

Evidently, a black\n                 man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore,\n                 since I'm black, it was probably me,\n                 right?\n          Harold shrugs his shoulders.\n\n                              TARIK\n                 Well that was the logic the cop used. I\n                 told him I haven't even been to Newark in\n                 months. Then he pointed a gun at me and\n                 told me to stop resisting arrest. I\n                 said, \"Hey, I'm not resisting anything.\"\n                 So he starts beating me with his gun,\n                 screaming at me, telling me to stop\n                 resisting.\n\n                               HAROLD\n                 Holy shit.

Please stop beating me.\"\n                 But that didn't work. Then another cop\n                 showed up. Then another. When it was\n                 all said and done, it took nine cops to\n                 bring me in here.\n\n                              HAROLD\n                 That fucking blows!\n          Tarik nods and continues reading his book.
