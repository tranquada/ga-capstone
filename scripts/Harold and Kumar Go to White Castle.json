It\n          sounds like it's very complicated.\n          Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO\n          MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK\n          AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.\n          Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the\n          CASHIER are too busy talking to notice.
