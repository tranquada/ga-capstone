The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been\r\n          crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT. HUT - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the\r\n          space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies\r\n          in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.\r\n          The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until\r\n\r\n<b>          THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.\r\n</b>          The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks\r\n          over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold\r\n          their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.\r\n\r\n<b>          ANOTHER RATTLE.\r\n</b>          It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as\r\n          the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow\r\n          and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans\r\n          in and peers through the bamboo slats.\r\n          WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.\r\n          Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his\r\n          face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of\r\n\r\n<b>          A SERRATED METAL BLADE\r\n</b>          protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously\r\n          protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted\r\n          eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...\r\n\r\n<b>                         MIDDLE-AGED MAN\r\n</b>          Run!\r\n\r\n<b>          SMASH CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          2.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints\r\n          through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off\r\n          the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves\r\n          impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.\r\n\r\n<b>          A MONSTROUS HOWL\r\n</b>          ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins\r\n          thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread\r\n          and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.\r\n          He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races\r\n          up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of\r\n\r\n<b>          A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!\r\n</b>          GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He\r\n          kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite\r\n          lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of\r\n\r\n<b>          A HULKING BEAST.\r\n</b>          It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.\r\n          It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,\r\n          the Teen turns to make his escape when\r\n\r\n<b>                         A HAND\r\n</b>          wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a\r\n          TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.\r\n\r\n<b>          THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.\r\n</b>          He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the\r\n          briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the\r\n          geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted\r\n          against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises\r\n\r\n<b>          A SWORD.\r\n</b>          Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps\r\n          towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA\r\n          ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.\r\n\r\n<b>          FORM CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          THE SAME SYMBOL.\r\n</b>          It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles\r\n          away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-\r\n          ski race with TWO BUDDIES.\r\n\r\n<b>          TITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          3.\r\n</b>          The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages\r\n          on the beach.\r\n          Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his\r\n          opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of\r\n          triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels\r\n\r\n<b>                         THE SYMBOL\r\n</b>          searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his\r\n          ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams\r\n          across the water.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light\r\n          flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh\r\n          like a brand.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. BEACH - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,\r\n          clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF\r\n          PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BLONDE GIRL\r\n</b>          Daniel, what's wrong? Did you\r\n          break your ankle?\r\n          But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from\r\n          between his fingers and reels back.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BLONDE GIRL\r\n</b>          Oh my God.\r\n          He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to\r\n          his feet and takes off running.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.\r\n          Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure\r\n          outrunning the hurtling vehicles.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. COASTAL FOREST - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The\r\n          pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same\r\n          hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He\r\n          peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.\r\n\r\n<b>          A STILT HOUSE\r\n</b>          sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right\r\n          on the edge of a coral-white beach.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          4.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          EXT.

He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays\r\n          and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.\r\n\r\n<b>                         DANIEL\r\n</b>          Number 3 is dead.\r\n          Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his\r\n          feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on\r\n          the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully\r\n          raw. Directly below this fresh wound are\r\n\r\n<b>          TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.\r\n</b>          They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.\r\n          Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.\r\n          Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.\r\n\r\n<b>                         HENRI\r\n</b>          Did anybody else see this?\r\n          OFF Daniel's panicked nod...\r\n\r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          INT.

The\r\n          walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.\r\n          Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.\r\n\r\n<b>                         HENRI\r\n</b>          Taillights in five minutes.

Bitter, he takes one last\r\n          look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.\r\n          As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS\r\n\r\n<b>          THE GECKO.\r\n</b>          It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk,\r\n          and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          EXT.

The\r\n          speedometer never brushes past 60.

He\r\n          hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are\r\n          talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a\r\n          pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.\r\n\r\n<b>                         MARK\r\n</b>          The Sheriff's Department is\r\n          starting to put up roadblocks.

Bernie morphs into a gecko and\r\n          darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.\r\n          John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.\r\n          He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at\r\n          Mark's side.
