Cris then\n          shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty\n          intersecting corridor. A Black Suit barrels into the empty\n          intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it.\n          Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out;\n          steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and\n          falls on his ass.\n          \n          Cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of\n          FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS.

Cris switches to the right side of the\n          card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him.\n          \n          Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a\n          herky-jerky rhythm.\n          \n          He walks four quick steps without being seen. Then stops\n          behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way. When\n          Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting\n          across the lobby at an acute angle. In this way, he avoids\n          being seen by Black Suit 2. Cris now backs up three steps and\n          avoids being seen by Black Suit 3.\n          \n          By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his\n          hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like\n          invisibility.\n          \n          The last obstacle to daylight is Ferris.

Cris\n          feints and lands an uppercut to Randy's chin.

The big guy falls to his knees,\n          bleeding.\n          \n          Liz rushes to Randy's side, holding her ex and glowering up\n          at Cris like he's a sadistic brute.\n          \n                              LIZ\n                    Get out of here!

WHAM! Cris takes a sledgehammer in the mouth. Randy\n          follows up mercilessly, punching Cris in the gut, then\n          holding him up while he punches him again.\n          \n          Liz grabs Randy's arm.\n          \n                                                                    45.\n          \n          \n          \n                              LIZ\n                    Stop it, Randy! Stop it!\n          \n          Randy flings her aside and finishes up   with a solid right to\n          Cris' jaw, that puts him on the floor.   Randy pulls back his\n          leg for a pointy-booted cowboy kick to   the ribs, when Liz\n          rushes to Cris' side and glowers up at   Randy like he's a\n          sadistic brute.\n          \n                              LIZ\n                    Get out of here!

Scanning for security cameras.\n          Fighting. Winning. Losing. Dying.\n          \n          He goes down a stairwell. One version of himself exits at a\n          landing.
