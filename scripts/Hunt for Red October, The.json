Anyway,; I got curious,\r\n          and. started tracking. the sound on our\r\n          lateral array. I located it four\r\n          different times. The fifth time it\r\n          was gone and I couldn't find it. But\r\n          I want to show you what I worked up.\r\n          Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status\r\n          board overlaying the nautical map:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         -48-\r\n\r\n                         JONES (CONT'D)\r\n          The first contact was at zero-nine-Been\r\n          hours and the bearing was two-six-nine.\r\n\r\n                         (DRAWING LINE)\r\n          Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was\r\n          bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine-\r\n          forty-eight is was two-ive-zero.\r\n\r\n                         (ANOTHER LINE)\r\n          I came back to it at about ten-hundred\r\n          and the bearing was two-four-two. The\r\n          last signal was real faint and I didn't\r\n          have a very good lock on it.\r\n\r\n                         MANCUSO\r\n          So?\r\n\r\n                         JONES\r\n          Well, I figure it couldn't be very far\r\n          away from us, right? Let's say it was\r\n          halfway between us and Iceland. That\r\n          would put it on a course like this.\r\n          Jones makes more calculations on the. status board.

Sir, I believe the sound I\r\n          heard is the acoustical signature of some\r\n          kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and\r\n          he's taking the inshore track off the\r\n          Iceland coast.\r\n\r\n                         THOMPSON\r\n          What do you think, captain?\r\n          Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones:\r\n\r\n                         MANCUSO\r\n          Let me see if I got this straight.

Right now, the Soviet Captain,\r\n          a man named Tupolev is removing the\r\n          safety features on all his weapons.\r\n          He won't make the same mistake twice.\r\n          Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He\r\n          can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand.\r\n\r\n                         SUDDENLY:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          A FIRE STORM\r\n          of GUNFIRE sprays the CONN.

Behind a console, Mancuso drags out\r\n          his .45 and RETURNS FIRE. The shadow disappears.\r\n\r\n          ON THE DALLAS\r\n          Beaumont rips off his headgear, turning to Thompson in the sonar\r\n          shack's door, breathing hard:\r\n\r\n                         BEAUMONT\r\n          Jesus Christ.
