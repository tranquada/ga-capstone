The brightly-\ncolored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.\n\n\n<b>EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nTwo bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of\nnowhere.\n\n\n<b>INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nThe decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and\nhomegrown scientist.

Maybe\n             I should try some.\n\nMike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search\nfor food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged\nden like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the\ncricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.\n\nMike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting\nspiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless\ninsects.\n\n<b>                           MIKE\n</b>             Run, little guys.\n\n<b>                           JOSHUA\n</b>             They can't outrun the food chain.\n\n<b>                           MIKE\n</b>             I could get away.\n\n<b>                           JOSHUA\n</b>             Imagine yourself the size of that\n             fly. A scytodes spitter would be\n             as big as a Cadillac. You'd be\n             spider chow, kid.\n\nMike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing\ncrickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered\nwith a towel.\n\n<b>                           MIKE\n</b>             Are the new tarantulas in here?\n\n<b>                           JOSHUA\n</b>             Took me forever to get a breeding\n             set of Chilean reds.

A large, male\ntarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,\nthen wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a\nmummy-like bundle.\n\n<b>                           MIKE\n</b>             That is too cool.\n\n<b>                           JOSHUA\n</b>             Male tarantulas compete for the\n             female's attention.\n<b>                           (MORE)\n</b>\n<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                           5.\n</b>\n<b>CONTINUED:\n</b>\n<b>                           JOSHUA (CONT'D)\n</b>             Each one tries to bring her the\n             best present.

You\n             know how women love breakfast in\n             bed.\n\nJoshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of\nsubterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas\nscuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.\n\n<b>                           JOSHUA\n</b>             Take a look, the female of the\n             species is three times as big as\n             the male.\n\nMike peers into a large den.

The faded logo on the\ndoor reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,\n<b>PROSPERITY, NV.\n</b>\n\n<b>INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY\n</b>\nRotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a\nstring of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of\nthe tunnel.\n\nCHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered\nclothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.\n\nChris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes\ncontact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to\nscrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.\n\nSomething sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.\n\nChris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away\na section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections\nof silver and gold splash across his face.

A\nlarge rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's\nsack lunch.\n\nChris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The\nrodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes\nrock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.\n\nA BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices\na small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a\nstove.

He defends himself with the\nmachete.\n\nShining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.\nOnce again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares\nthe death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.\n\n<b>                               MIKE\n</b>             Consuela!   No!     Bad!   Bad\n             Consuela!\n\nThe massive spider stops in shock.            Chris looks back to\nsee Mike has returned.\n\n\n<b>TARANTULA POV\n</b>\nThe familiar multi-perspective spider vision.

They dive\ninto the back of the humvee.\n\nConsuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She\ncollapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.\nThe earth itself begins to collapse.\n\n\n<b>INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY\n</b>\nGladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.\nBUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall\nis sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth. The\nhumvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling\ndesert.\n\n\n<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n</b>\nThe humvee reaches open road. The survivors watch out\nthe back as Prosperity disappears into a massive\nsinkhole.\n\n\n<b>EXT. HIGHWAY/INT.

And then\nChris looks down to see his tight pants have finally\nripped.\n\n<b>                        CHRIS\n</b>          I really need some pants that fit.\n\nThe group smiles.    Happy to be alive.\n\n<b>                          MIKE\n</b>          Look out!\n\nEveryone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny\nrabbit hops across the highway.
