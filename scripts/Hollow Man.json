Marlowe\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Red Wagon \nProds. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRevised Draft \n6/26/98\n\n\tFADE IN:\n\tOn complete darkness.\n\tA SMALL DOOR swings open.\n\tA circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the \n\tlength of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a \n\tgloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the \n\tfrightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind \n\tit. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to \n\tpad down the tube s length.\n\tAfter several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit \n\tcubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.\n\tThe SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s \n\tears.\n\tThe rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a \n\tdoor swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.\n\tThe rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.\n\tThe rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, \n\tbut the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on \n\tthe far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and \n\tdashes toward it.\n\tBut an invisible force descends.\n\tThe rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its \n\tbody, crushing it.\n\tA LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, \n\thalting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, \n\tstruggling against the unholy force.\n\tThen a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life \n\tquickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...\n\tThe creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white \n\tfur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.\n\tHUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked \n\tape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into \n\tthe rat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\tIn the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the \n\tTonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer \n\tscreen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with \n\tthe shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry \n\tframed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips \n\tcoffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a \n\tcomplex computer rendered molecule displayed on his \n\tscreen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts \n\tslightly, then falls apart.\n\tSebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the \n\tcellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard \n\twith renewed vigor.\n\tAnother molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s \n\tfingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on \n\tand off, it trembles and twists apart.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tDamnit.\n\tSebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a \n\tlight comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a \n\tBRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her \n\tliving room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses \n\tit and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to \n\tthe window, getting interested. But when the brunette \n\treaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window \n\tand lowers her shades.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN (cont d)\n\t\t\tDamnit.\n\tSebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. \n\tHe s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at \n\tthe ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big \n\tred letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be \n\tWorking.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins \n\tpecking away again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nLATER:\n\tThe television is now only static. We pan by his alarm \n\tclock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his \n\tcomputer.\n\tHe gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away \n\tagain. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.\n\tHe types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. \n\tNothing happens.\n\tHe hits a few more keys and watches intently for a \n\treaction.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\t\t (beat)\n\t\t\tI am a goddamn genius.\n\tHe hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on \n\tthe screen. He dials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\tINT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\tDigital phone rings.\n\tIn the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a \n\tdeep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her \n\tdesk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.\n\tThe ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse \n\taround and her screen comes to life. She click on a \n\ttelephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, \n\tSebastian appears in a window on her screen.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tSebastian, do you know what time it \n\t\t\tis?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN (SCREEN)\n\t\t\tYou know Da Vinci never slept. Said it \n\t\t\twas waste of time.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tWhat is it this time?\n\tINTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM\n\tSebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer \n\twindow. He notices something behind her in the bed, the \n\tyoung man sleeping face down.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tWho s that?\n\tLinda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer \n\tscreen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tNot your business. Not anymore.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tTouche.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tSo you calling about anything in \n\t\t\tparticular, or were you just hoping to \n\t\t\tcatch me sleeping in the nude?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tI cracked the reversion.\n\tUpon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tYou cracked it?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tLook at this. \n\tSebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the \n\tmolecular structure appears on Linda s computer.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tWatch this.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tYou sure?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\t91% sure.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\t\t (astonished)\n\t\t\tEleven months with no progress and you \n\t\t\tsuddenly come up with it out of the \n\t\t\tblue? How?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tThe usual. Coffee and twinkies.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tI hate you.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tI know. You think you could hunt down \n\t\t\tMatt and get to the lab early. I want \n\t\t\tIsabelle prepped for a live test.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tYeah, I think I can find him. What are \n\t\t\tyou going to do?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tWell y know. It s daylight in \n\t\t\tSwitzerland. I gotta call the Nobel\n\t\t\tCommittee and tell them to get our\n\t\t\tprizes ready. See you in a few.\n\tON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda \n\tcrosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tHey... come on.\n\tDR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under \n\tsheets.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\t\t (groggy)\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tSebastian just called. We gotta get to \n\t\t\tthe lab.\n\tMatt bolts up.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tShit! You didn t tell him I was here, \n\t\t\tdid you?\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tGive me some credit, will ya.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tSo what s the rush?\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tHe cracked reversion.\n\tMatt pulls his jeans on.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tWanna ride down?\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tWe better take our own cars.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tYou re gonna have to tell him about us \n\t\t\teventually.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tI know. It s just You re his best \n\t\t\tfriend. He ll feel betrayed.\n\tEXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY\n\tFrom a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in \n\tthe harsh light of morning.\n\tCAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security \n\tfence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is \n\tsurrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.\n\tThe Porsche is waved through security and heads straight \n\tinto the warehouse.\n\tINT. WAREHOUSE -DAY\n\tThe Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space \n\tand Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, \n\tand Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the \n\tlot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the \n\twarehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.\n\t\t\t\tMARINE GUARD\n\t\t\tMorning, sir.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tMorning, Ed.\n\t\t\t\tMARINE GUARD\n\t\t\tYour team s in early. Something \n\t\t\tspecial going on?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tSorry, Ed. You know the rules. \n\tSebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A \n\tlaser reads his print. \n\tScan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN \n\tClearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE \n\tDivision:\tCLASSIFIED \n\tThe doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.\n\t\t\t\tMARINE GUARD\n\t\t\tHave a good day, sir.\n\tINT. ELEVATOR - DAY\n\tInside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian \n\ttaps in his floor code.\n\t\t\t\tELEVATOR (V.0.)\n\t\t\tAuthorization please.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tCaine zero zero two seven.\n\t\t\t\tELEVATOR (V.0.)\n\t\t\tAuthorization verified. Good morning, \n\t\t\tDr. Caine. \n\tThe elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes \n\tbelow us and keeps descending into the belly of the \n\tearth, the shaft goes down forever.\n\tINT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR\n\tWe slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas \n\tchambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a \n\tspecific animal, although no animals are visible.\n\tAs we pass one habitat, something slams into the \n\tPlexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then \n\tSCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen \n\tanimal cries. THUMP.\n\tTHUMP.\n\tThe Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry \n\tanimals were slamming against it. But still, no animals \n\tare seen.\n\tAbove each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES \n\trevealing heat signatures of the various animals, but \n\tthey remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a \n\tsheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly \n\tempty cage.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tIsabelle ...\n\tThe woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the \n\tPlexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The \n\tPlexiglas begins to shake violently.\n\t\t\t\tMATT (cont d)\n\t\t\tCalm down baby. Calm down. It s \n\t\t\tokay...\n\tMatt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and \n\tpulls them down over his eyes. \n\tTHERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in \n\tshape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the \n\tPlexiglas door and reaches inside.\n\t\t\t\tMATT (cont d)\n\t\t\tIt s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not \n\t\t\tgoing to hurt you. Come here.\n\tTHERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs \n\thold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt \n\treaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.\n\t\t\t\tMATT (cont d)\n\t\t\tJust hold still. \n\tSomething clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. \n\tBlood erupts in a bite pattern.\n\t\t\t\tMATT (cont d)\n\t\t\t Ow, shit.\n\tMatt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies \n\topen and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see \n\tthe heat signature running down the hallway. He turns \n\taround to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt \n\tpulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the \n\tCorridor.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tYou okay?\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tShe bit me.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tYeah. She s become a lot more \n\t\t\taggressive in the last few days.\n\tLinda takes the goggles from Matt.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA (cont d)\n\t\t\tGo take care of that bite. I ll get \n\t\t\ther.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tAnd give you a chance to pull ahead? \n\t\t\tNever.\n\tLinda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and \n\tpulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.\n\tAROUND THE CORNER\n\tA slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. \n\tWe hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.\n\tLooking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a \n\thaunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed \n\tthough and something large and angry is throwing itself \n\tagainst it. We can t see anything.\n\tA few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, \n\twearing goggles and leveling their pistols.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\t\t (ala Porky)\n\t\t\tShh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting \n\t\t\tsimians.   heheheheh.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tKnock it off.\n\t\t\t\t (soothing voice)\n\t\t\tIsabelle!\n\tTHERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering \n\theat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda \n\tfires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. \n\tThen falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it \n\tstops inches above the ground. \n\tTHERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at \n\tLinda s feet.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tGood shootin , Tex.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tWhat s that make it?\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tI m still ahead. 6 to 5.\n\tLike a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from \n\tthe top of her tranquilizer gun.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tBut I m catching up.\n\tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY\n\tThe elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met \n\tby SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tCan I have a word?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tMost normal people say good morning.\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tDon t you think you should test the \n\t\t\tprotocol on the liver samples before \n\t\t\tyou inject Isabelle?\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tHow many tissue samples have we \n\t\t\tsuccessfully regressed? Hundreds, \n\t\t\tright? How many have gone on to work \n\t\t\ton the full system? None.\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tThat s beside the point.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tNo, that is the point. I m not going \n\t\t\tto waste six months of my life on an \n\t\t\toutmoded testing procedure. This thing \n\t\t\tworks. I know it. I feel it.\n\tLinda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail \n\tend of the conversation.\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tFine. You can mop up afterward.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tYou think I m going to kill Isabelle?\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tKill? More like liquefy.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tSarah, thank you for your opinion, but \n\t\t\tI m the project leader. Understand? \n\tShe says ...\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tYes, Sir.\n\t... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. \n\tSebastian turns to Linda.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tHow did you ever convince me to hire \n\t\t\ther?\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tYou said you wanted the beat vet in \n\t\t\tthe country.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tYeah, well she cares more about the \n\t\t\tanimals than the research.\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tMaybe that s why she s so good.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tCUT TO:\n\tCLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As \n\tit s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and \n\treaches in, removing...\n\tA GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.\n\tSebastian peers at the vial.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tWho da Man? You da Man.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tAs we pull out we see we are.\n\tINT. LABORATORY - DAY\n\tAlmost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech \n\tFrankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical \n\treadouts, bizarre medical equipment.\n\tOn a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over \n\ta humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. \n\tThe straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the \n\tbody to lots of machinery.\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tProtocol is hot.\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tVitals?\n\tSarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, \n\tblood pressure, the rest.\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tNormal.\n\tCARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in \n\ta cart of equipment.

She drops her keys on the table \n\tand begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the \n\twindow. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she \n\tpulls her blinds shut.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tShit.\n\n\tFrustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then \n\tstops.

The panel of glass fogs from \n\tSebastian's breath.

I have to make a few \n\t\t\tcalls.\n\n\tMrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer \n\tcrosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver \n\tand starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone \n\tgoes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to \n\tget a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on \n\tthe phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The \n\tline's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in \n\tthe kitchen.\n\n\t\t\t\tKRAMER (cont'd)\n\t\t\tHello? Hello?\n\n\tKramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door \n\tleading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to \n\tit. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling \n\tdead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings \n\tlightly. Kramer steps out.\n\n\tEXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT\n\n\tIn the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to \n\tthe telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is \n\topen and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks \n\taround, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his \n\tpipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is \n\tvisible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and \n\tthe pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp \n\tcry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and \n\this cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out \n\this form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues \n\ta beat until Kramer manages to break free.\n\n\t\t\t\tKRAMER\n\t\t\tHelp! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!\n\n\tAs Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. \n\tWHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling \n\tinto the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one \n\tsplash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped \n\tAIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And \n\tbecause of the water displacement, we can clearly see two \n\tarms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. \n\n\tMARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at \n\tthe pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his \n\tflailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around \n\thim. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails \n\tfor a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A \n\tmoment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR \n\tPOCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the \n\tpool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of \n\twater. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall \n\tuntil all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of \n\ttiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the \n\tlight like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape \n\tdisappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha \n\temerges from the house and sees her husband floating face \n\tdown in the pool. She screams.\n\n\tINT.

Nice shot.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tHe's let the animals out. It wasn't \n\t\t\thim we were tracking.\n\n\tLinda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq \n\tgun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs \n\tare soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from \n\ther brow.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tYou okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tIt won't kill me unless it gets \n\t\t\tinfected. You?\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tMe .... Don't ask about me. If he \n\t\t\tfreed all the animals, we could have \n\t\t\tdozens running around the lab.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tSo he could be anywhere right now.\n\n\tMatt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud \n\tmist. Nothing else appears.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWhat do we do?\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tGet to the lab, lock the goddamn doors \n\t\t\tand pray to God Frank can reprogram \n\t\t\tthe elevator.\n\n\tINT. SUPPLY ROOM\n\n\tSarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door \n\tto the fridge/freezer.\n\n\tThe DOOR SLAMS behind her. She freezes and slowly turns.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tFrank?\n\n\tShe eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t (frightened whisper)\n\t\t\tWho's there?\n\n\tShe listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's \n\tstarting to panic.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH (cont'd)\n\t\t\tDr. Caine?\n\n\tShe starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. \n\tShe clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to \n\taim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an \n\tidea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the \n\tfloor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the \n\tlinoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming \n\tmore and more hysterical. Splattering more and more \n\tblood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she \n\tsearches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. \n\tBut there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching \n\tthe tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.\n\n\tFinally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She \n\theads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper \n\tin her ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN'S VOICE\n\t\t\tYou missed.\n\n\tHer hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She \n\ttries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands \n\tstruggling against the force.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH\n\t\t\tPlease no. Let me go. Oh god, let me \n\t\t\tgo. \n\n\tThe arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? No!\n\n\tSarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH (cont'd)\n\t\t\tHelp me! Oh God. Somebody help me!\n\t\t\tFRANK!\n\n\tSlowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and \n\taround, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her \n\tstomach.\n\n\tSarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH (cont'd)\n\t\t\tNo... please. Don't do this to me.\n\n\tShe struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In \n\tanguish and in fear.\n\n\t\t\t\tSARAH (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWhat do you want?\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tYou.\n\n\tThe trigger pulls .... Pop!\n\n\tA dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's \n\tstomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly \n\tshe's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless \n\tto the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is \n\tthe sound of someone breathing.\n\n\tOn Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her \n\tcheek..\n\n\tAlmost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation \n\truns across her breast and strokes down her body. The \n\tsense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian \n\tsighs.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN'S VOICE\n\t\t\tI've always liked your feistiness. \n\n\tSarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently, \n\taccompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. \n\tSebastian exhales, his breath filled with the \n\tintoxication of power.\n\n\tINT.

I'm losing him.\n\n\tBut it's Linda and Matt.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tDid you see her?\n\n\tLinda rushes over to check on Carter.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tWhere is she?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tShe went to the supply room. Carter \n\t\t\tneeded blood.\n\n\tLinda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carter's heart.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tI said no one goes anywhere alone.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tShe didn't listen.\n\n\tShe-slowly pulls Frank's hand away from the wound.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tBut...\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tHe's dead.\n\n\tLinda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford \n\therself the luxury.\n\n\tINT.

Sarah!\n\n\tThe group breaks into a run. Linda pushes into the \n\tchamber and falls at Sarah's side. Matt cradles Sarah's \n\thead. They look for some sign of life as Linda fights \n\tback the tears.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tNo...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tHer too?\n\n\tMatt nods.

And just what are we supposed to \n\t\t\tdo now?\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN'S VOICE\n\t\t\tNow?

The little red light on the intercom. \n\tIts on.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tSebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...\n\n\tLinda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no \n\tnothing. She listens. Shit.

They fall to the \n\tground. Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps \n\tback and her lips erupt with blood.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN'S VOICE\n\t\t\tFigured it out? You were always so \n\t\t\tclever.\n\n\tMatt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his \n\tneck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda \n\twatches him being pulled away.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tNo!\n\n\tShe clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is \n\ttossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart \n\tpistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing \n\tbut objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads \n\tfor cover.

I \n\t\t\tdid something bad, just to see if I \n\t\t\tcould get away with it. And when I \n\t\t\tdid, I realized I could have it all. I \n\t\t\tcan kill in broad daylight. And \n\t\t\tnobody's gonna tell the police they \n\t\t\twere fucked by a ghost. Anything I \n\t\t\tdesire I can make happen, but not if \n\t\t\tpeople know.\n\n\tLinda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She \n\tpushes through it and slams it behind her.\n\n\tINT.

CORRIDOR, LAB DOORS - DAY\n\n\tThe doors explode open.\n\n\tINT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY\n\n\tLinda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside \n\tthe supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier.\n\n\tLinda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.\n\n\tLinda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls \n\tto her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tMatt... Matthew. Stay with me now. \n\n\tLinda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and \n\tdeep.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tHe surprised us. We weren't \n\t\t\texpecting...\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tShhh. Don't talk.\n\n\tBAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against \n\tit again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks \n\taround the room and sees the storage freezer.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWe gotta move. Hang on.\n\n\tLinda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.\n\n\tINT. STORAGE FREEZER\n\n\tLinda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks \n\ton the door and the jam.\n\n\tBAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down \n\tnext to Matt.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tLin...\n\n\tHe entire shirt is stained with blood.

She \n\tstumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda \n\tscrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. \n\tSebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no \n\tavail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The \n\tdoor stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. \n\tThen she hears the click of the door locking.\n\n\tOUTSIDE THE FREEZER\n\n\tCLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five \n\tdegrees, down to negative twenty.\n\n\tINSIDE THE FREEZER\n\n\tThrough the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints \n\theading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and \n\tpushes on the door. It won't move.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tGoddamnit.\n\n\tLinda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of \n\tduct tape and pulls off a length.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tWhat're you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tThis is temporary.\n\n\tShe takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound.

STORAGE FREEZER\n\n\tLinda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear \n\trolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. \n\tThe tear drops freeze.

They're both already starting \n\tto turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the \n\tshelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she \n\tsees something. She looks back at the door lock and then \n\tshe rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the \n\tshelf.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWe're not dying in here.\n\n\n\tINT.

STORAGE FREEZER\n\n\tLinda furiously winds wire into a coil.\n\n\tINT. CORRIDOR\n\n\tSebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists \n\tin and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian \n\tpauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the \n\thallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he \n\tpulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping \n\tand footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. \n\tWith machine like precision, he turns and fires. The \n\ttranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing \n\ttumbles over.\n\n\tSebastian continues down the hallway.\n\n\tINT. STORAGE FREEZER\n\n\tLinda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other \n\tend is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an \n\toutlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead \n\tlights.\n\n\tA moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* \n\ta piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch \n\tshe smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.\n\n\tINT. LABORATORY\n\n\tSebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be \n\thard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off \n\tthe shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and \n\tbegins mixing.\n\n\tINT. STORAGE FREEZER\n\n\tLinda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to \n\tthe lightbulb, socket. \n\tSuddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies \n\tagainst the nearest metal surface. She's made an \n\telectromagnet.\n\n\tINT. LABORATORY\n\n\tSebastian loads the filled test tubes into the \n\tcentrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He \n\ttakes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment \n\tand then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The \n\tvial shatters and...\n\n\tEXPLODES.\n\n\tA powerful explosion that rocks the room.\n\n\tINT. STORAGE FREEZER\n\n\tLinda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up \n\tagainst the door.

Shaking...\n\n\tINSIDE THE DOOR -\n\n\tLinda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze \n\tand she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once \n\tsoaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes \n\therself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath \n\thangs as a low cloud of Mist.\n\n\tINT. LABORATORY - DAY\n\n\tSebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, \n\tcalculating their combined power in his mind. Then he \n\tcloses the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands \n\tinto its timer.\n\n\tINT. SUPPLY ROOM\n\n\tThe door lock twitches again and twists back. The door \n\tswings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a \n\tsupply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble \n\tevery which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.\n\n\tShe scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling \n\this cold body out of the storage locker.\n\n\tShe pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a \n\ttrashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the \n\tpaper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she \n\tdoes, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.\n\n\tINT. CORRIDOR\n\n\tSebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him.

CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY\n\n\tSebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up \n\tthe tunnel.

One One One One One.\n\n\t\t\t\tELEVATOR\n\t\t\tAuthorization valid. Thank you.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tSebastian!\n\n\tAnd there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds \n\ta oxygen container with a cut line.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI can't let you leave. Come on out and \n\t\t\tI'll give you one last chance.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tYou said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't \n\t\t\thold on to the past.\n\n\tThe door starts to shut.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tAaaaaaahhhh!\n\n\tShe hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A \n\tline of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. \n\tWWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs \n\ttoward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, \n\tshe slides. Her foot jamming into it. \n\tShe lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed \n\tinto the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in \n\tpain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical \n\tscrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives \n\ttoward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body \n\tfly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the \n\ttank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights \n\tflickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of \n\tsparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her \n\tfeet and turns to see...\n\n\tHalf of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a \n\tgruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned \n\trevealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like \n\tdeformed blackened bubble wrap.\n\n\tSebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with \n\tanother shot of flame.\n\n\tSebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the \n\tcorner.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tOh God!\n\n\tLinda stalks toward him.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA \n\t\t\tYou wanna see God? I'll show you God. \n\n\tLinda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex \n\tand clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, \n\tlooking like some ugly creature, pushes down the \n\tcorridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering \n\tand cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose \n\tanother jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and \n\tdoesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks \n\tpressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the \n\tblackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he \n\tpushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb \n\tthemselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet \n\tmoment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable \n\tshe is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. \n\tBut something on the ceiling catches her attention. She \n\tblasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE \n\tSPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water \n\tsprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the \n\tdownpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes \n\ttoward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs \n\tLinda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand \n\tsmashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, \n\tshe looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She \n\tcrawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to \n\ther feet and slams her against the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tI'm gonna find everyone in your family \n\t\t\tand kill them-. Your sister... she \n\t\t\tnever liked me. I think I'll go after \n\t\t\ther and her little boy first. \n\n\tSebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head \n\tcuts open, blood dripping down.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI just wanted you to know that before \n\t\t\tyou die.\n\n\tLinda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses \n\tagainst her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. \n\tBut through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see \n\tsomething also... a watery smudge.\n\n\tBAM!\n\n\tMATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian \n\tslams against the corridor wall and sinks down.\n\n\tMatt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. \n\tHe drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he \n\tsinks to his knees by Linda.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tThought I'd... thought I'd save you \n\t\t\tfor a change.\n\n\tHe gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT (cont'd)\n\t\t\tLet's got out of here.\n\n\tJust as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. \n\tHe swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the \n\tway, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The \n\tconduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The \n\tVOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the \n\tcurrent pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His \n\tblood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his \n\tskeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly \n\telectrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and \n\tmore visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in \n\tand out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.\n\n\tINT. CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n\tJust outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the \n\tsealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.\n\n\tThrough the doors porthole she sees a collection of \n\tchemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tNitro...\n\n\tMatt peaks inside.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tHe said it himself... All they'll find \n\t\t\tis a pile of charred corpses.\n\n\tShe sees the centrifuge... The timed counter on its face \n\tcounts down from a minute. Fifty nine. Fifty eight. Fifty \n\tseven...\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tHe's rigged the centrifuge.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tIn an enclosed space, he'll wipe out \n\t\t\tthe whole lab.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL\n\n\tLinda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the \n\tburned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We \n\tknow the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar \n\tat the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tGrab on.\n\n\tLinda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls \n\therself up. She reaches back down for Matt.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tForget about me. You go.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tFuck you. Give me your hands.\n\n\tLinda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. \n\tShe struggles, but they both manage to got him through \n\tthe hatch.\n\n\tINT. LABORATORY - DAY\n\n\tThree... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.\n\n\tThe centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.\n\n\tINT. VENT\n\n\tLinda and Matt are on top of the elevator.\n\n\tLinda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the \n\tsmooth metal surface.\n\n\tFrom the little light below she can see a maintenance \n\tladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. \n\tThey look up and see it disappear into the darkness.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tClimb!\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tBut...\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tClimb!\n\n\tMatt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right \n\tbehind him.\n\n\tINT. LABORATORY\n\n\tThe centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are \n\tstarting to rattle.\n\n\tINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n\tLinda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as \n\tthey can.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tI can't. I'm going to pass out.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tKeep moving.\n\n\tHe does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his \n\twound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much \n\tfurther they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in \n\tfrom the maintenance hatch below.\n\n\tINT. LABORATORY\n\n\tThe centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The \n\tvials shake violently.\n\n\tThen... one of the vials shatters.\n\n\tA FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the \n\tlaboratory.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL\n\n\tThe EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE \n\tFIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in \n\tits path.\n\n\tOne of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the \n\tflames. We see its shape briefly before it disappears In \n\ta wall of fire.\n\n\tINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n\tThe ladder begins to shake. The entire shaft begins to \n\trumble. Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward \n\tsafety.\n\n\tINT. EXHAUST VENT\n\n\tThe FIREBALL blows into the vent. Starts rolling down it \n\talso.\n\n\tINT. TUNNELS\n\n\tMore explosions.\n\n\tCHAIN REACTIONS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\n\n\tTHE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR. Slamming \n\tinto it... The elevator flies upward.\n\n\tINT. ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n\tThe rumbling worsens. The two desperately cling to the \n\tladder. They looks down to see...\n\n\tThe elevator...\n\n\tSURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the \n\texplosion's SHOCK WAVES.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tOh God!\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tDon't look.\n\n\tThe carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. \n\tIts loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the \n\twalls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls \n\therself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's \n\tpressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... \n\t30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. \n\tWhen Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF \n\tFEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing \n\tin.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tMove!\n\n\tPanicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares \n\tdown at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates \n\tbefore it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames \n\treaches up to lick the soles of her feet.\n\n\tThey hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the \n\televator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and \n\tBEGINS TO FALL.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tIt's coming down!\n\n\tFASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete \n\tfree- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. \n\tMetal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes \n\tshears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's \n\ttracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda \n\tsees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as \n\tit ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access \n\tladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but \n\tcontinues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the \n\televator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams \n\tthere, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and \n\tlook up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. \n\tThere's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the \n\tladder.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tC'mon. Before it slips.\n\n\tThey begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the \n\ttight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed \n\tby Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs \n\tthere a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed \n\tthrobbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her \n\tleg.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tIt's him.\n\n\tShe kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of \n\tdirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the \n\tladder.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tSebastian, you fuck.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tGet off me.\n\n\tSebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent \n\tdirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda \n\ttries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian \n\tgrabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. \n\tLinda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks \n\tdown at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She \n\tlets go!\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tNo!\n\n\tShe and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam \n\tagainst the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a \n\tfew above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below \n\ther. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But \n\tmetal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. \n\tLinda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing \n\tdark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from \n\thim. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over \n\tto the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tLet go of me.\n\n\tSebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into \n\ther from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand \n\treaches out and strokes her hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tRemember the day we met? You were \n\t\t\twearing a red dress and you were so \n\t\t\tpretty. Now... Now look at you.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT\n\t\t\tGet off of her!\n\n\tSebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with \n\this filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.\n\n\t\t\t\tMATT (cont'd)\n\t\t\tSebastian, stop it.\n\n\tLinda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try \n\tand grab her, help her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEBASTIAN\n\t\t\tYou fucked it all up.\n\n\tLinda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency \n\tbrake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold \n\tof the ladder.\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tGo to hell. \n\n\tLinda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES \n\t... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a \n\thundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto \n\tthe ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her \n\tback onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.\n\n\tEXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n\tLinda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. \n\tEmergency crews close from all directions, sirens \n\troaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into \n\tthe sky.\n\n\tAn ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop \n\tout, immediately putting a blanket around her and \n\ttreating Matt's wounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARINE GUARD\n\t\t\tWhat happened?\n\n\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\tWe lived.\n\n\tLinda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin \n\tand she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground... \n\talmost as if something was there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FADE \nOUT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHollow Man\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Gary Scott Thompson\u00a0\u00a0Andrew W.
