A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs\n\taskew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the\n\tcorner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly\n\tatop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a\n\tresounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR\n\tswings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE\n\trings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking\n\tit off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his\n\tback to the camera, phone in hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGURE\n\t\t\t(groggily)\n\t\tHello...What?...No, I don't work\n\t\ttoday...I'm playing hockey at two.\n\n\tTHE DOG yawns and shakes its head.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGURE (O.C.)\n\t\tWhy don't you call Randal?...\n\t\tBecause I'm fucking tired....I just\n\t\tclosed last night....\n\t\t\t(deep sigh)\n\t\tJesus...What time are you going to\n\t\tcome in?...Twelve...Be there be\n\t\ttwelve?...Swear...\n\n\tA PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy.

THE RUMPLED FIGURE\n\tslowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair\n\tand stands.\n\n\tTHE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The\n\tRumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It\n\tis the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is\n\tDante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tNext time, I get the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.\n\n\n\tHe releases the dog and sits up.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\t\t(exhausted)\n\t\tShit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT: BATHROOM.

THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a\n\tknife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack\n\tremains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.\n\tGround coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in\n\tthe coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes\n\tto life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY\n\tPARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of\n\tpapers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls\n\this eyes as it occurs to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tShit.\n\n\tThe register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT: CONVENIENCE STORE.

He struggles to hold them all in one hand\n\tas he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but\n\tthe sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops\n\thim.

All\n\t\tyou do is overcompensate for having\n\t\twhat's basically a monkey's job:\n\t\tYou push fucking buttons. Any moron\n\t\tcan waltz in here and do our jobs,\n\t\tbut you're obsessed with making it\n\t\tseem so much more fucking important,\n\t\tso much more epic than it really is.\n\t\tYou work in a convenience store,\n\t\tDante. And badly, I might add. And\n\t\tI work in a shitty video store.\n\t\tBadly, as well.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou know, that guy Jay's got it\n\t\tright-he has no delusions about\n\t\twhat he does. Us? We like to make\n\t\tourselves seem so much better than\n\t\tthe people that come in here, just\n\t\tlooking to pick up a paper or-God\n\t\tforbid-cigarettes. We look down on\n\t\tthem, as it we're so advanced.\n\t\tWell, if we're so fucking advanced,\n\t\tthen what are we doing working here?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t142.\n\n\n\tRANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong\n\twords alone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tDANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tDANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tI threw out the stuff that got\n\t\tbroken. The floor looks clean.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tYou need a ride?\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\t\t(looks out door)\n\t\tGot one. Just pulled up.\n\n\tThey stand in silence. Then...\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tDo you work tomorrow?\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tSame time. What about you?\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tI'm calling out. Going to hit the\n\t\thospital-see how Caitlin is. Then\n\t\ttry to see Veronica.\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tYou wanna grab something to eat\n\t\ttomorrow night...after I get out of\n\t\there?\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tI'll call you. Let you know.\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tAll right. Good luck with Veronica.\n\t\tIf you want, I can talk to her, you\n\t\tknow, and explain...\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tNo thanks. I'll take care of it.\n\t\tWe've got a lot of shit to talk\n\t\tabout.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t143.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tHelluva day.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tTo say the least.\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tDo you need a hug or something?\n\t\t'Cause I would have no hang-ups\n\t\tabout hugging you...you know, you\n\t\tbeing a guy and all. Just don't\n\t\tknead my ass when you do it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tGet the fuck outta here already.\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tI'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.\n\n\tRANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE\n\tthe sheet-sign.\n\n\t\t\t\tRANDAL\n\t\tYou're closed.\n\n\tHe exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.\n\n\tDANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open\n\tand starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.\n\n\tPOV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.\n\n\t\t\t\tDANTE\n\t\tWhat'd you forget something?\n\t\t\t(looks up, surprised)\n\t\tOh. I'm sorry, we're closed.\n\n\tA gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.\n\tHe stares ahead and slumps to the floor.\n\n\tJOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on\n\tthe floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs\n\ta paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of\n\tchange, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the\n\tframe. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.\n\n\tCREDITS\n\n\tCredits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes\n\tto the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for\n\ta clerk, looks down the aisles.\n\n\t\t\t\tCUSTOMER\n\t\tHello? Little help?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t144.\n\n\n\tNo reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to\n\tmake sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the\n\tcounter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClerks\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Kevin Smith\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:40.578641"}
