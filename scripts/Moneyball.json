OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 1\r\n\r\n           Static shots: A deserted locker room. Empty showers.\r\n           Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in\r\n           a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV.\r\n           LEGEND: October 15, 2001\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the\r\n           faint voice of an announcer -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n           ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who\r\n           has just three at bats in the series, and\r\n           none of them hits - as he settles back in\r\n\r\n                          -\r\n\r\n          2 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM -NIGHT 2\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           At the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty\r\n           diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on.\r\n\r\n           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n           - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has\r\n           it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut\r\n           off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that\r\n           wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in\r\n           fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure\r\n           seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:\r\n\r\n           STEVE LYONS V/O\r\n           - a ground out to second, Thom, is not\r\n           what the A's were looking for from Saenz -\r\n           down by two in the ninth -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of\r\n           peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty\r\n           diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the\r\n           baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the\r\n           radio back on -\r\n\r\n           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n           Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout\r\n           to bat for Menechino -\r\n\r\n           2.\r\n\r\n           2.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits.\r\n           Switches the radio back on -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n           - the A's are down to their last strike\r\n           and this Yankee crowd is on its feet -\r\n           Rivera squints for the sign, he has it,\r\n           delivers and -\r\n           Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits\r\n           just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n           It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees -\r\n           down two games to none - have come back\r\n           to win three, and the Division Series.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on\r\n           Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and\r\n           climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly\r\n           hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward\r\n           an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           STEVE LYONS V/O\r\n           This is an exceptional feat not only for\r\n           New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though\r\n           not the kind you can be proud of: Only\r\n           once before has a team lost a Division\r\n           Series after winning the first two games -\r\n\r\n          3 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 3\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           It's coming from a small television a night security\r\n           guard is watching. But when he sees Billy approaching,\r\n           he quickly shuts it off.\r\n\r\n                          BILLY\r\n           It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.\r\n           It's no big deal.\r\n\r\n                          SECURITY GUARD\r\n           No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently\r\n           turns in his hands -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          BILLY\r\n           How's Meg?\r\n\r\n                          SECURITY GUARD\r\n           She's good, thanks.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           - and the glass window of the bar behind him -\r\n\r\n           3.\r\n\r\n           3.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          BILLY\r\n           And the boys?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SECURITY GUARD\r\n           They're good.

In my\r\n           job as the national cross-checker for the\r\n           New York Mets, I see the top 200 players\r\n           in the United States. It's been a while\r\n           since I've seen a five tools guy, the\r\n           complete package. Your throwing ability,\r\n           your fielding skills... Ed told me you had\r\n           power but I had no idea it was of the\r\n           light tower variety. I hope you're as\r\n           interested in professional baseball as we\r\n           are in acquiring you in the upcoming\r\n           draft.\r\n\r\n           27.\r\n\r\n           27.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          BILLY\r\n           Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with\r\n           my parents, decide if baseball is\r\n           something I want to do full time. I have\r\n           a scholarship to play football at\r\n           Stanford.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          MARTINEZ\r\n           Well, Billy, we're certainly looking\r\n           forward to meeting your folks and talking\r\n           to them as well. And we believe in\r\n           college, but that's something you can do\r\n           in the winter months. You need to know\r\n           the sky's the limit with your ability.\r\n           You could be a superstar before you've\r\n           even graduated. But to get to that\r\n           level, you need to work with our people.\r\n           Pro-ball is where you need to be to\r\n           develop the skills God gave you.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          16 INT.

And it leads people who run\r\n          major league teams to misjudge their\r\n          players and mismanage their teams.\r\n          They're still asking the wrong questions.\r\n          People who run baseball teams still think\r\n          in terms of buying players.

To buy\r\n           wins, you buy runs. You're trying to\r\n           replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at\r\n           Johnny Damon and they see a star worth\r\n           seven point five million a year. When I\r\n           look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect\r\n           understanding of where runs come from.\r\n\r\n           SUDDEN CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          ARCHIVAL VIDEO: The back of Johnny Damon's A's jersey as\r\n          he walks to the plate to adoring Oakland fans.\r\n\r\n           PETER V/O\r\n           His batting average is ignorable. What\r\n           matters is his on base percentage-\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          DAMON swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left\r\n          field for a single. He leads off first--\r\n\r\n           PETER V/O\r\n           - which in 2001 was .324. That's 10\r\n           points lower than league average, and 17\r\n           points lower than Garcia's.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          On the next pitch, DAMON takes off for second--\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           PETER V/O\r\n           True, he stole some bases. But attempted\r\n           steals in general have to succeed 70% of\r\n           the time before they even start to\r\n           contribute to run totals. In 2001 he cost\r\n           you runs.\r\n          DAMON's tagged out at second.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          BACK TO THE GARAGE\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          PETER\r\n           He's got a good glove. He's a decent\r\n           leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's\r\n           not worth the seven point five million\r\n           Boston is paying him. You're lucky to\r\n           have him off your payroll, it opens all\r\n           kinds of interesting possibilities.\r\n\r\n                          BILLY\r\n           You read Bill James, Pete?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          PETER\r\n           Yes. These ideas and this approach to the\r\n           game aren't all new. In fact, some of\r\n           them have been around for two decades.\r\n\r\n           35.\r\n\r\n           35.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          BILLY\r\n           If this approach has been around for so\r\n           long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing\r\n           them?\r\n\r\n                          PETER\r\n           That's a much more difficult question\r\n           than how to win baseball games. Once you\r\n           begin to pull at that string, your\r\n           understanding of the world might begin to\r\n           unravel.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The elevator door closes.\r\n\r\n          21 INT.

He has it all --\r\n           power, speed, the arm. The Look -- and\r\n           I'm never wrong about that. Which is why\r\n           this is a premium number.\r\n           He sets a contract on the table. Clipped to its top-\r\n           sheet is a check. On its left-hand corner is the Mets\r\n           insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000. They all\r\n           see it. A lot of money in 1980. Silence.

I\r\n           do. But what I can't do is burn a second\r\n           first-round draft pick on someone who\r\n           can't play for four years -- no matter\r\n           how good he is. Four years is ample time\r\n           for someone to get hurt. It happens all\r\n           the time. So, no. I'm sorry. It has to\r\n           be one or the other. To postpone four\r\n           years is four years he could be in big\r\n           leagues.

Magnante on the other hand, he\r\n           doesn't think very much of himself at\r\n           all, and when he tightens up we've got\r\n           ourselves an adventure.

According to the scoreboard, it's\r\n           2 outs, 2 strikes. If Koch throws a strike, the game is\r\n           over.
