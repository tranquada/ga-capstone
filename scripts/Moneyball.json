THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV.\r\n           LEGEND: October 15, 2001\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the\r\n           faint voice of an announcer -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n</b>           ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who\r\n           has just three at bats in the series, and\r\n           none of them hits - as he settles back in\r\n\r\n<b>                          -\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          2 EXT.

Just a couple of the floodlights are on.\r\n\r\n<b>           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n</b>           - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has\r\n           it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut\r\n           off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that\r\n           wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in\r\n           fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure\r\n           seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:\r\n\r\n<b>           STEVE LYONS V/O\r\n</b>           - a ground out to second, Thom, is not\r\n           what the A's were looking for from Saenz -\r\n           down by two in the ninth -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of\r\n           peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty\r\n           diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the\r\n           baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the\r\n           radio back on -\r\n\r\n<b>           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n</b>           Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout\r\n           to bat for Menechino -\r\n\r\n<b>           2.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           2.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           He turns it off again.

Waits\r\n           just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>           BRENNAMAN V/O\r\n</b>           It is bedlam in New York.

He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and\r\n           climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly\r\n           hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward\r\n           an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>           STEVE LYONS V/O\r\n</b>           This is an exceptional feat not only for\r\n           New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though\r\n           not the kind you can be proud of: Only\r\n           once before has a team lost a Division\r\n           Series after winning the first two games -\r\n\r\n<b>          3 INT.

He's the Greek\r\n           God of Walks.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           On the TV, the batter takes another pitch just off the\r\n           edge of the strike zone.\r\n\r\n<b>           63.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           63.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          PETER\r\n</b>           I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last\r\n           June.
