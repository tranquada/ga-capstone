It's the regular\nmix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying\nfreshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-\nshirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...\n\n...a very nervous MAN.\n\nShifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.\nWe hold on him for a moment, but not for too long.

He looks to Jones -- \"Well? What about\nyour end of the bargain?\"\n\nFrom within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet\npouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find\ndiamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.\n\nHe hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath\ncandy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,\nhigh-tech triggering mechanism.\n\n                        JAMES EARL JONES\n          Ah, c-5.

Alex helps him with his\ndashiki-chute, and then all three look up...\n\nHere comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,\ncatching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still\nbound, still scared out of his wits.

She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives\nunderneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts.\n\n-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat.\nThe scene goes something like this:\n\nINT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM\n\nThunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating\nat full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when\n\nTHREE SHOTS\n\nring out.

With no\ngood shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns BLAZING.\nHe shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a\ncascade of hot water.\n\nDylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded.\n\nOther pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading\nto an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an\ninch of water grows on the floor.\n\nNatalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin\nMan's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes\nthey're just trying to waste his bullets.\n\nHolstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                    29.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nOn the far wall, Natalie switches on the overhead hooks,\nwhich circle on a wire like a ski lift. The Thin Man\nlooks up, distracted, not noticing --\n\nDYLAN\n\nAs she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry\ncarts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man\nas he talks on the phone.\n\nShe clears her throat.      The Thin Man turns.   She kicks\nhim in the jaw.\n\nKnocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips\nunder a washing machine.\n\nHe crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet.\nWe weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.\n\nHE TURNS TO SEE\n\nNATALIE\n\nright behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun\narm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling\nover to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of\npotatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.\n\n                             NATALIE\n             Hey!    Hands off, assh....\n\nBefore she can finish her sentence, the Thin Man throws\nNatalie at Dylan, knocking them both down. He jumps up,\nand with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks\nanother, releasing a wall of steam -- we can't see a thing.\n\nBy the time the fog clears, the Thin Man is long gone.\n\n                           NATALIE\n             Okay, to summarize? Damn.\n\nLying down in the water, Dylan reaches under the washer\nto fish out the Thin Man's busted cell phone.\n\nINT.

You're right.\n                    (quickly)\n             I'll just kill you.\n\nBLAM!\n\nIt all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting\nCharlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox.\nAlex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance\nto go off.\n\nDylan runs to Charlie's side.\n\n                            DYLAN\n             Charlie, no.   NO!\n\nShe hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round\ntheir fallen leader. He gasps for air.\n\n                           DYLAN (CONT'D)\n             He's trying to say something.\n\nThen Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for\nair, there's something stuck in his mouth.\n\nWith a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice\nchip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene.\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                101.\n\nCONTINUED:\n                           VOICE\n             Ucch, that tasted terrible!\n\nThe voice isn't Charlie's. Dylan reaches down and rips\noff Charlie's mask, revealing...\n\n                            NATALIE\n             Bosley!   Are you okay?\n\n                            BOSLEY\n             Think so.\n\nHe pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small\nwound where the bullet grazed his side.\n\n                           BOSLEY (CONT'D)\n             Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.\n\nDylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair.\n\n                           DYLAN\n             Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's\n             here... then where's Charlie?\n\nThe Angels all look at each other.      No one knows.\n\nEXT. CENTER PASSAGE - DAY\n\nIn gorgeous SLOW MOTION, the three angels walk side-by-side\nwith a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them.\n\nThey won.\n\nAs MUSIC rises, the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends, then peels\naway to reveal...\n\nEXT. GORGEOUS BEACH - DAY\n\nThe angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in-\nhand. Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc\non his sniffer.\n\nCharlie is on the cellular speakerphone.\n\n                           CHARLIE'S VOICE\n             Great work, angels. You'll be happy\n             to know you received another\n             presidential commendation.\n\nThe Angels, and Bosley, clink glasses.\n\n                           CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)\n             Enjoy your vacation, angels.\n\n                           THE ANGELS\n             Thank you Charlie.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                102.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nThey toast the speakerphone.\n\n                           CHARLIE'S VOICE\n             Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been\n             putting in some long hours on this case,\n             so I thought you might enjoy a chance to\n             catch up with some old friends.\n\nNATALIE AND ALEX TURN TO SEE\n\nPETER AND JASON\n\nwalking across the beach towards them. Each is carrying a\ndrink of his own. They wave. Damn those men look good.\n\nAlex and Natalie share a smile.\n\n                           DYLAN\n             Any chance you'll be joining us,\n             Charlie?\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\nA SUNNY DECK\n\nWe're in Charlie's point-of-view. We can see part of his\nreflection in the window -- not enough to see his face,\nbut we get some sense of the man.\n\nHe turns away, begins walking.    Steps down onto the sand.\n\n                           CHARLIE\n                    (to cell phone)\n             I'd love to, Angels. But I have some\n             precious treasures to watch over.\n\nWith that, he hangs up. We stay in his P.O.V., walking\nacross the beach. And it's not just any beach.\n\nTO THE LEFT, WE NOTICE\n\nPETE AND JASON\n\napproaching.    We're on the same beach.\n\nLooking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley.\nThey have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them.\n\nA beat, then Dylan looks back.\n\nShe looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we\nmove past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie?\nFrom her reaction, it's not clear.\n\nA beat, then we...\n\nCHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                            103.\n\nREVERSE ANGLE/NOT P.O.V.\n\nDylan looks back forward again. Did she just see Charlie?\nHer smile tells us she thinks she did.\n\nShe raises a toast.\n\n                           DYLAN\n          To Charlie.\n\n                           THE ANGELS AND BOSLEY\n          To Charlie.\n\nThey knock glasses.\n\nRight at the moment we should probably fade out, Bosley\nspills his icy drink in his lap. His eyes go wide.\n\nThe Angels just have to laugh.\n\nWe FREEZE FRAME, then...\n\nCUT TO BLACK.\n\n                               THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlie's Angels\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Ed Solomon\u00a0\u00a0John August\u00a0\u00a0Zak Penn\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:24.488085"}
