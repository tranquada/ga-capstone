Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.\nWe hold on him for a moment, but not for too long.

He looks to Jones -- \"Well? What about\nyour end of the bargain?\"\n\nFrom within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet\npouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find\ndiamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.\n\nHe hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath\ncandy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,\nhigh-tech triggering mechanism.\n\n<b>                        JAMES EARL JONES\n</b>          Ah, c-5.

THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY\n</b>\n-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug.\nThey plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's\nfrantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.\n\n<b>DROPPING WITH THEM\n</b>\nThey continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is\nterrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact,\ncasually, he glances at his watch, and then looks --\n\n<b>FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY\n</b>\nAt the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the\ndistance...\n<b>\n</b><b>CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               4.\n</b>\n<b>CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK\n</b>\nIt's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps\nout, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the\nsky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards\n\n<b>JONES AND PASQUAL\n</b>\nwho are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal\nvelocity.

Pasqual's chute deploys. He\nflies upward, leaving --\n\nAlex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the\nocean screams up at them. Not much time left.\n\nJames Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies\nup. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his\nentire dashiki.

Alex helps him with his\ndashiki-chute, and then all three look up...\n\nHere comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,\ncatching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still\nbound, still scared out of his wits.

She grabs the wooden seat and whips\nit up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it\nlike a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin.\n\nQuickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4.\n\n<b>                           DYLAN (CONT'D)\n</b>             Now, guys, I warned you.

Then Dylan does a head\nfake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving\neach man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall.\n\nJust Guards #5 and 6 left.
