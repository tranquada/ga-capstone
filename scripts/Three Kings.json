IRAQI DESERT - DAY\n</b>\n     WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky.\n\n     THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the\n     distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT\n     CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING.\n\n     The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders\n     APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY\n     BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is\n     a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.\n\n     Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER\n     stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares\n     at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag\n     over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy\n     turns around, we see his face for the first time.\n\n<b>                         TROY\n</b>               Are we shooting people, or what?\n\n<b>                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)\n</b>               <u>Are we shooting?</u>\n\n<b>                         TROY\n</b>               <u>That's what I'm asking you.</u>\n\n<b>                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)\n</b>               <u>What's the answer?</u>\n\n<b>                         TROY\n</b>               <u>I don't know the answer.

He aims at the figure on\n     the horizon.\n\n<b>     POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\n</b>\n     The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing,\n     loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound.\n\n     Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck\n     explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of\n     Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up\n     to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing.\n\n<b>                         SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)\n</b>               <u>That guy just shot a towel head.</u>\n\n<b>                         SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)\n</b>               <u>Bullshit.</u>\n\n<b>     YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER\n</b>\n     lies on the ground.

Archie takes\n     the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord\n     binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol.\n\n     Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks\n     down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into\n     the Interrogator's face.\n\n     The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie\n     watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side\n     of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator\n     looks terrified, crying.
