ELLIS' ROOM - PREDAWN 1\r\n</b>\r\n           ELLIS(14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed. He is a\r\n           wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip\r\n           struggling desperately to be a mustache.\r\n           His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny. A\r\n           backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him.\r\n           The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie. Ellis\r\n           quickly grabs it.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           I'm comin' out now.\r\n\r\n           He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his\r\n           shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot\r\n           of his bed. He's out in one motion.\r\n\r\n<b>          2 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - PREDAWN 2\r\n</b>\r\n           Ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two-\r\n           foot-wide section of decking.\r\n           He lives on a HOUSEBOAT anchored just off the bank of the\r\n           Arkansas River. The \"boat\" is really the combination of a\r\n           double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together\r\n           atop large flotilla.\r\n           Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat. He\r\n           slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted\r\n           window. VOICES come from inside.\r\n           Slowly, Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window.\r\n\r\n<b>          3 INT. ELLIS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 3\r\n</b>\r\n           MARY LEE(41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator.\r\n           SENIOR(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper. The\r\n           mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room.\r\n\r\n<b>                          MARY LEE\r\n</b>           I just want to have a conversation.\r\n           I just want to talk about it.\r\n\r\n           Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up\r\n           from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger\r\n           toward him.\r\n\r\n<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           If you don't look up from that\r\n           goddamn paper...\r\n\r\n           She stops before completing the thought.\r\n           After a moment, Senior lowers his paper. He stares across\r\n           the table at his wife. He looks at her with true disdain.\r\n\r\n<b>           2.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n           His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling\r\n           on his cup of coffee. He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and\r\n           sets it back on the table. He raises the paper up.\r\n           Mary Lee's eyes soften. She bites the inside of her cheek to\r\n           keep from crying. Her eyes move to the kitchen window.\r\n\r\n<b>          4 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 4\r\n</b>\r\n           Ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word \"shit.\"\r\n           He slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers\r\n           a boat, fish cleaning station, and industrial ice machine.\r\n           The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick\r\n           ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla. The ropes\r\n           extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees.\r\n           Ellis sprints across a simple, wood-planked bridge to shore.\r\n           His houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank.\r\n\r\n<b>          5 EXT. ELLIS' RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 5\r\n</b>\r\n           Ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path.\r\n           Waiting for him there is NECKBONE(14), a scrawny kid with\r\n           slicked back blonde hair wearing a FUGAZI T-shirt. He sits\r\n           atop a smallish dirt bike. Ellis hops on the back.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           What the shit man?\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Suck it. Drive.\r\n           The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail.\r\n\r\n<b>          6 EXT. RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 6\r\n</b>\r\n           From a distance, the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes\r\n           up and down, in and out of trees along the riverbank.\r\n\r\n<b>           ON THE BIKE,\r\n</b>           The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees\r\n           illuminated by the straining headlight.\r\n\r\n<b>          7 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAWN 7\r\n</b>\r\n           The boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill. Now on\r\n           foot, they are silhouetted against a light blue, morning sky.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           How old is she?\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           A Junior.\r\n\r\n<b>           3.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n           At a collection of trees growing out of the water, the boys\r\n           move branches away from a tarp covered boat.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           She's got nice titties. You talk\r\n           to her?\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Nah.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           You're gonna have to talk to her.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           I know.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Remind me when we get back to my\r\n           house, Galen's got a book on that.\r\n           Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom\r\n           boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat,\r\n           launches them out into the water.\r\n\r\n<b>          8 EXT. RIVER - MORNING 8\r\n</b>\r\n           A chunk of Neckbone's greased back hair bobs in the wind as\r\n           they cruise down river. Ellis steers a small 15 horsepower\r\n           motor. An orange sun is coming up now.\r\n           Neckbone's eyes lock on what's in front of them. Ellis kills\r\n           the motor. Neckbone stands up, a serious look on his face.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Shit.\r\n           Ellis raises up behind him. He takes a deep breath, nods.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Your dad'd kill us he knew we went\r\n           out there.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           I'm not worried about my dad\r\n           killin' us.\r\n           THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's\r\n           enormous.\r\n           Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river\r\n           by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown\r\n           water and yellow foam six football fields wide.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           What if it sinks?\r\n\r\n<b>           4.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move\r\n           if we're gonna make it back. Set\r\n           your watch. We'll need a good\r\n           fifteen minutes.\r\n           Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They\r\n           take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor.\r\n           The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river.\r\n\r\n<b>          9 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MORNING 9\r\n</b>\r\n           The boat lurches through the murky, rushing water.\r\n           Neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boat's edges.\r\n           Ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact\r\n           against this current.\r\n           The tail end of the boat swings to the right. Ellis flinches\r\n           and grabs an edge to steady himself. The front of the boat\r\n           bobs toward an ISLAND in the middle of the river.\r\n           Neck turns to Ellis and points.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           THERE IT IS!\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          10 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 10\r\n</b>\r\n           The boys splash down in ankle deep water. They take hold of\r\n           the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore.\r\n           Neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island.\r\n           Ellis snatches up his backpack and follows.\r\n\r\n<b>          11 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - CONTINUOUS 11\r\n</b>\r\n           The island, only 60 some yards in diameter, is separated by a\r\n           clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center.\r\n           The trees make it so you can't see from one side of the\r\n           island to the other.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Galen thinks it's been here awhile.\r\n           Thinks the last flood did it.\r\n           Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees. They stop\r\n           at a deep creek that cuts across the island. Neckbone looks\r\n           to his right, then his left. Sees what he's looking for.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           It's down there.\r\n           A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek. Ellis starts\r\n           across.\r\n\r\n<b>           5.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Hold it.\r\n           Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Look.\r\n           Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins\r\n           curl around in the creek. Neckbone drops the stone on top of\r\n           them. The snakes fan out.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Little shits.\r\n           Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk.\r\n\r\n<b>          12 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - DAY 12\r\n</b>\r\n           The boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up.\r\n           Ellis cranes his neck back. Awestruck.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           So there it is.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Yeah, there it is.\r\n           A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above.\r\n\r\n<b>          13 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - MOMENTS LATER 13\r\n</b>\r\n           The boys scale up the tree from low lying branches.\r\n           Ellis, hands on the edge of the boat, gets a leg over the\r\n           side and pulls himself onto the deck. He reaches down and\r\n           helps to drag Neckbone on board.\r\n           They get to their feet, steadying themselves on the wooden\r\n           deck. It's solid. They take in their new vantage point.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           It came down from up there.\r\n           Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off.\r\n           Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head\r\n           over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Motor broke off.\r\n           Ellis isn't concerned with the motor. His eyes are locked on\r\n           a covered cabin at the front of the boat.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Who else knows about this?\r\n\r\n<b>           6.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Just me and Galen.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           What's he think?\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           He don't care about it.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Good.\r\n           Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           'Cause this boat's ours.\r\n           Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows.\r\n\r\n<b>          14 INT. BOAT CABIN - CONTINUOUS 14\r\n</b>\r\n           Ellis, stooping over, makes his way into the tiny cabin room.\r\n           Yellow floral curtains, stained with age, cover a row of\r\n           windows that wrap around the top of the cabin. These provide\r\n           an odd glow in an otherwise dark, wood paneled space.\r\n           There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left. To\r\n           the right, a mold-covered sink and mirror.\r\n           Neckbone peers over Ellis' shoulder at the front of the cabin\r\n           room. A small booth sits to the right across from a\r\n           miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           It's got its own shitbox\r\n           Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light\r\n           streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers.\r\n           Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           This is perfect.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Ho-Lee-Shit.\r\n           Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of\r\n           Playboys from the 1980's.\r\n           Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot\r\n           against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home.\r\n           Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Aw shit.\r\n\r\n<b>           7.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a\r\n          dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from\r\n          the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own.\r\n          He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a\r\n          CROSS has been left in the heel.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Her tits are so small.\r\n          Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the\r\n          cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin.\r\n          On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty\r\n          cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag.\r\n          Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Neck.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Look at that beave. You gotta see\r\n           this.\r\n          Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag.

His backpack\r\n           resting at his feet, he holds the Walkie-Talkie in his hand.\r\n           Senior works behind him washing utensils in the outdoor sink.\r\n\r\n<b>           22.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           What do you know about Tom\r\n           Blankenship?\r\n\r\n<b>                          SENIOR\r\n</b>           What?\r\n           Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Mr. Blankenship, what do you know\r\n           about him?\r\n\r\n<b>                          SENIOR\r\n</b>           Why?\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           I don't know.

He pretends\r\n           to peruse the canned food and notices that it's a big display\r\n           of Beanie Weenie. He grabs two handfuls as she passes.\r\n           Ellis takes the cans to an open register. As a CASHIER scans\r\n           and bags his items, he cranes his neck looking for her.\r\n           She's disappeared into another section of the store.\r\n           Ellis pays in crumpled cash. A horn HONKS. He sees Galen's\r\n           truck idling out front. He grabs the bag and runs out.\r\n\r\n<b>          38 EXT.

She runs her\r\n           finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea.\r\n           It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a\r\n           salad. The table is set for two. She's been waiting.\r\n           Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him.

The sound of\r\n           his Mother clearing the table seeps through.\r\n           He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood. His\r\n           face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat.\r\n           On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark\r\n           bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing.\r\n           Ellis looks at his backpack. It has spilled open revealing a\r\n           can of Beanie Weenie. Ellis studies the can.\r\n           He looks back to the window. His breathing settles.\r\n           Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window.\r\n\r\n<b>          42 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 42\r\n</b>\r\n           It's pitch black. The only light comes from the moon's\r\n           reflection off the surface of the water.\r\n           Ellis, eyes wide, navigates the small boat through choppy\r\n           black water.\r\n\r\n<b>           35.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          43 EXT.

He sizes\r\n           up the dark woods.\r\n           He removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down\r\n           the shorelines. Still nothing. Ellis follows the beam of\r\n           light into the woods.\r\n\r\n<b>          44 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - NIGHT 44\r\n</b>\r\n           Ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island.\r\n           He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the\r\n           distance. A RUSTLING behind him. He swings the light\r\n           around. Nothing but trees.\r\n           Ellis takes a deep breath. Finding the log to cross, he\r\n           shines his light down into the creek. The nest of snakes\r\n           show their backs.\r\n\r\n<b>          45 EXT.

The firelight\r\n           illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above.\r\n           Ellis, his flashlight off, crouches behind a tree and watches\r\n           the campsite.

Carver walks over to her.\r\n          Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and\r\n          holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CARVER\r\n</b>           I know you know where he is.

He removes a Ziplock bag\r\n          containing the note that Mud sent.\r\n          Neckbone hands it to Ellis. Taking the note, he sets his ice\r\n          down and walks over to Juniper.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Mud sent us to give this to you.\r\n          Juniper is stunned.

A series of ropes and pulleys\r\n           crisscross from the boat to the trees.\r\n           Neckbone and Ellis stand on the ground staring up at him.\r\n           Mud holds a chainsaw and seems to be hesitating.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           Well if you're gonna do it do it!\r\n           Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord. Angled on one of\r\n           the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting.\r\n           Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they\r\n           watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb.\r\n           Suddenly, the chainsaw stops. A deep CRACKING sound. The\r\n           huge branch SNAPS, tumbling off lower limbs before crashing\r\n           to the ground. Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life.\r\n           The branch now rests on the ground, SILENCE. The ropes and\r\n           pulleys hang taught, squeaking from the weight of the boat.\r\n           Mud slowly lifts his head up. He smiles at what he sees.\r\n           The rigging has held.\r\n\r\n<b>                          MUD\r\n</b>           One down!\r\n           Neckbone and Ellis watch as Mud scampers around the trunk to\r\n           the next branch.

The man, early thirties with a thick mustache, is\r\n           JAMES. He leans against the grill of a black Lincoln.\r\n\r\n<b>           67.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n           Carver appears from inside the Piggly Wiggly. He holds a cup\r\n           of coffee and is closely trailed by a fat little man,\r\n           NELSON(56). They're all dressed in a similar fashion, a\r\n           cross between rural farmers and rodeo stars.\r\n           As Carver approaches the Lincoln, he scolds James for leaning\r\n           on the grill.

May Pearl has vanished.\r\n           Pryor, the skinny kid Ellis punched to get this date, wanders\r\n           past. He makes eye contact. Ellis stares him down.

The real reason Mud's in\r\n           the trouble he's got is because of\r\n           her. He's been in love with that\r\n           girl since he was your age. They\r\n           used to run all around here and it\r\n           was the same back then. He'd\r\n           follow that girl wherever she led\r\n           him. Problem is she don't care\r\n           about nobody but herself. I've\r\n           told him as much. She'd bed down\r\n           with the meanest snake she could\r\n           find, then when things went bad\r\n           she'd go runnin' to Mud. Mud would\r\n           take her back, then go find\r\n           whatever unlucky sonofabitch last\r\n           put a hand on her and beat `em `til\r\n           they knew to never touch her again.\r\n           And this time I guess he thought a\r\n           beating wasn't good enough. Had to\r\n           shoot that fella. I don't know for\r\n           sure, but I'd put money on Juniper\r\n           knowin' he'd do it. And I have a\r\n           suspicion she might of even told\r\n           him to. Either way, those two are\r\n           set for failure. Only chance Mud\r\n           has is to cut her loose. Cause\r\n           I'll tell you what, Mud's no bad\r\n           ass. He's runnin' scared.\r\n          Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old\r\n          man's remarks.

Ellis follows his line of sight.\r\n           The crowd weaves in front of him, but then he sees her.\r\n           Juniper leans against a pool table at the far end of the bar.\r\n           A GUY(32) whispers in her ear and kisses her neck. She\r\n           throws her head back, laughing. Ellis watches in disbelief.\r\n           Nearby, the BARTENDER(46) fills a customer's shot glass.

The Guy keeps whispering\r\n           in her ear. Juniper straightens her back slightly.\r\n           Ellis can't take his eyes off her. Juniper stares back at\r\n           him, but doesn't make a move.\r\n           After a moment, Juniper's eyes fall to the floor. She turns\r\n           her head back to the Guy.

I was so angry\r\n           the tips of my ears were burnin'.\r\n           That's how I knew I was gonna kill\r\n           this man. But when I got up close\r\n           enough, I saw that the man she was\r\n           with had tattoos on his back, just\r\n           like mine. I moved in closer and\r\n           the guy turns his head back toward\r\n           me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the\r\n           guy she was with was me.\r\n          Mud ducks back under the motor. Ellis looks at Neckbone,\r\n          worried.\r\n\r\n<b>           96.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           I'll finish the boat, but I'd be\r\n           surprised if I live long enough to\r\n           sail on it.

They\r\n           crouch by it, speaking quietly.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NECKBONE\r\n</b>           You be all right?\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           Yeah.

Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox.\r\n           Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor\r\n           and walks back into the woods. On his way, he stops to hang\r\n           Mud's shirt on a tree branch.\r\n\r\n<b>          108 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 108\r\n</b>\r\n           Ellis rides in the flat bottom boat alone.

He gets off\r\n           the bike and walks toward it. Ellis removes the flier Carver\r\n           gave him. He dials a phone number copied at the bottom.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           (into the phone)\r\n           Hello.

He walks back over to the bike,\r\n           climbs on and waits.\r\n           After a moment, he watches as Miller's green pick-up pulls\r\n           out of the Piggly Wiggly parking lot and races away. Ellis\r\n           cranks the bike.\r\n\r\n<b>          110 EXT.

The green pick-up is nowhere in sight.\r\n           At Juniper's door, he knocks twice, softly. The door swings\r\n           opens.

Ellis drops the hose.\r\n           Senior's voice, speaking into the telephone, faintly carries\r\n           outside. He's yelling.

He hears the phone SLAM down.\r\n           Senior appears at the back door. He stares at Ellis through\r\n           the fire. Ellis moves to the side but realizes Senior isn't\r\n           staring at him. He's staring at the fire.\r\n           Senior disappears back into the house. There is a commotion.\r\n           Ellis watches as Senior bursts out of the house holding an\r\n           armful of woman's clothes. Senior walks up to the bonfire\r\n           and begins tossing clothes on top piece by piece.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           What are you doing?\r\n           Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in\r\n           the flames.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Stop it!

He watches the town pass by.\r\n          A168 The marina junkyard. The Sonic. Downtown. A168\r\n\r\n<b>           125.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          B168 EXT. FLEA MARKET - DAY B168\r\n</b>\r\n           Ellis and his father unload a cooler at the back of a tented\r\n           flea market. A WOMAN comes out to greet them.\r\n\r\n<b>          169 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/NEW APARTMENTS - DAY 169\r\n</b>           Senior's truck pulls into the parking lot of a newly finished\r\n           apartment complex. The two-story buildings are modest.\r\n           The truck idles out front.\r\n\r\n<b>           INSIDE THE CAB,\r\n</b>           Ellis grabs the door handle. He turns to Senior.\r\n\r\n<b>                          ELLIS\r\n</b>           I'll see you next week?\r\n\r\n<b>                          SENIOR\r\n</b>           Yeah.\r\n           Ellis begins to get out but stops when Senior speaks.\r\n\r\n<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Ellis? You mind your mother okay?\r\n           This is a big change for her.

He watches as Senior pulls away.\r\n           He stands alone in front of the apartments, studying the\r\n           surroundings. A busy road out front. A gas station and\r\n           collection of stores. A lot of people and commotion.\r\n           A compact car pulls into a parking spot one building down.\r\n\r\n           Ellis watches as three COLLEGE AGE GIRLS climb out dressed in\r\n           running shorts and t-shirts. Two are heavy set, the other is\r\n           petite. They joke and laugh. One sees Ellis and waves.\r\n           Ellis nods to her. He tracks them as they walk inside.\r\n           Ellis smirks.\r\n\r\n<b>          170 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 170\r\n</b>\r\n           The river rushes past. A large motor churns the water.\r\n\r\n<b>           126.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n           Tom stands steering Mud's salvaged boat down river. He\r\n           cranes his neck, seeing something up ahead.\r\n           Tom kills the motor. Looking out over the bow, he's pleased\r\n           by what he sees. His eyes glint, almost a smile. He walks\r\n           to the small cabin and enters.\r\n\r\n<b>          171 INSIDE THE CABIN, 171\r\n</b>           Mud rests flat on his stomach on the cushioned bench.\r\n           Shirtless, gauze bandages wrap around his chest and back.\r\n           He's sleeping.\r\n           Tom walks in and kneels next to him. Touches his shoulder.\r\n           Mud's eyes open.\r\n\r\n<b>                          TOM\r\n</b>           Come on son. You need to see this.\r\n           Mud, groggy, raises up. Tom helps him to his feet, putting\r\n           an arm over his shoulders. Tom practically carries Mud\r\n           outside.\r\n\r\n<b>          172 ON DECK, 172\r\n</b>           Tom and Mud slowly maneuver out the door and take a place\r\n           near the front of the boat.\r\n           Mud pulls his head up. Looks out ahead. The sight in front\r\n           of him grabs his attention. He perks up.\r\n           A tributary from the Mississippi river opens up into a vast\r\n           stretch of ocean.\r\n           Mud smiles, showing the missing tooth.\r\n           Tom and Mud stand on deck as their boat drifts slowly into\r\n           the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n           The End.\r\n\r\n<b>                          \r\n</b>\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Mud.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Mud</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Jeff Nichols\" title=\"Scripts by Jeff Nichols\">Jeff Nichols</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Mud Script.html#comments\" title=\"Mud comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:12:04.956393"}
