In the background \n               is a revolving door leading to the street. Through the \n               revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously \n               one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. It is Comrade \n               Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade. Despite \n               the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical \n               Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a \n               fur cap, and heavy boots.\n\n               Buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed \n               by its magnificence. The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's \n               strange appearance, approaches him.\n\n                                     MANAGER\n                              (politely)\n                         Is there anything I can do for you, \n                         monsieur?\n\n                                     BULJANOFF\n                         No, no.\n\n               He exits toward the street. The Manager returns to his \n               customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly \n               dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. \n               It is Comrade Iranoff.\n\n               The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.\n\n                                     MANAGER\n                         Yes, monsieur?\n\n                                     IRANOFF\n                         Just looking around.\n\n               Iranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when \n               suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same \n               fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade \n               Kopalski.\n\n               Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it \n               turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager \n               is by now dumfounded.\n\n               STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE\n\n               A taxi stands at the curb. Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting \n               beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase. Kopalski, returning \n               from the hotel, joins the group.\n\n                                     KOPALSKI\n                         Comrades, why should we lie to each \n                         other?

Each click pounds on their consciences.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                              (looking up)\n                         Comrade Buljanoff...\n\n                                     BULJANOFF\n                         Yes, Comrade?\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Do you spell Buljanoff with one or \n                         two f's?\n\n                                     BULJANOFF\n                              (with fright in his \n                              voice)\n                         With two f's, if you please.\n\n               Ninotchka goes on with her typing. Suddenly she looks up at \n               Iranoff, who becomes self-conscious and fixes his tie. As he \n               does so he sees that Ninotchka's glance is concentrated on \n               the spats which he was wearing and in his hurry forgot to \n               remove. He knows it is too late to do anything about it except \n               to stand one foot behind the other, as Ninotchka types faster, \n               the clicking of her keys twice as loud. Ninotchka picks up \n               the telephone.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                              (into phone)\n                         Will you send me some cigarettes, \n                         please?\n                              (suddenly getting up)\n                         Comrades, I am not in a position to \n                         pass final judgment but at best you \n                         have been careless in your duty to \n                         the State.\n                              (with utmost gravity)\n                         You were entrusted with more than a \n                         mere sale of jewelry.

The CAMERA ZOOMS down to a CLOSE-\n               UP of the little drawing of the Hotel Clarence on the map. \n               The CAMERA then PANS OVER from the Clarence toward the \n               opposite side of the street, but before we reach the opposite \n               side we see that in the center of the street is a little \n               isle of safety.

Here \n                         goes! A man comes into a restaurant \n                         and sits down and says, \"Waiter!

Everyone else thinks so! \n                         Maybe you didn't get it.\n\n               He sits down again.\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (threateningly)\n                         I'll tell you that joke again. A man \n                         comes into a restaurant. Did you get \n                         that?\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     LEON\n                         He sits down at the table and says \n                         to the waiter... Did you get that \n                         too?\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     LEON\n                         Well, so far it isn't funny, but \n                         wait. He says to the waiter, \"Waiter! \n                         Bring me a cup of coffee.\" So the \n                         waiter comes back five minutes later \n                         and says, \"I'm sorry, sir, we have \n                         no coffee.\"...\n                              (he realizes he has \n                              made a mistake)\n                         Wait a minute... wait a minute... \n                         I'm all mixed up...\n                              (he starts over again)\n                         A man comes in a restaurant, he sits \n                         down, he calls the waiter and he \n                         says, \"Waiter!

No humor!!\n\n               In his excitement he leans on the shaky table. It topples \n               forward. Simultaneously his feet shoot from under him and he \n               sits violently on the floor, the contents of the table \n               crashing about him, hot soup in his face.\n\n               A terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is \n               rocking with laughter.\n\n               For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the \n               irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself \n               roars with laughter.\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (indignantly)\n                         What's funny about this?\n\n               Ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable.\n\n               After a moment Leon gets up and sits next to her. As he dries \n               himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation \n               and starts to howl with laughter too. The ice is broken at \n               last!\n\n               On their mutual wild hilarity, we\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               LIVING ROOM -- ROYAL SUITE\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               A conference is in session -- Ninotchka, her two Lawyers, \n               and the Three Russians. Ninotchka sits at the desk, leaning \n               back in the chair, looking into space, and apparently weighing \n               every point which is brought up. One of the lawyers is reading \n               from a document.\n\n                                     LAWYER\n                              (reading)\n                         In addition to the arguments above \n                         enumerated for lifting this \n                         injunction, we wish to cite the \n                         decision of the High Court of Paris, \n                         rendered in the case of Princess \n                         Marishka against the Government of \n                         Montenegro on the fifth day of August, \n                         1897.

They tell me it is \n                         extremely instructive.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, \n                         Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, \n                         Comrades. And why do we always keep \n                         the windows closed?\n                              (she opens the window)\n                         Isn't it amazing, at home there's \n                         still snow and ice and here... Look \n                         at the birds. I always felt a little \n                         hurt that our swallows deserted us \n                         in the winter for capitalistic \n                         countries. Now I know why. We have \n                         the high ideal but they have the \n                         climate... well, Comrades, I don't \n                         think I need you any more.\n\n                                     KOPALSKI\n                         If there is anything we can do for \n                         you...\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         No, not a thing. Would you like to \n                         go out?\n\n                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS\n                         Thank you, Comrade.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Have you any money?\n\n               The Russians stammer a negative answer.\n\n               Smiling benevolently, Ninotchka goes to the table, takes \n               several bills from her handbag, and goes back, extending a \n               fifty-franc bill to Kopalski.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Well, here are fifty francs.\n\n                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS\n                              (overwhelmed)\n                         Thank you, Comrade, thank you.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Bring me forty-five back.\n\n                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS\n                              (terribly disappointed)\n                         Naturally, Comrade.\n\n               The Three Russians leave. Ninotchka waits a moment. Then \n               hurries to the door and turns the key. Camera follows her as \n               she goes into the bedroom. She proceeds to the door leading \n               to the corridor and turns its key. She goes to the table and \n               takes a little key from her handbag, goes to the bureau and \n               unlocks the drawer, opens it, and, just as she is about to \n               take out something, her eye falls on the night table, where \n               she sees the picture of Lenin which she brought with her \n               from Moscow. She walks over to it and turns its face against \n               the wall, then goes back to the bureau and takes from the \n               drawer the very hat which twice aroused her disapproval when \n               it was displayed in the millinery shop in the lobby.\n\n               She moves over to the large mirror, puts the hat on her head, \n               is uncertain whether it is right side to fore, and changes \n               it. She looks at herself, aghast at seeing a complete \n               stranger. She sits down, still staring in the mirror, then \n               leans forward and rests her chin on her hand. As she sits \n               studying the new Ninotchka suspiciously, we\n\n               LIVING ROOM -- LEON'S APARTMENT\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               It is evening.

Outside stands \n               Ninotchka wearing her new hat timidly as well as a completely \n               new outfit which she has bought, apparently to match the new \n               hat. It takes Leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor. \n               He takes her hand and leads her in, closing the door. He \n               looks at her again and kisses her hand.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         I don't look too foolish?\n\n                                     LEON\n                         Foolish?

I wake up in the \n                         middle of the night and laugh at \n                         them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know \n                         they're not funny, they're silly. \n                         They're stupid. And still... I \n                         laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff \n                         and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they \n                         are scoundrels and I should hate \n                         them -- then I realize who made them \n                         like that, and instead of sending my \n                         report to Moscow I tear it up and go \n                         down and buy a ridiculous hat... and \n                         if this keeps on... am I too \n                         talkative?\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (radiantly)\n                         No... go on.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Leon, I want to tell you something \n                         which I thought I never would say, \n                         which I thought nobody ever should \n                         say, because I thought it didn't \n                         exist... and, Leon...

As the kiss ends they look at each other \n               for a second.\n\n               Ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk \n               chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from \n               it a little mirror and a lipstick. Before she uses it she \n               looks at Leon with guilty happiness. Leon looks at her with \n               great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking \n               at her as she makes up her lips.\n\n                                     LEON\n                         What a gesture for a sergeant.\n\n               As soon as she is finished, Ninotchka slips the mirror and \n               lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances \n               at the top of the desk.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Leon, I would like to ask you \n                         something.\n\n                                     LEON\n                         Anything, Ninotchka.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         If you don't want to answer, you \n                         needn't. But if you do, you must \n                         tell me the truth.\n\n                                     LEON\n                         I promise...

I thought what \n                         a waste of silver. That's all that \n                         interested me then. Now I would like \n                         to know... what happened to the woman?\n\n               Leon too is completely serious by now. For answer he quietly \n               opens the drawer of the desk. Ninotchka looks in and takes \n               from the drawer the photograph.

The guest \n               who has nudged her turns to Marianne.\n\n                                     GUEST\n                         Are you crazy?\n\n                                     ANOTHER GUEST\n                         How could you make such a remark?\n\n                                     THIRD GUEST\n                         Swana isn't stupid.\n\n                                     MARIANNE\n                         What did I say? I just said \"isn't \n                         she something?\" I didn't say something \n                         what.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S TABLE\n\n               Leon and Ninotchka are seated and a Waiter stands by them \n               presenting a bottle of champagne to Leon for his approval.\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (to Waiter)\n                         Is it dry?\n\n                                     WAITER\n                         Yes, monsieur.\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (to Ninotchka)\n                         Is that right or do you prefer it \n                         sweet?\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         I wouldn't know. The closest I ever \n                         came to champagne was in a newsreel. \n                         The wife of some president was \n                         throwing it at a battleship.\n\n                                     LEON\n                         It's always good luck to launch \n                         something with champagne; a \n                         battleship... or an evening.\n\n               By now the Waiter is filling their glasses. Ninotchka lifts \n               her glass and looks at it.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         It's funny to look back. I was brought \n                         up on goat's milk, I had a ration of \n                         vodka in the army, and now champagne.\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (gaily)\n                         From goats to grapes. That's drinking \n                         in the right direction.\n\n               Ninotchka takes her first sip of champagne. Leon drinks and \n               watches her. The first sip proves a painful surprise. \n               Ninotchka's face is that of a child who has been fed a bad \n               medicine.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Ugh... um... oh...\n                              (slowly the delight \n                              of champagne dawns \n                              on her and her face \n                              breaks into a smile)\n                         It's good.\n\n               She drinks the whole glass at once. Leon looks at her in \n               amused surprise. He drinks too. The Waiter fills their glasses \n               again.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         From what I read I thought champagne \n                         was a strong drink. It's very \n                         delicate. Do people ever get drunk \n                         on this?\n\n                                     LEON\n                         There have been cases... but the \n                         headache the next morning is worth \n                         while -- if you drink it with the \n                         right toast.\n                              (he raises his glass \n                              again fondly)\n                         To us, Ninotchka!\n\n               They clink glasses and drink again, looking at each other.\n\n               LONG SHOT OF THE TABLE, including part of the dance floor.\n\n               As Leon and Ninotchka lift their glasses again, Swana and \n               General Savitzky start to dance by the table. Swana stops, \n               pretending complete astonishment.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         Hello, Leon! What a surprise! You of \n                         all people! How are you, my dear?\n\n               Leon gets up. Ninotchka watches the scene tensely.\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (embarrassed)\n                         Hello, Swana.

I \n                         know... wars will wash over us... \n                         bombs will fall... all civilization \n                         will crumble... but not yet, please... \n                         wait, wait... what's the hurry?\n                              (mixing reality with \n                              fantasy)\n                         Let us be happy... give us our \n                         moment....\n                              (turning to Leon)\n                         We are happy, aren't we, Leon?\n\n                                     LEON\n                              (fondly)\n                         Yes, sweetheart.\n                              (he holds her in his \n                              arms)\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                              (her voice getting \n                              dimmer and dimmer)\n                         So happy and so tired.\n\n               She falls asleep in his arms. Leon gathers her up and carries \n               her into the bedroom, the diadem still on her head.\n\n               BEDROOM -- THE ROYAL SUITE\n\n               Leon carries Ninotchka to the bed, puts her down on it. She \n               is now sleeping soundly. He kisses her once more and then \n               turns, the CAMERA PANNING with him, and starts toward the \n               door to the corridor and exits. As he closes the door with \n               an uncertain hand, it slams.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, as she lies on the bed\n\n               On the night table beside her is a photograph of the stern-\n               faced Lenin. The crash of the slamming door awakens Ninotchka \n               for a moment. Completely content and happy, she turns around \n               and sees the disapproving face of the photograph.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                              (charmingly)\n                         Smile, little father, smile.\n\n               INSERT OF PHOTOGRAPH OF LENIN\n\n               The photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we...\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS -- DAY\n\n               FADE IN ON:\n\n               IN THE FOREGROUND a clock shows that it is a quarter to \n               twelve.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM OF THE ROYAL SUITE\n\n               It is taken from an ANGLE which includes the door. The lights \n               are still on, the curtains drawn, the empty champagne bottle \n               and glasses litter the room. We hear the buzzer of the \n               corridor door ring several times without an answer.\n\n               CAMERA moves through the door into the bedroom, never \n               disclosing the bed. The lights in the bedroom are still \n               lighted also and the curtains drawn. CAMERA stops on the \n               door from the bedroom to the corridor. The buzzer rings. \n               Apparently the caller has moved from the living-room door to \n               the bedroom door.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT OF THE BED\n\n               Ninotchka is lying on the bed, still in her evening dress. \n               The diadem is no longer on her head, but no special emphasis \n               is laid on that detail in the camera angle. We hear the sound \n               of the buzzer ringing again and again. Ninotchka half wakens \n               and calls out something which sounds like \"come in\" without \n               being fully aware of what she is doing.\n\n               BEDROOM -- AT THE DOOR\n\n               The door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in \n               the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit. Swana \n               looks around, surprised and amused at the state of the room. \n               She walks over to the bed where lies Ninotchka, still not \n               enough awake to face reality. Swana is delighted to have \n               surprised Ninotchka in this condition.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                              (ironically)\n                         Good morning.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                              (awakening gradually)\n                         What?\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow \n                         noon, to be exact. I hope you will \n                         forgive me. I know it's extremely \n                         cruel to waken anyone at such an \n                         hour. Don't you recognize me? I am \n                         the Duchess Swana.\n\n               By now Ninotchka is awake. She gets up and realizes to her \n               acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has found \n               her.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         I know how you feel, my dear. The \n                         morning after always does look grim \n                         if you happen to be wearing last \n                         night's dress. Don't be embarrassed \n                         by my presence, though. You couldn't \n                         have found anybody more sympathetic \n                         to your condition. I remember once \n                         in Petrograd when I felt exactly as \n                         you do. I had to bow from a balcony \n                         to the crowd. My dear, the masses \n                         have no understanding of the feelings \n                         of a lady before noon. Don't you \n                         find that true?\n\n               During Swana's speech Ninotchka has found herself completely.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         I think we can cut your visit short. \n                         Leon is not here.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         Of course not, my dear! I didn't \n                         come here with any such suspicion. \n                         How ridiculous!\n                              (with a glance toward \n                              the living room)\n                         Nor did I come here to pick up his \n                         hat.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S HAT, shot through the bedroom door into \n               the living room where it lies on the table.\n\n               LONG SHOT -- LIVING ROOM -- TOWARD BEDROOM DOOR\n\n               By the bed stand Ninotchka and Swana. Swana starts toward \n               the living room, Ninotchka following her.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                              (as she reaches the \n                              threshold)\n                         How stale last night's gaiety looks! \n                         It has the taste of a dead cigarette.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         If you were encouraged to come here \n                         by our meeting last night I am afraid \n                         you misunderstood my attitude.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         Don't worry, you were quite rude \n                         enough.\n                              (during the following \n                              speech, she draws \n                              the curtains and \n                              opens the windows)\n                         Do you mind if I let in a little \n                         fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it \n                         will make you feel better and I want \n                         you to be at your very best.

She starts to remember \n               the night before, and she looks toward the safe.\n\n               INSERT OF THE DOOR OF THE SAFE, which is closed by now.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AND SWANA\n\n               Ninotchka stares in the direction of the safe as Swana \n               chatters on.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         You can't deny we gave the people \n                         their money's worth -- almost -- \n                         eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                              (desperately)\n                         I must insist that you leave.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         Not before you agree to use those \n                         reservations to Moscow.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         In that case I can only say good-by.\n\n               Abruptly she walks toward the bedroom.\n\n               TRAVELING SHOT OF NINOTCHKA\n\n               She enters the small room connecting the living room and \n               bedroom and closes the door to the living room. She walks \n               into the bedroom toward the bed and glances at it. The diadem \n               is not there. After going back into the anteroom, she opens \n               the outer door of the safe and pulls on the inner door. It \n               has not been properly closed and opens at once. The safe is \n               empty. Ninotchka stands staring in frozen horror for a moment, \n               then rushes to the telephone by the bed.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                              (into the telephone)\n                         \u00c9lys\u00e9e 2763.\n\n               LONG SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AT THE TELEPHONE, waiting for her \n               connection\n\n               In the background the door to the living room is opened by \n               Swana.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                              (standing in the door)\n                         I wouldn't waken Leon.

They \n                         were given to me by my mother.

Our \n                         situation has changed considerably. \n                         Before I had only a claim to the \n                         jewels.

France is going to \n                         uphold that ownership.\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         My lawyer agrees with you. He says \n                         France will uphold it in every court, \n                         but I will drag you through every \n                         court, don't forget that. And when I \n                         say it will take two years I am, as \n                         always, conservative.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Won't those two years in court be \n                         expensive for you? I know that money \n                         was no object as long as you could \n                         squeeze it from the pockets of the \n                         people, but now...\n\n                                     SWANA\n                         I may run out of money, but you have \n                         already run out of bread. Two years \n                         is a long time for your comrades to \n                         wait.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         I see.

Five-forty \n                         leaves you time enough to close the \n                         deal with Monsieur Mercier, but \n                         naturally you'll be too busy for any \n                         farewells.

Comrades of the \n                         World, never has there been such a \n                         May Day parade as this! Already for \n                         four hours the pavements of Moscow \n                         have resounded to the tread of a \n                         million boots! Thousands of gun-\n                         carriages have thundered past. \n                         Thousands of tanks, combined with \n                         our mighty air force, have \n                         demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor \n                         that we are ready and invincible! \n                         Now past me marches the great army \n                         of our civilians!

The CAMERA NARROWS DOWN to a \n               CLOSE SHOT OF Ninotchka marching with the others. All her \n               individuality is gone. She is one of many, a cog in the \n               Russian machine. With a stern expression she is looking \n               straight ahead when suddenly something attracts her attention \n               and she glances to one side.\n\n               A Column of Male Workers is coming in the opposite direction. \n               Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are recognizable among them.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- BULJANOFF, IRANOFF, AND KOPALSKI MARCHING. All \n               three are already pretty exhausted from the long march. \n               Kopalski sees Ninotchka. He whispers it to the others. The \n               three look toward Ninotchka and lift their shoulders with a \n               gesture which says, \"Look where we are now.\"\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA, answering them with a sad smile. \n               After they have passed she stares straight forward again \n               with the same stern expression.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               PANNING SHOT -- STAIRCASE IN NINOTCHKA'S TENEMENT HOUSE\n\n               It is an overcrowded house. People are walking up and down \n               stairs, standing grouped in front of the various apartments; \n               children are sliding down the banisters and playing games \n               under the feet of the adults.\n\n               Ninotchka trudges upstairs wearily. Camera pans with her as \n               she goes into an apartment which is divided into several sub-\n               apartments. Finally she opens the door of her own room and \n               goes in.\n\n               NINOTCHKA'S ROOM\n\n               It is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two \n               other girls. As she enters only one girl is present. It is \n               Anna, a cello player, who sits on the edge of her bed \n               practicing on her cello. Apparently Ninotchka has not adjusted \n               herself completely to the Moscow which she once thought so \n               great.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Good evening, Anna.\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         Good evening, Ninotchka.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Aren't you late?\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         No, the opera starts an hour later \n                         tonight on account of the parade.\n\n               During the following scene Anna puts her cello in its case \n               and gets ready to go to her job. Ninotchka starts to arrange \n               the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. \n               Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, \n               a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a \n               tablecloth.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Didn't you march?\n\n               Anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the Bolshevik \n               regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it.\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         They didn't let me.

The conductor \n                         got so excited he yelled, \"There's \n                         sabotage in the string section!\"\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         Too bad... you missed an inspiring \n                         day, Anna.\n\n                                     ANNA\n                         I know... my heart is sad... but my \n                         feet are happy.

Ninotchka is left alone. Her \n               thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with Leon. \n               Mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything \n               is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive \n               little machine). As she turns the knob she smiles again \n               reminiscently. As she does, the blare of a Russian speech \n               brings her back to reality.\n\n                                     VOICE ON RADIO\n                         Individuals?

Thus shall we pursue \n                         our way into the future, fists \n                         clenched, hearts encased in steel \n                         armed against bourgeois sentimentality \n                         and...\n\n               Quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of \n               Russian oratory.\n\n               SECOND VOICE ON RADIO\n\n               ...From the Exploiters for the Toilers.

She closes her eyes for a \n               moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself.\n\n                                     NINOTCHKA\n                         No music.\n\n               At this moment the door opens, and Buljanoff, Iranoff, and \n               Kopalski enter.
