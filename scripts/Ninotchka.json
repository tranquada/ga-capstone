In the background \n               is a revolving door leading to the street. Through the \n               revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously \n               one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. It is Comrade \n               Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade. Despite \n               the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical \n               Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a \n               fur cap, and heavy boots.\n\n               Buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed \n               by its magnificence. The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's \n               strange appearance, approaches him.\n\n<b>                                     MANAGER\n</b>                              (politely)\n                         Is there anything I can do for you, \n                         monsieur?\n\n<b>                                     BULJANOFF\n</b>                         No, no.\n\n               He exits toward the street. The Manager returns to his \n               customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly \n               dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. \n               It is Comrade Iranoff.\n\n               The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.\n\n<b>                                     MANAGER\n</b>                         Yes, monsieur?\n\n<b>                                     IRANOFF\n</b>                         Just looking around.\n\n               Iranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when \n               suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same \n               fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade \n               Kopalski.\n\n               Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it \n               turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager \n               is by now dumfounded.\n\n<b>               STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE\n</b>\n               A taxi stands at the curb. Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting \n               beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase. Kopalski, returning \n               from the hotel, joins the group.\n\n<b>                                     KOPALSKI\n</b>                         Comrades, why should we lie to each \n                         other?

Ninotchka starts to arrange \n               the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. \n               Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, \n               a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a \n               tablecloth.\n\n<b>                                     NINOTCHKA\n</b>                         Didn't you march?\n\n               Anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the Bolshevik \n               regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it.\n\n<b>                                     ANNA\n</b>                         They didn't let me.

After a little \n               while the door to the corridor opens and Ninotchka's other \n               roommate, the street-car conductor, strides in. She is a \n               squareset, unfriendly woman in uniform.\n\n               At sight of her one of the Russians nudges Ninotchka, makes \n               the gesture of ringing up a fare, and accompanies it with an \n               inquiring look. Ninotchka nods. The Russians change their \n               tune quickly to the \"Volga Boatman\" in order not to awaken \n               animosity.\n\n               The street-car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take \n               off her shoes and her coat, then draws the curtain. During \n               the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound \n               of gargling.\n\n               Again Gurganov crosses the room, this time accompanied by \n               his little son.\n\n               Suddenly the door is opened by Vladimir, a friendly old man.\n\n<b>                                     VLADIMIR\n</b>                              (calling into the \n                              room)\n                         Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman \n                         left a letter for you.\n\n               He hands her a letter and exits.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA\n</b>\n               She takes the letter, glances at the envelope, and is stunned. \n               She turns the envelope -- an expression of breathless wonder \n               comes over her face.\n\n<b>                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS\n</b>                         What is it, Ninotchka?\n\n<b>                                     NINOTCHKA\n</b>                         It's from Paris.\n\n<b>                                     IRANOFF AND BULJANOFF\n</b>                         From Paris?\n\n<b>                                     KOPALSKI\n</b>                         A bill?\n\n<b>                                     NINOTCHKA\n</b>                         From Leon.\n\n<b>                                     ALL THREE RUSSIANS\n</b>                         From Leon!...

All three are \n               looking over her shoulder. Ninotchka hesitates to open the \n               letter, obviously wanting to read it all by herself. Realizing \n               her feelings, the Three Russians walk to the far end of the \n               room and sit down on a little bench, looking toward Ninotchka \n               with childlike expectancy. In great anticipation Ninotchka \n               opens the letter. She starts to read it. Suddenly her \n               expression changes to one of terrific disappointment. She \n               turns the letter over, glances at the second page, then puts \n               the letter down on the table. The Russians have followed her \n               expression closely.
