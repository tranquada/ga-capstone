She finally gets to \n\tShirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which \n\twas so tight it was about to burst open anyway.  She unsnaps \n\tthe front of Shirley's bra.\n\t\n\tBob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a \"move,\" merely\n\tstepping forward.  He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back \n\tof the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.\n\t\n\tThe Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above \n\tShirley's head.  But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already \n\thigh overhead), and the night creatures lose their power.  The \n\tPrincess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly \n\tsinks down to the ground, losing all strength.\n\t\n\tThe Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then \n\tback to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming \n\tskeletons.  Only their clothing and bones remain.\n\t\n\tQuick Zoom in on Criswell's throne.  Criswell's steaming \n\tskeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE IN.\n\nEXT.

She cuts another piece of\n\ttape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her\n\thanging...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDOCTOR #1\n\t\t\tProbably was bruised in the \n\t\t\tcrash.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDOCTOR #2\n\t\t\tYou know, you two were very \n\t\t\tlucky.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHIRLEY\n\t\t\tI love you Bob.
