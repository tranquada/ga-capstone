Wearing a vacant\r\n      face, the train pulls into the station. BRANDON boards.\r\n\r\n      He takes a seat automatically, as if pre-programmed.

As he instinctively looks up to respond, a\r\n      mixture of surprise, fear, excitement and doubt across his\r\n      face.\r\n\r\n      The PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL who we met at the beginning of our\r\n      story is staring down at BRANDON, this time in a more\r\n      engaging fashion. She looks because she wants to be looked\r\n      at.\r\n\r\n      Again, a dance begins. This time, she leads. Engaged, active,\r\n      decisive.\r\n\r\n      BRANDON's face is fractured into many conflicting emotions.\r\n      It's as if a magnet is drawing him in, but at the same time\r\n      he's trying to resist.\r\n\r\n      At this moment, the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL stands up, eyeing\r\n      BRANDON as she makes her way to the door, blocking BRANDON as\r\n      the train pulls in to her stop.\r\n<b>                                   88.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>114   INT.
