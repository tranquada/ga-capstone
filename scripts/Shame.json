(CONT'D)\r\n              As if it was a negative\r\n              progression, a descent into hell,\r\n              moving with stealth amongst those\r\n              you need to affect, growing more\r\n              and more with a momentum that is\r\n              unstoppable.\r\n\r\n    BRANDON looks across the hall, distracted by the IT\r\n    TECHNICIAN who is replacing the computer in his office.\r\n\r\n                        DAVID (CONT'D)\r\n              Now, some inane kid snorting the\r\n              entire load of his mother's spice\r\n              cupboard and posts that on You\r\n              Tube.

SUBWAY. DAWN.                                        13\r\n\r\n     BRANDON sits, looking over at the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL sitting\r\n     opposite-\r\n\r\n     The train moves on, after a while stopping at another\r\n     platform.\r\n\r\n     PEOPLE get on, PEOPLE get off.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON's eyes travel down over the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's legs\r\n     and up-\r\n\r\n     She opens them a little, the dip of her skirt, sinking deep\r\n     between her thighs-\r\n                                  6.\r\n\r\n\r\n     She looks up, senses BRANDON watching. She lets her fingers\r\n     fall in her lap.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON shifts a little in his seat to get a better look\r\n     through the crowd. Suddenly she stands and makes her way to\r\n     the train door. Hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole\r\n     for stability, revealing a wedding ring.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON's hand reaches for the pole too, touching her as he\r\n     stands behind her. There is a gentle unison contact.\r\n     BRANDON's breath, heavy on her neck. Both are frozen to the\r\n     spot, caught in a mutual moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n14   INT. SUBWAY. MORNING.                                        14\r\n\r\n     The train door bolts open and the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL\r\n     disembarks. BRANDON is blocked by a MALE PASSENGER as he gets\r\n     out in quick pursuit of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON is several paces behind now, pursues. She turns left\r\n     into a stairwell.\r\n\r\n     It's almost like fighting a downward river. People are\r\n     walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the\r\n     PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL.\r\n\r\n     The tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs. A\r\n     moment later, BRANDON reaches the summit, to be greeted by a\r\n     wrought-iron gate.\r\n\r\n     He looks left at one staircase. People ascend.\r\n\r\n     He looks right at another staircase. Other passengers ascend.\r\n\r\n     People come in and out of the turnstiles on the right-hand\r\n     side. He has lost her. A sudden moment of disappointment\r\n     crosses his face.\r\n\r\n     He descends the staircase, dejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n15   INT. OFFICE.

A pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck\r\n     to the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n16   INT. CUBICLE. MEN'S TOILETS. OFFICE.

It's almost animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n52   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                     52\r\n\r\n     A dimly lit street-\r\n\r\n     A cab is pulling up.

BRANDON'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR. NIGHT.               53\r\n\r\n     BRANDON waits in the lobby, pressing the button for the\r\n     elevator. An elevator arrives.

We hear\r\n     SISSY and DAVID making love.\r\n\r\n                           SISSY (O.S.)\r\n               (MOANS)\r\n\r\n                           DAVID (O.S.)\r\n               Yeah?\r\n\r\n     BRANDON doesn't want to hear. BRANDON stands back against a\r\n     wall, as if transfixed, as if he cannot take any more. His\r\n     breathing is irregular. Something of the past has come to the\r\n     present. All of his distractions have now stopped, and he is\r\n     at once confronted with himself.\r\n\r\n     His face bears the pain of something long passed, but\r\n     visually present. This wound has not healed.\r\n\r\n     Jolting himself out of his trance, BRANDON hurriedly heads\r\n     out into the corridor-\r\n\r\n\r\n55   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT.

He is dressed in running gear.\r\n\r\n     Pushing the glass doors open, BRANDON hesitates and presses a\r\n     button on the iPod Nano on his arm. He stretches, zips his\r\n     top, pulling his hood up.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON slips his earphones on, moving off.\r\n\r\n\r\n57   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                      57\r\n\r\n     BRANDON running past illuminated windows and neon lights. The\r\n     city is alive. BRANDON stays focused, running, music pumping\r\n     in his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n58   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT.

It's like a murder scene.\r\n     Pale blue sheets in disarray, the mattress nearly coming off\r\n     the bed, sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex.\r\n\r\n     A lone condom disregarded on the floor.\r\n\r\n     We see his bedside drawer ajar.\r\n\r\n     He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut.\r\n\r\n\r\n59   INT.

BRANDON opens his eyes, inwardly flinches.\r\n\r\n     SISSY gets into the bed, covering herself with the white\r\n     sheet. Snuggles up to BRANDON\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON\r\n               I have to be up and out by seven.\r\n\r\n     SISSY inhales through her teeth.\r\n\r\n                          SISSY\r\n                   (to herself)\r\n               It's cold.\r\n\r\n     Uncomfortable SILENCE-\r\n                                   45.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON\r\n               Sissy, get out of my room?\r\n\r\n     SISSY doesn't move.\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON (CONT'D)\r\n               Sissy, get out of my room.\r\n\r\n     All this time, BRANDON has not looked at SISSY, staring up to\r\n     the blank ceiling. He SCREAMS at the top of his lungs-\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON (CONT'D)\r\n               GET THE FUCK OUT! GET OUT!\r\n\r\n     SISSY gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and\r\n     slowly walks around the bed.\r\n\r\n     SISSY SLAMS the bedroom door on her exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n60   INT. OFFICE.

NIGHT.                              63\r\n\r\n     BRANDON stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward\r\n     the Hudson River, the LAP of murky water, audible. He hovers\r\n     for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back\r\n     to the main road.\r\n\r\n     The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n64   EXT. NEAR STANDARD HOTEL. NIGHT.                             64\r\n\r\n     Above, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored\r\n     with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny\r\n     still lives.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans.\r\n     Above him, engraved in stone is \"1949.\" He looks up toward\r\n     the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin\r\n     building. Stark and authoritative.\r\n\r\n     A KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor\r\n     window, a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away.\r\n\r\n     A WOMAN, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans\r\n     and t-shirt, paces along the window. Catching sight of\r\n     BRANDON, she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass.\r\n\r\n     A MAN stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and\r\n     jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up.\r\n\r\n     A FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of\r\n     cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy\r\n     duster.\r\n\r\n     And then BRANDON sees her-\r\n\r\n     A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands, naked her body pressed against\r\n     the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson\r\n     River. The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN\r\n     behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up\r\n     fuck.\r\n                                    50.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BRANDON hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his\r\n     face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDON's eyes lock\r\n     with the MIDDLE AGED WOMAN's dead gaze, standing high above-\r\n\r\n     A CAR HORN LOUD UNREMITTING-\r\n\r\n     BRANDON turns, his hypnotism broken. It's as if he comes back\r\n     to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n65   EXT. STREET. NEAR RESTAURANT.

Her eyes checking the room, with\r\n     quiet concern.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON stands watching from a distance-\r\n\r\n     BRANDON makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter\r\n     until-\r\n\r\n\r\n66   INT.

An escalating collage of graphic images,\r\n     obscene sexual messages and a provocative sexual conversation\r\n     hanging mid sentence addressed to a live sex chatroom. The\r\n     images haunting, brutal, from the weird to the\r\n     sadomasochistic. The open windows, an endless stacking of\r\n     obscene chatroom conversation, emails posted with graphic\r\n     sexual photos and live webcam images of every combination of\r\n     fucking disappearing into the screen in infinite form.\r\n\r\n     SISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued-\r\n\r\n     Suddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a\r\n     woman legs splayed-\r\n                                  66.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FROM SCREEN\r\n               Hey, where's Brandon?

Then suddenly he enters the whole\r\n     contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag.\r\n\r\n     Then, BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment, a\r\n     black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post\r\n     it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone\r\n     numbers on the back.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON moves on, picking up anything he can find. An old\r\n     jacket, elbows worn. A handful of old t-shirts.\r\n\r\n     He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing\r\n     more crap along the way, one of SISSY's dirty thongs on the\r\n     floor. He picks it up, moving on.\r\n\r\n\r\n75   INT. KITCHEN. APARTMENT.

He peers up, looks\r\n     around the room almost bare-\r\n\r\n     His laptop resting on his desk. BRANDON stops, considers,\r\n     initially resistant and then something finally compels him to\r\n     do it-\r\n\r\n     He picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall.\r\n     Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an\r\n     ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff.\r\n     Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the\r\n     heaving bag of crap out into the corridor.\r\n\r\n     The SLAM of the front door-\r\n\r\n\r\n77   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       77\r\n\r\n     BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the\r\n     swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on\r\n     the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up\r\n     along the street in waiting for collection.\r\n\r\n     Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by\r\n     the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n     A SIREN goes past-\r\n\r\n     The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door\r\n     firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n78   INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE. DAY.                                  78\r\n\r\n     BRANDON, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into\r\n     MARIANNE's office. He studies her, almost like prey. The\r\n     moment seems to last a lifetime. There is much want in\r\n     BRANDON's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly, and without any warning, BRANDON walks into his\r\n     dream, entering MARIANNE's office, and pulls her behind a\r\n     partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately.\r\n\r\n     She responds, startled, but happy to be taken. She\r\n     surrenders.\r\n\r\n     They pull away, looking at one another. She smiles,\r\n     laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on.\r\n\r\n                          BRANDON\r\n               Come on.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON leads MARIANNE away.\r\n                                     68.\r\n\r\n\r\n79   EXT.

DAY.                         81\r\n\r\n     BRANDON enters the bedroom, stopping to prepare a drink.\r\n     Watching MARIANNE at the window.\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON\r\n               You wanna drink?\r\n\r\n     He pours a drink from the mini bar.\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON (CONT'D)\r\n               What are you looking at?\r\n\r\n                         MARIANNE\r\n               The view is amazing.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON approaches nervously, standing next to her.\r\n\r\n                          BRANDON\r\n               Hey.\r\n\r\n     MARIANNE leans up and kisses BRANDON.\r\n\r\n                          MARIANNE\r\n               (LAUGHS)\r\n                                    69.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MARIANNE takes BRANDON's hand and leads him to the bed. We\r\n     see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender\r\n     touches.\r\n\r\n     MARIANNE caresses BRANDON's face and kisses both his eyes.\r\n     BRANDON attempts to do the same to MARIANNE, slowly but\r\n     surely. This ritual becomes more aroused, clothes start to\r\n     fall away, revealing for the first time both each other's\r\n     flesh.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON rolls up her skirt, laughs at her panites. MARIANNE\r\n     giggles.\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON\r\n               (LAUGHS) Are they vintage?\r\n\r\n                         MARIANNE\r\n               A little bit. (LAUGHS)\r\n\r\n     The ritual begins to get more passionate, as they feel for\r\n     each other's breasts and thighs.\r\n\r\n     At the height of this passionate encounter, BRANDON's\r\n     attention strangely, slowly starts to fade. It's as if the\r\n     intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him.\r\n\r\n     He recoils, unable to continue.\r\n\r\n     Both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing\r\n     heavily. MARIANNE's face is one of puzzlement and hurt. She\r\n     looks at BRANDON for some kind of answer. He gets up.\r\n     MARIANNE, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her\r\n     skirt, adjusts her hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n82   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL.

Erm...\r\n\r\n     MARIANNE looks at him, the moment fragile. She does up her\r\n     bra.\r\n\r\n                         MARIANNE (CONT'D)\r\n               You know, it's cool.

The HOTEL LOVER laughs as well.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON turns, for a moment she is almost beautiful.\r\n\r\n     HOTEL LOVER smiles, already pulling on her underwear. BRANDON\r\n     watches her, pulling on a tiny thong. She looks up, stares at\r\n     him.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON looks away, fighting back the cold flutter of shame.\r\n                                   71.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BRANDON\r\n               Can I get you a drink?\r\n\r\n     HOTEL LOVER hesitates, smile, shakes her head.\r\n\r\n                         HOTEL LOVER\r\n               No.\r\n\r\n     BRANDON nods.
