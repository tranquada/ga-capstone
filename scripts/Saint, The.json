He looks around.  \nOn a counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS. Michael Quinn picks up \nA FORK. He bends the fork's tines. Inserts it in the lock.  \nHe fishes around for a second. Nothing happens. He pulls the fork out, \nrebends it, and inserts it in the lock again. And CLICK.. ..the lock pops.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Michael Quinn turns and smiles.

A MAN \nIN BLACK climbs up, securing a sling to the window frame in which to sit.

The \nNikko Hotel's core is hollow, like the Hilton in New York; thus, the ballroom's \n\"ceiling\" is 12 stories up.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CHAMPAGNE SERVERS are passing out glasses. A grey-haired Japanese \nbusinessman, HIRO MYAKI, clinks his glass.

NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE OVER MEZZANINE \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Man In Black has reached the mezzanine.  \nTWO JAPANESE SECURITY GUARDS, armed with automatic rifles, walk their \nshift directly below him.

They \ndisappear around a corner.  \nThe Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he \nyanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups.  \nHe drops to the mezzanine. He rests the glass against the wall. He peers over \nthe balustrade at the party below. Satisfied, he removes his hood, ENDING TITLES.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">This is SIMON TEMPLAR. A hard, self-reliant, crafty man. You should treat him \nas such or be very sorry you ever met him. It is unfortunate that a man of \nTemplar's various talents can be so lacking. How? \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">His journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast. This one \ngives no quarter. Ever. Though his outward self glows with life, he is dead inside.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar, focused utterly, steals inside a corridor.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A long corridor with a door at the end, on which is engraved: MYAKI \nCORPORATION. At the entrance, secured in a niche, is a BRONZE BUST OF \n<b>HIRO MYAKI.  \n</b>\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar stops cold. A RUG (an oriental runner) extends the length of the \ncorridor.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug.  \nRevealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS.  \nTemplar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool \nof steel cable attached to the top). He aims down the corridor and fires.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A STEEL DART explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds \nabove the door at corridor's end.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool. He looks around for \nsomething to secure it.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">TEMPLAR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry about this.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck.  \nHe hangs from the cable, testing it. It will hold.  \nHe pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips.  \nIt's A GLIDER for the cable.  \nHe attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of \nthe corridor.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar bumps up against the door. He pulls his knees up and over the \nhandles of the glider, then flops over backwards, hanging upside down.  \nHIS FACE is now right next to the door handle, over which is an ELECTRONIC \nLOCK (opened by punching a code).  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar pulls out a BLACK BOX. It's a really small, really powerful computer \nand its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a \nminute and a half. Templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike \n<b>ELECTRODE PROBES.  \n</b>\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He activates the system. The little computer starts running through \ncombinations of numbers. He waits, hanging upside down. Meanwhile-- \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE - ELEVATOR LOBBY \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing. One of \nthese guys is a riot...  \nThe elevator opens.

They clink and drink.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The computer BEEPS. It's finished.  \nTemplar turns the door handle; pushes open the door.  \nHe pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again.  \nHe swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up.  \nHe releases from the glider and lunges inside.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A grand boardroom with Japanese furniture and art.  \nAt the end of a fifty-foot mahogany table is a PAINTING OF HIRO MYAKI.  \nTemplar walks over to it.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">TEMPLAR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry again.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He RIPS the painting off the wall and heaves it aside.  \nAnd here, where the painting was, is A SAFE.  \nTemplar unshoulders his backpack. He pulls out a 40-pound CARLSBAD &amp; \nRINKER industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer. No finesse \nhere, people.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">No, there's no time for high-tech. He's going to drill right through the bitch, \nright through four inches of tungsten steel. He starts setting up the drill.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE LOBBY \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Two CHAMPAGNE GLASSES lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess \nlie the JAPANESE GUARDS, now unconscious.

With the GUARD'S KEYRING, he \nshuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ilya stops short. His eyes spark.  \nHe sees Templar's cable and glider.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as THE BIT CHEWS into the \ntungsten lock. This is a violent exercise. SINEWS OF METAL spit out like \nshrapnel.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He's through the lock in seconds. Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with \na THUD on the beautiful mahogany table. He opens the safe.  \nINSIDE THE SAFE is one object: A SMALL BOX, the size of a cufflink keeper.  \nTemplar grabs it and opens it.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">INSIDE THE LITTLE BOX is a tiny MICRO-CHIP.  \nTemplar closes the box and pockets it.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ILYA (v.o.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't move.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar freezes.

I guarantee it will \nland coiled in several places.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension \ncord.  \nAnd this is not lost on Templar.  \nTemplar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around \nIlya's ankles. His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun \nclattering across the floor.  \nIlya tries to get to his feet.  \nTemplar floors him with a right cross.  \nTemplar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room. Ilya \ngains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He jumps, clutching the ceiling girder above.  \nHe's going out the way he came in.  \nSuddenly ILYA'S HANDS are around his ankles.  \nTemplar falls. He's going 12 stories to his death.  \nNo. His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade. Templar dangles there, \nlooking up at the sadistic face of Ilya.

Hands it slowly to Ilya, who reaches over the balustrade for it...  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">TEMPLAR stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs Ilya's hand, jerking him over \nthe balustrade.  \nIlya falls 12 stories to his death.  \nNo he doesn't. He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade \n<i>there</i>.  \nTemplar clambers up again, atop the balustrade.  \nHe jumps to the ceiling girder.  \nHand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in \nseconds.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He releases from the girder to the window frame.  \nThere's one further problem. BULLETS. Ricocheting all around him. Fired by -- \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ILYA, one floor down.  \nTemplar reaches over his shoulder. Pulls a GUN from his backpack. To return \nfire? No, it's the DART GUN.  \nTemplar aims the dart gun out the aperture he cut in the window and fires.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.
