Wilde - \n\nFADE IN: \nThe majestic city and bay, as seen from the elevation of the surrounding \nShan Ho hills as we SUPER \u0096 \n\nHONG KONG \u0096 1965 \n\nPANNING away from the city, we come before the bleak facade of the SAINT \nIGNATIUS ORPHANAGE.  \n\nBOY'S VOICE (o.s.) \nSimon Magus was a magician and \nsorcerer in uhhm... Sumatra.  \n\nINT. HONG KONG - SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - DAY \nTwenty boys, aged 7 to 12, sit at spartan desks, bibles raised. FATHER \nO'NEAL walks amongst them. A career Jesuit with razor eyes and thin lips. An \nawful man.  \n\nFATHER 0'NEAL \n(sternly) \nSumeria.  \nAnd what happened to him Francis? \n\nFRANCIS, 12, is the eldest and largest boy.  \n\nFRANCIS \nJesus' disciples came and performed \nmiracles. When Simon Magus saw the \nmiracles he offered disciple Peter \ngold for the powers of God.  \n\nFATHER 0'NEAL \nWhat did disciple Peter say to that? \nMichael Quinn? \n\nFather O'Neal stands before the youngest, littlest boy, who, unlike the others, \nexhibits no fear in his huge, intelligent eyes. Father O'Neal hates this boy.  \n\nThe boy, MICHAEL QUINN, doesn't respond.  \nFather O'Neal snatches his bible, revealing a SECOND BOOK hidden behind it.  \n\nIt's a dime store pulp adventure with a gaudy cover entitled \"THE KNIGHTS \nTEMPLAR.\" \n\nFATHER 0'NEAL \nAnswer the question Michael.  \n\nThe little boy stares up at him.  \n\nMICHAEL QUINN \nThat's not my name.  \n\nFather O'Neal yanks the boy from the chair. Drags him by the arm across the \nroom and out into the corridor.  \n\nTHE OTHER BOYS wait two seconds, then they spring up and run, en masse, \nto the door. Grouped in the threshold, straining for a good view, they watch \nas -- \n\nFATHER O'NEIL pulls Michael Quinn into an office down the corridor. The door \nhas a stained-glass window.  \n\nIt begins. We see it in SILHOUETTE: Father O'Neal with a CANE SWITCH in \nhis hand, the boy beneath him. Down the switch comes. Again. And again.  \nThe boy YELPS. And again and again and again... and now he SCREAMS...\n\nTHE BOYS HUDDLED IN THE DOORWAY begin to wince. With every repeated, \nmerciless descent of the switch...  \n\nINT. SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - EATING HALL - NIGHT \nTHE BOYS sit at benches. Michael Quinn stares stoically ahead. The back of \nhis shirt is striped with blood.  \n\nFATHER YIN, 50's, a Chinese Jesuit, grim in black frock and white collar, \npaces amongst the benches. Father O'Neal watches from the side.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nWhy one child is born into a good \nhome and another into poverty - that \nis but part of God's design. All of \nyou are unwanted, put here because \nof the sins of your unwedded \nmothers. The church has fed you and \neducated you. Given you a home. A \nname. An identity.  \n\nStopping before Michael Quinn, he points to a PORTRAIT ON THE WALL of a \nstern-faced Jesuit.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nWho is that, boy? \n\nMICHAEL QUINN \nFather Michael Quinn.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nYes. A great man. You ungrateful \nlittle cur, you will sit here \nwithout food until you appreciate \nyour namesake.  \n(to the other boys) \nAll of you will sit with him. Put \nlunch away, Mr. Fong.  \n\nMR. FONG, the orphanage cook, wheels a FOOD CART into the kitchen and \nlocks the door. Father Yin exits, followed by Father O'Neal and Mr. Fong, \nleaving -- \n\nA HUNDRED BOYS staring at Michael Quinn.  \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nINT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT \nAgain, Father Yin stands before Michael Quinn. The boys are seated for their \nevening meal.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nWhat is your name, boy? \n\nSilence. Michael Quinn stares straight ahead.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nPut supper away, Mr. Fong.  \n\nMR. FONG wheels the FOOD CART into the kitchen and locks the door. Again, \na hundred boys stare at Michael Quinn.  \n\nINT . ORPHANAGE BUNKROOM - NIGHT \nA long, narrow room with bunkbeds. The boys aren't sleeping. They're \ngrouped around Michael Quinn's bunk. One boy has his hand clamped to \nMichael's, mouth, the others are wailing on him... and outside -- \n\nINT. ORPHANAGE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BUNKROOM - NIGHT \nFathers O'Neal and Yin watch through the door.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nSpareth the rod, spoileth the child.  \n\nINT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING \nFather Yin grits his teeth, staring down at Michael Quinn, whose face is \nwelted. Nothing has changed.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nPut breakfast away, Mr. Fong. \n \nAgain, the FOOD CART goes into the kitchen. The Fathers and Mr. Fong exit.  \nThe boys rise, moving toward Michael Quinn. They're going to kick the living \nshit out of him.  \n\nMICHAEL QUINN \nStop. You'll have your breakfast.  \n\nMichael Quinn walks to the locked kitchen door.  \nThe other boys, curious, follow.  \n\nMichael Quinn kneels before the door, examining the lock. He looks around.  \nOn a counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS. Michael Quinn picks up \nA FORK. He bends the fork's tines. Inserts it in the lock.  \nHe fishes around for a second. Nothing happens. He pulls the fork out, \nrebends it, and inserts it in the lock again. And CLICK.. ..the lock pops.  \n\nMichael Quinn turns and smiles. The boys flood inside.  \nThe hungry boys go for the food cart, scooping up eggs and sausage. They're \nravenous. Francis, mouth full of sausage, beams at Michael Quinn.  \n\nFRANCIS \nThey should've named you Simon, like \nSimon Magus the sorcerer.  \n\nMICHAEL QUINN \nNo. Simon. . . .  \n(pulls the \"KNIGHTS TEMPLAR\" paperback from his back pocket) \n...Templar.  \n\nSuddenly a SHARP WHISTLE. The boys, startled, whip their necks around.  \nMR. FONG stands in the doorway.  \nFather O'Neal and Father Yin enter quickly.  \nThe boys back away from the food cart.  \n\nFATHER YIN \nWho.. . who did this...? \nThe boys look at Michael Quinn. Then Francis speaks: \nFRANCIS \nI did father.  \nAnd another boy, James: \nJAMES \nI did father. .  \n\nAnd another and another: \"I did father.\" They all say it. And the littlest \nyoungest boy, surrounded by his new confederates, smiles slightly. His eyes \nglint.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nBegin MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA - NIGHT \nA chilly September night. A rally is underway in the Dvortsovaya Ploshchad, \nthe vast square at the foot of Nevsky Prospect Boulevard. The Winter Palace \nand Hermitage loom in the b.g.  \n500,000 ST. PETERS BURGERS' stand shoulder-to-shoulder, listening to a \nSPEECH. INTERNATIONAL T.V. CREWS (the BBC, CNN, etc.) are transmitting \nthe event.  \n\nSPEAKER (o.s.) \nIn I917 Lenin stood here and \npromised a new age. The result? \nTyranny. Poverty. The darkest \nyears in our history.  \n\nTHE SPEAKER stands on a platform behind a cluster of microphones, his \nimage projected on a huge screen (like the Sony screen in Times Square) \nabove and behind him.  \n\nHe is MICHAEL ROMANOV, coal-haired, fierce, ardent, eyes glinting like onyx, \nvoice cutting the night air.  \n\nROMANOV \nIn 1987 Gorbachev stood here and \npromised a new age. The result? An \nend to communism. Democracy. A \nfree economy. And what else? \nChaos.  \n(crowd CHEERS) \nThe economy run by criminals, the \ngovernment run by charlatans. And \nthey are in league together! \nThieves! Traitors! \n(louder CHEERS) \nMen and women of St. Petersburg, \ncitizens of Russia, the salt of this \ncountry, this must end! \n(deafening CHEERS) \nJoin me then in the song of our \nforefathers.  \nRomanov begins to sing, ably, the first verse of \"Mother Russia\" \n(the Russian anthem before the Bolsheviks).  \n\nTHE CROWD joins him. The Ploshchad rings with the voices of half a million \nRussians...  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIKKO HOTEL - CONTINUOUS \n\nWe're 12 stories up, outside the city's Nikko hotel.  \nThe rally across town is a distant glow.  \nWe hear the singing crowd.  \n\nTWO HANDS appear, gripping the nooks of the exterior architecture. A MAN \nIN BLACK climbs up, securing a sling to the window frame in which to sit. A \nbulky BACKPACK hangs from shoulder straps.  \nHe produces a diamond cutter; begins carving a man-sized aperture in the \nwindow. Below, in the foyer \u0096 \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM \n-- A JAPANESE SECURITY MAN sits at his guard station, watching C.N.N.  \nNEWS on a small television. Wolf Blitzer is reporting live from the rally.  \n\nWOLF BLITZER \n(on t.v.)\nAn extraordinary allegation, \nBernard, that Russia's present \nleadership, including President \nVictor Karpov, is connected with the \ncountry's underworld.  \n\nInside the foyer ballroom, Japanese businessmen are hosting a reception. The \nNikko Hotel's core is hollow, like the Hilton in New York; thus, the ballroom's \n\"ceiling\" is 12 stories up.  \n\nCHAMPAGNE SERVERS are passing out glasses. A grey-haired Japanese \nbusinessman, HIRO MYAKI, clinks his glass. The guests pay attention.  \nDuring this we focus on a CHAMPAGNE SERVER moving toward the lobby \nelevators with a full tray.  \n\nHIRO MYAKI \nLadies. Gentlemen. The Myaki \nCorporation looks forward to many \nprofitable days ahead. To our new \nmanufacturing facility in St.  \nPetersburg. To the new Russia! \n\nAs the crowd CLAPS...  \n\nEXT. NIKKO HOTEL - EXTERIOR WALL \n...the Man In Black kicks at the cut section of window, pushing it into the \nhotel and plunging inside after it.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE \nThe Man In Black catches hold of a steel girder and dangles, and, \nmiraculously -- \n\nTHE PIECE OF WINDOW doesn't fall.  \n\nIt's stuck to his feet with suction cups.  \n\nThe Man In Black moves, hand over hand, toward the mezzanine balcony, the \nwindow stuck to his feet.  \n\nIN THE LOBBY BELOW \nEverybody's beaming, toasting, congratulating, etc., totally oblivious to THE \nMAN IN BLACK, 12 stories up, inching hand-over-hand across the roof \nsuperstructure.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE OVER MEZZANINE \nThe Man In Black has reached the mezzanine.  \nTWO JAPANESE SECURITY GUARDS, armed with automatic rifles, walk their \nshift directly below him. They pass a wall mounted television, also carrying \nthe NEWS: \n\nWOLF BLITZER\n(on t.v.) \nOne thing's certain, Bernard: \nMichael Romanov, age 32, French born \nand Oxford educated, descendent of \nthe last czar, is a political force \nto be reckoned with.  \n\nThe guards move down the mezzanine; one jokes, the other laughs. They \ndisappear around a corner.  \nThe Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he \nyanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups.  \nHe drops to the mezzanine. He rests the glass against the wall. He peers over \nthe balustrade at the party below. Satisfied, he removes his hood, ENDING TITLES.  \n\nThis is SIMON TEMPLAR. A hard, self-reliant, crafty man. You should treat him \nas such or be very sorry you ever met him. It is unfortunate that a man of \nTemplar's various talents can be so lacking. How? \n\nHis journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast. This one \ngives no quarter. Ever. Though his outward self glows with life, he is dead inside.  \n\nTemplar, focused utterly, steals inside a corridor.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR \nA long corridor with a door at the end, on which is engraved: MYAKI \nCORPORATION. At the entrance, secured in a niche, is a BRONZE BUST OF \nHIRO MYAKI.  \n\nTemplar stops cold. A RUG (an oriental runner) extends the length of the \ncorridor.  \n\nTemplar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug.  \nRevealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS.  \nTemplar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool \nof steel cable attached to the top). He aims down the corridor and fires.  \n\nA STEEL DART explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds \nabove the door at corridor's end.  \n\nTemplar yanks the other end of cable from the spool. He looks around for \nsomething to secure it.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nSorry about this.  \n\nHe ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck.  \nHe hangs from the cable, testing it. It will hold.  \nHe pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips.  \nIt's A GLIDER for the cable.  \nHe attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of \nthe corridor.  \n\nTHE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR \n\nTemplar bumps up against the door. He pulls his knees up and over the \nhandles of the glider, then flops over backwards, hanging upside down.  \nHIS FACE is now right next to the door handle, over which is an ELECTRONIC \nLOCK (opened by punching a code).  \n\nTemplar pulls out a BLACK BOX. It's a really small, really powerful computer \nand its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a \nminute and a half. Templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike \nELECTRODE PROBES.  \n\nHe activates the system. The little computer starts running through \ncombinations of numbers. He waits, hanging upside down. Meanwhile-- \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE - ELEVATOR LOBBY \nThe Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing. One of \nthese guys is a riot...  \nThe elevator opens. The CHAMPAGNE SERVER comes out, tray in hand.  \n\nCHAMPAGNE SERVER \nCompliments of Mr. Myaki.  \n\nJAPANESE GUARDS \n(delighted) \nAhh! \n\nBeaming, they each take a glass. They clink and drink.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR \nThe computer BEEPS. It's finished.  \nTemplar turns the door handle; pushes open the door.  \nHe pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again.  \nHe swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up.  \nHe releases from the glider and lunges inside.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES \nA grand boardroom with Japanese furniture and art.  \nAt the end of a fifty-foot mahogany table is a PAINTING OF HIRO MYAKI.  \nTemplar walks over to it.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nSorry again.  \n\nHe RIPS the painting off the wall and heaves it aside.  \nAnd here, where the painting was, is A SAFE.  \nTemplar unshoulders his backpack. He pulls out a 40-pound CARLSBAD & \nRINKER industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer. No finesse \nhere, people.  \n\nNo, there's no time for high-tech. He's going to drill right through the bitch, \nright through four inches of tungsten steel. He starts setting up the drill.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE LOBBY \nTwo CHAMPAGNE GLASSES lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess \nlie the JAPANESE GUARDS, now unconscious. The champagne server's \ngone...  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE \n...because he's here, moving quickly toward the Myaki Corporation's office, \nand he's not a champagne server, but a thief and a killer, a blonde Russian \nnamed ILYA.  \nIlya stops just outside the interior corridor. With the GUARD'S KEYRING, he \nshuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR \nIlya stops short. His eyes spark.  \nHe sees Templar's cable and glider.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES \nTemplar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as THE BIT CHEWS into the \ntungsten lock. This is a violent exercise. SINEWS OF METAL spit out like \nshrapnel.  \n\nHe's through the lock in seconds. Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with \na THUD on the beautiful mahogany table. He opens the safe.  \nINSIDE THE SAFE is one object: A SMALL BOX, the size of a cufflink keeper.  \nTemplar grabs it and opens it.  \n\nINSIDE THE LITTLE BOX is a tiny MICRO-CHIP.  \nTemplar closes the box and pockets it.  \n\nILYA (v.o.) \nDon't move.  \n\nTemplar freezes. His eyes twitch.  \nThis wasn't in the plan...  \n\nILYA (v.o.) \nTurn around. Slowly.  \n\nTemplar faces Ilya. Ilya has a silenced handgun.  \n\nILYA \nOn your knees.  \n(Templar sinks to his knees) \nGive me the box. Slowly.  \n\nTemplar pulls out the box. Tosses it to Ilya.  \nIlya raises the handgun at Templar's head. Smiles.  \nTry something: throw an extension cord on the ground. I guarantee it will \nland coiled in several places.  \n\nIlya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension \ncord.  \nAnd this is not lost on Templar.  \nTemplar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around \nIlya's ankles. His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun \nclattering across the floor.  \nIlya tries to get to his feet.  \nTemplar floors him with a right cross.  \nTemplar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room. Ilya \ngains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE \nTemplar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it.  \n\nHe jumps, clutching the ceiling girder above.  \nHe's going out the way he came in.  \nSuddenly ILYA'S HANDS are around his ankles.  \nTemplar falls. He's going 12 stories to his death.  \nNo. His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade. Templar dangles there, \nlooking up at the sadistic face of Ilya. And suddenly below -- \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM \n-- A JAPANESE WOMAN, looking up, pointing at the man dangling from the \nbalustrade above, SCREAMS. And now everybody looks up.  \n\nHIRO MYAKI \nSound the alarm! Call the police! \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE \nIlya and Templar. Ilya calmly compresses his foot against Templar's left \nknuckles.  \n\nILYA \nThe box please.  \n\nTemplar, grimacing, reaches with his right hand and pulls the box from his \npocket. Hands it slowly to Ilya, who reaches over the balustrade for it...  \n\nTEMPLAR stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs Ilya's hand, jerking him over \nthe balustrade.  \nIlya falls 12 stories to his death.  \nNo he doesn't. He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade \nthere.  \nTemplar clambers up again, atop the balustrade.  \nHe jumps to the ceiling girder.  \nHand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in \nseconds.  \n\nHe releases from the girder to the window frame.  \nThere's one further problem. BULLETS. Ricocheting all around him. Fired by -- \n\nILYA, one floor down.  \nTemplar reaches over his shoulder. Pulls a GUN from his backpack. To return \nfire? No, it's the DART GUN.  \nTemplar aims the dart gun out the aperture he cut in the window and fires.  \n\nEXT. NIKKO HOTEL - 12TH FLOOR \n\nA STEEL DART launches from the window, flies fifty yards, and imbeds in the \nSTAIRCASE BULKHEAD OF THE BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE NIKKO.  \n\nINT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE \nTemplar ties the cable to the ceiling girder.  \nHe pulls out his black hood and drapes it over the taught cable. He grabs both \nends of the hood.  \nAnd he jumps.  \n\nEXT. NIKKO HOTEL/ADJACENT BUILDING \nTemplar flies through space, across the cable, the hood acting as a makeshift \nglider.  \nHe lands on the roof of the adjacent building.  \nTemplar looks around. SIRENS ARE WAILING.  \nHe runs across rooftops, disappearing into the St. Petersburg night.  \n\nINT . NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM \nTotal chaos. Women screaming, everybody running around. Ilya comes \nthrough the panicked crowd.  \nTen ST. PETERSBURG POLICEMEN enter.  \n\nILYA \nI tried to stop him! He went out \nthe window! \n\nFive policemen go for the elevators. Five more exit quickly. Ilya follows.  \n\nEXT. NIKKO HOTEL - ENTRANCE \nThe befuddled police race off, looking skyward at the top floors of the \nbuilding.  \nIlya curses silently. And peels away from the cops and commotion, off into \nthe night.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. A BRITISH-AIR 747 - MORNING \nThe First Class section. The plane is in flight.  \nA STEWARDESS, young, perky, comes down the aisle pushing a \nmagazine/newspaper cart.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nNewspaper sir? \n\nSIMON TEMPLAR sits there, dressed as usual without much heed to fashion.  \nNote this, reader: Templar is not a super-spy, super-hero, or super-rake. He \nis a thief.  \n\nHe's examining several antique Russian BRACELETS and LOCKETS. He looks \nup at the stewardess.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \n(Cockney) \nWow, are those gorgeous or what...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou have an eye for beauty. Of course - you see it every time you \nlook in the mirror.  \n\nShe blushes, fidgets, as his eyes bore in on her.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nWhy thank-you, Mr...  \n(reads seat assignment) \nTemplar.  \n\nShe continues down the aisle, smiling to herself.  \nTemplar resumes with his lockets.  \n\nINT. BRITISH AIR 747 - FIVE HOURS LATER \nThe plane has landed.  \nPASSENGERS are filing out past the Stewardess.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nGoodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in London, etc.  \n\nTemplar moves past the Stewardess, carrying TWO CARRY-ON BAGS. He \nwinks at her. She winks back, and fingers one of the RUSSIAN LOCKETS, now \naround her neck.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nGood-bye, Mr. Templar.  \n\nAs Templar moves off, she smiles to herself and CUT TO: \n\nINT. LONDON - HEATHROW AIRPORT \nTemplar walks briskly away from customs.  \nA MAN IN TRENCHCOAT falls in behind Templar.  \nTWO MEN appear in front of Templar, blocking his path; the man behind \nTemplar comes to his side. They are Scotland Yard men BAKER, TEAL, and INSPECTOR MACDUFF.  \n\nINSPECTOR MACDUFF \nHow's the weather in St. Petersburg? \n\nTEMPLAR \nCold.  \n\nINSPECTOR MACDUFF \nLet's warm things up for you.  \n\nBaker and Teal gruffly take Templar by the shoulder and walk him forward and CUT TO: \n\nINT. HEATHROW CUSTOMS - INTERROGATION ROOM \nA spartan room, a table and two chairs. MacDuff ransacks TEMPLAR'S BAGS \nwhile, across the room -- \n\nTemplar kisses the wall, hands outstretched, as Baker finishes frisking him.  \nTemplar turns.  \n\nBAKER \nHe's clean.  \n\nTEMPLAR \n(to MacDuff) \nCareful with that. It's delicate \nequip...  \n\nMacDuff lifts Templar's 9MM PISTOL from the bag.  \n\nTEMPLAR \n. . . ment.  \n\nMACDUFF \nYes. Very.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nIt's for protection.  \nI deal in antique....  \n\nMACDUFF \n(snaps) \nI know what you deal in. And these? \nYour pajamas? \n\nHe holds up Templar's black bodysuit.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nFor jogging. My doctor's \nrecommended five miles a...  \n\nMACDUFF \nSit down and shut it.  \n\nTemplar sits down.  \n\nBaker has Templar's papers. He holds up a certificate.  \n\nBAKER \nHe's licensed to carry, Inspector.  \n\nMACDUFF \nLet's see the passport.  \n(Baker hands MacDuff \nTemplar's passport) \nWhat's your nationality this week, \nTemplar? \n\nTEMPLAR \nI forget.  \n\nMACDUFF \n(looks at passport) \nIssued by the Principality \nof.. . Yemen? You're bloody joking.  \n\nTEMPLAR \n(shrugs) \nCall the embassy \n\nMacDuff whips the passport at Templar. Templar calmly moves his head; the \npassport flies by. Hits the wall.  \n\nMACDUFF \nShut it.  \n\nMacDuff leans down, coming in close.  \nTemplar doesn't blink. His expression never changes.  \n\nMACDUFF \nYou pass through Russia for a day \nwith that gear and, what a surprise, a prototype \ncomputer chip worth quarter of a billion quid is nicked \nfrom the Myaki Corporation the night you arrive. We know \nyou didn't fence it in Russia. Where is it? \n\nThe door opens. Teal enters, tossing several X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHS on the \ntable before MacDuff. Two are of Templar's bags, two are of his body.  \n\nTEAL \n(Cockney) \nAll negative. He didn't swallow it.  \n\nAn embarrassing pause.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou've got three options: charge me, \nor release me.  \n\nMACDUFF \nWhat's the third.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou can kiss my ass.  \n\nA dreadful pause. MacDuff smiles.  \nHe turns away, then turns back and viciously backhands Templar across the \nface; Templar's head jerks. The blow would knock most men out.  \nNow Templar smiles. Like a serpant. And says calmly: \n\nTEMPLAR \nI'm a busy man. Make up your mind.  \n\nMacDuff stares at Templar, gritting his teeth.  \nTemplar rises. Begins collecting his things.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. LONDON RESTAURANT - EVENING \nA quaint place off Piccadilly. The STEWARDESS (from Templar's flight) gulps a \nmartini. She is tipsy. She shows it.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \n.. . then me mum says, call uncle \nCharlie, he's in the airline \nbusiness, there's jobs there, good \nbenefits too, and.. ..where was I? \n\nTEMPLAR, enduring this, sits opposite with a scotch.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nHow you got your job.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nRight! \n(hiccups, giggles) \n'Scuze me.  \n\nTemplar motions to a passing WAITRESS.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nAnother round please.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nYe're tryin' ta get me drunk, aren't \nyou? Are you cute or what? I gotta \nfreshen up.  \n(she rises) \nWhere's the loo in 'ere? \n\nTEMPLAR \nBack there. Leave your locket.  \nI'll polish it for you.  \n\nShe smiles crookedly; hands over the locket.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nAre you a dearheart or what...  \n\nShe blows Templar a kiss and lurches off to the bathroom. Templar watches \nher a moment.  \nWhen she's gone he puts the locket on the table.  \nHe pries open the back of it with a pen-knife.  \n\nINSERT - THE LOCKET - there is a compartment in which sits THE STOLEN \nMICRO-CHIP. Templar plucks out the chip and drops it into an envelope.  \n\nBACK TO SCENE - FOLLOWING THE STEWARDESS \nas she returns to the table. She sits down. Looks around. Templar's gone. The \nlocket's gone. The waitress appears.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nMaam, where's the gent who was \nsitting 'ere? \n\nWAITRESS \nHe left, luv. Said you'd take care \nof the bill.  \n\nShe hands the Stewardess the bill. She stares at it.  \n\nSTEWARDESS \nWhat? \n\nShe sinks down, confused, blinking, near tears. CUT TO: \n\nINT. LONDON - MUSGRAVE HOTEL \nA small, plush, discrete residential hotel in the heart of Mayfair (Regent Street, Grovesnor Sq. or equivalent). TEMPLAR approaches the front desk with his carry-on bags. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON and the HOTEL MANAGER are behind the desk.  \n\nCONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON \nMr. Templar! Good to see you sir.  \nYour room key - south penthouse as \nusual. Your suits are up from storage, \npressed of course, and \nthere's a bottle of Oban on the \ndresser.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThanks Harry. Oh, and Harry...  \n(pulls out the envelope with the computer chip) \n.. . ship this by overnight courier to that address.  \n\nCONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON \nVery good sir.  \n\nJIMMY, a young Bellman, takes Ternplar's bags. Templar doesn't let go. An \nuncomfortable pause.  \n\nCONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON \nJimmy, Mr. Templar carries his own bags.  \n\nTemplar steps past Jimmy into the elevator.  \n\nJIMMY THE BELLMAN \nWhat's with the bags, gov'nuh? \n\nHOTEL MANAGER \nThey're all he ever brings. The \nman's bills are paid by a bank in \nSwitzerland and his mailing address \nis a corporation in Lisbon. Bloody strange...  \n\nCONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON \nMr. Templar, strange? No sir, he's \njust shy.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT . MUSGRAVE HOTEL - SOUTH PENTHOUSE \nTernplar sits at a desk with a bottle of Oban scotch and glass, staring at the \nscreen of a modemed MINI-COMPUTER.  \n\n-- Templar types: LION CONTACTING ZEBRA: IS ZEBRA HOME? \n\n-- And this comes back: AFFIRMATIVE, LION.  \n\n-- Templar types: PIGEON IS FLYING; WILL ARRIVE A.M.  \n\n-- And this back: EXCELLENT. LION GETS LION'S SHARE. -- Templar types a \nnew command. A new screen appears: \n\n******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* \n\nPRIVATE UNMARKED ACCOUNTS \n\nPLEASE ENTER SECURITY PASSWORD \n\nTemplar types in: 77N8LS473Z. This appears: \n\n******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* \n\nACCOUNT OF: TEMPLAR, SIMON \n\nBALANCE (AS OF 8/1S/95): U.S. $47,895,12S.12 (Not a typo, reader. It's forty-seven million bucks.) \n\nTemplar picks up his scotch and drinks, staring at the screen. He's waiting for \nsomething...  \nThe first digit, \"4,\" vanishes.  \nA \"5\" appears in it's place. Now fifty-seven million.  \n\nTemplar permits a slight smile, having just made 10 million dollars, and \ndrinks his scotch.  \n\nThe phone RINGS. Templar eyes it skeptically. He picks it up.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYes.  \n\nA voice with an Eastern European accent: \n\nVOICE \nIs this Simon Templar? \n\nTEMPLAR \nIt depends.  \n\nVOICE \nA meeting. Midnight, Blackfriars \nBridge.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nInvolving what? \n\nVOICE \nA lot of money. If you want it.  \n\nClick. Templar recradles the receiver; He stares at it a moment and CUT TO: \n\nINT. MUSGRAVE HOTEL LOBBY - LATER - NIGHT \nTemplar enters the lobby wearing a fresh suit under a black leather trench \ncoat. He goes to the desk, where concierge Harry Winston looks up.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nHarry, I'm going for a walk over \nBlackfriars Bridge. Midnight.  \n\nPause. And Harry, just perceptibly, nods. And returns to his obsequious self.  \n\nHARRY WINSTON \nVery good, sir.  \n\nTemplar walks off through the lobby.  \n\nHARRY WINSTON \nJimmy \n(Jimmy walks over) \nIt's about time I taught you how to \nrun the front desk.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. LONDON - BLACKFRIAR' S BRIDGE - MIDNIGHT \nFog. The bridge lights cast everything in a sickly yellow glow. Below, A \nTUGBOAT plows the river, horn BELLOWING. The lights of Southwark twinkle \nbeyond.  \n\nTemplar enters from Victoria Embankment.  \nTWO FIGURES emerge from the fog. Templar approaches.  \nOne is a huge dim-wit with greasy hair, as tall and wide as a bookcase. His \nname, aptly, is ZERO.  \nThe other is middle-aged and strongly built. A high forehead; clipped, irongrey \nhair; square jaw and aquiline nose; deep-set, ruthless, unblinking eyes.  \n\nThis is GREGOR TRETIAK. To characterize him as the John Gotti of Russia is to \ndemean him. He is vastly more powerful.  \n\nTRETIAK \nInteresting.  \n(sizes up Templar) \nYou are not a big man. But men like \nyou never are. It is my pleasure, \nSimon Templar. My name is...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI know who you are. Tell me what \nyou want, or I keep walking.  \n\nTRETIAK \nSuppose I don't want anything.  \nSuppose I want to kill you.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nSuppose there's a high-powered rifle \ntrained at your head.  \n\nAs Tretiak's eyes dart about, Templar raises his hand, waving, signaling to \nsomeone below the bridge -- \n\nBELOW THE BRIDGE - ON THE VICTORIA EMBANKMENT \n\n-- that someone is CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON, in a cloth cap and rain \nmack now, and yes, he has a 30.6 scoped rifle trained at Tretiak's head.  \n\nBACK TO THE BRIDGE Tretiak's jaw muscles twitch. He smiles thinly.  \n\nTRETIAK \nRumour has not lied about you, Mr.  \nTemplar. Last night something was \nstolen in St. Petersburg. My city.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou talk about the place as if you \nown it.  \n\nTRETIAK \n(sinisterly) \nI do, Mr. Templar. May I ask who hired you? \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou can ask. I won't answer.  \n\nTRETIAK \nWhat you stole I wanted very badly.  \n(beat) \nIlya.  \n\nIlya emerges from the shadows.  \nLocks eyes with Templar. The thief from the Nikko! \n\nTRETIAK \nWhat is the saying - if you can't \nbeat them, why not join them? \nAn American phrase, no? Or are you \nBritish? Australian? \n\nTEMPLAR \nI'm nothing. Except bored.  \nGet to the point.  \n\nTRETIAK \n(smiles) \nOf course. An American scientist \nhas worked ten years to develop a \ncertain technology. I am informed \nthat the technology will be made \npublic at the annual nuclear science \nsymposium in Washington D.C. I \nwould like the plans and \nspecifications for this technology. Before the symposium.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhat are we talking about? \n\nTRETIAK \nA nuclear fusion generator. We have \na man on the inside.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhy can't he steal it? \n\nTRETIAK \nHe's tried. The scientist trusts no \none and keeps no hard records of the \ntechnology in the lab.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nNuclear fusion. They say it's \nmankind's only hope after all the \noil's gone. This guy's actually done it? \n\nTRETIAK \nShe.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCome again? \n\nTRETIAK \nShe, Mr. Templar. The scientist is a woman.  \n(hands over a dossier) \nHer dossier. All the information \nyou will need.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nMy fee is fifteen million U.S.  \ndollars, half up front, half when I \ndeliver. You'll hear from me.  \n\nTemplar turns and walks off.  \n\nTRETIAK \nTemplar, one question.  \n\nTemplar stops. Turns.  \n\nTRETIAK \nI ask you to steal a person's entire \nlife's work. You have no reaction.  \nAre you that cold? \n\nTemplar stares back, expressionless. He turns and disappears into the fog.  \n\nTRETIAK \nNo, rumor hasn't lied about you, Templar.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - ESTABLISHING SHOTS \nVarious establishing shots of this suburban community just north of \nManhattan. Pretty, charming, affluent.  \n\nINT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - SUPERMARKET \nA large suburban supermarket.  \nThe aisles are full of Westchester women: affluent, country clubby, \nhousewifey types.  \nA HAND reaches for a BOTTLE OF LEMONADE (100% Natural) , bringing it \ndown to the eye level of -- \n\nJILLIAN ST. THOMAS. She is lean, a swimmer's body perhaps, with terrific \nacuteness and authority in her thought, speech, and action. Debate this \nwoman? Fine, but you'd better know what the hell you're talking about. Her \nstare can stop a train.  \nShe's casually dressed. Only her JACKET stands out.  \nIt's waist-cut, with a colorful diagram of protons and electrons circling a \nnucleus embroidered on the back.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(reads ingredients) \nFiltered water, high fructose corn \nsyrup. Lemon juice concentrate.  \nCitric acid. Gum acacia...? \n(grumbles) \nTotally natural, yeah right.  \n\nShe returns the bottle and turns, coming face-to-face with SIMON TEMPLAR, \nwearing a moustache and glasses now.  \nHe has a bottle of LEMON JUICE in his hand.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nTry this.  \n(smiles) \nSorry, I overheard.  \n(hands her the bottle) \nThe real thing. No chemicals, \nno preservatives.  \n\nShe reads the label. Satisfied, she looks at Templar.  \n\nJILLIAN \nThanks.  \n\nShe puts it in her cart and wheels off and CUT TO: \n\nINT. SUPERMARKET - PRODUCE SECTION - MINUTES LATER \nJillian is examining apples. There is a THUMPING NOISE. It persists. Finally \nshe looks over at -- \n\nTEMPLAR. He's standing in front of the watermelons. He's thumping one with \nhis thumb. He notices Jillian.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nHello again. These aren't ripe.  \nHow are the apples? \n\nJILLIAN \nExcellent. They're in season.  \n\nTemplar walks over to the apples. Picks one up. Studies it for a moment.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI wonder why He didn't want us to eat these.  \n\nA pause. She looks at him, puzzled.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWho? \n\nTEMPLAR \nGod. In the Garden of Eden.  \n\nJILLIAN \nOh right. Sorry, little slow today.  \nBad headache.  \n(looks at the apple) \nUhm, actually, I don't know.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhy wasn't it: \"No bananas.\" Or: \n\"Avoid, at all cost, kumquats.\" \nWonder what God had against apples.  \nShe gives him a funny look and turns away.  \n\nJILLIAN \nSorry. Can't help you.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nHow about William Tell? You really \nthink he shot one of these off his \nbrother's head with an arrow? \n\nJillian turns around again. A pause.  \n\nJILLIAN \nDo I know you? \n\nTEMPLAR \nUnlikely. I just moved to New York.  \n\nShe stares at him. This is a very strange man.  \nIntriguing yes, but also possibly a lunatic. She decides to take the dismissive \nroute: \n\nJILLIAN \nWell uhhm, sir, to answer your apple \nquestions, one, I don't know what \nGod's problem was. Two, William \nTell, like Paul Bunyon, never \nexisted. And in case you're \nwondering, Isaac Newton discovered \ngravity through planetary \nobservation not because one of those \nfell on his head, and I seriously doubt \nthat eating one a day will keep the doctor away.  \n(beat) \nOkay? \n\nShe wheels her cart off. Says over her shoulder: \n\nJILLIAN \nBy the way - welcome to the Big Apple.  \n\nTemplar watches her wheel off. His eyes glint. This is going to be \ninteresting...  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. WESTCHESTER SUPERMARKET - PARKING LOT - DAY \n\nJillian slams down the hatch of her station wagon, now filled with groceries.  \nShe gets in.  \nThe car pulls out of the parking lot.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING \nJillian, driving, drinking her lemonade, listens to a cassette tape. An \nauthoritative, scholarly, Indian voice: \n\nVIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) \nNuclear fusion occurs when pairs of \nnuclei meet and their protons and \nneutrons fuse together into a single \nnucleus. The fused nuclei move off \nat high speed, producing energy.  \nNuclear fusion could provide us \nwith almost unlimited power.  \n\nJILLIAN \nNo, really? Moron.  \n\nVIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) \nAll you need are two hydrogen gases, \ndeuterium and lithium, and a machine \nto make them fuse under controlled conditions.  \n\nJILLIAN \nC'mon, Dr. Singh. Tell me something \nI don't know.  \n\nJillian sees something through the windshield.  \nShe turns down the volume and squints -- \n\nJILLIAN'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD \nA ROLLS ROYCE sits on the road shoulder. As we pass the Rolls, we see \nSIMON TEMPLAR standing next to it wearing a hopeless expression.  \n\nBACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN \nlooks at the Rolls in the rear-view mirror. She frowns.  \n\nJILLIAN \nJust keep driving.  \n\nJillian frowns again. Against her better judgment, she pulls over. Throws it in \nreverse.  \n\nEXT. WESTCHESTER - SUBURBAN ROAD SHOULDER - DAY \nJillian's station wagon backs up to the Rolls Royce on the road shoulder. Jillian \ngets out.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nHello! \nShe walks up to him. Together they look down at THE REAR TIRE. It's flat, a \npancake.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhere's the spare? \n\nTEMPLAR \nI.. .well.. .I'm not really certain.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou do know how to change a tire.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nSorry.  \n(beat) \nI'm not very...  \nmechanical.  \n\nJillian rolls her eyes.  \n\nJILLIAN \nGive me your keys.  \n\nTemplar hands them over.  \nThey walk to the rear. Jillian opens the trunk.  \nThey both look down at -- .  \n\nTHE TRUNK'S INTERIOR - THE SPARE TIRE is also flat.  \n\nTEMPLAR \n(sheepish) \nSorry.  \n\nJillian rolls her eyes again.  \n\nJILLIAN \nAll right, where do you live? \n\nTEMPLAR \nClose.  \n\nJILLIAN \nIt's your lucky day.  \n(begins to walk off) \nCome on.  \n\nTemplar watches her walk off. He smiles grimly.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S CAR - DRIVING \nThe car winds through Westchester roads.  \n\nVIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) \nResearch has centered on a machine \ncalled a tokamak, developed in \nRussia, essentially a doughnut \nshaped tube that contains the gases to \nbe fused.  \n\nAt this, Templar stares at the tape cassette.  \n\nVIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette) \nThe tokamak hasn't worked because \nthe two gases must be heated to a \ntemperature of hundreds of millions \nof degrees, and kept together for \nseveral seconds.  \n\nJILLIAN \nTry room temperature, idiot.  \nThe Tokamak's got it all backwards.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nUhhm. Excuse me. Who is that? \n\nJILLIAN \nHim? A powerful, well-respected man \nwho doesn't know a goddarnn thing \nwhat he's talking about. If I got \none tenth of his funding...  \n\nJillian reaches down and yanks off the cassette player.  \nShe looks out the window, grumbling. They drive on.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nIt's the next left. First driveway on the right.  \n\nEXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - TEMPLAR 'S HOME \nJillian's station wagon pulls into the circle of the largest mansion in \nWestchester County. Just stupendous.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON \nJillian stares, open-mouthed, at the mansion.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou live here? \n(turns to him) \nAre you for real? \n\nHe picks up Jillian's lemonade bottle.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nLike the label says. No chemicals, \nno preservatives.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(points at the house) \nYou work for this or inherit it? \n\nTEMPLAR \nMy father made shoes. I inherited \nthe company. Now I make shoes.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(looks at the house) \nThat's a helluva lot of shoes.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nUhm listen, I'm not very good at \nthis and I realize we just met, \nbut I'm even-tempered, politically \nmoderate, belong to no religious \ncults, have no children I know of, \nam free of communicable diseases, I \nhappen to find you attractive...  \n\nJILLIAN \nWait a minute, hold on.  \nAre you asking me out on a date? \n\nTEMPLAR \nYes.  \n\nJILLIAN \nHow do you know I'm not married? \n\nTEMPLAR \nI believe the fourth finger on your left hand is...  \n\nJILLIAN \n(quickly) \nOkay so I'm not married.  \nI could have a boyfriend.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI'd be surprised if you didn't have several.  \n\nJILLIAN \nBe surprised. Lemme give you a hand.  \n\nJillian pops the wagon's back hatch and gets out.  Templar follows. They walk to the wagon's rear.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat about you? There's no wife stashed \non some island someplace? \n\nTEMPLAR \nNo wife stashed on some island.  \n\nThey pick up Templar's groceries; each takes two bags.  \n\nJILLIAN \nNo mistress? C'mon. No bimbo on the side? \n\nTEMPLAR \nNot a one.  \n\nThey walk toward the mansion.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWell, that's a start. Here's the \ndeal with me: I am not particularly \neven-tempered, I'm staunchly \nliberal, belong to no \nreligious cults but I do believe in God as a \nbasic force of good, have no \nchildren because one has to have sex \nto do that and, well, let's not \npursue that, am free of communicable \ndiseases, see above, and you're an \nattractive man, if a little weird, \nand well.. .hell, why not.  \n(smiles) \nYou've got a date, shoemaker.  \nWhat's your name? \n\nTEMPLAR \nMichael. Michael Quinn.  \n\nThey reach the mansion's front veranda. They set the groceries on a wicker \ncouch.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI'm Jillian St. Thomas.  \n\nThey shake hands. Jillian fishes for a pen.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI'll give you my number.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nJust say it. I have a good memory.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(looks at him) \nEight seven seven, five two nine eight.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nGood. Great. I'll call you.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI've heard that before.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI will call you. You saved me \ntoday. Thanks again.  \n\nShe walks off to her car. Templar turns toward the front door. Jillian suddenly \nstops. Turns.  \n\nJILLIAN \nHey.  \n(Templar turns) \nWhat's my number? \n\nTEMPLAR \n(without hesitation) \nEight seven seven, five \ntwo nine eight.  \n\nJILLIAN smiles and continues toward the car, mumbling: \n\nJILLIAN \nAnd he has a brain.  \nWhat do you know.  \n\nAT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR - TEMPLAR watches Jillian get in her wagon \nand drive off. Then Templar keys open the door and enters.  \n\nINT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - DAY \nThe place is empty. Totally. No furniture. Nothing.  \nJust Templar's two CARRY-ON BAGS on the floor in front of Templar.  \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nINT. WESTCHESTER MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nIt's late now. About 10 p.m.  \nTemplar sits on a packing crate in the vacant living room with a glass of \nscotch, studying Jillian's life.  \n\nThere are pages of personal data and many photographs: Jillian in cap and \ngown; Jillian in a lab coat; Jillian at the beach, etc.  \n\nDISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: \n\nA LEGAL PAD, with Templar's handwritten note: \nNO HARD COPIES - COMPUTER SOFTWEAR \n\nTEMPLAR stares into the screen of his mini-computer.  \nIt is two hours later.  \n\nINSERT - THE MINI-COMPUTER SCREEN - Templar has entered every detail of \nJillian's life. Looks like this: \nHome state: Massachusetts \nHometown: Milton \nHighschool: Milton Academy \nHighschool mascot: Bulldogs \nUniversity: Harvard \nUniversity mascot: Crimson \n\nIt just goes on and on: names of parents, family members, teachers, pets, \nboyfriends; favorite movies, colors, sports teams, hobbies, etc.  \n\nDISSOLVE TIME CUT TO: \n\nTEMPLAR finishes entering the details of Jillian's life.  \nHe copies it onto a 3 1/4 disk, pulls out the disk and shuts off the minicomputer.  \nHe leans down and picks up a SHOE BOX. Opens it. He lifts out a WOMAN'S \nSHOE and jerks the heel, which lifts away from the sole on hinges. revealing a \nhidden compartment, in which Templar places a small transistor.  \nHe clicks the heel shut. THE SHOE -- \n\nMATCH DISSOLVES TO: \n\nTHE SAME SHOE, now on Jillian's foot and WIDEN TO -- \n\nINT. MANHATTAN - LE CIRQUE \n-- Jillian and Templar at a corner table in Le Cirque. The meal is over. They're \ndrinking coffee, laughing, at ease. The \"date\" is going well.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI am not eccentric.  \n\nJILLIAN \nNo? You live in the biggest house \nin America but do your own shopping, \nyou talk to strange women about the history \nof apples, and you give \na first-time date.. . shoes? \nIsn't the tradition flowers? \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou said you liked them.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI do. I'm joking. They're \nbeautiful. Thank-you.  \n\nThey smile at each other. A WAITER brings more coffee. There's a sudden \ncommotion. Jillian and Templar look -- \n\nACROSS THE ROOM - a group of WAITERS are clapping their hands for a \nYOUNG COUPLE seated at a table.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(to the waiter) \nWhat happened? \n\nWAITER \n(smiles) \nHe just asked her to marry him.  \nAnything else? \n\nJILLIAN looks at the radiant young couple. Smiles.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nJust the check please.  \n(the waiter exits; Jillian looks at him) \nYou didn't answer my question.  \nMaybe it made you uncomfortable.  \nMaybe I should just shut up...  \n\nJILLIAN \nNo, it's all right. Okay: \"Why \nJillian never got married, chapter \nOne:\" I don't know where you're from. . .  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCanada.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI don't know what it's like there, \nbut here, if a teenage girl doesn't \nwant to be a cheerleader, or drink \n'till she pukes every weekend, or \ntalk endlessly on the phone every \nnight about absolutely nothing, then she \ndoesn't win many popularity \ncontests, know what I mean? \nThat pretty much took care of highschool.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCollege? \n\nJILLIAN \nTry earning double p.h.d.'s \nfrom Harvard before you turn twenty-three \nand having a social life.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCan I ask a personal question? \n(she nods) \nWhat's your I.Q.? \n\nJILLIAN \n(laughs) \nThat's personal? My I.Q.? \nLet's just say it's high.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nVery high.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYes, very high. As high as yours.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou don't honestly mean that.  \n\nJILLIAN \nOh, you're a smart one, shoemaker.  \nIt's in the eyes. I can always tell.  \n\nThey stare at each other. Neither averts eyes.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI just don't often get \nthe opportunity. It feels nice.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nFor me, too.  \n(and he means this:) \nYou're very pretty.  \n\nJILLIAN \nStop it. Flattery will get you...  \nsomeplace. I don't know where yet.  \n\nShe smiles. The waiter arrives with the check; gives it to Templar. Jillian picks \nup her purse and takes her wallet out. Templar sees her doing this...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nNo no no, absolutely not.  \nPut that away.  \n\nJILLIAN \nIt's not for us. It's for the couple over there.  \n(points at the couple across the room) \nWaiter, put their bill on my card please.  \n\nWAITER \nMaam? Are you sure? \n\nJillian nods. The waiter takes Jillian's card, exits.  \nJillian smiles at Templar. [Due to his mean origins and evolution, Templar has witnessed approximately three charitable acts in his whole life, and this was \nthe third.] Thus does Simon Templar smile uneasily back.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nNeat, modest, non-descript. Jillian and Templar enter. Jillian walks across the \nliving room into a bar alcove off the living room.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI'll make the booze.  \nTurn on the news. I want to catch up on that \nRussia thing.  \n\nTemplar turns on the T.V. His eyes rove around, casing the place.  \n\nJILLIAN (o.s.) \nWhat do you want, Michael? \nI've got everything.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nScotch please. No ice.  \n\nCNN EVENING NEWS with anchor BERNARD SHAW comes on.  \n\nBERNARD SHAW (on T.V.) \n.. ..of the steadily growing NeoCzarist \nParty, leveled more allegations against \nPresident Victor Karpov. According to \nRomanov, two men, Gregor Tretiak...  \n\nTemplar looks at the T.V. and double takes.  \nA PHOTO OF GREGOR TRETIAK has appeared on the screen.  \n\nBERNARD SHAW (o.s.) \n.. . and Ivan Gracha...  \n\nA PHOTO OF IVAN GRACHA, 50's, short, beady-eyed, sinister, appears on the \nscreen.  \n\nJILLIAN pokes her head out of the bar.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat brand? \n\nBERNARD SHAW (o.s.) \n...allegedly the most powerful of \nRussia's underworld bosses, are \nlinked to President Karpov in \nillegal enterprises...  \n\nJILLIAN walks over to Templar. They watch together.  \n\nJILLIAN \nThat country's going to explode.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nIt very well might. Oban.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat? .  \n\nTEMPLAR \nMy brand of scotch.  \nOban. Have any? \n\nJILLIAN \nNo, but there's a liquor store \nfive minutes away.  \n\nShe grabs her coat, heads for the door.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWait. Don't be ridiculous.  \n\nShe stops. Looks at him.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI want to be ridiculous.  \n(pause) \nMichael, I haven't had anybody \nover in...a long time. And I \nhappen to like you. I want to do \nthis right. Okay? \n(he smiles; nods) \nI'll be back in ten minutes.  \n(points at fireplace) \nBuild a fire.  \n\nShe winks at him and exits.  \nTemplar walks to the window and stands there, waiting.  \nWe hear Jillian's car start, see the headlights.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou're making this too \neasy, dear.  \n\nHe pulls from his pocket a BLACK CASE, flips it open, turns it on. On a \nminiature computer screen is a detailed map of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. Two \nlocations are pulsing: 1) Jillian's house and 2) a moving object, transmitted \nfrom a homing device, which we now see \u0096 \n\nINT. JILLIAN' S CAR - DRIVING \n\n-- it's in JILLIAN'S SHOE as she stamps on the brake at a stoplight and waits \nand we CUT BACK to the house...  \n\nINT. JILLIAN' SHOUSE - BACK HALLWAY \nTEMPLAR moves down the hall opening doors, looking for Jillian's lab. He \nmoves quickly, ruthlessly.  \n\nHe comes to a heavily locked FIRE DOOR. He unpockets a set of burglar's \ntools.  \nFor Templar, these locks are a joke. He opens them with alarming speed. He \npushes open the door, revealing a DESCENDING STAIRCASE. He descends.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BASMENT \nTemplar finds a lightswitch and flips it on.  \nHis eyes widen. Here we find -- \n\nJILLIAN'S LABORATORY. A POOL OF WATER (the size of a small swimming \npool) is surrounded by HUNDREDS OF TEST TUBES of various shapes and \nsizes containing chemicals.  \nTemplar moves through, eyes scanning everything.  \nHe sees JILLIAN'S COMPUTER. Walks over to it.  \n\nHe unpockets the HOMING SYSTEM and sets it on the desk.  \nThe PULSING LIGHT is still moving; Jillian hasn't yet reached the liquor store.  \nHe turns on Jillian's monitor and hard drive. The COMPUTER SCREEN blinks \non. We see a MENU: \nA.) Personal finances \nB.) Income tax \nC.) Things to do \nD.) Addresses \nE.) Research \n\nTemplar positions the cursor on \"E.) Research\" and hits \"enter.\" The modem \nengages; this appears: \n\n******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* \nPLEASE WAIT \nThen this appears: RETRIEVAL CODE: _____________________ \n\nTEMPLAR \nSmart girl. Send your data into \ncyberspace and only you can retrieve \nit. Because only you have the code.  \n\nHe unpockets the 3 1/4 disk containing the data from Jillian's life and pushes \nit into the disk drive. He types a command; a new screen appears: \n\nDATA ENTRY SYSTEM \nPress any key to begin \n\nTemplar hits a key and the old screen reappears: \n******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ******* \nPLEASE WAIT \nRETRIEVAL CODE: ______________________ \n\nBut now, in the space next to \"Retrieval Code,\" Templar's data appears. word \nafter word, like this: \n-- \"Massachusetts\" \n-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED \n-- \"Boston\" -- \n-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED. \n-- \"Milton\" -- \n-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED \n-- \"Milton Academy\" \n-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED \n-- \"Bulldogs\" \n-- Computer: ACCESS DENIED \n\nIt's incredibly fast, a new word appearing every second, as the system tries to \ncrack Jillian's code. But the computer denies access to each word.  \nThe HOMING DEVICE suddenly BEEPS. The pulsing light has stopped, \nindicating Jillian is at the liquor store.  \nTemplar grimly turns back to the computer.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. WESTCHESTER LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT \nThe clerk, WALTER, hands Jillian her change.  \nShe exits with a SCOTCH BOTTLE in a brown wrapper.  \n\nCLERK \nGoodnight Jillian.  \n\nJILLIAN \n\u0091Night, Walter.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY - NIGHT \nTemplar paces; he looks at the homing device. The PULSING LIGHT is moving \nback toward Jillian's house.  \nTemplar looks at the computer; his system continues entering words: \n\"Hendrix.\" ACCESS DENIED. \"Purple Haze.\" ACCESS DENIED. \"Red Sox.\" \nACCESS DENIED. \"Celtics.\" ACCESS DENIED. On and on...each is met with \n\nACCESS DENIED.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING - NIGHT \nJillian, driving, turns on the radio. She hums along.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY \nTemplar stares at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulse is getting closer; it's do or \ndie now...  \nTemplar's system suddenly stops. It has run through every word. Each has \nmet with failure.  \nTEMPLAR frowns. He yanks the system disk from the disk drive. He begins \npacing...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nOkay, think. Think.  \n\nTemplar suddenly gets an idea.  \nHe sits and types: \"Tokamak.\" ACCESS DENIED Templar stares at the screen \nin frustration.  \n\nHe looks at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulsing light is getting really close.  \nTemplar concentrates with every brain cell.  \nWe can feel him think. He's remembering something.  \n\nMEMORY FLASHBACK \n\nWe're in Jillian's car again, when they first met.  \n\nJILLIAN \nTry room temperature, idiot.  \nThe Tokamak's got it all backwards.  \n\nBACK TO THE LABORATORY \n\nTemplar grabs a pencil and notepad and spells out: \nTOKAMAK. Under this he spells it backwards: KAMAKOT.  \nHe turns to the computer and types: \"KAMAKOT\" And instantly this flashes: \nACCESS GRANTED.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nOpen sesame.  \n\nThe retrieval begins: A DOCUMENT appears on the screen: \nTHE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION \nSubmitted by: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS \n\nTemplar scrolls through the document; we see a dizzying display of graphs, \ntables, plans, specifications, etc.  \nTemplar pulls out the disk containing Jillian's data and shoves a fresh disk \ninto the disk drive. He begins copying Jillian's research from harddrive to disk.  \nHe looks at the HOMING DEVICE. Christ, she's almost back.. .and indeed -- \n\nEXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE \n-- Jillian's car comes wheeling into the driveway.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN' S LABORATORY - NIGHT \nThe document is copied. Templar grabs the copied disk from the disk drive \nand rips the slip of paper from the notepad. He flicks off the computer and \nsprints across the lab, then up the stairs.  \n\nEXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE \nJillian reaches for the doorknob and enters -- \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE \nShe comes in. TEMPLAR, relaxed, lounges on the couch, flipping through some magazines.  \nHe smiles: \n\nTEMPLAR \nThat was quick.  \n\nShe walks past him to the bar alcove.  \n\nJILLIAN \nNow Mr. Michael Quinn, let's have \nthat scotch. Hey, what happened \nto the fire? \n\nTEMPLAR \nI thought we'd create our own.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(smiles) \nDown boy.  \n\nHe gets up; goes to the fireplace; grabs some logs and lays them across the \nandirons and we -- \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nTHE LOGS, now gently burning. Cole Porter is playing.  \nCAMERA PANS past Jillian's shoes on the carpet, past the Oban Scotch on the \ncoffee table, now half empty, to -- \n\n-- the couch, where Jillian and Templar are locked in a heavy kiss. Jillian stops.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhoah whoah whoah, time to put \non the brakes. Those lips oughtta be \nlicensed buddy...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nSorry. I wasn't trying to...  \n\nJILLIAN \nI know you weren't but if we keep \ngoing I'm gonna be the one who gets us \nboth in trouble. Whew! \n(fans herself) \nHaven't felt like that for awhile.  \n(she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes) \nAm I going to see you again? \n\nA pause. Perhaps, just perhaps, for the first time in his black life Templar's having a hard time lying...  \n\nJILLIAN \nMichael? \n\nTEMPLAR \n(smiles at her) \nHow about breakfast? \n\nJILLIAN \nIt's a date. I'll walk you \nout, shoemaker.  \n\nEXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nIn the threshold they kiss again.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nGood-night.  \n\nJILLIAN \n'Bye. Drive safe.  \n\nTemplar walks off to his Rolls Royce parked in the driveway. He smiles at her and waves.  \nHe turns toward his car; his face goes hard and cold.  \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - CONTINUOUS LATE AFTERNOON \nOn the Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's equivalent of the Champs-Elysees \u0096 \n\nMICHAEL ROMANOV stands on a raised platform outside the gates of a \nPALATIAL MANSION taking up a whole city block. TEN THOUSAND \nSUPPORTERS surround him. Many carry large, slogan-filled banners.  \nFour THUGGISH-LOOKING MEN stand guard inside the mansion's compound, \ngiving Romanov the eye. One is ZERO (Tretiak's bodyguard on Blackfriars \nBridge).  \n\nMICHAEL ROMANOV \nWhere is Russia's capital? Moscow? The Kremlin? No, Russia's capital is...  \n(points at mansion) \nTHROUGH THOSE GATES! \n(crowd CHEERS) \nA den of thieves! \n\nA LIMOUSINE pulls through the crowd, which reluctantly parts. The guards \nwithin the compound open the gates.  \n\nMICHAEL ROMANOV \nAnd here - the Prince of Thieves! \n\nGREGOR TRETIAK sits in the back of the limousine, silently glaring at \nRomanov. The limousine rolls inside the compound, the gates CLANGING \nshut.  \n\nMICHAEL ROMANOV \nEvery citizen in St. Petersburg \nknows what that man does, yet the \npolice don't arrest him. They \nprotect him! How can this be? \nMaybe we should ask our elected \nwhores in Moscow! \n\nThe CROWD CHEERS WILDLY and starts hurling rocks, bottles, etc, through \nthe gate at -- \n\n-- TRETIAK, emerging from the limousine. Tretiak's guards surround him; \nthey move quickly up the mansion's marble steps, dodging the thrown debris.  \n\nSIRENS WAIL. Four large police vans roar up, the back doors flinging open.  \nST. PETERSBURG POLICE, in riot gear, deploy from the vans.  \nThe police push into the crowd, wielding riot shields and batons. A melee \nbreaks out, Romanov supporters versus the police.  \n\nINT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - EVENING \nTretiak and his men move past A GUARD STATION manned by TWO GUARDS \nwatching six SURVEILLANCE MONITORS (showing, at all times, certain areas of. the compound).  \n\nThis is a former nobleman's residence; a 20 foot diameter CRYSTAL \nCHANDELIER hangs from the domed roof fifty feet above. A spectacular \nstaircase ascends to a mezzanine, with offices (formerly bed chambers) off it.  \n\nTretiak approaches a man in a lab coat, ZUBOV, wearing a grim, anxious \nexpression. Zubov chainsmokes constantly.  \n\nZUBOV \nThere's a problem.  \n\nTretiak follows Zubov down stairs into -- \n\nINT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - BASEMENT LABORATORY \n-- a large room with TECHNICIANS hunched over computers.  \nTretiak follows Zubov to a large bank of computers.  \n\nZUBOV \n(indicates computer) \nThis is the data your thief sent us.  \n\nTretiak looks at Zubov's COMPUTER SCREEN.  \n\nINSERT - THE COMPUTER SCREEN. Again we see: \n\nTHE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION \nSubmitted by: \nDR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS \n\nBACK TO SCENE \n\nTRETIAK \n(confused) \nCold fusion? \n\nZUBOV \nYes. Fusion at room temperature.  Regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community. A myth.  \n(smiles) \nThen I read this.  \n\nZubov begins scrolling through the document; again we see the displav of graphs. tables. plans. Specs.. etc.  \n\nZUBOV \nShe first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak - is impractical. You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy is wasted than created. Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion.  \n(scrolls more pages) \nThe hydrogen isotopes needed.  \n(scrolls more pages) \nThe physical plant. She even estimates its cost. Extraordinary.  \n(scrolls more pages) \nThe next pages are the critical part, what no one in fifty years has discovered.  \n(looks up at Tretiak) \nThe combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature.  \n\nTretiak leans toward the screen, waiting.  \n\nTRETIAK \nWell? Let's see.  \n\nZUBOV \nTretiak - I think from reading \nthis that the woman's done it.  \nShe may have found a source of \nunlimited energy.  \n\nTRETIAK \nWhat do you mean \nmay have. Show me.  \n\nZUBOV \nI said there was a problem.  \nZubov hits the \"scroll\" key. The next page appears; we see the heading at the top of the page: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION \n\nBut there's something wrong with the rest of the page.  \nTerribly wrong. We know this because of \u0096 \n\nTRETIAK'S EXPRESSION, and it's not too happy.  \n\nTRETIAK \nWhere's the rest of it? \n\nZUBOV \nIt's in her head. \n\nand CUT TO: \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING \nJILLIAN, humming the Cole Porter song from the previous evening, fills a basket with breakfast for two: eggs, bagels, etc. Sunlight streams in. Birds chirping.  \n\nShe wears jeans and her jacket with the atomic diagram embroidered on the back. She grabs flowers from a vase; tosses them in the basket. Smiles.  \n\nINT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM \nShe enters with the basket. Looks at the disheveled couch and the bottle of Oban. She hums the Cole Porter song, stabs her feet in THE SHOES TEMPLAR GAVE HER and goes to the front door.  \n\nEXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT \nJillian comes out, running into -- \n\nYURI, her lab assistant, who comes up the front stoop. Mid-20's, heavy \nRussian accent, white lab coat.  \n\nYURI \nGood morning, boss.  \nWhere are you going? \n\nJILLIAN \nTo see a friend.  \nBe back in a couple hours.  \n\nShe gets in her car.  Yuri gives her a look, goes inside.  \n\nINT. JILL IAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM \nYuri enters. The foyer phone RINGS.

WESTCHESTER - TEMPLAR' S MANSION - MORNING \nThe huge estate, as before. Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circular driveway. Jillian gets out with the breakfast basket. Moves up the flagstoned walk.  \nSuddenly the front door opens. A WOMAN, mid-30's, pretty and well-dressed, comes out and locks the door.  \n\nJILLIAN watches her. The woman comes down the walk.  \n\nWOMAN \nMay I help you? \n(beat) \nDo you have an appointment? \n\nJILLIAN \nA what? \n\nWOMAN \nTo see the house.  \n\nJILLIAN \nThe man who lives here...  \nwho owns the house...  \n\nWOMAN \nWhat man. The estate is rented \nfor weddings and corporate events.  \nAre you. ..interested...? \n\nJILLIAN \nNo. No.  \n\nThe rental agent gives Jillian a funny look and gets in her car. Drives off.  Jillian stares at the house, thunderstruck. Then she sharply inhales: \n\nJILLIAN \nOh my god. ...  \n\nJillian gets in her car.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nTEMPLAR'S COMPUTER screen, which reads: \n\n******* NATIONAL BANK OF GENEVA ******* \nPRIVATE UNMARKED ACCOUNTS \nPLEASE ENTER SECURITY PASSWORD \n\nINT.

JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - MORNING \nJillian races down the stairs and across the lab to her computer. She moves in a panic, as if in a living nightmare. She turns the computer on. She types in the code word, \"kamakot,\" and her research paper appears on the screen. In the lower right corner it reads: LAST ENTERED: 10:23 p.m.  \n\nJILLIAN \nNo.. . ..  \n\nShe sees something on the desk.  The NOTEPAD on which Templar wrote his notes.

It's really no trouble. ...  \n\nOkay lady, anything to get rid of you: \n\nTEMPLAR \nSure. Black please.  \n\nShe smiles and walks off to the coffee counter, passing A BUSINESSMAN, who sits down with a steaming cup of coffee and starts reading the WALL STREET JOURNAL.  \n\nTemplar eyes the man, then looks back at his computer.  \nHe begins typing. The phone modem engages. \u0096 \n\nTemplar types: LION CONTACTING BEAR. IS BEAR HOME? \n-- This comes back: AFFIRMATIVE. \n-- Templar types: LION HAS NOT BEEN PAID.

So long.  \n\nShe smiles. Templar sort of smiles back. She walks off to catch her flight.  THE BUSINESSMAN next to Templar, hidden behind his newspaper, sets his coffee cup down next to Templar's.  \nThe Businessman flips a page, engrossed in an article.  \nHe reaches back for his coffee, but takes Templar's cup.  \n\nHe drinks from the cup.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nExcuse me, that's my. . . .  \n\nThe Businessman's newspaper is shaking. Violently. It falls to the table.  The Businessman's face is flushed. He twitches. He pitches over. His head THUDS on the table.  \n\nTemplar feels the Businessman's carotid artery. He's dead. Templar picks up his coffee and smells it.  Templar's eyes dart to the lounge.  The Lady Accountant is gone.  Nobody in the lounge has noticed what's happened.  Templar hurriedly collects his things.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. WESTCHESTER - JILLIAN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nAN AIRPORT TAXI stops at the curb. Templar gets out, paying the cabbie.

A NINTENDO GAME. Little spaceships are flying around chasing other little spaceships!  TEMPLAR stares at it, stunned: what he sent the Russians is essentially worthless. Templar shuts off the monitor. The screen blackens. The black screen reflects light. It reflects A PERSON coming down the stairs. A person with a gun...  \n\nTemplar dives away as THREE BULLETS blow the computer monitor to shards.  \nTHE WOMAN FROM THE J.F.K. LOUNGE, not an accountant but an assassin, \ndraws a bead on -- \n\nTEMPLAR, who scrambles across the room ducking under lab tables as \nBULLETS shatter bottles, beakers, test tubes; glass fills the air.  \nTEMPLAR stands up, his 9mm leveled at the woman.  \nThe woman's gun is leveled at Templar. - \n\nTEMPLAR \nThat's a Reuger nine shot.  \nI counted nine.  \n\nFEMALE ASSASSIN \nWhat if you're wrong.  \n\nThe tension boils. Templar was right: her hand flashes to the gun, ejecting the spent clip. She tries to ram in a fresh clip but she's not fast enough...  \n\nTEMPLAR'S across the room in half a second. He presses his gun to her \nforehead.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhen were you hired and for what? \n\nI'm not in a very good mood...  \n\nTemplar cocks the hammer. This gets her attention.  \n\nFEMALE ASSASSIN \nOkay. Take it easy. I was hired a week ago to take you and the woman out, and detonate the house. It was empty when I got here.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWho's your employer? \n\nFEMALE ASSASSIN \nI don't ask names.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nDid they have accents?

What's your price? \n\nFEMALE ASSASSIN \nFifty thousand for you, fifty \nfor her, fifty for the house.  \n\nTemplar pulls out his wallet, from which he unfolds three pieces of negotiable paper. Hands them to her.  She examines them.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nU.S. bearer bonds.  Good as cash.  \n\nFEMALE ASSASSIN \nAbout the airport - no \noffense you understand.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nNone taken.

But it's fixed, inert.  \nThe pulsing light begins to move east, quickly.  \n\nTemplar watches it. The pulse is moving too quickly for an automobile. And it's heading for the ocean.

A tattoo here, a scar there...  \nCOCO, a young mechanic, hands Remy a CELLULAR PHONE.  \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \nMerci, Coco.  \n(Coco walks off) \nRemy Samarkand Aeronautique, \nRemy Samarkand.  \n\nTEMPLAR (v.o.) \nI need a favour, Remy.  \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \n(smiles) \nAnything for Simon Templar...  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. PARIS, FRANCE - CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - THREE HOURS LATER \nThe Concorde touches down as we SUPER: \n\nCHARLES DE GAULLE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, PARIS, FRANCE \n\nEXT. DE GAULLE AIRPORT - TARMAC \nTemplar, with his carry-on bags, and Remy Samarkand run across the tarmac toward a LEAR JET being fueled. In the b.g. sits the huge Concorde jet. They yell over the howling jet engines.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nIT'S A LITTLE JET, MAYBE A TURBO \nPROP. ENTERED SCOTLAND FIVE \nMINUTES AGO, GO ING TO ST. PETERSBURG.  \nCAN WE GET TO IT BEFORE THEN? \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \nOUI . OVER FINLAND.  \n\nINT. REMY' S LEAR JET - MINUTES LATER \nTHE HOMING DEVICE - The screen shows a MAP OF EUROPE. Two locations \nare pulsing: 1) Remy's jet, moving north from Paris; and 2) The jet carrying Jillian, moving across Scotland heading due east.  \nThe plane is in flight. Templar's homing device and mini-computer sit on the cockpit console.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhat are you smuggling these days? \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \nOh, things. How long has it been \u0096 \ntwo year? Three? Now tell me: \nwhat's so important about this plane? \n\nTEMPLAR \nFifteen million dollars \nof my money.  \n(picks up cellular phone) \nAnd a score to settle.  \n\nTemplar punches numbers and CUT TO: \n\nEXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY \nThe city's decrepid industrial section. PANNING PAST buildings we come to the facade of \"APEX ELECTRONICS,\" the only well-maintained building on the block.  \n\nA throbbing drum-beat is heard within...  \n\nINT. EAST BERLIN - APEX ELECTRONI CS - DAY \nOrganized. Spotless. You could eat off the floor. A STEREO plays GERMAN \nTECHNO-ROCK at a zillion decibals.  \n\nA COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE hangs from a hoist. BERTA FRANK (hereafter \n\"FRANKIE\u0094), late 20's, blonde spiky hair, pretty in a sort of dangerous way, is soldering a panel of transistors to the satellite.  \nA wall-mounted T.V. plays a news program.  \n\nGERMAN NEWS ANCHOR \n(German) \nIn Russia, Michael Romanov has \nbeen accused of inciting riots and \nviolence in St. Petersburg...  \n\nThe phone RINGS. Frankie grabs it.  \n\nFRANKIE \nJa.  \n\nTEMPLAR (v.o.) \nHow's the weather in Berlin, Frankie? \n\nFRANKIE \nSimon? Where are you? \n\nINTERCUT - SIMON IN REMY' S PLANE / FRANKIE IN BERLIN \n\nTEMPLAR \nUnimportant. How soon can \nyou be in St. Petersburg? \n\nFrankie looks at her wristwatch.  \n\nFRANKIE \nFive hours. What type of job? \n\nTEMPLAR \nEyes and ears. Two hundred \nthousand cash for two days work.  \n\nFRANKIE \nWho's the mark? \n\nTEMPLAR \nGregor Tretiak. His headquarters.  \nHis office in particular.  \n\nFrankie lights a cigarette. Thinks.  \n\nFRANKIE \nGregor Tretiak is not a very \nnice man, Simon. Four \nhundred thousand.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nDeal. Now listen, Frankie...  \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nINT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY \nFour hours later. Jillian sits, head bowed, unconscious. Yuri sits opposite. He is nodding off.  If only Jillian could wake up...  \nThe PILOT shouts back.  \n\nPILOT \nWe're over Helsinki.  \nYuri wakes, sits upright. Yawns.  \n\nINT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY \nRemy's peering out the window. Sees something.  \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \nSimon, there! \n\nTwo miles ahead, THE RUSSIAN JET roars past, heading east toward St.  \nPetersburg. Remy jerks the stick, banking into a right turn behind the Russian jet. Remy \nlooks at his ALTITUDE GAUGE.  \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \nThey're descending.  \n\nRemy looks at Templar; Templar nods back.  \nRemy pushes the stick; the Lear jet begins descending.  \n\nINT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY \nJillian sits, still unconscious. Or is she?  \n\nJILLIAN' S POV - THROUGH SLITTED EYES \n\nThrough the tiniest slit of eye, so as not to appear conscious, Jillian looks at Yuri, then at TWO PARACHUTES shelved above the emergency exit.  \nBACK TO SCENE - YURI stands up and stretches. He goes to the window and \nlooks out.  [Wheelchair trivia: wheelchair armrests are removable, enabling a patient to \ntransfer himself from the chair to a regular chair, or car seat, etc...] \n\nJILLIAN'S RIGHT HAND (photographed in extreme close-up under the \nblanket) pulls out the PIN securing the armrest to the wheelchair. She lifts the armrest, separating the aluminum tubing, freeing her right wrist.  \n\nINT. REMY'S LEAR JET - DAY \nThrough the windshield is the RUSSIAN GULF STREAM.  \nRemy, his headset on, turns to Templar.  \n\nREMY \nThe St. Petersburg tower wants us to circle.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nNo. Follow them down.  \n\nREMY \nWhat do we do when we land? \n\nTEMPLAR \nHaven't figured that out yet.  \n\nINT. THE RUSSIAN GULFSTREAM - DAY \nThe aircraft is tilted forward in descent.  \nThe PILOT shouts back to Yuri: \n\nPILOT \n(Russian, subtitled) \nPrepare for landing.  \n\nThe Pilot shuts the cockpit door.  \nSuddenly JILLIAN'S EYES are open; her hands are free and she's throwing off \nthe blanket and gripping the wheels.  \nShe pushes; the wheelchair bursts forward.  \nYURI gets to his feet; the wheelchair slams against his shins. Jillian WHIPS \nthe detached armrest across Yuri's head. Yuri falls backward, dazed.  \nJillian rolls to the emergency door, one hand yanking open the door, the other \ngrabbing a PARACHUTE from the shelf. Wind howls through the cabin.  \nJillian gets the parachute on. Her ankles are still bound to the footrests. To \nhell with it, she'll lose the wheelchair in mid-air. She pushes forward as -- \n\n-- YURI lunges across the floor, grabbing the wheels. JILLIAN AND THE CHAIR \nteeter on the edge of emergency door exit, half in, half out.  \nYuri clings to the chair wheels. His body jerks forward. He's sliding on his \nstomach. Jillian and the chair are pulling him out. Terror in Yuri's eyes. He \ngrabs for the door frame. His fingers slip.  \nJillian, the wheelchair, and Yuri hanging from the wheelchair, plunge from the \naircraft.  \n\nINT. REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY \n\nTemplar's bagging his computer and homing device.  \nREMY suddenly clutches his arm.  \n\nREMY \nSimon.  \n\nTemplar looks up.  \n\nTEMPLAR' S /REMY' S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD JILLIAN AND YURI fall from the aircraft.  \n\nINT . THE RUSS IAN GULFSTREAM \nThe pilot, looking down at Jillian and Yuri, clicks on his short-wave radio: \n\nPILOT \nWe have a problem.  \n\nEXT. SKIES OVER ST. PETERSBURG - DAY \nJILLIAN freefalls in the wheelchair, her ankles still bound to the chair's \nfootrests. YURI is beneath her, clutching the wheels. He tries to pull himself \nup.  \n\nJILLIAN yanks the rip-cord; a plume of silk spills out and Jillian and the chair \nSLINGSHOT UP, decelerating from 120 m.p.h. to 20 m.p.h. in two seconds.  \nYuri can't take the \"G\" force; his hands rip away from the chair. He \nplummets, SCREAMING, and 3000 feet later he will hit concrete in St.  \nPetersburg.  \n\nJillian pulls out the footrest pins (the footrests separate from the chair in the \nsame manner), freeing her ankles. The chair releases, falling away.  \n\nINT. REMY' S JET - CONTINUOUS \nTemplar turns to the cockpit storage hatches behind him.  \nHe yanks open one designated: PARACHUTES.  \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \nDon't! \n\nTWO HUGE TOUCANS fly out of the hatch.  \nThey flap around the cockpit.  \nTemplar looks askance at Remy...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nRemy...  \n\nREMY SAMARKAND \nI get ten grand for them in Paris.  \nMaybe a Russian would pay more? \n\nTemplar grabs a PARACHUTE PACK and races to the back of the plane. He \nYANKS OPEN the EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR. Cold air blasts his face.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nPut down in Helsinki \nand wait for my call! \n\nAnd Templar jumps and -- \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS \nAn autumn day in Peter the Great's city.  \nPeaceful. Normal. Pedestrians walk the streets.  \n[note: St. Petersburg is called \"Venice of the North\" because it's built atop \nmarshy islands connected by canals. There are over 400 bridges; on the \ncanals, boat traffic is often as dense as automobile traffic.] \nA WOMAN, glancing up, notices something.  \n\nWOMAN (Russian) \nLook.  \n(points skyward) \nLook! \n\nOther pedestrians stop. They, too, look up at -- \n\nA PARACHUTIST (Jillian of course) descending into the heart of the city! \nAnd down she comes, landing hard in the middle of an intersection. TAXIS \nand AUTOMOBILES swerve aside, nearly killing her. Others SCREECH to a \nstop.  \n\nJILLIAN gets to her feet, wild-eyed and frantic, tangled in cord and parachute \nsilk. She looks around at -- \n\nCROWDS OF PEDESTRIANS staring at her.  \n\nJILLIAN \nHelp me. I'm American. Police! \n\nA ST. PETERSBURG POLICE CRUISER comes through the intersection to a \nstop. A YOUNG COP, just 20, hangs up his c.b. radio and gets out. He \napproaches Jillian.  \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - PETER AND PAUL FORTRESS CITY PARK \n\nAcross the Neva River from Jillian is a city park with a HUGE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF PETER THE GREAT.  Under the statue, two OLD RUSSIAN GEEZERS are playing chess, smoking \npipes, arguing, etc.  \n\nDown TEMPLAR comes. The parachute snags on the BRONZE HORSE'S HEAD.  \nTemplar dangles 15 feet off the ground. He looks at the GEEZERS directly below. Hello there.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nSorry about this.  \n\nHe shrugs off the parachute pack and falls, landing on the chess board, \nscuttling the pieces. The Geezers fall backward on their behinds.  \nTemplar gets to his feet, gaining his bearings, looking for Jillian. He takes off running.  \n\nINT. POLICE SEDAN, DRIVING - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nJillian sits in the back seat, catching her breath. The Young Cop looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  \n\nJILLIAN \nDo you speak English? \n\nYOUNG RUSSIAN COP \nYes. Some.  \n\nJILLIAN \nThank God.  \n(takes a deep breath, composes herself) \nI'm an American scientist. Last night, in New York, a man stole something from me, then this morning I was kidnapped by my lab assistant, god this sounds like a bad novel . . . . .  \n\nSuddenly a ROCK bounces off the windshield.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat was that? \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - DAY \nThe police cruiser moves past A THRONG OF MICHAEL ROMANOV \nSUPPORTERS carrying placards and banners. They begin pelting the cruiser with rocks and bottles.  \n\nINT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY \nThe cruiser clears the Romanov supporters.  \nRocks and bottles smash on the back windshield.  \n\nYOUNG RUSSIAN COP \nThere could be revolution maybe.  \nCity very dangerous.  \n\nIN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD - TWO OTHER POLICE CRUISERS pull into the \nstreet, blocking it.  The Young Russian Cop brakes; the cruiser comes to a stop in front of the other cruisers.  \n\nAn OLDER RUSSIAN COP, followed by a PLAINCLOTHESMAN, approach the \nyoung cop's cruiser.  \n\nEXT. TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nTEMPLAR sprints across the Neva River Bridge connecting the Peter and Paul Park with downtown St. Petersburg.  \nHe suddenly stops short, seeing -- \n\nTEMPLAR' S POV - TWO BLOCKS AWAY \n\n-- JILLIAN in the cruiser, the Older Cop and the plainclothesman approaching.  \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - INTERSECTION - DAY \nThe Older Cop leans in the window.  \n\nOLDER COP \n(Russian) \nIs this her? \n\nYOUNG COP \n(Russian) \nYes sir Sergeant Ravik.  \n\nThe plainclothesman emerges from behind the Older Cop.  \nIn one shocking, effortless motion, he places a silenced handgun to the Young \nCop's head and squeezes the trigger. Blood spatters the windshield.  \nJILLIAN gasps in horror at the plainclothesman. It is...ILYA.  \nThe Older Cop opens the door, shoving the Young Cop's corpse to the \npassenger side. Ilya gets in back next to Jillian, pressing the HANDGUN into her ribs. The cruiser ROARS off into St. Petersburg traffic.  \n\nEXT. AT THE FOOT OF TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS \nTEMPLAR looks around. He sees A MOTORCYCLE STAND filled with MOTORCYCLES. Runs to it. Chooses a big, powerful, Honda street machine.  \nHe pulls out his burglar's tools; jams one in the ignition. He has it running in seconds. He throws it in gear and ROARS off.  \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nTemplar blasts through traffic on the Honda. He's on a street parallel to Jillian's.  \n\nAT AN INTERSECTION Templar looks to his right, where he can see, one block over on the parallel street -- \n\nTHE POLICE CRUISER moving through traffic.  Templar guns the motorcycle. The engine WHINES. He races ahead, \naccelerating through the gears.  AT THE NEXT INTERSECTION - TEMPLAR throws the cycle into a skidding, hair-raising turn.  He's going 'round the block to cut off the sedan.  \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - DAY \nThe police cruiser moves through the intersection.  Suddenly TEMPLAR'S MOTORCYCLE, Templar-less, veers into the path of the cruiser. The cruiser hits it head on. The motorcycle rides up the cruiser's hood and smashes through the front windshield. The cruiser careens out of control. It fishtails twice and crashes into A STREETLIGHT POLE.  \n\nINT. THE POLICE CRUISER - DAY \nUP FRONT, the Older Cop is unconscious; he's taken the full brunt of the motorcycle through the windshield.  \n\nIN THE BACK, Ilya is groggy, semi-conscious. JILLIAN is reeling also; there's a gash on her forehead.  The BACK PASSENGER DOOR jerks open. TEMPLAR lunges inside.  Ilya raises his gun but he's weak, disoriented. Templar yanks it from his hand and pistol whips him.  This has all happened so fast.  Jillian looks at Ilya then at Templar...  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat...? WHO...? \n\nAnd Templar yanks Jillian out.  \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe intersection is chaos: PEDESTRIANS running up, surrounding the police cruiser, vehicles stopping, etc.  \nTemplar, virtually dragging Jillian, plows through the crowd, passing a \nRussian Army Corporal who's just gotten out of his ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK.  \n\nRUSSIAN ARMY CORPORAL \n(Russian) \nLet me help! \n\nTEMPLAR \n(Russian) \n(pointing back at the police sedan) \nHelp them! \n\nThe Corporal runs to the smashed cruiser, and -- \n\nTEMPLAR and JILLIAN run to the Corporal's SUPPLY TRUCK.  \n\nINT. RUSSIAN ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK - DAY \nThe driver's side door opens. In comes Jillian, then Templar. Templar shoves Jillian across the front seat and gets in, behind the wheel. He floors it.  \nThey accelerate into traffic. Templar looks at Jillian. She's trembling, staring \ncatatonically straight ahead.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWho are you. Tell me who you \nare and what the hell is going on.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI was hired to steal your research, \nbut you know that by now. You left the critical \ndata off the disk.  \nWhere is it? memorized, right? \n(she doesn't answer) \nThat's a bad cut. Here.  \n\nHe hands her his HANDKERCHIEF. She swats it away.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nLook, you're in big trouble.  \nThe guy who hired me will do anything \nto get your research. Once he has it, you're a \ncorpse. Give me the missing data and I'll get \nyou out of here. You can trust me.  \n\nShe stares at him in disbelief.  \n\nJILLIAN \nTrust you? \n(chews the word) \nTrust you...? \n\nShe grabs the door handle and yanks it open. Templar grabs her arm, pulling her back. They wrestle back and forth...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nDamn it, don't be stupid...! \n\nShe picks up the CORPORAL'S STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE, sitting in a holder \non the console between them, and throws it in Templar's face.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nARGGH! \n\nTemplar recoils, blinded, releasing Jillian. He jerks the steering wheel to the side and stomps on the brakes.   JILLIAN lunges out before the supply truck fully stops. She hits the pavement running. She hurries off, blending into the crowded sidewalk.  \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS \nTemplar gets out, cursing, wiping the hot liquid from his eyes. He looks around. Runs off in Jillian's direction, abandoning the supply truck.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - LOMONOSOVA AVENUE \nTemplar, running, out of breath, rounds a corner onto Lomonosova Avenue, in the city's shopping district. It's jammed with PEDESTRIANS, SHOPPERS, MERCHANTS, etc. Templar moves through the crowd, eyes scanning left and right. There's no sign of Jillian.  \nThen he sees her.  \nJust a glimpse. 50 yards ahead. Moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the FONTANKA (the largest and most beautiful of the city's grand canals).  \n\nEXT. LOMONOSOVA AVENUE - FONTANKA CANAL BRIDGE - SUNSET \nTemplar runs over the Fontanka Canal Bridge. Nothing. He comes back the \nother way. Nothing.  \nHe stops in the middle of the bridge, exhausted, out of breath. Below him, \npassing under the bridge, all types of WATER CONVEYANCES (skiffs, barges, \ndinghies, etc) are navigating the canal.  \n\nAnd emerging from underneath the bridge, seated in the back of a WATER \nTAXI,...is Jillian.  Templar races off the bridge.  \n\nEXT. FONTANKA CANAL - EMBANKMENT PROMENADE - SUNSET \nTemplar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal. The water \ntaxi is 50 yards past the bridge.  \nJILLIAN sees him coming.  \nTEMPLAR closes the gap. 30 yards. 20 yards. Now 10. Now he's running \nalongside the taxi, staring at Jillian.  \nAnd she stares back at him, stony, expressionless.  \nThe canal is wider now, and the water taxi accelerates, pulling away from the \nslower skiffs.  \nTemplar slows to a jog. He stops, lungs heaving. The sun is setting to the \nwest.  \nThe water taxi speeds off into the setting sun, leaving Templar with this \nimage of Jillian: eyes unblinking, staring at him with pure, unadulterated \nhatred.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT \nNight is falling. Down the street from Tretiak's headquarters, A FEDERAL \nEXPRESS VAN rolls up to a traffic light.  \n\nINT. FEDERAL EXPRESS VAN - NIGHT \nFRANKIE has arrived in St. Petersburg. She sits at the wheel in a Federal \nExpress uniform. She pulls out a charge of C-4 plastique with a timer. She \nopens the van door; tosses it into a sidewalk TRASH RECEPTACLE.  \nShe accelerates through the light, now green, and takes a left into TRETIAK' S \nHEADQUARTERS, parking behind a LIMOUSINE which has just entered.  \nThe limousine's doors open. Several dark-suited men get out. One of them is \nIVAN GRACHA (the Russian mafia figure shown on the C.N.N. broadcast).  \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nA MAP OF ST. PETERSBURG AND OUTLYING REGIONS is spread out on \nTretiak's desk. Tretiak, Ilya, Zubov, and ten men are present.  \n\nILYA \nThere could be another solution.  \nThe woman is not-the only scientist \nworking in this field. Is she? \n\nTretiak turns to Zubov, who nods.  \n\nZUBOV \nNo. There are others.  \n\nTRETIAK \nGet on a plane. Leave tonight.  \n\nThe door opens. Zero, the huge bodyguard, enters.  \n\nZERO \nGracha is here.  \n\nTretiak goes immediately to his desk, pressing the \"RECORD\" BUTTON on a \nv.c.r. within. The surveillance camera in Tretiak's office begins taping the \nmeeting.  \n\nIVAN GRACHA and six bodyguards enter.  \n\nGRACHA \nThis had better be important.  \nIt's my wife's birthday.  \n\nTRETIAK \nMy apologies to your wife.  \n\nGRACHA \nAn apology from Tretiak? \nAn historic moment.  \n\nTRETIAK \n(placating) \nCome now, Ivan, why must we feud.  \n\nGRACHA \nWe feud because we hate each other.  \n\nTRETIAK \nIt is true there have been harsh \nwords between us. We are rivals. But rivalry \nis bad for business. Upon what conditions would \nyou accept a partnership? Be reasonable.  \n\nGRACHA \nFifty percent of the drug trade \nin St. Petersburg and Moscow. A third of \nprostitution and gambling.  \n\nTRETIAK \nAgreed.  \n(they shake hands) \nI need the men in your areas, Ivan, \nfor two days. Particularly Moscow \nand points South.  \n\nGRACHA \nWhy? \n\nTretiak hands TWO PHOTOGRAPHS to Gracha. One is of JILLIAN, taken \nsomewhere in Westchester, wearing her \"atomic\" jacket. The second is an \nInterpol photo taken of TEMPLAR in a cafe in Amsterdam.  \n\nTRETIAK \nTo find this woman...  \nand kill this man.  \n\nGRACHA \n(smiles) \nThis is a private matter, I take it.  \n(Tretiak smiles) \nThen you'll have them.  \n\nTRETIAK \nIlya - some wine for Ivan Gracha.  \n\nINT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NI GHT \nTWO GUARDS man the guard station, eyeing the bank of six video monitors.  \nFrankie enters with a big DELIVERY BOX.  \n\nFRANKIE (Russian) \nDelivery.  \n\nFrankie hands Guard 1 the box and hands Guard 2 a clipboard for his \nsignature. Frankie looks at the surveillance monitors and raises an eyebrow.  \n\nON TRETIAK'S OFFICE MONITOR - we see Tretiak with Ivan Gracha raising a \ntoast. In the screen's lower corner are the letters \"REC.\" The meeting is being \ntaped.  \n\nEXT. NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT.  \nTHE C-4 in the trash receptacle blows. It blows up TWO CARS and A TREE. A \nmonstrously concussive explosion.  \n\nINT. TRETIAK' S OFFI CE \nGracha drops his wine glass; it shatters on the floor. Gracha and his men \nunholster their weapons. Tretiak's men go for theirs. A tense stand-off.  \n\nGRACHA \nWhat is this, Tretiak? \n\nTRETIAK \nPut your guns down.  \n\nTretiak goes to his desk; stabs an intercom button -- \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT \nThe guards, save one, barge out the front door. The remaining guard answers \nthe intercom, leaving FRANKIE unattended by the surveillance monitors.  \nHer hand moves to THE CO-AXIAL CABLE behind the video monitors, yanking \nit. She plugs a TRANSMITTOR into the monitor, then replugs the co-axial \ncable into the transmitter. The guard turns to Frankie.  \n\nFRANKIE \nWhat was that? \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREET - NIGHT \nTEMPLAR stands in a shop doorway. He pulls out his homing device. Adjusts \nthe screen.  \n\nINSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE \n\nThe computerized screen now shows the ST. PETERSBURG CITY GRID. Two \npulses: 1) a fixed pulse (Templar) and 2) a moving pulse (Jillian) on the other \nside of town.  \nTemplar turns his collar up; walks off into the night.  \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS - NIGHT \nTEMPLAR comes down a street in a scummy part of town. A GUY in a doorway \nswigs a vodka bottle, looking dangerously at Templar. A few PROSTITUTES \npass.  \nTemplar pulls out the homing device.  \n\nINSERT - THE HOMING DEVICE - The MOVING PULSE is one block from \nTemplar, emanating from inside a huge building, the NEVSKY RAIL STATION.  \n\nBACK TO SCENE - Templar pockets the homing device and walks across the \nstreet to the train station.  \n\nINT. NEVSKY STATION - MAIN CONCOURSE - NIGHT \nAn enormous facility, 100 yards long with a vaulted ceiling and entrances at \nthe north and south ends.  \n\nTemplar-enters from the north, looking around. He walks quickly to the center \nof the station concourse.  \n\nSTATION LOUDSPEAKER (v.o.) \nNext train to Moscow boarding on platform 8.  \n\nTemplar approaches Platform 8. Passengers are boarding the next train to \nMoscow. Against the wall, a gang of ten PROSTITUTES are smoking, drinking \nvodka, laughing.  \nTemplar freezes.  \nJILLIAN is with the prostitutes. Her back's to Templar, but it's her. Same \n\"atomic\" jacket, the shoes Templar gave her, same height, same weight. ...  \n\nTemplar isn't the only one who's spotted her...  \nTWO MEN IN BLACK TRENCHCOATS, obviously Tretiak's men, are converging \nupon Jillian from the other direction. They haven't yet seen Templar...  \n\nTemplar moves off quickly, drawing his gun. As Tretiak's men move in for the \nkill.  \nTEMPLAR falls in behind them, WHIPPING the barrel of his gun over one, then \nthe other. They fall, unconscious. The PROSTITUTES, alarmed, whirl around \nand...  \n\n...It's not Jillian.  \nTemplar, thunderstruck, looks at THE PROSTITUTE'S feet. She's wearing \nJILLIAN'S SHOES and JACKET. On her wrist is JILLIAN'S WRISTWATCH.  \nTemplar turns. The TRAIN TO MOSCOW is pulling out of the station. ...  \n\nTemplar sprints away, back toward the station concourse. It's all clear now; \nJillian sold her clothes and watch and bought a ticket to Moscow.  \n\nEXT. NEVSKY STATION - NIGHT \nAUTOMOBILES are parked in front of the station. Templar picks a B.M.W. out \ncome the burglar's tools. Templar's through the door lock in two seconds. He \ngets in and shoves a tool in the ignition lock.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN B.M.W. - NIGHT \nTemplar speeds down the highway, moving in and out of traffic. His cellular \nphone chirps. He unpockets it, clicks it on.  \n\nFRANKIE \nSimon. Good news.  \n\nINT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the b.g. through a window, we see Tretiak's headquarters looming down \nthe street.  \nFrankie sits in front of six VIDEO MONITORS like those in Tretiak's \nheadquarters; they are receiving the video transmissions from Tretiak's \nsurveillance cameras. We see exteriors, Zubov's lab, corridors, etc.  \nFrankie is looking at A MONITOR OF TRETIAK'S OFFICE; Tretiak is pacing, \ntalking on the phone.  \n\nFRANKIE \nThey haven't found her and \nthey don't know where she is.  \n\nINTERCUT - FRANKIE IN HOTEL/TEMPLAR DRIVING \n\nTEMPLAR \nShe's on a train to Moscow.  \n\nFRANKIE \nThat's bad news. They're 'stopping \nevery train leaving the city.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCall you later, Frankie.  \n\nTemplar tosses the phone and jerks the wheel. The B.M.W. veers wildly \nacross three lanes of traffic, swerving off the highway down an exit ramp.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. ROAD SOUTH OF ST. PETERSBURG - NIGHT \nThe St. Petersburg city outskirts. Templar's B.M.W. rounds a corner onto a \ntwo-lane road running next to the Moscow line train tracks.  \n\nINT. TEMPLAR'S B.M.W - NIGHT \nTemplar stares ahead through the windshield.  \n\nTEMPLAR'S POV - THE TRAIN TRACKS - A half mile ahead is a street crossing.  \nWe see the blinking caboose lights of the TRAIN TO MOSCOW. It's stopped at \nan intersection in front of TWO BLACK SEDANS parked across the tracks.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - NIGHT \nJILLIAN sits alone, looking around nervously, wondering why the hell the \ntrain's stopped. Her hair is brushed over the gash on her forehead. She wears \nthe prostitute's ratty jacket and shoes.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS \nTwo of Tretiak's men enter the first passenger car, heads swiveling back and \nforth, checking every passenger's face.  \n\nEXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT \nTemplar runs up to the rear passenger car.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT \nTretiak's men come through the third car.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CARS - NIGHT \nTemplar comes the other way looking for Jillian. Through one car and into the \nnext.  \nHe sees JILLIAN. This time it is her.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CARS - NIGHT \nOn come Tretiak's men, into another car. They're one car away now...  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - JILLIAN'S CAR \nJILLIAN sits up in her seat; she looks through the connecting door into the \nnext car, which TRETIAK'S MEN are entering. She rises to flee, running into -- \n\n-- TEMPLAR. Jillian's eyes bulge. She's going to scream. Templar clamps her \nmouth and shoves her forward to the exit door which opens to the parallel \ntracks.  \nTemplar wrenches open the door and sticks his head outside, looking down \nthe tracks. We hear a TRAIN WHISTLE and RUMBLING WHEELS.  \nTemplar comes back inside. TRETIAK'S MEN are half-way through the next \ncar and approaching fast.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWe're going to jump. Okay? \n\nJillian, terrified, wide-eyed, nods. And they jump.  \n\nEXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS \nTemplar and Jillian lunge from the train onto the parallel tracks. A train \nwhistle BLARES. Jillian looks up; her face contorts with shock at -- \nA TRAIN bearing down on them at 60 m.p.h. 100 feet.  \nNow 70. 50. Jesus, it's right on top of them...  \n\nTEMPLAR grabs her hand and yanks her across the tracks with 10 feet to go.  \nThe TRAIN SCREAMS past them.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - DAY \nTRETIAK'S MEN enter the car where Jillian was. Outside, the St. Petersburg \ntrain flashes by, blocking any view of Templar and Jillian on the other side of \nthe tracks.  \nThey continue down the aisle, into the next car.  \n\nEXT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - PARALLEL TRACKS \nThe train to St. Petersburg is gone. Jillian stares at Templar with hateful eyes.  \nHe gets up and yanks her to her feet. Pulls her back toward the train to \nMoscow.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - REAR CAR - NIGHT \nA GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is having a heated conversation on a cellular \nphone. Outside, we see TRETIAK'S MEN walking toward their vehicles.  \nTemplar and Jillian enter the private berth across from the businessman. It \nhas reclining chairs and a curtain for privacy. The train BEGINS MOVING \nagain.  \nTemplar and Jillian sit, regarding each other.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou can't get rid of me.  \n\nJILLIAN \nLike a bad flu.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nPretty smart, selling the clothes and \nwatch. You were going for the U.S.  \nembassy, weren't you? \n\nJILLIAN \nPresent tense please \u0096 \nI am going.  \nBefore we discuss the present, \nlet's discuss the past.  \n\nShe stares hard, malevolently at him.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWho the hell are you. I want \nfull name, address, profession, \nand don't - don't - say Michael Quinn \nof 112 Mason Street, shoemaker.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nMy name is Simon Templar.  \nI don't have an address because I \nlive in hotels. I'm a professional thief.  \n\nJILLIAN \nGood. We're getting somewhere.  \nI'd like to respond to that.  \n\nThe German Businessman is looking at them.  \nJillian pulls the curtain shut.  \nThen she SLAPS Templar, hard, across the face.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou wicked man.  \n(slaps him again.  \nYou liar.  \n(slaps him again) \nThief.  \n\nShe draws back to slap him again.  \nHe catches her arm.  \nThey freeze this way, faces inches apart.  \nShe's trembling, her face a mask of hatred.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI hope you rot in hell.  \n\nHe lets go of her. She stands up.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhere are you going? \n\nJILLIAN \nAs far away from \nyou as I can.  \n\nTemplar pulls out his 9mm pistol.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nSit down.  \n\nJillian stares at the gun.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou're joking.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nMichael Quinn jokes. I don't.  \n\nShe glares at him. Slowly sits. Templar pulls out his cellular phone.  Punches numbers.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nRemy. Be at Moscow Airport \nat eight a.m., fueled and ready to go.  \n\nTemplar clicks off the phone and pockets it. Then he pockets the gun, its \nbarrel pointing at Jillian through his jacket. With his free hand he grabs her \narm and puts it under his arm, clamping it to his body.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWe're going to sit here and not \nmake a scene. I'd get some rest.  \nTemplar leans back, shutting his eyes.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI sleep light.  \n\nJillian, out of the corner of her eye, notices something through the curtain...  \nACROSS THE AISLE - THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN is folding up his cellular \nphone and stuffing it in his satchel briefcase on the floor. He leans back and \ncloses his eyes. The satchel briefcase sticks into the aisle.  \nClose enough for Jillian to touch...  \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nEXT. BENARES, INDIA - ESTABLISHING - MORNING \nThe exquisite, astonishing city on the Ganges River.  \n\nEXT. BENARES - UNIVERSITY OF BENARES \nA courtyard in the traditional Indian style. Zubov and two of Tretiak's men \napproach a building.  \nZubov rings the doorbell. Seconds pass. The door opens. An Indian gentleman \npeers out.  \nHe's about 50, in a madras shirt and nehru jacket. This is DR. VIJAY SINGH, \nwhose taped lecture we heard in Jillian's station wagon.  \n\nZUBOV\nDr. Singh? Dr. Vijay Singh? \n\nVIJAY SINGH \nWho are you and what do you want? \n\nZUBOV \nMy name is Vapin Zubov. I would \nlike to discuss something with...  \n\nVIJAY SINGH \n(scowls) \nCome back at a decent hour...  \n\nDr. Singh begins to shut the door. Zubov puts his hand in the door, jamming \nit.  \n\nZUBOV \nI would like to discuss cold fusion, Doctor.  \nDr. Singh's demeanor changes. Pushes open the door.  \n\nVIJAY SINGH \nCome in.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. THE TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING \nPASSENGERS are yawning, pulling up their window blinds. Sunlight streams in. A PORTER passes by. .  \n\nPORTER \nThirty minutes to Moscow, \nthirty minutes...  \n\nThe Porter moves past the German Businessman; he's asleep and snoring.  \nAcross the aisle -- \n\nJILLIAN'S EYES are darting from the German Businessman, to TEMPLAR, \nwho's looking out the window.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI need to use the ladies' room.  \nI think you can trust me to...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI don't trust anybody.  \n\nJillian gives Templar a disgusted look. She rises and moves into the aisle.  \nTernplar follows.  \n\nJILLIAN \nTell me something.  \nHow much were you paid? \n\nTEMPLAR \nIt's not your business. Move.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI think it is.  \nC'mon. Tell me.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nFifteen million dollars, \nbut it didn't work out. Did it.  \n\nThey pass a PORTER serving snacks (fruits and cheeses) from a cart. Jillian looks' at the cart.  \n\nJILLIAN \nDoes it bother you? What you do? \n\nTEMPLAR \nNo.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou have no conscience? \nNo sense of morality? \n\nTEMPLAR \nDefine morality.  \n\nJILLIAN \nIt's a commonly used and \ngenerally understood word.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nNot by me. .  \n\nThey've arrived outside the LADIES ROOM. Jillian opens the door, begins to \nenter.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWait.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou are not going in there with me.  \n\nTemplar brushes past her, leaving the door open.  \nHe steps up on the toilet, examining the WINDOW above.  \n\nJILLIAN \nOkay, how about: Do unto others \nas they would do unto you.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nHow about: Do unto others \nbefore they do unto you.  \n\nTemplar pulls up the window. It opens only five inches; it's prevented from \nrising further by TWO SAFETY SCREWS drilled through the frame.  \n\nJILLIAN \nHow about: love thy neighbor.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThe man who said that was \ncrucified by his.  \n\nSatisfied, Templar steps down and walks back to Jillian. She shakes her head, \nlaughs mirthlessly.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWere you raised by wolves? \nWho were your parents, Lucretia \nBorgia and the Marquis de Sader \n\nTEMPLAR \nThe two people in question weren't \nas nice as that. I wouldn't know.  \nI never met them. Are you through? \nIt's all yours.  \n\nShe gives him a look and shoves past him into -- \n\nTHE LADIES ROOM Jillian enters, closes the door and locks it. She stands on the toilet and examines the window. Sees the safety screws. She steps down.  \nShe turns on the sink, then kneels and pulls up her pantleg, revealing THE \nGERMAN BUSINESSMAN'S CELLULAR PHONE stuffed in her sock. She pulls it \nout.  \nShe turns the sink on full blast, creating as much noise as she can, and \npunches numbers.  \n\nJILLIAN \nInternational operator please.  \n(pause) \nThe American Embassy in Moscow, please.  \n\nJillian waits for the call to connect and CUT TO: \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - FRONT CAR - AISLES \nJillian exits the ladies' room.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou really will rot in hell, \nknow that? \n\nTEMPLAR \nGood, all my friends will be waiting for me.  \nThey move down the aisle, passing the SERVING PORTER, Jillian's hand \ndangles over the fruit and cheese cart.  \nShe plucks up a SERVING KNIFE with two fingers and slides it up her sleeve.  \n\nJILLIAN \nFriends? I thought you trusted \nno one.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI don't. Give it to me.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(innocently) \nWhat.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThe knife you just took.  \n\nJillian sighs. Pulls the serving knife out of her sleeve and hands it over. When \nshe turns back toward her berth, she doesn't like what she sees -- \n\nTHE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN has woken up. He's yawning, opening up a \nstack of business correspondence sitting on the armrest of his chair with a \nLETTER OPENER.  \nJILLIAN continues down the aisle, sweating it out. If the guy discovers that \nhis phone is missing...  \n\nEach step is a mile.  \nFinally Jillian and Templar come to their berth. The German Businessman is \nreading a letter. The letter opener is sitting on the stack of unopened letters.  \nJillian \"accidentally\" knocks the stack of letters and letter opener off the \narmrest. They fall to the floor next to the German Businessman's satchel \nbriefcase.  \nJillian quickly drops to a kneeling position and begins gathering up all the \nletters.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI'm so sorry! \n\nAs Jillian rises and hands the German Businessman his letters, we see that \u0096 \n\nTHE CELLULAR PHONE is back in the German Businessman's satchel \nbriefcase.  \nTemplar and Jillian sit down.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING \nThe train pulls into the station.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - MORNING \nThe Porter comes down the aisle, calling out: \n\nPORTER \nMoscow Station, Moscow Station! \n\nTemplar and Jillian move with the other passengers toward the exits. As they \npass the ladies' room: \n\nJILLIAN \nGive me a second, will you? \nI don't feel well.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nMake it quick.  \n\nJillian goes in the bathroom.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM \nJillian enters and stands on the toilet. Out comes the German Businessman's \nLETTER OPENER. She centers the opener in one of the screw heads, leans into \nit, and twists. She begins unscrewing it.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM \nTemplar is impatiently looking at the ladies' room door.  \nThe passengers are filing past him.  \nHe knocks on the door.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES' ROOM \nJillian's got one screw out. The other is coming. Templar KNOCKS again.  \n\nJILLIAN \nJust a second.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - AISLE OUTSIDE LADIES' ROOM \nTemplar knocks again, LOUDER. No response inside.  \nThe German Businessman passes by him...  \n\nGERMAN BUSINESSMAN \nPorter, I seem to have lost my letter opener...  \n\nTemplar stares at the guy.  \n\nINT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - LADIES ROOM \nThe door SMASHES open, splintering the lock. Templar bursts in. Something \ninstantly gets his attention.  \nThe fully opened window. And no Jillian... Templar bolts out.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING \nJillian hurries up the escalator to the main concourse. A stupendous, vaulted \ninterior. As impressive as Grand Central in New York or Victoria in London.  \nShe moves through the crowd. Eyes scanning everything and nothing. She \nbumps into A COMMUTER, who scowls.  \nJillian takes cover by one of the immense marble pillars. She pulls her collar \nup. Waits it out.  \n\nACROSS THE CONCOURSE - A MAN studies her. He's tall, blonde, looks like he \nplayed linebacker for Ohio State.  \nHe approaches. She eyes him. Everyone is a potential enemy. But this guy is \nobviously American.  \n\nBLONDE MAN \nMs. St. Thomas? Jillian? \n\nJILLIAN \nYes.  \n\nThe Blonde Man opens his wallet, flipping out his EMBASSY BADGE and C. I. A. CREDENTIALS.  \n\nWHITEHEAD \nJohn Whitehead, Special Agent, \nCentral Intelligence Agency.  \nWas your trip all right? \n\nJILLIAN \nYes it was fine, oh who cares, \nI'm finally safe...  \n(squeezes his hand) \nDo you have a car? \n\nWHITEHEAD \nYes, outside. First I'd like to ask \nyou some questions. That was an interesting \nstory you told the embassy.  \n\nJILLIAN \nInteresting? It's true.  \n\nWHITEHEAD \nPlease understand: the United States \nEmbassy receives fifty calls a day.  \nMy husband's been murdered, \nmy daughter's been sold into white slavery, \nyou get the idea. So before we waste a lot of people's \ntime, Ms. St. Thomas, you say you have p.h.d.s \nin chemistry and nuclear physics.  \nWhat's the atomic symbol for, say. ..gold? \n\nPause. Jillian stares at Whitehead.  \n\nJILLIAN \nYou've gotta be kidding me...  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING \nTemplar dashes across the platform, looking everywhere. Jillian has vanished.  \nSuddenly his cellular phone chirps. He unpockets it and clicks it on.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nTalk to me, Frankie.  \n\nINT. ST. PETERSBURG - FRANKIE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING \nFRANKIE, red-eyed and drinking coffee, is staring at the video transmission \nfrom Tretiak's office. Tretiak and Ilya are talking. .  \n\nINTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO (as deemed necessary) \n\nFRANKIE \nShe called the U.S. Embassy a \nhalf hour ago.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhat? \n(considers this) \nDoes Tretiak know? \n\nFRANKIE \nSimon, the U.S. Embassy has more leaks \nthan a Polish submarine. Who do you \nthink intercepted the call? \n\nAs FRANKIE says that, she doubletakes at the monitor showing Tretiak's \noffice. Frankie's eyes widen.  \n\nON THE VIDEO MONITOR - A THIRD MAN has entered the room.  \nIt is the crusading reformer, MICHAEL ROMANOV.  \nFrankie stabs a button on a tape recorder next to her monitors. It begins \ntaping the transmission from Tretiak's office.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThanks, Frankie.  \n\nFRANKIE \nSimon, wait. . . .  \nCLICK.  \n\nFrankie turns some dials, bringing into ZOOM FOCUS Tretiak and Romanov.  \nShe ups the volume. We hear this: \n\nTRETIAK \nHail Michael Romanov, Czar of the \nFatherland. How will that sound \nto the average Russian? \n\nFRANKIE \n(a whisper) \nI don't believe it...  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - ESCALATOR - DAY \nTEMPLAR runs up the escalator, plowing through the disembarking \npassengers, taking two stairs at a time.  \n\nINT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION, MAIN CONCOURSE - MORNING \nTemplar comes off the escalator. The place is packed with COMMUTERS. He \nmoves off, eyes darting in all directions for Jillian, while meanwhile \u0096 \n\nACROSS THE CONCOURSE, BY THE PILLAR - CONTINUOUS \n\nJILLIAN \n. ..Cd, that's big \"C\" little \"d,\" \ncadmium's valence is 2, its atomic number \nis 48 and its atomic weight is 112.411 or \nwould you like that carried out five more decimal \nplaces? Good enough? \n\nWHITEHEAD \n(smiles) \nGood enough. Come this way, \nMs. St. Thomas.  \nHe ushers her off.  \n\nAs they move from behind the pillar, 50 yards away -- \n\nACROSS THE CONCOURSE - TEMPLAR sees Jillian and Whitehead. He looks around, thinking.  He sprints for the side exit.  \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - MAIN ENTRANCE/EXIT - DAY \nThe circular drive where travelers are picked up and deposited by taxis, \nbuses, automobiles.  \nJillian and Whitehead exit the station.  \nAHEAD - TWO MERCEDES SEDANS are waiting. Several darksuited MEN stand \nnext to an open back door.  \n\nJILLIAN \n(shakes her head) \nWhat a nightmare.. To think my \nwork could just be taken from me...  \n\nWHITEHEAD \nYou're safe now, Doctor St. Thomas.  \nWe'll have you back in New York in no time.  \nThey continue toward the parked Mercedes.  \n\nSuddenly Jillian blinks. She sees something.  \nIt's TEMPLAR, driving a Russian sedan. He rolls to a stop across the circular \ndrive, staring a hole right through Jillian, grimly shaking his head at her, \ntrying to warn her...  \n\nJILLIAN \nAgent Whitehead...  \n\nWhitehead looks at Jillian.  \n\nPause. Jillian eyes Templar across the drive.  \n\nAGENT WHITEHEAD \nYes? \n\nJillian looks at the men waiting by the Mercedes. She looks at two Moscow \npolice officers standing to the side. Something's wrong. Something doesn't \nfeel right.  \n\nAGENT WHITEHEAD \nMs. St. Thomas? \nYou had a question? \n\nThey're drawing closer to the waiting Mercedes...  \n\nJILLIAN \nNothing, I was just thinking that \nwhen my research was stolen I felt like \nthe Buffalo Bills after they lost four World Series.  \n\nWHITEHEAD \nHah hah, I bet you did. I'm a baseball \nfan too hah hah...  \n\nJillian looks at him differently.  \n\nThe Buffalo Bills lost four Super Bowls, Whitehead.  \nThey continue toward the waiting sedans.  \n\nJILLIAN'S EYES dart around. Her forehead is sweaty.  \nAnd she bolts from him, taking Whitehead by surprise.  \nJILLIAN sprints across the circular drive for Templar's car, Whitehead after \nher. The men by the waiting Mercedes converge on Jillian from the side.  \nTEMPLAR throws open the passenger side door for Jillian.  \nThe men coming from the Mercedes open fire on Templar, blowing in the \nsedan's side window. Templar ducks.  \nJILLIAN'S almost there...  \nShe reaches the open sedan and dives inside.  \nShe tries to shut the door; WHITEHEAD gets hold of it.  \nJILLIAN SCREAMS at Templar.  \n\nJILLIAN \nGo! \n\nTemplar floors it. The car SQUEALS away from the curb. Whitehead runs \nalongside, trying to get the door open.  \nThe car accelerates. Whitehead sprints but can't keep up. His feet leave the \nground; he clings to the doorframe through the blown-out window.  \nWhitehead pulls his gun from his shoulder holster and aims across Jillian's \nbody at Templar. His finger \nsqueezes the trigger as Jillian shoves his hand up.  \nBULLETS blow holes in the roof of the car.  \n\nJILLIAN hits Whitehead, hard, in the head.  \nWhitehead's head snaps back. She hits him again.  \nWhitehead falls away from the car.  \nHe rolls twenty feet and stops, dazed but alive.  \n\nINT. TEMPLAR' S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY \nTemplar guns the sedan through a RED LIGHT. Cars to the left and right \nSCREECH to a stop. The sedan flies on...  \n\nJILLIAN \nTAKE ME TO THE EMBASSY.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWe're going to the airport.  \n\nTemplar guns the accelerator.  \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - GORKY STATION - CIRCULAR DRIVE - DAY \nThe TWO MERCEDES pull up to Whitehead, who staggers to his feet. He gets \nin the lead Mercedes; the two cars race off after Templar and Jillian.  \n\nINT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY \nTemplar floors it through another intersection. he looks in his rear view \nmirror. There's no sign of the two Mercedes. They've escaped.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nGood.  \n\nJILLIAN \nIs it? Who's worse \u0096 \nthem or you? \n\nTemplar looks down and registers shock -- \n\n- - IN THE INTERSECTION AHEAD, A BLIND MAN with a walking stick is tap \ntapping across the intersection.  \nJillian cringes, expecting the worst. Templar throws the steering wheel and -- \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY \n-- The sedan swerves, clearing the BLIND MAN by two inches, skidding wildly \nthrough the intersection.  \n\nINT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY \nTemplar fights the wheel but he's losing...  \n\nThe skid can't be corrected. Jillian SCREAMS.  \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY \nThe sedan slides sideways, hits the curb and flips over, spinning like a top \nacross the sidewalk.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. WHITEHEAD'S MERCEDES - DAY \nThe Mercedes moves through traffic. Whitehead and the other men look \naround. The Mercedes rounds a corner.  \nAcross the intersection is the OVERTURNED SEDAN on the sidewalk, \nsurrounded by gawking PEDESTRIANS.  \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION \nThe Mercedes pulls up. Whitehead and his men get out. They warily approach \nthe sedan, drawing guns. The pedestrians back off, getting the hell out of the \nway.  \n\nWhitehead and his men surround the car. They kneel, guns trained \ninside...Templar and Jillian are gone.  \nWhitehead barks at his men.  \n\nWHITEHEAD \nFifteen block radius.  \nGo house to house.  \n\nWhitehead looks around at the surrounding buildings. We FOCUS on one of \nthem, a RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH several blocks away, under scaffolding \nand mesh wire, in the process of renovation. CAMERA pushes in on the \nchurch's HUGE ONION SHAPED TURRET. . . . .  \n\nINT. MOSCOW - RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH \n\u0085 and we're in the turret's interior: round, with stained glass windows, a desk \nand chair. A trap door leading to the vestibule below BANGS OPEN.  \n\nJILLIAN comes up, followed by Templar, his gun in hand.  \nThey're cut and bruised, exhausted.  \nJillian slumps against the wall, shivering.  \nTemplar puts his equipment on the desk and goes to each of the windows.  \nFrom this elevation he can see the entire city.  \n\nTEMPLAR'S FIRST POV - RED SQUARE, a mile across town, where a thousand \nMuscovites are listening to a pro Michael Romanov speech.  \n\nShifting from Red Square to the city outskirts, we see MOSCOW \nINTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, where Remy waits.  \n\nTEMPLAR'S SECOND POV - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY is just a few blocks \naway - we see the American flag flying from the roof stanchion.  \nIn the intersections around the embassy, Tretiak's men stand by their \nvehicles, watching. Every point of access to the embassy is sealed.  \nWe see WHITEHEAD. A Mercedes pulls up to him. ILYA gets out.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThe embassy's surrounded.  \n\nBACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN \nis staring at Templar's computer. The modem is engaging. JILLIAN sits up, \nstaring at the screen.  \nJillian reads an ELECTRONIC MESSAGE which appears: \nBEAR CONTACTING LION.  \nGIVE HER TO ME.  \nIN RETURN, 20 MILLION AND SAFE PASSAGE.  \nIF YOU REFUSE YOU WILL DIE.  \n\nJillian's eyes grow wide with terror.  \nTemplar looks out a third window.  \n\nTEMPLAR'S THIRD POV - Tretiak's men are going building to building in a \nfifteen block radius sweep, closing in on the church.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThe airport's out. They're drawing a \nnoose around us. We don't have much time.  \n\nTEMPLAR turns away from the window.  He sees Jillian looking at his computer.  He walks over to it and reads the message.  Jillian gets slowly to her feet, watching Templar.  JILLIAN's mouth quivers as Templar types: LION CONSIDERING OFFER.  Templar looks at Jillian. She stares back. A long moment. Neither moves.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat are you going to do? Tell me.  I deserve at least that.  \n(desperate now) \nI'll die. If you take their offer, they'll kill me.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nAnd if I don't, they'll kill me.  \nInteresting situation I'd say.  \n\nJillian sinks to the chair, her voice shaking.  \n\nJILLIAN \nOh god. It's over, it's all over...  You're not human. You're an animal.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nI'm a businessman. I perform services for profit. And spare me the lecture. You didn't spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich. Richer than anyone on earth. Richer than God.  \n(beat) \nI'll make you an offer - pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about one month's. . .\n\nPause. She slowly looks up at him.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI don't hold the patent rights to cold fusion.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhat? \n\nJILLIAN \nYou fool. Don't you understand? \n(her voice cracks; she begins to softly cry) \nIt wasn't about money, it wasn't about becoming rich...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nIf you don't own the patent rights, who does? \n\nJILLIAN \nA foundation in my name. The royalties \nwere going to go to scientific research, \ncuring cancer, .. .christ how can you understand this...  \n\nShe lowers her head, weeping openly.  \n\nCAMERA PUSHES in on Templar, staring at her. Even the darkest of men have a seed of goodness. Here, for the first time, does it flower in Simon Templar.  \n\nBut we don't know this. Templar betrays nothing.  \nHe picks up his homing device and clicks it on.  \nHe types in this command: MOSCOW.  \nThe device beeps; THE MOSCOW STREET GRID appears.  \nHe types a new command: SUBTERRANEAN DATA.  \nMoscow's SUBTERRANEAN GRID appears superimposed over the street grid; \nwe see the guts of the city; the Moscow subway, water and gas mains, etc. In a corner of the screen is a TABLE OF SCHEDULES.  \nTemplar analyzes the information on the screen.  \n\nHe quickly rises; goes to Jillian, pulling off his belt.  \nHe pulls her up. She stands limply, still weeping, no longer resisting. He's \nbigger and stronger, there's no use. Templar gathers Jillian's wrists together \nand ties them with the belt.  \nHe pulls her to the trapdoor and CUT TO: \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - SIDEWALK \nSeveral pedestrians walk by. Templar walks Jillian quickly to a MANHOLE \nCOVER. He kneels and hoists the cover off. He points into the hole.  \nJillian, her wrists bound, steps down uneasily, her feet finding the top rung of \na STEEL LADDER. She descends into the manhole. Templar follows.  \n\nINT. MOSCOW - SUBTERRANEAN SEWER SYSTEM - DAY \nJillian and Templar come down the ladder, dropping to the steel-gridded \nwalkway over the Moscow sewer.  \nTemplar pulls Jillian twenty feet down the walkway.  \nAt this point in the wall there is a HATCH with a compression HATCHWHEEL, \nthe turning of which opens the hatch, like on a submarine.  \nWithin the hatch we hear RUSHING WATER.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThat's a municipal water main.  \nIn one hour you're going in there.  \n\nTemplar pulls out a SWITCHBLADE. Clicks it on.  \nJillian, shivering with terror, stares at the blade...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nListen. They shut it down twice a \nday for five minutes to clean the filters.  \nOnce at noon, once at midnight. Noon is in one hour.  \n\nJILLIAN \nHow do you know all this? \n\nTEMPLAR \nPart of my job. Now ask the logical question...  \n\nJILLIAN \n.. . where does it go? \n\nTEMPLAR \nVery good. Under the United States Embassy.  \nThere's an exit hatch into the embassy \ncourtyard. That's where we're going.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWe...? \n\nTemplar lowers his gun. He lowers the blade to her wrists and cuts the belt.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou heard me.  \n\nA long pause. They stare at each other.  \n\nJILLIAN \nThen what happens? \n\nTEMPLAR \nLet's get to the embassy, \nthen we'll talk about it.  \n\nJILLIAN \nTemplar - about that night at my house\u0085 \n\nTEMPLAR \nDon't talk about it, okay? \n\nHe turns away from her. She watches him.  \n\nJILLIAN \nOkay.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - RED SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - DAY \nThe Michael Romanov supporters are marching past the Kremlin with \nPLACARDS BEARING ROMANOV'S FACE, chanting: \nKARPOV MUST GO! Ahead, awaiting them, are -- \n\nTwo units of MOSCOW POLICE in riot gear. A POLICE SERGEANT clicks on a \nmegaphone.  \n\nMOSCOW POLICE SERGEANT\nDisperse. Disperse! \n\nOn come the Romanov supporters. Rocks start flying. The Romanov \nsupporters push into the line of police. The police push back with shields and truncheons.  A melee breaks out. The Romanov supporters surge past the police. It is a wild, uncontrolled, chaotic scene.  \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - DAY \nROMANOV SUPPORTERS flood past the embassy gates, chased by Moscow \nPolicemen. Fights rage allover the street. A full-fledged riot is breaking out.  OVERTURNED CARS are burning. LOOTERS run through the streets with stolen goods. We hear the sporadic CRACKLE of small arms fire.  \n\nIN THE U. S. EMBASSY COURTYARD \nA U. S. MARINE and ARMY GREEN BERET detachment, grimfaced and heavily \narmed, stand silent vigil inside the embassy's wrought-iron gates.  \nCOLONEL WILLIAM CROSBY, embassy c.o., exits the embassy and \napproaches the front gates. A FULL BEER BOTTLE smashes at his feet, \nshowering him.  \n\nCOLONEL CROSBY \nJesus H. Christ.  \n\nACROSS THE STREET FROM THE U. S. EMBASSY \nIlya and his men stand next to their vehicles, silently watching the embassy.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. MOSCOW SEWER SYSTEM - DAY \nThe WHOOSHING water in the municipal water main begins to subside. Templar looks at this watch.  \n\nINSERT - TEMPLAR'S WRISTWATCH - it is exactly 12 noon.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nRight on time.  \n\nThe water subsides to a trickle. Templar grips the hatchwheel and turns it.  Opens the hatch. Residual water spills out onto the walkway.  Templar pulls himself into the water main. He extends his hand to Jillian.  Jillian looks uncertainly inside.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nFour blocks. Right under Tretiak's men \nand up into the embassy compound. You can do this.  \nShe grabs Templar's hand. He pulls her up and inside -- \n\nINT. MOSCOW - MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - DAY \n-- a four foot diamater pipe. Templar pulls out a PENLIGHT, switches it on and \nsticks it between his teeth. On hands and kneess Templar and Jillian move off \nthrough the water main.  \n\nINT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET \nTemplar and Jillian crawl up. Templar shines his penlight at the ceiling; AN \nEXIT HATCH WITH HATCHWHEEL is above them.  \n\nJILLIAN \nIt doesn't seem like we've gone far enough.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWe haven't, up there's the street in \nfront of the embassy.  \n(looks at his wristwatch) \nCome on. We've got two minutes.  \n\nThey crawl off through the water main.  \n\nINT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN UNDER EMBASSY \nTemplar and Jillian crawl toward A SECOND EXIT HATCH.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThere it is.  \n\nThey reach the exit hatch. They look at it.  Jillian trembles.  \n\nJILLIAN \nOh my god...  \n\nThe EXIT HATCH has no hatchwheel. It's sealed.  \nJillian, panicked, looks down the water main.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWe. ...we've got to go back.  \n\nTEMPLAR \n(checks his watch) \nNot enough time.  \n(thinks) \nThe hatch under the street.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat about Tretiak's men \u0085 \n\nTEMPLAR \nBetter than drowning.  \n\nThey scramble off.  We hear WHOOSHING WATER coming down the pipe.  \n\nJILLIAN \nThe water's back on! \n\nBack they go, crawling as fast as they can.  \n\nINT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET \nTemplar and Jillian reach the exit hatch under the street. Templar grips the \nhatchwheel as -- \n\nTHE WATER ROARS through the pipe, hitting Jillian flush, blowing her \nbackward; she desperately clings to Templar's shoulders as he spins the \nhatchwheel.  The water rises mercilessly. There's a foot of air, then six inches, then just three, then none at all, and they're under water...  TEMPLAR desperately turns the hatchwheel, spinning it one last time and WHOOOSH, the hatch door blows open \u0096 \n\nINT. MOSCOW - MANHOLE BELOW THE STREET \n- - and SMASHES against A ONE FOOT DIAMETER PIPE running along the wall \nof the service manhole, CRACKING a fissure in it. PRESSURIZED GAS blows \nout of the pipe. TEMPLAR pulls himself up. He reaches down and pulls Jillian up. Templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel shut.  \nJILLIAN looks at the GAS spewing from the cracked pipe.  \nShe sniffs the air. Templar looks at the pipe. A warning is printed in five \nlanguages: GAS - DANGEROUS.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCity gas line.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWe can't stay here, \nwe'll asphyxiate.  \n\nTemplar and Jillian clamber up the steel runged ladder to the manhole cover.  \nTemplar pushes up the manhole cover, popping his head out, looking around.  HIS EYES widen with alarm --- \n\nA POLICE VAN is rolling straight for his head. He ducks and closes the \nmanhole cover as the VAN RUMBLES over it.  \nTemplar listens. Above, the van has stopped.  \nTemplar pushes up the manhole cover. The VAN has stopped directly over the \nmanhole.  \n\nEXT. MOSCOW - STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY \nTemplar slithers out. Pulls up Jillian. They're under the van now.  \nThe van's rear door opens; TEN MEN jump down to the pavement. We see \ntheir BLACK BOOTS; they are MOSCOW POLICE, arriving to arrest the looters.  \nTemplar and Jillian crawl toward the van's rear.  \nTemplar looks toward THE U.S. EMBASSY. It's 100 yards away, but looks like \n100 miles.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nBoth of us will never make it.  \nBut one of us can.  \n(draws his gun) \nGive me ten seconds, then \nbreak for the embassy and \ndon't stop running until you're \nat the gates. It's a hundred yards, \nso move it.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWhat are you going to...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThat's my business.  \n\nJILLIAN \nWait...  \n(he stops) \n.. .Simon. Don't do this.  \nThey'll kill you.  \n\nA long, tense pause.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThe world can do without Simon \nTemplar. It can't do without you.  \n(smiles grimly) \nSee you around sometime.  \n\nHe takes a deep breath and logrolls out.  ABOVE THE VAN - TEMPLAR gets to his feet in the street, gun drawn. He \nraces from the van, heading in a direction away from the embassy.  \nACROSS THE STREET - ILYA double takes, seeing Templar sprinting from the \nvan.  \n\nILYA \nKill him! \n\nIlya, Whitehead and Tretiak's men sprint down the street after Templar, firing \nas they run, leaving -- \n\nJILLIAN UNDER THE VAN with a clear path to the embassy. She counts it off:  three. . . . four. . . . five . . . . .  \n\nTEMPLAR dives behind an OVERTURNED CAR and comes up firing on Tretiak's \nmen.  \n\nIN THE U. S. EMBASSY'S FRONT COURTYARD \nColonel Crosby watches the situation unfold.  \n\nCOLONEL CROSBY \nWhat the hell is going on.  \n\nIN THE STREET - ILYA, WHITEHEAD and the other men close in on Templar, \nlaying down a withering fusillade of fire. Templar returns fire from behind the \ncar.  \n\nUNDER THE VAN - JILLIAN \n\nJILLIAN \n. . . nine. . . . TEN. . . .  \n\nJillian logrolls out from under the van.  \nShe sprints for the embassy gates.  \nBEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR \nsees Jillian running for the embassy. As he returns fire, he exhorts her under \nhis breath.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nGo. Faster.. . .  \n\nILYA, firing on Templar, sees Jillian. He spins, running in a new direction. He's \ngoing to get Jillian before she can reach the embassy.  JILLIAN, sprinting, screams to the embassy marines.  \n\nJILLIAN \nOpen the gate! \n\nIN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - COLONEL CROSBY turns to his second in command, a Lieutenant JONES.  \n\nCOLONEL CROSBY \nDo it.  \n\nLieutenant Jones and a MARINE PRIVATE push open the embassy gates.  \nCOLONEL CROSBY watches Jillian helplessly. There's nothing he can do. Not until she reaches the embassy.  On Jillian comes, legs pumping, feet pounding the pavement. ILYA is right behind her.  She can feel his breath he's so close. Twenty yards. Fifteen yards. Ten...  \n\nBEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR dodges bullets, corning thick and heavy now, and watches in terror as --- \n\nILYA, with a desperate reach, collars Jillian. She shrugs off her jacket, leaving Ilya with the jacket but no Jillian. Jillian lunges through the embassy gates...  \n\n... and is instantly surrounded by U.S. Marines. Jillian looks up at Colonel Crosby, panting.  \n\nJILLIAN \nI'm an American citizen.  \n\nCOLONEL CROSBY \nYou have our full protection ma'am.  \n(looks at Ilya) \nBack away from the gate.  \n\nIlya's black eyes stare at Colonel Crosby. He backs away from the gate. He turns and sees \u0096 \n\nAT THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR, out of bullets with his hands raised, \nsurrounded by Tretiak's men behind the overturned automobile.  Ilya, fuming, walks across the street to Templar.  AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - ILYA walks up to Templar. With the calm efficiency of a hangman, Ilya puts his hand on Templar's shoulder and forces him down, down to his knees. He sticks his gun to Templar's head.  \n\nHe's going to execute Templar right there, behind the overturned car in the street.  \n\nIN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - JILLIAN, watching, frantically turns to Colonel Crosby.  \n\nJILLIAN \nDo something! \n\nCOLONEL CROSBY \nThat's Russian soil out there, ma'am.  \n\nJillian turns away, horrified, shielding her eyes.  \n\nBY THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR AND ILYA \n\nTEMPLAR (Russian) \nWait. A cigarette. It's customary.  \n\nIlya looks at Templar. Looks at his men.  \nAnd Ilya laughs. Chuckling at first, then open-mouthed.  \nAll of TRETIAK'S MEN laugh in Templar's face.  \nIlya takes out a cigarette. Hands it to Templar.  \nLights it for him.  \n\nTEMPLAR (Russian) \nThank-you.  \n\nAnd Ilya and Tretiak's men continue to laugh.  \n\nThey won't be for long...  \nBecause Templar is looking at A GRATE above the municipal lines below. And \nTRETIAK'S MEN are sniffing the air, wondering why it smells like rotten \neggs...  \nTemplar flicks the cigarette into the grate and dives away as -- \n\nTHE ENTIRE STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY blows sky high as THE \nGAS MAIN ignites .  \nIlya, Whitehead, and the other men are blown off their feet. Some are killed.  \nAsphalt and dirt rain down, followed by -- \n\nWATER, as the municipal water main goes up.  \nIlya and Whitehead get to their feet, looking around, water falling like a \nmonsoon.  \nTemplar is gone.  \nAnd the police van is SPEEDING away.  \n\nINT. POLICE VAN - DAY \n\nTemplar guns the van through Moscow streets. He pulls out his cellular \nphone. Punches numbers.  \n\nEXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY \nRemy stands by his jet, smoking a cigar, looking impatiently at his watch. His \ncellular phone beeps.  \n\nREMY \nSimon, where the hell are you...  \nYou want me to do what? \n\nRemy clicks off the phone and scrambles up into the cockpit of the Lear.  \n\nINT. POLICE VAN - DAY \nTemplar guns the van straight for -- \n\nA group of TRETIAK'S MEN conducting the building-to building search. They \npull two sedans into the intersection, blocking it.  \n\nINT.

REMY' S LEAR JET - DAY \nRemy's Lear jet skirts Moscow rooftops, just 200 feet off the ground. As the jet clears the KREMLIN roof, we see majestic Red Square spreading before \nus...  \n\nEXT. RED SQUARE - DAY \nTEMPLAR'S POLICE VAN roars into Red Square as -- \n\nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY'S LEAR JET touches down. In \nRed Square. It taxis to a stop next to Lenin's tomb.  \nThe police van SCREECHS up next to the Lear. Templar races from the van to \nthe jet, dodging BULLETS fired from -- \n\nTRETIAK'S MEN, firing from sedans entering the square.  \nThe Lear jet accelerates straight for the oncoming sedans, lifting off, almost \nscraping the landing gear against their windshields. It wings into the air, \nclearing the top of the Ivan Memorial by a foot.  \nAnd heads west. To freedom.  \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nEXT. ST.

If tomorrow morning the sky falls, have clouds for breakfast.  If the birds forget their songs, listen to the wind. And if between right and wrong, do what is right.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWho said that? \n\nJILLIAN \n(smiles privately) \nMy grandmother.  \n\nTemplar gently takes her face in his hands.

It looks like a N.A.S.A. control \nroom.  \nThe Secret Servicemen lead Romanov across the room to -- \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY \nAn office, relatively comfortable, with a computer, a television and v.c.r., and \na small satellite link.  \nVICTOR KARPOV, the popularly elected President of Russia, rises. Karpov is \n55, intelligent, with a calm, professional demeanor.  \n\nROMANOV \nA nuclear bunker, Mr. President? \nYou must worry for your safety.  \n\nKARPOV \nI have reason to.  \n\nROMANOV \nYes. You do.  \n\nThey glare at each other.  \n\nKARPOV \nYou understand my policy \non taping meetings.  \n\nRomanov consents with a wave of his hand. Karpov motions to his ATTACHE, \nwho flips the switch on a VIDEO CAMERA mounted in the wall.  \n\nKARPOV \nI'll get to the point.  \nYour remarks are irresponsible; \nthey've caused civil unrest. Unless \nyou appeal to your supporters \nto stop rioting, I will institute martial law.  \n(beat) \nTell me what you want.  \n\nROMANOV \nA public debate, then new \nelections. We'll let the \npeople decide.  \n\nKARPOV \n(considers this) \nAgreed.  \n\nThey shake hands.  \nRomanov rises and exits.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nA HAND reaching for a SHOTGLASS. The hand shakes so badly.. .it has to set \nthe glass down. WIDEN TO -- \n\nINT. MANHATTAN - LOWER EAST SIDE BAR - DAY \n-- TEMPLAR, drunk at noon in a wretched little dive on Avenue A. His face is \ndrawn and pale. Haunted. Hasn't slept or shaved for days. His fingernails are \ndirty.  \n\nTWO DARK-SUITED MEN enter. One pauses by the entrance, the other goes \nto the bar. He sets a FOLDER on the bartop and slides it to Templar.  \nThe two men exit.  \nTemplar opens the folder. Inside is a plane ticket. A plane ticket to St. Petersburg...  \n\nDISSOLVE TO: \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE - DAY \nTretiak sits behind his desk. The room is dark.  \n\nTRETIAK \nThe woman's death \nwas unfortunate.  \nYou lost. I lost. To think \nwhat we could have done \nwith her formula.  \nBut life goes on, no? \n\nTEMPLAR sits opposite Tretiak, staring at him. He is shaved and rested, his \neyes utterly alert.  \n\nTRETIAK \nWhen Romanov gains the \npresidency Russia will be ours.  \nThe possibilities are, you would \nagree, endless.  \n(beat) \nYou have talent. Unique talent.  \nI need that talent to break into an \nimpregnable facility. Be part of \nthis, Templar.  \n\nTEMPLAR \n(considers this) \nFifteen million, plus the fifteen \nyou owe me.  \n\nTRETIAK \nI owe you nothing.  \nYou were hired to steal \nsomething and you failed.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThirty million, \nand I use my own men.  \n\nTRETIAK \nTwenty million, and one \nof my men goes with you.  \n\nTemplar nods in agreement. Rises. Goes to the door.  \n\nTRETIAK \nTemplar. A question.  \n(Templar turns) \nYou had feelings for \nthe woman, didn't you? \n\nTEMPLAR \nI don't have feelings, Tretiak.  \n\nTemplar, his face hard, cold, expressionless, exits.  \n\nTretiak watches him.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - OFFICE - DAY \nA hotel in the heart of the city. We hear sounds of demonstrations and rioting \nin the street below.  \nTemplar sits at a table with Harry Winston, Remy Samarkand, and Frankie.  \nARCHITECTURAL PLANS and PHOTOGRAPHS of the Admiralty's Nuclear \nSituation Facility are spread amongst room service trays.  \nILYA, and the massive ZERO sit on the couch, listening.  \nIlya eyes Templar. Templar periodically meets Ilya's eyes. These exchanged \nglances are rife with hostility.  \nThey've been at this a while and everyone's frustrated.  \n\nFRANKIE \nNo, no, no, Karpov's office \nis in the nuclear operations \nroom. The entry hatch \ncan't be activated from \nabove - only below.  \n\nREMY \nIt's lead-lined and reinforced \nwith eight feet of concrete.  \nExplosives and drills are out.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nElectronic by-pass? \n\nFRANKIE \nNegative. Understand something, \nSimon, please: this is not a bank.  \nThis is the former Soviet Union's \nmissile command.  \nForced entry is impossible.  \n\nA long pause. Everyone looks at each other.  \nTemplar examines A PHOTOGRAPH of the facility.  \nHe fixates on it. He sees something.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nWhat's that? \n\nTemplar points at the SMALL DETECTION UNIT next to the Nuclear Operations \nentrance hatch.  \nFrankie looks at the photograph, then picks up a set of blueprints. Starts \nflipping through...  \n\nFRANKIE \nUhhm.. .that is the facility's...  \n(comes to the relevant page and reads:) \n... radiation detector.  \nIn the event of nuclear \nfall-out it automatically closes \nthe hatch.  \n\nEveryone turns to Templar.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nYou're saying the system can think.  \n\nFRANKIE \nYes.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nThen it can be lied to.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV'S LAB - DAY \nRomanov and Tretiak stand on one side of the lab.  \nACROSS THE LAB, ZUBOV and DR. SINGH are huddled over a hydrogen tank, \njust like the one we saw in Jillian's lab. The tank is surrounded by hundreds of \ntesttubes and beakers containing chemicals.  \n\nTRETIAK \nThe world will continue to spend half \nits gross national product on oil.  \n\nROMANOV \nAnd Russia will spend none. Within five years we will be the \nwealthiest nation on earth.  \n\nTRETIAK \nAnd it's leaders, Romanov, \nthe most powerful people.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. ST. PETERSBURG - ADMIRALTY - NIGHT \nThe situation in the city has worsened.  \nThe ROMANOV SUPPORTERS outside the admiralty now number several \nthousand. They carry pro-Romanov banners and shout: DOWN WITH \nKARPOV! In the b.g., we see more rioting. Gunfire crackling. An overturned \ntruck.  \n\nA MILITARY AMBULANCE careens around the corner and rolls past the \nRomanov supporters up to the Admiralty gates.  \nTWO RUSSIAN NAVY M.P.'s open the gates. The ambulance pulls inside. The \ndriver's window rolls down. It's Harry Winston dressed as a RUSSIAN ARMY \nPARAMEDIC.  \n\nHARRY WINSTON (Russian) \nTwo soldiers shot by looters! \n\nThe M.P. waves the ambulance through. Harry waves back.  \nThe ambulance pulls into the Admiralty compound, going past to the rear, to \nthe NAVAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD.  \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL \nThe ambulance pulls up next to the emergency ward.  \nThe back door opens. Remy, dressed as a PARAMEDIC, gets out. Remy and \nHarry haul out two heavily bandaged RUSSIAN SOLDIERS on stretchers.  \nThe stretchers expand into rolling gurneys. Harry and Remy roll the wounded \nsoldiers inside.  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL \nHarry and Remy roll the gurneys through the emergency ward. NAVAL \nDOCTORS and NURSES are scrambling around, attending to WOUNDED \nSOLDIERS. The scene is frenetic.  \nThe gurneys roll past the operating rooms, through double doors, into a \nroom. No one notices.  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM \nA room stocked with hospital supplies. The wounded \"soldiers\" spring off the \ngurneys. They are TEMPLAR and ILYA. Ilya wears the uniform of a NAVAL \nM.P. Templar wears a bulky, lead-lined anti-radiation suit.  \nTemplar shoulders his backpack.  \nHarry Winston stands on a counter, pushing up the CEILING TILE. Templar \nand Ilya climb atop the counter.  \nHarry forms a stirrup with his hands and hoists Templar, then Ilya, through \nthe hole in the ceiling.  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - VENTILATION DUCTS - NIGHT \nTemplar and Ilya crawl through the ventilation duct to a WIRE MESH \nOPENING.  \nTemplar rips off the wire mesh screen.  Thirty feet below, in the recessed entrance to the nuclear situation facility, \nTWO NAVAL GUARDS are walking their shift. They walk around the corner. . . \n\nTEMPLAR \nWe've got sixty seconds. Move.  \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - SIDE OF BUILDING \nTemplar crawls out of the ventilation duct, his feet finding a windowsill. Just \nthree inches to stand on.  \nIlya crawls out, his feet finding the same windowsill.  \nThe two men are side-by-side.  \nThey begin inching across the sill to a STEEL-RUNGED ladder leading to the \nconcrete floor below.  \nIlya's FOOT suddenly slips. His arms flail. He tries to keep his balance, but \nfails.  \nTemplar catches Ilya's wrist.  \nA terrifying tableau: Ilya, hanging over the concrete floor below, held up only \nby Templar. If Templar let's go, Ilya's dead. They stare at each other...  \n\nAnd Templar pulls Ilya back. Ilya gets his footing. Catches his breath. Nods to \nTemplar. They continue to the ladder and descend.  \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS \nThe naval guards walk their shift.  \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT \nTemplar and Ilya hurry across the concrete floor to the entrance hatch.  \nTemplar kneels next to the RADIATION DETECTOR, unshouldering his \nbackpack.  \nTemplar's anti-radiation suit has a goggled hood, which he dons. He then \ncarefully lifts from his backpack a PLEXIGLASS RECTANGULAR BOX the size \nand shape of a shoe box, and a high-powered cordless BOLTDRIVER.  \nThe plexiglass box has two' compartments, one empty, the other filled with \nSMOKY GAS.  \nTemplar positions the plexiglass box over the radiation detector. He \nunpockets FOUR CONCRETE BOLTS CREWS and bolts the box tightly to the \nconcrete floor with the cordless boltdriver. (The plexiglass box has a steel \nmount with holes for this purpose.) \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS \nThe naval guards reach the end of the perimeter wall, then turn back toward \nthe nuclear situation facility...  \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION FACILITY - NIGHT \nTemplar turns a knob on the plexiglass box; THE DOOR separating the two \ncompartments within the box OPENS.  \nInside, THE SMOKY GAS releases. It wafts into the radiation detector's \nsensors.. ..Templar watches anxiously, talking to it...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nRadon isn't plutonium but \nyou don't know that...  \n\nThe detector's EMERGENCY LIGHT begins BLINKING.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nBoom, you just got nuked.  \n(unbolts the box) \nNow it's two months later and \nthe radiation's gone...  \n\nTemplar rips the plexiglass box away from the detector, releasing the RADON \nGAS into the air. A moment passes.  \nThe EMERGENCY LIGHT turns off and, open sesame, THE CONCRETE \nHATCHDOORS separate, revealing STAIRS.  \nTemplar rips off his hood. He and Ilya descend.  \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS \nThe naval guards are nearing the rear of the Admiralty. Around the corner is \nthe nuclear situation facility...  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nTemplar and Ilya race down. At the base of the stairs is the HATCHDOOR \nopen/close switch. Templar throws the \"close\" switch. Above, the hatch doors \nstart to close..  \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - PERIMETER WALLS \nThe naval guards come around the corner just as...  \n\n... THE CONCRETE HATCH DOORS pull shut.  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATION ROOM - DAY \nTemplar and Ilya move through the nuclear situation room to President \nKarpov's office.  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE - DAY \nIlya and Templar enter. Ilya opens the credenza behind Karpov's desk, \nrevealing ROWS OF VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES.  \nIlya rifles through the tapes.  \nTemplar kneels behind the T.V. and V.C.R. He switches the T.V.'s satellite link \nfrom \"RECEIVE\" to \"TRANSMIT,\" and adjusts the satellite frequency.  \nIlya hands Templar a VIDEO CASSETTE TAPE. Templar throws it in the V.C.R.  \nand hits a button. The V.C.R. transmits the tape over the satellite link to the - - \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY ROOF \n-- Satellite DISH on the Admiralty's roof, which sends the transmission into \nouter space, where it bounces off a satellite and returns to -- \n\nINT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \n-- a V.C.R. in the hotel suite, where Frankie hovers over an array of \nsophisticated editing equipment.  \nTretiak, Romanov, and several of Tretiak's men stand to the side.  \nTemplar's transmission plays on a T.V. It's a tape of the Karpov/Romanov \nmeeting: \n\nKARPOV \nTell me what you want.  \n\nROMANOV \nA public debate, then new elections.  \nWe'll let the people decide.  \n\nKARPOV \n(considers this) \nAgreed.  \n\nFrankie hits \"play\" on A SECOND V.C.R.: Here, we see the Tretiak/Ivan \nGrachameeting, taped earlier: \n\nTRETIAK \nUpon what conditions would \nyou accept a partnership? \nBe reasonable.  \n\nGRACHA \nFifty percent of the drug trade \nin St. Petersburg and Moscow.  \nA third of prostitution and gambling.  \n\nBoth V.C.R.'s are connected to a VIDEO MORPHING SYSTEM not unlike those \nused by filmmakers. Frankie hits some buttons on the morphing machine.  \nOn the first V.C.R. MONITOR - ROMANOV'S IMAGE is lifted from the \nvideotape. It simply disappears.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR SITUATIONS FACILITY - NIGHT \nTemplar and Ilya, waiting. Templar looks at his watch.  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCome on, Frankie...  \n\nINT. ST. PETERSBURG - HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nFrankie, finished, hits \"play.\" We see an altered version of the \nKarpov/Romanov meeting. Romanov has been morphed out and Ivan Gracha \nbas been morphed in.  \nON THE SCREEN, it now looks like this: \n\nPRESIDENT KARPOV \nTell me what you want.  \n\nGRACHA \nFifty percent of the drug trade \nin St. Petersburg and Moscow.  \nA third of prostitution and gambling.  \n\nPRESIDENT KARPOV \nAgreed.  \n\nPresident Karpov shakes Gracha's hand.  \n\nBACK TO SCENE \n\nFrankie turns to Tretiak and Romanov.  \n\nFRANKIE \nShould I send it? \n\nTRETIAK \nNot yet.  \n\nRomanov clicks on his cellular phone.  \n\nROMANOV \nGeneral Radischev please.  \nYes, an emergency.  \n\nFrankie, alarmed, turns to Tretiak.  \n\nFRANKIE \nWhat's he doing? Templar won't \nhave time to get out of there...  \n\nTretiak nods to ZERO who opens the door into the hall.  \nTWO MOSCOW POLICEMEN enter. They stride over to Frankie, yank her up \nand handcuff her, dragging her off.  \n\nCUT TO: \n\nEXT. ADMIRALTY - GARRISON - NIGHT \nThe Naval Guard in the garrison looks up with wide, startled eyes at -- \n\nTHREE RUSSIAN TANKS rumble up to the Admiralty, followed by a \ndetachment of RUSSIAN ARMY SPECIAL FORCES.  \n\nNAVAL GUARD \n(under his breath) \nMother of God...  \n\nThe tanks smash through the gate, rolling into the Admiralty compound. The \nSpecial Forces Men walk silently past the startled Naval Guard, who rushes \ninside and hits a KLAXON HORN.  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NAVAL HOSPITAL STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT \nHarry and Remy, startled by the klaxon, look out the storage room window \nat...the tanks.  \n\nHARRY \nCome on, Simon, move it...  \n\nEXT.

ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR OPERATIONS OFFICE \nTemplar looks at his watch. He's waiting for Frankie to send back the \nmorphed tape...  \n\nTEMPLAR \nCome on, Frankie.  \n\nSuddenly the transmission starts coming across the satellite link, recording \nover the old tape. It's almost finished...  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - OPERATIONS ROOM - NIGHT \nThe Special Forces Men come down the stairs and across the room toward \nKarpov's office...  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NUCLEAR BUNKER - KARPOV'S OFFICE \nTemplar yanks the MORPHED TAPE from the v.c.r and goes back to Karpov's \ncredenza. He kneels by the drawer.  \nSomething fast and unexpected happens, like slight-of hand. Templar pulls A \nSECOND TAPE from inside his suit and puts it back in the drawer, sliding the \nmorphed tape under the credenza. He stands, turns, and freezes...  \n\nILYA (remember, he is dressed as a NAVAL M.P.) has his gun leveled on Templar.  Ilya steps past Templar.  Lifts the tape from the drawer \n- the tape from Templar's waistband.  The door bursts open. The Special Forces men pile inside. The Special Forces \nMAJOR regards the situation.  \n\nILYA \nI found him over there.  \n(holds up the tape) \nWith this.  \n\nSPECIAL FORCES MAJOR \nGive it to me.  \n(turns to his men) \nArrest President Karpov.  \n\nFour Special Forces Men race out.  \n\nINT. ADMIRALTY - NIGHT \nPresident Karpov and his wife are sleeping.

DVORTSOVAYA PLOSCHAD - EARLY MORNING \n\nIt's 4 a.m., but revolution is in the air. Thousands of St. Petersburgers are \npouring into the square. It is an anxious, surreal scene.  \nRUSSIAN TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES surround the square.  \nTHE CROWD explodes with thunderous cheers as -- \n\nMICHAEL ROMANOV, escorted by soldiers, comes through the crowd.  \nGENERAL NICOLAI RADISCHEV, tall, stern, career Army man, follows with a \ncontingent of junior officers.  \n\nBehind Radischev are TEMPLAR, FRANKIE and PRESIDENT KARPOV, under \narrest, escorted by SPECIAL FORCES MEN.  \nRomanov climbs atop a TANK TURRET.  \nHe looks out over the crowd.  \nTHE CROWD comes to a hush. Like Lenin's arrival at Finland Station. A \nhistory-in-the-making atmosphere.  \n\nROMANOV \nFriends, countrymen, I give you \nMajor Antonin Scarpinin.  \n\nMajor Scarpinin (the Special Forces Major), climbs atop the tank turret.  \n\nMAJOR SCARPININ \nTwenty minutes ago a team of \nRussian Special Forces, acting on \nconfidential information, raided \nPresident Karpov's office...  \n\nACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK and his men emerge from several \nlimousines.  \nAs Tretiak moves through the crowd, IVAN GRACHA and twenty of his men \napproach.  \n\nTRETIAK \nThank you for coming, Ivan, \nit is a great night for Russia.  \n\nIVAN GRACHA \nI don't give a damn who's president.  \nI'll make my money either way.  \n\nTRETIAK \nMaybe you should take greater \ninterest in politics, Ivan Gracha.  \nTretiak and Gracha turn to Major Scarpinin, listening...  \n\nON THE TANK TURRET - TEMPLAR and FRANKIE are shoved by soldiers up \nnext to Scarpinin. Templar and Frankie exchange a steely glance.  \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE - REMY and HARRY come through the \ncrowd. Seeing Templar and Frankie atop the tank, they stop in their tracks \nand watch...  \n\nMAJOR SCARPININ \nThis man, a known international thief, \naided by this woman, a German \noperative, were arrested stealing a \nsurveillance videotape from \nPresident Karpov's office.  \nScarpinin shows THE SEIZED TAPE to the crowd, then hands it to Romanov, \nwho climbs atop the tank.  \nTEMPLAR AND FRANKIE are pulled down from the turret and led away to TWO \nARMY TRUCKS in the background.  \n\nROMANOV \nOne month ago I said I would \nprove that those who call \nthemselves our leaders...  \n(points at KARPOV) \n.. .are in league with those who we \nknow to be thieves, traitors, \nrapists of our once-great country.  \nDo you want to see this proof? \n\nTHE CROWD \n(out for blood) \nYES! \n\nRomanov hands the tape to Major Scarpinnin, who walks it over to an army \ncommunications TECHNICIAN standing by a portable V.C.R. linked to the \nHUGE SCREEN (seen in Romanov's earlier speech) above Romanov.  \nON THE TANK TURRET - ROMANOV points at the HUGE SCREEN.  \nThe crowd waits breathlessly. .:.  \n\nON THE SCREEN - the tape begins playing, but we don't see Karpov's office.  \nShockingly, we see...Tretiak's.  \nSimon Templar stashed the tape Frankie recorded of the Tretiak/Romanov \nmeeting in Karpov's office. We see: \n\nTRETIAK \nHail Michael Romanov, Czar \nof the Fatherland. How will \nthat sound to the average Russian? \n\nROMANOV \nThe average Russian is a fool.  \n\nIN THE CROWD there is confusion, incredulity.  \nROMANOV'S eyes widen.  \nTRETIAK and MEN stare in disbelief at the screen.  \nIVAN GRACHA and his men slowly back away from Tretiak.  \n\nROMANOV \nHe exists to be dominated.  \nTo partnership in government.  \n\nTRETIAK \nNo Romanov \u0096 \nto partnership in crime.  \n\nMICHAEL ROMANOV looks down at the crowd and...  \n. ...500,000 RUSSIANS stare back at him in silence.  \n\nROMANOV \nThat.. . that it is a fraud...  \n(turns to General Radischev) \nI can explain.  \n\nRADISCHEV \n(motions to MAJOR SCARPININ) \nArrest him.  \n\nScarpinin and his Special Forces Men close in on Michael Romanov, the \ncrusading reformer.  \nACROSS THE SQUARE - TRETIAK AND HIS MEN, huddled in a protective \ncircle, stare into the angry faces of half a million Russian citizens.  \nTotal silence. A pin could drop.  \nTretiak and his men brandish their weapons. The intimidated crowd backs off.  \nThey move quickly toward their vehicles, the CROWD parting for them.  \n\nA DETACHMENT OF RUSSIAN MARINES comes through the crowd.  \nThey are heavily armed and ready for business.  \nTretiak aims and fires. A MARINE goes down.  \nCIVILIANS SCREAM and dive away. pandemonium breaks out.  \nTRETIAK'S MEN open fire. The MARINES return fire. A harrowing amount of \nammunition is expended in seconds.  \nTen of Tretiak's men and many marines take hits. ZERO dies instantly. A \nbrutal, close-quarters firefight. The outnumbered marines take the worst of it.  \nTretiak, Ilya, and Tretiak's surviving men run past the fallen marines to their \nvehicles.  \nThey pile into the first two cars and SQUEAL away, heading down the Nevsky \nProspect.  \n\nACROSS THE SQUARE - AT THE ARMY TRUCKS \nPanic and pandemonium. Soldiers running here and there amidst panicked \ncivilians. A SPECIAL FORCES SERGEANT stands guard outside one of the \ntrucks. A NAVAL PARAMEDIC, supporting a WOUNDED PARAMEDIC, staggers \nup.  \nHarry Winston and Remy, of course.  \n\nHARRY WINSTON (Russian) \nSergeant, give me a hand.  \n\nThe Sergeant gives Harry a hand. REMY stands up; whips the barrel of his \ngun across the Sergeant's head, who collapses onto Harry. Harry drags him \noff and \u0096 \n\nREMY pulls the pin on the truck's doorlock. The door swings open. Templar \nhops down \u0085 \n\nTEMPLAR \nGet Frankie.  \n\nRemy and Harry hurry off to the other army truck.  \nTEMPLAR gets in the truck, sliding behind the wheel. He starts the ignition \nand throws it in drive. The truck rumbles forward, hopping the curb.  \nTHE ARMY TRUCK ROARS out of the square, pursuing Tretiak's vehicles down \nthe Nevsky Prospect as, behind him -- \n\n- - the TANKS and ARMOURED VEHICLES also roar out of the square, followed \nby Russian Marines, Special Forces, and the enraged crowd.

TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - ZUBOV' S LAB \nA T.V. shows a newscast from the Ploschad. Dr. Singh and Zubov, having \nseen everything that just transpired, are frantically destroying their data and \nrecords.  \nZubov is burning the cold fusion hardcopies in a waste basket. Dr. Singh is \ndeleting the computer files.  \nTretiak and Ilya come down the stairs. Zubov pops a 3 1/4 disk from the \ncomputer.  \n\nZUBOV \nWe reduced the fusion \nformula to one disk and \ndestroyed everything else.  \n\nTRETIAK \nGood.  \n\nAnd Tretiak draws his gun. As does Ilya. Zubov and Dr. Singh stare at the \nguns.  \n\nDR. SINGH \nWhat.. . what are you...? \n\nTretiak shoots Zubov. Ilya shoots Dr. Singh. The two scientists fall, dead. So \nmuch for honor among thieves.  \nThen Tretiak wheels on Ilya, his gun coming up. Yes, so much for honor \namong thieves...  \nTretiak freezes, startled.  \nBecause Ilya has his gun leveled on Tretiak.  \nTretiak tries to speak. Words won't form. Ilya FIRES.

The MISSILE PROJECTILE explodes \nfrom the tank's barrel, flies through the mansion's front door over Ilya and \nTemplar's heads...  \n\n... wings across the interior of the mansion...  \n\n.. . and SLAMS into the rear wall of the mansion, exploding, blowing the wall \ndown, revealing ANOTHER TANK at the mansion's rear, lumbering toward it.  \nIlya slams the door shut and whirls on Templar. They trade blows. Ilya has \nthe better of this. He shoves Templar aside and races back through the foyer.  \nTemplar recovers and races after Ilya, tackling him in the middle of the floor.  \nThey roll on the floor, trading vicious blow after vicious blow, when --- \n\n-- A TANK SHELL RIPS into the mansion's domed cupola.  \nTemplar and Ilya look up in horror as -- \n\nTHE 20 FOOT DIAMETER CRYSTAL CHANDELIER descends.  \nTemplar and Ilya dive away. The chandelier CRASHES \nspectacularly in the middle of the foyer, exploding like a glass grenade. A \nHUGE PIECE OF CRYSTAL hits Templar in the side of the head, opening a \ngash, dazing him.  \nThere's no place to go. Except up.  \nIlya races for the staircase.  \nTemplar recovers and takes up the chase again.  \nUp the staircase they go.  \nA SECOND TANK MISSLE slams into the dome, imploding it.  \nCHUNKS OF STONE and MASONRY fall on Ilya and Templar, knocking them \nboth backward.  \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT \nThe lab is rocked by the explosions.  \nRACKS OF CHEMICALS in beakers fall to the floor, SMASHING. The chemicals \nbegin to ooze together.  \nA chemical reaction is occurring. The mixing chemicals begin emitting smoke.  \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - CORRIDOR/TRETIAK'S OFFICE \nTretiak's men are at the windows with automatic weapons, firing on the army \nbelow. Two men drag a crate into the office. They open it, revealing an \u0096 \n\nANTI-TANK GRENADE LAUNCHER. They pull it from the crate and set up the \ntri-pod...  \n\nON THE STAIRCASE - TEMPLAR AND ILYA \ncontinue up the staircase. Ilya reaches the mezzanine. He climbs atop the \nbalustrade and jumps to the lip of the crater in the dome. He pulls himself up.  \nTemplar repeats Ilya's actions: climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the \nlip of the crater. As he pulls himself up... ILYA appears.  \nHe compresses his foot against Templar's knuckles.  \nTemplar grimaces. There's no way out this time.  \nThere's a burst of ORANGE LIGHT as A TANK SHELL explodes on the roof, \nknocking Ilya off his feet, allowing -- \n\n-- Templar to pull himself up to the roof.  \n\nEXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS / NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT \nThe tanks continue firing. Russian Marines fire round after round into the \nmansion. Tretiak's men inside return the fire.  \nHarry, Remy and Frankie run up, looking with alarm at the vicious firefight.  \nRealizing Templar is within...  \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S OFFICE \nThe anti-tank grenade launcher is operational. One of Tretiak's men loads, the \nother fires, and -- \n\nEXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT \n-- an ANTI-TANK SHELL launches from the window and hits the tank in the \ncourtyard, blowing its turret off.  \nTretiak's men fire assault rifles from the windows.  \nNo one's surrendering. It's a fight to the death...  \n\nEXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ROOF - NIGHT \nTemplar and Ilya, on the mansion's roof. The view is mind-boggling: the \nnighttime St. Petersburg skyline looming in the background and, below, three \nRussian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion.  \nAcross the exploding, crumbling rooftop, Ilya and Templar go. A TANK SHELL \nexplodes in front of Ilya.  \nIlya falls, concussed by the shell. Templar dives upon him, wrenching the \nCOMPUTER DISK from Ilya's pocket.  \nIlya slams his forearm into Templar's head. The disk flies from Templar's \nhand, scuttles across the roof shingles, falling through a crater...  \n\n... it flutters to the mansion floor, 50 feet down.  \nThey get to their feet, circling each other. Their footing is not trustworthy, like \nice in Spring.  \nTank shells SLAM into the mansion's upper architecture and roof. A shell hits \nthe mansion's east wall, detaching the DRAIN PIPE running up it.  \nIlya draws a SWITCHBLADE. Backing Templar up.  \nTemplar's at the very edge of the building.  \nThere's no place to go.  \nTemplar's feet are unsteady. Because the cornice of the building is crumbling \nbeneath him. ...  \n\nAnd Templar falls. He looks over his shoulder, his wrists turning, hands \nopening, and...  \n\n... Templar catches the detached DRAINPIPE.  \nThe drainpipe sags under Templar's weight, bending... And it stops. Templar \nhangs there, bobbing up and down above the alley between the mansion and \nthe adjacent building, fifty feet below.  \nIlya turns back.  \nHe's going after the disk.  \nIlya jumps through the crater to the mezzanine and races down the \nstaircase...while in the basement...  \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT \nAnother whole shelf of chemicals falls, smashing. The chemicals continue to \nmix...  \n\nEXT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ROOF \nTemplar dangles from the drainpipe.  \nKA-CHUNG. It gives. It gives again. The drainpipe is about to break. Templar \nlooks down into the flames and demolition below...  \n\nINT. TRETIAK's MANSION - STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT \nIlya races reaches the foyer. The building is imploding, chunks of stone falling \nall around him.  \nIlya's eyes are wild. He wants that disk...  \n\nIlya gets to it.  \nClutches it. It's finally in his hands.  \nHe goes for the staircase. ...  \n\nINT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT \nThe chemicals are steaming now, in a froth, becoming more and more and \nmore volatile...  \n\nEXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT \nTemplar, dangling from the drainpipe, looks wildly around for an escape. If he \ncould just get to that adjacent building...  \n\nIt's too far. And his hands are slipping...  \n\nThen, from the mansion's basement, the very guts of the building, the \nchemicals in the lab detonate and -- \n\nTHE MANSION EXPLODES FROM WITHIN.  \n\nINT. TRETIAK' S MANS ION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nIlya's eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him. Ilya falls, \nengulfed in flame, still clutching the cold fusion disk.  \n\nEXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT \nThe drainpipe fully detaches from the collapsing mansion wall. It falls away \nfrom the mansion, with Templar still holding on...  \n\nTemplar releases from the drainpipe and catches the lip of the roof cornice of \nthe adjacent building.  \nTemplar pulls himself up and looks back at...  \n\nTRETIAK'S MANSION. The entire building comes apart at the seams. It \ncrashes into a heap of rubble.  \n\nFADE OUT: \n\nFADE IN: \n\nEXT. MANHATTAN - REESTABLISHING - DAY \nThe skyline of the great city as we SUPER: NEW YORK CITY - ONE MONTH LATER \n\nEXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - ESTABLISHING \nIt's mid-day. People coming and going.  \n\nINT. ROCKEFELLER - AN OFFICE \nCAMERA PANS past the office door, stenciled -- ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION - CHARITABLE DONATIONS -- to a huge desk. Two middle-aged LADIES are going through a four-foot \nstack of MAILED DONATIONS.  \nThey are LUCY and DELORES.  \n\nLUCY \nHere's one from that guy who owns \nmost of Brooklyn. Ten bucks again.  \n\nLUCY \nI'll alert the media.  \nGuy's richer than god...  \n\nDELORES \n(reads a check) \nHey, Mr. Anderson at the Met \ngave a thousand this year. Lucy? \n\nBut LUCY'S not listening.  \nShe's staring at a check. Her eyes are like hubcaps.  \n\nLUCY \nOh my goodness gracious...  \n(looks at Delores) \nGet Mr. Thomas, Delores.  \n\nDELORES \nWhat is it? \n\nLUCY \nA check for fifty...  \n(gulps) \n...million dollars.  \n\nDelores gets up, goes to Lucy, who's hyperventilating.  \nLucy hands her the check. Delores starts hyperventilating. Lucy reads the \nletter: \n\nLUCY \nIt's from a \"Jillian St.  \nThomas Foundation,\" \nfor the benefit of scientific research.  \n\nDELORES \nNever heard of it. Lemme see.  \n\nLucy hands Delores the letter.  \nINSERT - THE LETTER is printed under a letterhead with a logo design: the \nstick figure man with halo, the same design as the tiepin Jillian gave Templar.  \n\nBACK TO SCENE \n\nDelores looks at Lucy. Lucy looks back.  \nAnd over this we hear a voice. We've heard it before...  \n\nJILLIAN ST. THOMAS \nIf you're afraid of the dark, \nremember the night rainbow...  \n\nEXT.
