DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt is not a large room and jammed with tables, mostly for\nfour but some for six and eight. A long table of honor, for\nabout thirty people, has been placed upon a dais. \n\nDiner is over. Demi-tasses, cigars and brandy. The overall\neffect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility. It is\nJune.\n\nThe CAMERA, as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES, is\non the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD. It is a gold statuette, about a\nfoot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse. Exquisitely\nframed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in\nthe center of the table of honor. \n\nOver this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of\nADDISON deWITT:\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t The Sarah Siddons Award for\n\t Distinguished Achievement is\n\t perhaps unknown to you. It has been\n\t spared the sensational and\n\t commercial publicity that attends\n\t such questionable \"honors\" as the\n\t Pulitzer Prize and those awards\n\t presented annually by the film\n\t society...\n\nThe CAMERA has EASED BACK to include some of the table of\nhonor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who\nis speaking. We do not hear what he says. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t The distinguished looking gentleman\n\t is an extremely old actor. Being an\n\t actor - he will go on speaking for\n\t some time. It is not important what\n\t you hear what he says. \n\nThe CAMERA EASES BACK some more, and CONTINUES until it\ndiscloses a fairly COMPREHENSIVE SHOT of the room\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t However it is important that you\n\t know where you are, and why you are\n\t here. This is the dining room of\n\t the Sarah Siddons Society.\n\t The occasion is its annual banquet\n\t and presentation of the highest\n\t honor our Theater knows - the Sarah\n\t Siddons Award for Distinguished\n\t Achievement. \n\nA GROUP OF WAITERS are clustered near the screen masking the\nentrances of the kitchen. The screens are papered with old\ntheatrical programs. The waiters are all aged and venerable.\nThey look respectfully toward the speaker. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t These hollowed walls, indeed many\n\t of these faces, have looked upon\n\t Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie\n\t Fiske; Mansfield's voice filled the\n\t room, Booth breathed this air. It\n\t is unlikely that the windows have\n\t been opened since his death. \n\nCLOSE - THE AWARD on its altar, it shines proudly above five\nor six smaller altars which surround it and which are now\nempty. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t The minor awards, as you can see,\n\t have already been presented. Minor\n\t awards are for such as the writer\n\t and director - since their function\n\t is merely to construct a tower so\n\t that the world can applaud a light\n\t which flashes on top of it and no\n\t brighter light has ever dazzled the\n\t eye than Eve Harrington. Eve... but\n\t more of Eve, later. All about Eve,\n\t in fact.  \n\nTHE CAMERA MOVES TO: CLOSE - ADDISON deWITT, not young, not\nunattractive, a fastidious dresser, sharp of eye and\nmerciless of tongue. An omnipresent cigarette holder projects\nfrom his mouth like the sward of D'Artagnan. \n\nHe sits back in his chair, musingly, his fingers making\nlittle cannonballs out of bread crumbs. His narration covers\nthe MOVE of the CAMERA to him:\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t To those of you who do not read,\n\t attend the Theater, listen to\n\t uncensored radio programs or know\n\t anything of the world in which we\n\t live - it is perhaps necessary to\n\t introduce myself. My name is\n\t Addison deWitt.\n\t My native habitat is the Theater -\n\t in it I toil not, neither do I\n\t spin. I am a critic and\n\t commentator. I am essential to the\n\t Theater - as ants are to a picnic,\n\t as the ball weevil to a cotton\n\t field... \n\nHe looks to his left. KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish\nin an unprofessional way. She is scraping bread crumbs,\nspilled sugar, etc., into a pile with a spoon. Addison takes\none of her bread crumbs. She smiles absently. Addison rolls\nthe bread crumb into a cannonball. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t This is Karen Richards. She is the\n\t wife of a playwright, therefore of\n\t the Theater by marriage. Nothing in\n\t her background or breeding should\n\t have brought her any closer the\n\t stage than row E, center...\n\nKaren continues her doodling. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t ... however, during her senior year\n\t in Radcliffe, Lloyd Richards\n\t lectured on drama. The following\n\t year Karen became Mrs. Lloyd\n\t Richards. Lloyd is the author of\n\t 'Footsteps on the Ceiling' - the\n\t play which has won for Eve\n\t Harrington the Sarah Siddons\n\t Award...\n\nKaren absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse. A\nhand reaches in to take the spoon away. Karen looks as the\nCAMERA PANS with IT to MAX FABIAN. He sits at her left. He's\na sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant\napprehension. He smiles apologetically and indicated a white\npowder with he unwraps. He pantomimes that his ulcer is\nsnapping.   \n\nKaren smiles back, returns to her doodling. Addison mashes a\ncigarette stub, pops it out of his holder. He eyes Max. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t There are two types of theatrical\n\t producers. One has a great many\n\t wealthy friends who will risk a tax\n\t deductible loss. This type is\n\t interested in Art. \n\nMax drops the powder into some water, stirs it, drinks, burps\ndelicately and close his eyes. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t The other is one to whom each\n\t production mean potential ruin or\n\t fortune. This type is out to make a\n\t buck. Meet Max Fabian. He is the\n\t producer of the play which has won\n\t Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons\n\t Award...\n\nMax rests fitfully. He twitches. A hand reaches into the\nSCENE, removes a bottle of Scotch from before him. The CAMERA\nfollows the bottle to MARGO CHANNING. She sits at Max's left,\nat deWitt's right. An attractive, strong face. She is\nchildish, adult, reasonable, unreasonable - usually one when\nshe should be the other, but always positive. She pours a\nstiff drink.   \n\nAddison hold out the soda bottle to her. She looks at it, and\nat him, as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad. He\nsmiles and pours a glass of soda for himself. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t Margo Channing is the Star of the\n\t Theater. She made her first stage\n\t appearance, at the age of four, in\n\t 'Midsummer Night's Dream'. She\n\t played a fairy and entered - quite\n\t unexpectedly - stark naked. She has\n\t been a Star ever since. \n\nMargo sloshes her drink around moodily, pulls at it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t Margo is a great Star. A true Star.\n\t She never was or will be anything\n\t less or anything less... \n\t\t(slight pause)\n\t ... the part for which Eve\n\t Harrington is receiving the Sarah\n\t Siddons Award was intended\n\t originally for Margo Channing...\n\nAddison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette\nin his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in\nthe general direction of the table of honor. As he speaks the\nCAMERA MOVES in the direction of his glance...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t Having covered in tedious detail\n\t not only the history of the Sarah\n\t Siddons Society, but also the\n\t history of acting since Thespis\n\t first stepped out of the chorus\n\t line - our distinguished chairman\n\t has finally arrived at our reason\n\t for being here...  \n\nAt this point Addison's voice FADES OUT and the voice of the\naged actor FADES IN. CAMERA is in MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT of him\nand the podium. \n\n<b>\t\t\tAGED ACTOR\n</b>\t I have been proud and privileged to\n\t have spent my life in the Theater -\n\t \"a poor player ... that struts and\n\t frets his hour upon the stage\" -\n\t and I have been honored to be, for\n\t forty years, Chief Promoter of the\n\t Sarah Siddons Society...\n\t\t(he lifts the Sarah\n\t\t Siddons Award from its\n\t\t altar)\n\t Thirty-nine times have I placed in\n\t deserving hands this highest honor\n\t the Theater knows...\n\t\t(he grows a bit arch, he\n\t\t uses his eyebrows)\n\t Surely no actor is older than I - I\n\t have earned my place out of the\n\t sun...\n\t\t(indulgent laughter)\n\t ... and never before has this Award\n\t gone to anyone younger than its\n\t recipient tonight. How fitting that\n\t it should pass from my hands to\n\t hers...\n\nEVE HANDS: Lovely, beautifully groomed. In serene repose,\nthey rest between a demi-tasse cup and an exquisite small\nevening cup.  \n\n<b>\t\t\tAGED ACTOR\n</b>\t Such young hands. Such a young\n\t lady. Young in years, but whose\n\t heart is as old as the Theater...\n\nAddison's eyes narrow quizzically as he listens. Then,\nslowly, he turns to look at Karen...\n\n<b>\t\t\tAGED ACTOR\n</b>\t Some of us a privileged to know\n\t her. We have seen beyond the beauty\n\t and artistry- \n\nKaren never ceases her thoughtful pat-a-cake with the crumbs. \n\n<b>\t\t\tAGED ACTOR\n</b>\t -that have made her name resound\n\t through the nation. We know her\n\t humility. Her devotion, her loyalty\n\t to her art. \n\nAddison's glance moves from Karen to Margo. \n\n<b>\t\t\tAGED ACTOR\n</b>\t Her love, her deep and abiding love\n\t for us-\n\nMargo's face is a mask. She looks down at the drink which she\ncradles with both hands. \n\n<b>\t\t\tAGED ACTOR\n</b>\t -for what we are and what we do.\n\t The Theater. She has had one wish,\n\t one prayer, one dream. To belong to\n\t us. \n\t\t(he's nearing his curtain\n\t\t line)\n\t Tonight her dream has come true.\n\t And henceforth we shall dream the\n\t same of her. \n\t\t(a slight pause)\n\t Honored members, ladies and\n\t gentlemen - for distinguished\n\t achievement in the Theater - the\n\t Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve\n\t Harrington. \n\nThe entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous\napplause. Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet...\nFlash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the\nAged Actor's left... \n\nEve rises - beautiful, radiant, poised, exquisitely gowned.\nShe stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation. \n\nA dozen photographers skip, squat, and dart about like water\nbugs. Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop...\n\nTHE WAITERS applaud enthusiastically...\n\nAGED ACTOR, Award in hand, he beams at her...\n\nEVE smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right...\n\nMAX has come to. He applauds lustily.\n\nADDISON's applauding too, more discreetly. \n\nMARGO, not applauding. But you sense no deliberate slight,\nmerely an impression that as she looks at Eve her mind is on\nsomething else...\n\nKAREN, nor is she applauding. But her gaze is similarly fixed\non Eve in a strange, faraway fashion. \n\nADDISON, still applauding, his eyes flash first at Margo and\nthen at Karen. Then he directs them back to Eve. He smiles\never so slightly.  \n\nThe applause has continued unabated. EVE turns now, and moves\ngracefully toward the Aged Actor. She moves through\napplauding ladies and gentlemen; from below the flash bulbs\nkeep popping... \n\nAs she nears her goal, the Ages Actor turns to her. He holds\nout the award. Her hand reaches out for it. At that precise\nmoment - with the award just beyond her fingertips - THE\nPICTURE HOLDS, THE ACTION STOPS. The SOUND STOPS. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t Eve. Eve, the Golden Girl. The\n\t cover girl, the girl next door, the\n\t girl on the moon... Time has been\n\t good to Eve, Life goes where she\n\t goes - she's been profiled,\n\t covered, revealed, reported, what\n\t she eats and when and where, whom\n\t she knows and where she was and\n\t when and where she's going...   \n\nADDISON has stopped applauding, he's sitting forward, staring\nintently at Eve... his narration continues unbroken.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t ... Eve. You all know all about\n\t Eve... what can there be to know\n\t that you don't know...?\n\nAs he leans back, the APPLAUSE FADES IN as tumultuous as\nbefore. Addison's look moves slowly from Eve to Karen.  \n\nKAREN, she leans forward now, her eyes intently on Eve. Her\nlovely face FILLS THE SCREEN as the APPLAUSE FADES ONCE MORE -\nas she thinks back:\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN'S VOICE\n</b>\t When was it? How long? It seems a\n\t lifetime ago. Lloyd always said\n\t that in the Theater a lifetime was\n\t a season, and a season a lifetime.\n\t It's June now. That was - early\n\t October... only last October. It\n\t was a drizzly night, I remember I\n\t asked the taxi to wait...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. NEW YORK THEATER STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nTraffic is not heavy, the shows have broken some half-hour\nbefore. The rain is just a drizzle. \n\nThere are other theaters on the street; display lights are\nbeing extinguished. Going out just as Karen's taxi pulls up\nis: MARGO CHANNING in 'AGED IN WOOD'. The marquis display\nbelow includes \"Max Fabian Presents\" and \"By Lloyd Richards.\"\n\nThe taxi comes to a stop at the alley. Karen can be seen\nthrough the closed windows telling the driver to wait. Then\nshe gets out. She takes a step, hesitates, then looks about\ncuriously:\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN'S VOICE\n</b>\t Where was she? Strange... I had\n\t become so accustomed to seeing her\n\t there night after night - I found\n\t myself looking for a girl I'd never\n\t spoken to, wondering where she\n\t was...\n\nShe smiles a little at her own romanticism, puts her head\ndown and makes her way into the alley. \n\n<b>EXT. ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nKaren moves toward the stage door. She passes a recess in the\nwall - perhaps an exit - about halfway. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE'S VOICE\n</b>\t\t(softly)\n\t Mrs. Richards...\n\nKaren hesitates, looks. Eve is barely distinguishable in the\nshadow of the recess. Karen smiles, waits. Eve comes out. A\ngooseneck light above them reveals her... \n\nShe wears a cheap trench coat, low-heeled shoes, a rain hat\nstuck on the back of her head... Her large, luminous eyes\nseem to glow up at Karen in the strange half-light. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t So there you are. It seemed odd,\n\t suddenly, your not being there...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Why should you think I wouldn't be?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Why should you be? After all, six\n\t nights a week - for weeks - of\n\t watching even Margo Channing enter\n\t and leave a theater-\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I hope you don't mind my speaking\n\t to you...\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Not at all. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I've seen you so often - it took\n\t every bit of courage I could raise-\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(smiles)\n\t To speak to just a playwright's\n\t wife? I'm the lowest form of\n\t celebrity...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t You're Margo Channing's best\n\t friend. You and your husband are\n\t always with her - and Mr.\n\t Sampson... what's he like?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(grins)\n\t Bill Sampson? He's - he's a\n\t director.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t He's the best. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t He'll agree with you. Tell me, what\n\t do you between the time Margo goes\n\t in and comes out? Just huddle in\n\t that doorway and wait? \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Oh, no. I see the play. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(incredulous)\n\t You see the play? You've seen the\n\t play every performance?\n\t\t(Eve nods)\n\t But, don't you find it - I mean\n\t apart from everything else - don't\n\t you find it expensive? \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Standing room doesn't cost much. I\n\t manage. \n\nKaren contemplates Eve. Then she takes her arm. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t I'm going to take you to Margo...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(hanging back)\n\t Oh, no...\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t She's got to meet you-\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be\n\t just another tongue-tied gushing\n\t fan...\n\nKaren practically propels her toward the stage door. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(insisting)\n\t There isn't another like you, there\n\t couldn't be- \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t But if I'd known... maybe some\n\t other time... I mean, looking like\n\t this. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t You look just fine...\n\t\t(they're at the stage\n\t\t door)\n\t ... by the way. What's your name?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Eve. Eve Harrington. \n\nKaren opens the door. They go in. \n\n<b>INT. BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nEverything, including the doorman, looks fireproof. \n\nEve enters like a novitiate's first visit to the Vatican.\nKaren, with a \"Good evening, Gus -\" to the doorman, leads the\nway toward Margo's stage dressing room. Eve, drinking in the\nwonderment of all the surveys, lags behind. Karen waits for\nher to catch up... \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t You can breathe it - can't you?\n\t Like some magic perfume...\n\nKaren smiles, takes Eve's arm. They proceed to Margo's\ndressing room. \n\n<b>EXT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nNo star on the closed door; the paint is peeling. A type\nwritten chit, thumbtacked, says MISS CHANNING.\n\nAs Karen and Eve approach it, an uninhibited guffaw from\nMargo makes them pause. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(whispers)\n\t You wait a minute...\n\t\t(smiles)\n\t ... now don't run away-\n\nEve smiles shakily. At the same moment:\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO'S VOICE\n</b>\t\t(loudly; through the door)\n\t \"Honey chile,\" I said, \"if the\n\t South had won the war, you could\n\t write the same plays about the\n\t North!\"\n\nKaren enters during the line. \n\n<b>INT. MARGO'S DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt is a medium-sized box, lined with hot water pipes and\ncracked plaster. It is furnished in beat-up wicker. A door\nleads to an old-fashioned bathroom. \n\nMargo is at the dressing table. She wears an old wrapper, her\nhair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies\nbefore her like a dead poodle. Also before her is an almost\nfinished drink. \n\nLLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise. He's in\nhis late thirties, sensitive, literate. \n\nBetween them, by the dressing table, is BIRDIE - Margo's\nmaid. Her age is unimportant. She was conceived during a\nsplit week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot. She is\nfiercely loyal to Margo. \n\nKaren enters during the line Margo started while she was\noutside. Lloyd chuckles, Birdie cackles. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Hi.\n\t\t(she goes to kiss Lloyd)\n\t Hello, darling-\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO \n</b>\t Hi. \n\t\t(she goes right on - in a\n\t\t think \"Suth'n\" accent)\n\t \"Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't\n\t think you can rightly say we lost\n\t the wah, we was mo' stahved out,\n\t you might say - an' that's what ah\n\t don' unnerstand about all these\n\t plays about love-stahved Suth'n\n\t women - love is one thing we was\n\t nevah stahved for the South!\"\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t How was the concert?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Loud.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t Lemme fix you a drink. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t No thanks, Birdie. \n\nKaren laughs with them. \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Margo's interview with a lady\n\t reporter from the South-\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t The minute it gets printed they're\n\t gonna fire on Gettysburg all over\n\t again...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t It was Fort Sumter they fired on-\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t I never played Fort Sumter.\n\nShe takes the wig into the bathroom. Margo starts creaming\nthe make-up off her face. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Honey chili had a point. You know,\n\t I can remember plays about women -\n\t even from the South - where it\n\t never even occurred to them whether\n\t they wanted to marry their fathers\n\t more than their brothers...\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t That was way back...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Within your time, buster. Lloyd,\n\t honey, be a playwright with guts.\n\t Write me one about a nice, normal\n\t woman who shoots her husband. \n\nBirdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t You need new girdles. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Buy some. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t The same size? \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Of course!\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t Well. I guess a real tight girdle\n\t help when you're playin' a lunatic.  \n\nShe picks up Lloud empty glass, asks \"more\"? He shakes his\nhead. She pours herself a quick one. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(firmly)\n\t Margo does not play a lunatic,\n\t Birdie. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t I know. She just keeps hearin' her\n\t dead father play the banjo. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t It's the tight girdle that does it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t I find these wisecracks\n\t increasingly less funny! 'Aged in\n\t Wood' happens to be a fine and\n\t distinguished play-\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t - 'at's my loyal little woman. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t The critics thought so, the\n\t audiences certainly think so -\n\t packed houses, tickets for months\n\t in advance - I can't see that\n\t either of Lloyd's last two plays\n\t have hurt you any!\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Easy, now...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(grins)\n\t Relax, kid.

It was the last\n\t week. I went one night... the most\n\t important night in my life - until\n\t this one. Anyway... I found myself\n\t going the next night - and the next\n\t and the next. Every performance.\n\t Then, when the show went East - I\n\t went East. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t I'll never forget that blizzard the\n\t night we played Cheyenne. A cold\n\t night. First time I ever saw a\n\t brassiere break like a piece of\n\t matzos... \n\nEve looks at her unsmilingly, then back to her hands. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Eve... why don't you start at the\n\t beginning? \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t It couldn't possibly interest you. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Please...\n\nEve speaks simply and without self-pity. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I guess it started back home.\n\t Wisconsin, that is. There was just\n\t mum, and dad - and me. I was the\n\t only child, and I made believe a\n\t lot when I was a kid - I acted out\n\t all sorts of things... what they\n\t were isn't important. But somehow\n\t acting and make-believe began to\n\t fill up my life more and more, it\n\t got so that I couldn't tell the\n\t real from the unreal except that\n\t the unreal seemed more real to\n\t me... I'm talking a lot of\n\t gibberish, aren't I? \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Not at all...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Farmers were poor in those days,\n\t that's what dad was - a farmer. I\n\t had to help out. So I quit school\n\t and I went to Milwaukee. I became a\n\t secretary. In a brewery.\n\t\t(she smiles)\n\t When you're a secretary in a\n\t brewery - it's pretty hard to make\n\t believe you're anything else.\n\t Everything is beer. It wasn't much\n\t fun, but it helped at home -  and\n\t there was a Little Theater Group...\n\t like a drop of rain in the desert.\n\t That's where I met Eddie. He was a\n\t radio technician. We played\n\t 'Liliom' for three performances, I\n\t was awful - then the war came, and\n\t we got married. Eddie was in the\n\t air force - and they sent him to\n\t the South Pacific. You were with\n\t the O.W.I., weren't you Mr.\n\t Richards?\n\t\t(Lloyd nods)\n\t That's what 'Who's Who' says...\n\t well, with Eddie gone, my life went\n\t back to beer. Except for a letter a\n\t week. One week Eddie wrote he had a\n\t leave coming up. I'd saved my money\n\t and vacation time. I went to San\n\t Francisco to meet him. \n\t\t(a slight pause)\n\t Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded\n\t the telegram from Milwaukee - the\n\t one that came from Washington to\n\t say that Eddie wasn't coming at\n\t all. That Eddie was dead...\n\t\t(Karen puts her hand on\n\t\t Lloyd's)\n\t ... so I figured I'd stay in San\n\t Francisco. i was alone, but\n\t couldn't go back without Eddie. I\n\t found a job. And his insurance\n\t helped... and there were theaters\n\t in San Francisco. And one night\n\t Margo Channing came to play in\n\t 'Remembrance'... and I went to see\n\t it. And - well - here I am...\n\nShe finishes dry-eyes and self-composed. Margo squeezes the\nbridge of her nose, dabs at her eyes. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t\t(finally)\n\t What a story. Everything but the\n\t bloodhounds snappin' at her rear\n\t end...\n\nThat breaks the spell. Margo turns to her-\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t There are some human experiences,\n\t Birdie, that do not take place in a\n\t vaudeville house - and that even a\n\t fifth-rate vaudevillian should\n\t understand and respect!\n\t\t(to Eve)\n\t I want to apologize for Birdie's-\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t\t(snaps in)\n\t You don't have to apologize for me!\n\t\t(to Eve)\n\t I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.\n\t It's just my way of talkin'...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(nicely)\n\t You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss\n\t Coonan...\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIRDIE\n</b>\t Call me Birdie. \n\t\t(to Margo)\n\t As for bein' fifth-rate - i closed\n\t the first half for eleven years an'\n\t you know it!\n\nShe slams into the bathroom again. At that precise instant\nBILL SAMPSON flings open the door to the dressing room. He's\nyoungish, vital, undisciplined. He lugs a beat-up suitcase\nwhich he drops as he crosses to Margo-\n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL\n</b>\t Forty-five minutes from now my\n\t plane takes off and how do I find\n\t you?

Then she smiles. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(calling)\n\t Eve-\n\nEVE, startled, whips the gown away, turns to Margo. \n\nMARGO smiles understandingly. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(quietly)\n\t I think we'd better let Mrs. Brown\n\t pick up the wardrobe...\n\nWordlessly, Eve brings it toward her...\n\n<b>INT.

Eve Harrington has\n\t never by word, look, thought or\n\t suggestion indicated anything to me\n\t but her adoration for you and her\n\t happiness at our being in love!

Max has wandered off. Other\nguests are arriving. Margo gulps her drink, hands Bill the\nempty glass. He puts it on a passing tray. Margo takes a\nfresh one at the same time. \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t The general atmosphere is very\n\t Macbethish.

You remember\n\t Miss Caswell?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t I do not. How do you do?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMISS CASWELL\n</b>\t We never met. That's why. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Miss Caswell is an actress.

She is in safe hands. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Amen.\n\nEve smiles uncertainly at Margo as he leads her away. Margo\nlooks after them. She downs her drink...\n\n<b>INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt's many Martinis later. Most of the guests have gone. The\nparty has reached that static state - everyone's assumed more\nor less permanent places. \n\nBirdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee. CAMERA FOLLOWS her\nto the piano where Margo sits on the bench beside the\npianist. He is just finishing \"Liebestraum\" and she stares\nmoodily into a Martini. Birdie halts beside her with the\ncoffee. Margo looks up. Birdie holds out the coffee. Margo\ntakes the onion out of the Martini, drops it into the coffee\nand waves Birdie away. Birdie goes. \"Liebestraum\" comes to an\nend. The pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated\nrhythm. Margo stops him. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(quietly)\n\t \"Liebestraum.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\tPIANIST\n</b>\t I just played it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Play it again. \n\n<b>\t\t\tPIANIST\n</b>\t But that was the fourth straight\n\t time. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Then this will be five. I suppose\n\t you think I'm too drunk to count. \n\n<b>\t\t\tPIANIST\n</b>\t No. You're just crazy about\n\t \"Liebestraum.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t \"Liebestraum.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\tPIANIST\n</b>\t Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of\n\t depressing. If you don't mind my\n\t saying so, everybody's kind of\n\t dying on the vine...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t My dear Horowitz. In the first\n\t place, I'm paying you union scale.\n\t Second, it's my piano. Third, if\n\t everybody doesn't like kind of\n\t dying on the vine, they can get off\n\t the vine and go home.\n\t \"Liebestraum.\"\n\nUnhappily, he plays \"Liebestraum.\" Margo sips her Martini,\nstares down into it again. Bill tiptoes up. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL\n</b>\t\t(whispers)\n\t Many of your guests have been\n\t wondering when they may be\n\t permitted to view the body. Where\n\t has it been laid out? \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(somberly)\n\t It hasn't been laid out, we haven't\n\t finished with the embalming. As a\n\t matter of fact, you're looking at\n\t it. The remains of Margo Channing.\n\t Sitting up. It is my last wish to\n\t be buried sitting up. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t\t(trying to kid her out of\n\t\t it)\n\t Wouldn't you feel more natural\n\t taking a bow?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t You know nothing about feelings,\n\t natural or unnatural. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t Then without feeling, your guests\n\t were also wondering whether the\n\t music couldn't be a shade more on\n\t the - shall we say, happier side?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t If my guests do not like it here, I\n\t suggest they accompany you to the\n\t nursery where I'm sure you will all\n\t feel more at home. \n\nBill is about to get mad - when Max bustles up. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t Margo. You by any chance got\n\t bicarbonate of soda in the house?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(sympathetic)\n\t Poor Max. Heartburn?\n\t\t(Max nods)\n\t It's that Miss Caswell.

Max waits to set Bill straight. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t She loves me like a father. Also,\n\t she's loaded. \n\nHe starts off after Margo. As the CAMERA PANS with Bill we\nsee Margo going into the pantry with Max following her. Bill\njoins Addison and Miss Caswell on the stairs. \n\n<b>INT. PANTRY - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt's a good sized one. In the b.g., the caterers are packing\ndishes, glassware, etc. Margo crosses to a cupboard. She\nfinds the bicarb. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Here you are, Maxie dear. One good\n\t burp and you'll be rid of that Miss\n\t Caswell...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t The situation I'm in ain't the kind\n\t you can belch your way out.

She looks like she might\n\t burn down a plantation...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t\t(mixing)\n\t I feel right now like there's one\n\t burning in me. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t When's the audition?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t A couple of weeks. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t I tell you what.

And you could do me a\n\t big favor, if you would-\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t All you got to do is name it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Give Eve Harrington job in you\n\t office.\n\nMax burps. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t You get quick action, don't you?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t Margo, I wouldn't think of taking\n\t that girl away from you...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t You said yourself my inventory was\n\t in good shape - all of my\n\t merchandise put away. To keep her\n\t here with nothing to do - I'd be\n\t standing in her way... and you need\n\t her, Max. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t But what could she do?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t She'd be a great help - read\n\t scripts, interview people you have\n\t to see, get rid of the ones you\n\t don't have to... you'd be a man of\n\t leisure-\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t Well...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO \n</b>\t Think of your health, Max - more\n\t time to relax out in the fresh air\n\t at a race track...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t I don't know if this would be a\n\t wise move...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Promise. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t I promise. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(happily)\n\t That's my Max. \n\nLloyd enters, looking for her. \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t There you are, both of you.

A pause. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Who's left out there?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Too many. And you've got a new\n\t guest. A movie star from Hollywood. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Shucks.

Sometimes, though, I\n\t wish I understood you better.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t When you do, let me in on it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t I will. \n\nAnother pause. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t How's the new one coming?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t The play? All right, I guess...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t \"Cora.\" She's - still a girl of\n\t twenty?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Twentyish.

Isn't that so?\n\t\t(Margo doesn't answer)\n\t You know what this is all about,\n\t don't you? It has very little to do\n\t with whether you should play \"Cora\"\n\t - it has everything to do with the\n\t fact that you've had another fight\n\t with Bill. \n\nA pause. Margo closes the box of bicarb. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Bill's thirty-two. He looks thirty\n\t two. He looked it five years ago,\n\t he'll look it twenty years from\n\t now.

I'll wear rompers and come in\n\t rolling a hoop if you like... let's\n\t go say good night. \n\nThey exit into the dining room. As they open the swinging\ndoor, the CAMERA REMAINS in the doorway. Margo and Lloyd walk\ntoward the stairs. In the b.g., Eve is talking to the group.\nHow much she says is dependent on how long it takes Margo and\nLloyd to reach her. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(in the b.g.)\n\t Imagine... to know, every night,\n\t that different hundreds of people\n\t love you...

She scrambles to her feet...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Don't get up.

He senses\nthe approaching typhoon, he whips it up...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Eve was incredibly modest. She\n\t insisted that no credit was due\n\t her, that Lloyd felt as he did only\n\t because she read lines exactly as\n\t he had written them. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t The implication being that I have\n\t not been reading them as written.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t To the best of my recollection,\n\t neither your name nor your\n\t performance entered the\n\t conversation. \n\nMiss Caswell appears, uncertain, in the b.g.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON \n</b>\t Feeling better, my dear?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMISS CASWELL\n</b>\t Like I just swam the English\n\t Channel.

THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY\n</b>\nThe curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a\ndeteriorating Southern mansion. \n\nThere is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the aisle\nabout two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the\nstage. She is seated; they stand between her and auditorium.\nThere is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot\nmake out. Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace. \n\nShe passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignores\nhim as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears through\nthe door which leads backstage. \n\nMax whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and puts\nhis hands to his head in despair. \n\nMargo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd turn to\nher. Eve rises. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(cheerily)\n\t Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was\n\t long and I couldn't find a cab -\n\t where's Miss Caswell, shall we\n\t start?

Eve stands frozen with fear. Margo yells after Lloyd\ninto the wings. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t And they're getting better\n\t performances today than they ever\n\t got!

Woman to woman?\n\t Including a casual reference to the\n\t part of \"Cora\" - and your hopes of\n\t playing it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I discussed it very openly. I told\n\t her that I had spoken to Lloyd -\n\t and that he was interested. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t She mentioned, of course, that\n\t Margo expects to play the part?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Oddly enough - she didn't say a\n\t word about Margo. Just that she'll\n\t be happy to do what she can to see\n\t that I play the part.   \n\nAddison puffs at his cigarette, bemused. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Just like that, eh?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Just like that. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(thoughtfully)\n\t Do you know, Eve - sometimes I\n\t think you keep things from me. \n\nEve's feelings are hurt. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I don't think that's funny. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t It wasn't meant to be. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I confide in you and rely on you\n\t more than anyone I've ever known!\n\t To say a thing like that now -\n\t without any reason - when I need\n\t you more than ever...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(breaks in)\n\t I hope you mean what you say, Eve.\n\t I intend to hold you to it. \n\nTheir eyes meet. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t We have a great deal in common, it\n\t seems to me...\n\nThey both look as Karen passes them on her way back to her\ntable. \n\nGROUP, as Karen joins them. Another bottle of champagne has\ncome and almost gone - there's a fine, cheery feeling among\nthem. Margo, in particular, is cheery. A pause. Karen downs a\nglass of champagne.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t - well? What happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Nothing much. She apologized. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t With tears?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t With tears. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t But not right away? First the\n\t business of fighting them off, chin\n\t up, stout fella...\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Check. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Very classy stuff, lots of\n\t technique-\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t You mean - all this time - she'd\n\t done nothing but apologize? What'd\n\t you say? \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Not much.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Groom-\n\t\t(Bill says \"huh?\")\n\t - may I have a wedding present? \n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t What would you like? Texas?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t I want everybody to shut up about\n\t Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's\n\t all I want. Give Karen more wine...\n\t\t(blissfully)\n\t ... never have I been so happy.\n\t Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub\n\t Room. What a lovely, clever name.\n\t Where the elite meet. Never have I\n\t seen so much elite - and all with\n\t their eyes on me. Waiting for me to\n\t crack that little gnome over the\n\t noggin with a bottle. But not\n\t tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve...\n\t there they go.  \n\nThey all look. \n\nADDISON AND EVE, they get up and go without looking back.\n\nGROUP, they watch for an instant. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little\n\t Miss Evil. But the evil that men do\n\t - how does it go, groom? Something\n\t about the good they leave behind -\n\t I played it once in rep in Wilkes\n\t Barre...\n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t You've got it backwards. Even for\n\t Wilkes-Barre.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t You know why I forgive Eve? Because\n\t she's left good behind - the four\n\t of us, together like this, it's\n\t Eve's fault - I forgive her...\n\nKaren's reactions are, of course, most important. Knowing\nwhat she's done to Margo - wondering how to do what she must. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve\n\t did that, too. \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t You know, she probably means well,\n\t after all...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t She is a louse. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t\t(to Lloyd)\n\t Never try to outguess Margo. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Groom.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t Yes, dear. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t You know what I'm going to be?\n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t A cowboy. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t A married lady. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t With the paper to prove it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t I'm going to have a home. Not just\n\t a house I'm afraid to stay in...\n\t and a man to go with it. I'll look\n\t up at six o'clock - and there he'll\n\t be... remember, Karen? \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(quietly)\n\t I remember. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(to Bill)\n\t You'll be there, won't you. \n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t\t(grins)\n\t Often enough to keep the franchise. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t A foursquare, upright, downright,\n\t forthright married lady... that's\n\t for me. And no more make believe!\n\t Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.\n\t\t(Lloyd nods)\n\t I mean it, now. Grown-up women\n\t only, I might even play a mother -\n\t only one child, of course, not over\n\t eight...\t\n\t\t(they all smile)\n\t Lloyd, will you promise not to be\n\t angry with me? \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t\t(smiles)\n\t That depends. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t I mean really, deeply angry...\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t I don't think I could be.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t Well. I don't want to play \"Cora.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(explodes)\n\t What?\n\nMargo misinterprets her vehemence. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t\t(hastily)\n\t Now wait a minute, you're always so\n\t touchy about his plays, it isn't\n\t the part - it's a great part. And a\n\t fine play. But not for me anymore -\n\t not a foursquare, upright,\n\t downright, forthright married lady.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t What's your being married got to do\n\t with it? \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t It means I've finally got a life to\n\t live! I don't have to play parts\n\t I'm too old for - just because I've\n\t got nothing to do with my nights!\n\t\t(then quietly)\n\t I know you've made plans. I'll make\n\t it up to you, believe me. I'll tour\n\t a year with this one, anything -\n\t only you do understand - don't you,\n\t Lloyd?\n\nLloyd never gets to answer. Because Karen, before anyone can\nstop her, bursts into hysterical laughter...\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t What's so funny?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Nothing...\n\n<b>\t\t\tBILL \n</b>\t Nothing?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Everything... everything's so\n\t funny... \n\nMargo removes the champagne glass from in front of Karen...\n\n<b>FADE OUT.\n</b>\n<b>FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>INT. THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY\n</b>\nKaren is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box. Lloyd sits\nbeside Max up front.\n\nOn stage, the play is \"on its feet.\" Eve plays a dramatic\nscene with a young man. They carry \"sides\" but do not consult\nthem.\n\nAs she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young man\nwho is forced to turn his back to the auditorium. \n\nBill calls a halt. He indicates to Eve that she was to have\nremained downstage. \n\nEve seems to be at a loss. She looks at Lloyd. \n\nLloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change. \n\nBill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to\nwriting, he'll do the directing. It mounts swiftly to a\nscreaming fight. Bill throws the script out into the\nauditorium, takes his coat and stalks off.\n\nEve runs after him. Max retrieves the script. Lloyd remains\nadamant. Karen has risen in dismay. \n\nEve drags Bill back. Without looking at Lloyd, he takes the\nscript from Max, tells the actors to pick up where they left\noff. \n\nEve whispers to Lloyd from the stage. Lloyd smiles,\nmollified, sits down again with Max. \n\nKaren walks up the side aisle, out of the theater...\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN'S VOICE\n</b>\t Lloyd never got around, somehow -\n\t to asking me whether it was all\n\t right with me for Eve to play\n\t \"Cora\"... Bill, oddly enough,\n\t refused to direct the play at first\n\t - with Eve in it. Lloyd and Max\n\t finally won him over... Margo never\n\t came to a rehearsal, too much to do\n\t around the house, she said. I'd\n\t never known Bill and Lloyd to fight\n\t as bitterly and as often... and\n\t always over some business for Eve,\n\t or a move or the way she read a\n\t speech... but then I'd never known\n\t Lloyd to meddle as much with Bill's\n\t directing - as far as it affected\n\t Eve, that is... somehow, Eve kept\n\t them going. Bill stuck it out - and\n\t Lloyd seemed happy - and I thought\n\t it might be best if I skipped\n\t rehearsals from then on... \n\n<b>INT. RICHARDS' BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt is a lovely, large room. Two double beds, not alongside\neach other and each with an extension phone beside it. In\naddition to the door to the living room, there are two more -\nto separate dressing rooms and baths. Lloyd is asleep. But\nnot Karen. She turns restlessly, finally sits up, lights a\ncigarette. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN'S VOICE\n</b>\t It seemed to me I had known always\n\t that it would happen - and here it\n\t was.\n\t It felt helpless, that helplessness\n\t you feel when you have no talent to\n\t offer - outside of loving your\n\t husband. How could I compete?\n\t Everything Lloyd loved about me, he\n\t had gotten used to long ago... \n\nThe phone jangles suddenly, startling her. It wakes Lloyd up.\nKaren answers. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Hello... who?... who's calling Mr.\n\t Richards?\n\n<b>INT. ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA girl, in a wrapper, at a wall phone. Her hair's in curlers.\nShe's frightened. \n\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t My name wouldn't mean anything. I\n\t room across the hall from Eve\n\t Harrington, and she isn't well.\n\t She's been crying all night and\n\t hysterical, and she doesn't want a\n\t doctor...\n\nRICHARDS' BEDROOM, Lloyd is sitting on the edge of the bed,\nlooking over...\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Who is it? What's it all about?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(into phone)\n\t Did Miss Harrington tell you to\n\t call Mr. Richards?\n\nLloyd picks up his phone. \n\n<b>ROOMING HOUSE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t No, Eve didn't say to call him, but\n\t I remembered I saw Mr. Richards\n\t with her a couple of times - and I\n\t thought they being such good\n\t friends...\n\n<b>RICHARDS' BEDROOM\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t\t(into phone)\n\t Hello...hello, this is Lloyd\n\t Richards. Where is Eve? Let me talk\n\t to her-\n\n<b>ROOMING HOUSE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t She's up in her room, Mr. Richards.\n\t I really hate to bother you like\n\t this, but the way Eve's been\n\t feeling - I'm just worried sick\n\t what with her leaving for New Haven\n\t tomorrow, and everything...\n\n<b>RICHARDS' BEDROOM\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Tell her not to worry - tell her\n\t I'll be right over. \n\n<b>ROOMING HOUSE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t I'll tell her, Mr. Richards.\n\nShe hangs up. As she moves from the phone, the ANGLE WIDENS\nto disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs. The girls smile at\neach other. They go upstairs, arm in arm. \n\nRICHARDS' BEDROOM, Karen is still in bed, phone still in her\nhand. She hangs up, swings her legs out, puts out her\ncigarette, gets into a robe. The open door and light of the\ndressing room tell us where Lloyd is.\n\nKaren walks to the door, starts to say something, changes her\nmind. She crosses to a table, lights a fresh cigarette, comes\nback to the door. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t\t(finally)\n\t Aren't you... broadening the duties\n\t of a playwright just a bit? Rushing\n\t off in the middle of the night \n\t like a country doctor?\n\nNo answer except the opening and closing of drawers. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t What would you do if, instead of\n\t Eve, the leading man had called up\n\t to say her was hysterical?\n\nStill no answer. Her tension increasing, Karen goes back to\nthe table, snubs out the fresh cigarette, then strides\nswiftly back to the open door. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Lloyd, I don't want you to go!\n\nNow Lloyd appears. He's in flannels, and a sport shirt with\nno tie. He's confused and guilty and tortured.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t I didn't think you would! It seems\n\t to me, Karen, that for some tine,\n\t now, you've been developing a deep\n\t unconcern for the feeling of human\n\t being in general-\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t I'm a human being, I've got some!\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t\t(goes right on)\n\t - and for my feelings in\n\t particular! For my play, my career -\n\t and now for a frightened,\n\t hysterical girl on the eve of her\n\t first night in the Theater!\n\nHe goes back into his room. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Have you forgotten about Eve? What\n\t she is, what she's done?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t Old wives' tales, born of envy and\n\t jealousy! And a phobia against\n\t truth!\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Then tell me this isn't true! That\n\t your concern for your play and\n\t career is one thing - and that poor\n\t frightened hysterical girl another -\n\t and that your concern for her has\n\t nothing to do with either your play\n\t or your career!\n\nLloyd comes out wearing a jacket. He crosses to the door,\nKaren after him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t That first, last, and foremost -\n\t your reason for going now is that\n\t you want to be with Eve! Three in\n\t the morning or high noon - play or\n\t no play - wife or no wife!\n\t\t(Lloyd stops at the door)\n\t Isn't it true, Lloyd?\n\nLloyd goes out. Karen looks after him, despairing.\n\n<b>EXT. SHUBERT THEATER - NEW HAVEN - DAY\n</b>\nThe theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL. The\nmarquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards, presented by\nMax Fabian, opening tonight. \n\nAddison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo\non a lobby display. None of the actors are starred. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON'S VOICE\n</b>\t To the Theater world - New Haven,\n\t Connecticut, is a short stretch of\n\t sidewalk between the Shubert\n\t Theater and the Taft Hotel,\n\t surrounded by what looks very much\n\t like a small city. It is here that\n\t managers have what are called out\n\t of-town openings - which are\n\t openings for New Yorkers who want\n\t to go out of town...\n\nThey start for the hotel - Eve's arm through Addison's.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t What a day - what a heavenly day...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t D-day.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Just like it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t And tomorrow morning you will have\n\t won your beachhead on the shores of\n\t Immortality...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(grins)\n\t Stop rehearsing your column...\n\t Isn't it strange, Addison?\n\t I thought I'd be panic-stricken,\n\t want to run away or something.\n\t Instead, I can't wait for tonight\n\t to come. To come and go...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Are you that sure of tomorrow?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Aren't you?\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Frankly - yes.\n\nThey've arrived in front of the hotel. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t It'll be a night to remember. It'll\n\t bring to me everything I've ever\n\t wanted. The end of an old road -\n\t and the beginning of a new one...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t All paved with diamonds and gold?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t You know me better than that. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Paved with what, then?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Stars.\n\nShe goes in. Addison follows her. \n\n<b>INT. CORRIDOR - TAFT HOTEL - DAY\n</b>\nAddison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t What time?\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Almost four.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Plenty of time for a nice long nap -\n\t we rehearsed most of last night...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t You could sleep, too, couldn't you?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Why not?\n\nThey've arrived at her door. She opens it. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t The mark of a true killer.\n\t\t(he holds out his hand)\n\t Sleep tight, rest easy - and come\n\t out fighting...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Why'd call me a killer?\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Did I say killer? I meant champion.\n\t I get my boxing terms mixed. \n\nHe turns to go. After a few steps-\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(calling)\n\t Addison-\n\t\t(he pauses)\n\t - come on in for just a minute,\n\t won't you? There's... I've got\n\t something to tell you. \n\nAddison turns curiously, and enters behind her. \n\n<b>INT. EVE'S SUITE - TAFT HOTEL - DAY\n</b>\nOld-fashioned, dreary and small. The action starts in the\nliving room and continues to the bedroom. \n\nAddison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Suites are for expense accounts.\n\t Aren't you being extravagant? \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd\n\t had a terrific row but Lloyd\n\t insisted... well. Can I fix you a\n\t drink?\n\nShe indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor,\nglasses, etc. Addison's eyebrows lift.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Also with the reluctant compliments\n\t of Max Fabian. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Lloyd. I never have any, and he\n\t likes a couple of drinks after we\n\t finish - so he sent it up...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Some plain soda.\n\t\t(Eve starts to fix it)\n\t Lloyd must be expecting a record\n\t run in New Haven...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t That's for tonight. You're invited.\n\t We're having everyone up after the\n\t performance. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t We're?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Lloyd and I.\n\nShe carries the soda to him, sits on an ottoman at his feet. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t I find it odd that Karen isn't here\n\t for the opening, don't you?\n\nHe sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look at\nEve. As he looks back-\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Addison...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(blandly)\n\t She's always been so fantastically\n\t devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine\n\t that only death or destruction\n\t could keep her-\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(breaks in)\n\t Addison, just a few minutes ago.\n\t When I told you this would be a\n\t night to remember - that it would\n\t bring me everything I wanted-\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(nods)\n\t - something about an old road\n\t ending and a new one starting -\n\t paved with stars...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I didn't mean just the Theater.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t What else?\n\nEve gets up, crosses to look out over the Common.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE \n</b>\t\t(her back to him)\n\t Lloyd Richards. He's going to leave\n\t Karen. We're going to be married.\n\nFor just a flash, Addison's eyes narrow coldly, viciously.\nThen they crinkle into a bland smile. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the\n\t Theater, after all...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(turns; shocked)\n\t It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd\n\t loves me, I love him!\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t I know nothing about Lloyd and his\n\t loves - I leave those to Louisa May\n\t Alcott. But I do know you.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I'm in love with Lloyd!\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Lloyd Richards is commercially the\n\t most successful playwright in\n\t America-\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t You have no right to say such\n\t things!\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t - and artistically, the most\n\t promising! Eve dear, this is\n\t Addison.\n\nEve drops her shocked manner like a cape. Her face lights up -\nshe crosses back to the ottoman. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Addison, won't it be just perfect?\n\t Lloyd and I - there's no telling\n\t how far we can go... he'll write\n\t great plays for me, I'll make them\n\t be great!\n\t\t(as she sits)\n\t You're the only one I've told, the\n\t only one that knows except Lloyd\n\t and me...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t ... and Karen.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t She doesn't know. \n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t She knows enough not to be here.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t But not all of it - not that Lloyd\n\t and I are going to be married.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(thoughtfully)\n\t I see. And when was this unholy\n\t alliance joined?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t We decided the night before last,\n\t before we came up here...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(increasingly tense)\n\t Was the setting properly romantic -\n\t the lights on dimmers, gypsy\n\t violins off stage?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t The setting wasn't romantic, but\n\t Lloyd was.

Eve is tense and wary.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Your name is not Eve Harrington.

Addison eyes her keenly. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t A matter of opinion. Granted. It is\n\t also true that you worked in a\n\t brewery. But life in the brewery\n\t was apparently not as dull as you\n\t pictured it. As a matter of fact,\n\t it got less and less dull - until\n\t you boss's wife had your boss\n\t followed by detectives!\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(whirls on him)\n\t She never proved anything, not a\n\t thing!\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t But the $500 you got to get out of\n\t town brought you straight to New\n\t York - didn't it?\n\nEve turns and runs into the bedroom, slamming the door.\nAddison opens it, follows close after her... he can be seen\nin the bedroom, shouting at Eve who is offscene.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t That $500 brought you straight to\n\t New York - didn't it?\n\n<b>INT.

There was no Eddie - no\n\t pilot - and you've never been\n\t married! That was not only a lie,\n\t but an insult to dead heroes and to\n\t the women who loved them...\n\t\t(Eve, sobbing, puts her\n\t\t hands over her ears;\n\t\t Addison, closer, pulls\n\t\t them away)\n\t ... Fifth. San Francisco has no\n\t Shubert Theater and North Shore,\n\t you've never been to San Francisco!\n\t That was a stupid lie, easy to\n\t expose, not worthy of you...\n\nEve twists to look up at him, her eyes streaming.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I had to get in, to meet Margo! I\n\t had to say something, be somebody,\n\t make her like me!\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t She did like you, she helped and\n\t trusted you! You paid her back by\n\t trying to take Bill away!\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t That's not true!\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t I was there, I saw you and heard\n\t you through the dressing room door!\n\nEve turns face down again, sobbing miserably.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t You used my name and my column to\n\t blackmail Karen into getting you\n\t the part of \"Cora\" - and you lied\n\t to me about it!\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(into the bed)\n\t No-no-no...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t I had lunch with Karen not three\n\t hours ago.

But that, in\n\t itself, is probably the reason.\n\t You're an improbable person, Eve,\n\t and so am I. We have that in\n\t common. Also a contempt for\n\t humanity, an inability to love or\n\t be loved, insatiable ambition - and\n\t talent. We deserve each other. Are\n\t you listening to me?\n\nEve lies listlessly now, her tear-stained cheek against the\ncoverlet. She nods.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Then say so. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Yes, Addison.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t And you realize - you agree how\n\t completely you belong to me?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Yes, Addison.\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t Take your nap, now.

The CAMERA REMAINS on Eve's forlorn, tear\nstained face. Her eyes close... she goes to sleep.\n\n<b>INT.

Eve accepts the award\nfrom the Aged Actor, kisses him tenderly, folds the award to\nher bosom and waits for quiet.\n\nShe speaks with assurance, yet modestly and humbly.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Honored members of Sarah Siddons\n\t Society, distinguished guests,\n\t ladies and gentlemen: What is there\n\t for me to say? Everything wise and\n\t witty has long since been said - by\n\t minds more mature and talents far\n\t greater than mine. For me to thank\n\t you as equals would be presumptuous\n\t - I am an apprentice in the Theater\n\t and have much to learn from you\n\t all. I can say only that I am proud\n\t and happy and that I regard this\n\t great honor not so much as an award\n\t for what I have achieved, but as a\n\t standard to hold against what I\n\t have yet to accomplish.\n\t\t(applause)\n\t And further, I regard it as\n\t bestowed upon me only in part. The\n\t larger share belongs to my friends\n\t in the Theater - and to the Theater\n\t itself, which has given me all I\n\t have. In good conscience, I must\n\t give credit where credit is due. To\n\t Max Fabian-\n\nMAX sits erect, beaming proudly.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE'S VOICE\n</b>\t - dear Max. Dear, sentimental,\n\t generous, courageous Max Fabian -\n\t who took a chance on an unknown,\n\t untried, amateur...\n\nEVE, after applause greets Max. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t And to my first friend in the\n\t Theater - whose kindness and\n\t graciousness I shall never\n\t forget... Karen - Mrs. Lloyd\n\t Richards...\n\nKAREN resumes her doodling as applause breaks out for her...\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE'S VOICE\n</b>\t ... and it was Karen who first\n\t brought me to one whom I had always\n\t idolized - and who was to become my\n\t benefactor and champion. A great\n\t actress and a great woman - Margo\n\t Channing.\n\nMARGO, part of Eve's tribute has been over her CLOSE-UP. She\nsmiles grimly in reaction to the applause.\n\nEVE looks to her right, waits for the applause to die. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t My director - who demanded always a\n\t little more than my talent could\n\t provide-\n\nBILL, seated at the speakers' table. He has his award before\nhim - a smaller one. He puts out a cigarette expressionlessly\nas the applause breaks out. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t - but who taught me patiently and\n\t well... Bill Sampson.\n\nLLOYD sits beside Bill. He, too, has a smaller award. As Eve\nspeaks, he throws her a brief glance. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE'S VOICE\n</b>\t And one, without whose great play\n\t and faith in me, this night would\n\t never have been. How can I repay\n\t Lloyd Richards?\n\nEVE waits for the applause to die. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Hoe can I repay the many others? So\n\t many, that I couldn't possibly name\n\t them all...\n\nADDISON smiles approvingly. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE'S VOICE\n</b>\t ... whose help, guidance and advice\n\t have made this, the happiest night\n\t of my life, possible. \n\nEVE stares at the award for an instant, as if fighting for\nself-control.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Although I am going to Hollywood\n\t next week to make a film - do not\n\t think for a moment that I am\n\t leaving you. How could I? For my\n\t heart is here in the Theater - and\n\t three thousand miles are too far to\n\t be away from one's heart.\n\t I'll be back to claim it - and\n\t soon. That is, if you want me back.\n\nAnother storm of applause. Much ad lib shouting as Bill and\nLloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures.\nPeople are thronging out. The Aged Actor shouts above the\nhubbub...\n\n<b>\t\t\tAGED ACTOR\n</b>\t A good night to all - and to all a\n\t good night!\n\nEve disengages herself from the photographers, makes her way\ntoward Addison's table...

He gives her the award. \n\n<b>\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t For services rendered - beyond the\n\t whatever-it-is-of-duty, darling.\n\nMax bustles into the SHOT.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t Come on!

Karen pauses at Eve.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKAREN\n</b>\t Congratulations, Eve. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Thank you, Karen.\n\nKaren goes. Eve is being constantly congratulated. Some ad\nlib about seeing her at Max's party...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAX\n</b>\t\t(to Addison)\n\t I'm giving her a very high-class\n\t party. It ain't like a rehearsal,\n\t she don't have to be late. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t As soon as the peasants stop pawing\n\t her. \n\nMax hurries out. Margo and Bill step into the SHOT. Eve turns\nfrom a well-wisher to face her. \n\n<b>\t\t\tMARGO\n</b>\t ... nice speech, Eve. But I\n\t wouldn't worry too much about your\n\t heart. You can always put that\n\t award where your heart ought to be. \n\nEve looks at her wordlessly. Margo and Bill leave. Addison\nand Eve are alone. The tables about them are empty. Suddenly,\nher face becomes expressionless, her eyes dull... she glances\nat the table.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I don't suppose there's a drink\n\t left...\n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t You can have one at Max's. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t\t(sits)\n\t I don't think I'm going. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(sighs)\n\t Why not?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Because I don't want to. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(patiently)\n\t Max has gone to a great deal of\n\t trouble, it's going to be an\n\t elaborate party, and it's for you. \n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t No, it's not.\n\t\t(she holds up the award)\n\t It's for this. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t It's the same thing, isn't it?\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t Exactly.\n\t\t(she gives him the award)\n\t Here. Take it to the party instead\n\t of me. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t You're being childish.\n\nA well-wisher rushes up to Eve with an \"Eve, darling, I'm so\nhappy!\" Eve rises, thanks her graciously. Then she pulls her\nwrap over her shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVE\n</b>\t I'm tired. I want to go home. \n\n<b>\t\t\tADDISON\n</b>\t\t(curtly)\n\t Very well. I shall drop you and go\n\t on to the party. I have no\n\t intention of missing it...\n\nThey exit from the room, now empty of everything but tables,\nwaiters, and the usual banquet debris. \n\n<b>EXT. PARK AVENUE - NIGHT\n</b>\nEve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment\nhotel. She doesn't say good night to Addison, she enters the\nhotel as the cab drives off.

The bedroom and living room do not\nconnect except through the foyer. \n\nAll the lights are out. Eve turns them on in the foyer, the\nsame as she enters the bedroom. There are some new trunks, in\nvarious stages of being packed. Eve tosses her wrap on the\nbed, goes through the foyer to the living room.\n\nShe turns on the light in the living room. CAMERA FOLLOWS her\nto a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink.
