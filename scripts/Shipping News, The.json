LAUNDROMAT, MOCKINGBURG, NEW YORK - NIGHT\n\nGlaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes,\nempty Coke machine flashing all lights orange. Only two dryers are\nhumming. It's very late. Keep PANNING to...\n\n...a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumpled\nnewspapers from a dryer. She flattens and folds them meticulously,\nher glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission.\n\n...a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on\na neat cloth atop a dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette,\nolives. Bottle of red. An air of competence, of indomitable\nupbeatness. He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were\nnormal. More curious about...\n\n...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if\ncramming for life's midterm exam. Thoughtful. Circles one,\nslowly. Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and four\nempty snickers wrappers. His version of cold supper. He reaches\nfor the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he...\n\n...rises. Goes to the candy machine. Drops in his 65 cents, hits\nthe button. The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the\nmechanism at the last moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One more\nretelling of the story of his life. He BANGS the machine half-\nheartedly. Nope. Shakes it with his shambling strength. Nada.\nPOUNDS the coin return button. Hat trick. He empties his pocket.\nStudies the results. Not enough. And without so much as a sigh...\n\n...he ambles back to his dryer. Starts to unwrap the last\nSnickers. Partridge taking this all in. But Mata Hari of the\nNeat Newspapers goes to the candy machine, KICKS it violently. Out\nfall the Snickers and the 65 cents. She scoops up both, turns in a\nsingle motion to...\n\n...GLARE death at the enemy. Quoyle opens his mouth to comment.\nBut. Doesn't. Resumes unwrapping his supper, as...\n\n...his dryer STOPS. He pops it open. Stares in. Blinks.\nSuddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor\nto reveal they have been...\n\n...STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid the\npile. This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level. The\nbig, soft face is pitifully, yes, even adorably, devastated.\n\n                             QUOYLE (a murmur)\n                Ruined.\n\nAnd to the bystander.     This seems a comment on more than shirts.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE (softly)\n                Nah. Rub the ink with hot salt and\n                talcum powder.\n\nQuoyle's head WHIPS around.     As if he thought he was alone.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                If you're shocked when someone aims\n                kindness your way. That oughta tell\n                you somethin' about yourself.\n\nWatches the little guy's undemanding smile.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O., just staring)\n                Then again. If you're that kinda\n                guy. It don't.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                And put a cuppa bleach in, next\n                time through.\n\nAs Quoyle gazes at his benefactor, the woman sneaks up, SNATCHES\nhis Help Wanted ads. Races them over to her dryer. As the boys\nwatch, she shoves them in, starts the machine with Quoyle's coins,\nand glares fiercely back at us. A mother bear protecting her cubs.\nPartridge chuckles. Holds out his hand...\n\n                             PARTRIDGE\n                Partridge.\n\nQuoyle glances at the little man's cold fowl supper.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                Uh.   No thanks.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                It's my name.\n\nOh.\n\nINT. MOCKINGBURG RECORD CITY ROOM - DAY\n\nShabby one-floor newspaper. Old equipment, listless personnel,\nstale you can smell from here. Only guy working is Partridge, who\nis laying out the front page, and glances up to see across the\nfloor...\n\n...Quoyle enter in his best suit. It is also his worst suit.\nPartridge points to the only enclosed office, and gives his buddy a\nhearty thumbs-up. Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a\nglaze of panic. We see now that he is chewing, somehow. On the\nway into the office, he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the\ncoffee. Enters...\n\nINT. ED PUNCH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n...ED PUNCH, managing editor, looks up from a reverie with a\nstartled expression. He wears really thick glasses which MAGNIFY\nhis eyes, giving him a frightening aspect.\n\n                             PUNCH\n\n                 Quoyle?     You're early.\n\nFrom the rear, we see Quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the\nchair.\n\n                           PUNCH\n                 I don't like that.\n\nAll the change SPILLS out of Quoyle's pockets, and CLATTERS onto\nthe wood floor, ROLLING interminably, as Quoyle fidgets.\n\n                           PUNCH\n                 Partridge says you're not as\n                 dumb as you look.\n\nREVERSE ANGLE now to see Quoyle's face.        The neat moustache of\npowdered sugar.\n\n                           QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                 How could I be?\n\nAnd takes a healthy bite from what's left of the doughnut.\n\n                           PUNCH\n                 Anyway, that's why I'm takin' a chance\n                 on you. Partridge said he'd re-write\n                 whatever of your stuff. Stay late...\n\nQuoyle nods, dumbly.     Knows this.\n\n                           PUNCH\n                 We're a family paper. Upbeat\n                 stories with a community slant.\n                 Self-help stuff: Are You a Break-\n                 fast Alcoholic?...Guide to Getting\n                 Dumped...like that.\n\nQuoyle nods bigger. Like he gets it.         Punch shoves an antique tape\nrecorder across the table.\n\n                           PUNCH\n                 City Planning Board meeting at two-\n                 thirty. Three hunnerd words max.\n                 Sink or swim.\n\nHOLD on Quoyle's eyes.      Recalling...\n\nFLASHBACK:   EXT. PUBLIC POOL - DAY\n\n...Quoyle as a fat kid in a baggy bathing suit, being savagely\npummeled by his vicious OLDER BROTHER...\n\n                           QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                 I think my brother said that once.\n\n                              BROTHER\n                 LARDASS!     SNOTFACE!    FARTBAG!\n\nBeing pulled off the sniveling Quoyle by a rough hairy man with\ndead eyes.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                Maybe it was my father.\n\nQuoyle's FATHER hauls him off the deck, and in a single motion,\nFLINGS him INTO the pool!\n\n                          FATHER\n                Sink or swim, pig-butt.\n\nWatches the THRASHING with mild contempt.     Turns away before Quoyle\nsimply SINKS beneath the surface.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                I'm not a water person.\n\nINT. CITY ROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\nThe empty room a haven of dust motes floating in sickly fluor-\nescence. Quoyle sits across the desk, gazing with endearing\nfearfulness as Partridge turns page after page...\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                See, three hunnerd words would be,\n                like, one page. This is...oh,\n                fifteen, sixteen.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                So we should cut it.\n\nPartridge does glance up on that.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                Gonna have to.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                Or you could tie me in a sack, throw\n                me in the river. Tell the police you\n                thought it was oddly-wrapped lard.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                Might be quicker.\n\nNobody smiles. Nobody has to. Quoyle pulls a big glass jar from a\npaper sack. Sets it on the desk.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                Does your wife like special pickles?\n                They're fine with cold cuts.\n\nPartridge looks at the cornichons.     They look expensive.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                Come by for supper, tomorrow.     We'll\n\n                   find out.\n\nDISSOLVE to...\n\nEXT. PARTRIDGE'S BACK YARD - DAY\n\nSausages on the BBQ, interesting colors and sizes. A huge hand\ndelicately places cut-up pieces of quail on the grill. It is\nQuoyle, trusted, paying attention. MERCALIA, a slim black woman\nwith fiery eyes and an enticing smile, hands him a glass of white\nwine, and...\n\n...goes to slip her arm around Partridge. He watches Quoyle's\nconcentration approvingly. Shares a smile with his sexy wife.       And\nraps a knife on his glass. Announcement.\n\nQuoyle looks up with innocent eyes.         Which makes Partridge\nhesitate.\n\n                                PARTRIDGE\n                   We.     Got you this.\n\nMercalia takes out the package. Wrapped in tissue, a neat ribbon.\nShe hands it to Quoyle, and leans up to kiss his cheek. Quoyle\nlooks down at it, dumbfounded. A silence.\n\n                             MERCALIA\n                   It's...an anniversary present.\n                   Anniversary of our friendship.\n\nQuoyle smiles.     Sweet and slightly confused.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Seven and a half month anniversary?\n\nHe starts to unwrap...\n\n                                PARTRIDGE\n                   Well.     Why wait?\n\n...a wristwatch.     A nice one.     He is overwhelmed, but still\nuncomprehending.\n\n                              MERCALIA\n                   It's because we're happy.      About\n                   something.\n\nAnd steals a glance at her husband.\n\n                             QUOYLE (BIG grin)\n                   You're havin' a baby!\n\nThat stops Partridge's face.        No more stalling...\n\n                             PARTRIDGE\n                   Mercalia and me are movin'.\n                   To California. Friday night.\n\nQuoyle so pole-axed he can't even lose the smile.    It just turns\nstupid and transparent. His friend swallows.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                You know she's been learnin' to\n                drive a rig. She got the Oakland\n                to New Orleans run. I'm gonna\n                make her smoked duck sandwiches for\n                the road. I can edit copy anywhere.\n\nQuoyle nodding slowly, smile still there. Yep. I guess y'can.\nPartridge sees that it's a death blow. Mercalia looks at her feet.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                Love's all that counts.   It's the\n                engine of life.\n\nAs if parting advice. As if Quoyle should file that away.      So\nQuoyle nods some more. As if he will.\n\n                          PARTRIDGE\n                We'll just. Stay in touch.\n\nOn this, Quoyle's smile deserts him. So Partridge reaches out his\nhand. Quoyle paralyzed, then takes it. CLOSE ON their handclasp,\nand DISSOLVE to...\n\nINT. DOUBLETREE MEETING ROOM - EVENING\n\n...a slender feminine hand.   Buried in Quoyle's.\n\n                          PETAL (O.S.)\n                Petal Bear, Mr. Quoyle.\n\nPAN up to see her. Tiny, twitchy, moist ringlets. A gray-eyed\npredator. She looks around at the milling suits and their name\ntags. As if they were alternatives.\n\n                          PETAL\n                Do you hate this shit, or what?\n\nQuoyle transfixed by her slight form in its loose but clingy\nwrapping. The smile that sees him again and flickers...\n\n                          PETAL\n                What do you think? You want to\n                marry me, don't you?\n\nDon't you? No answer. She laughs, as if at some off-color\nresponse. Runs hot fingers up his arm, leaning to his face...\n\n                          PETAL\n                Buy me a drink somewhere, it's\n                seven-thirty. I think I'm going\n                to fuck you by ten. What do you\n                think of that?\n\nQuoyle.   Blinks.     She laughs again.   Bright, like whiskey music.\n\n                              PETAL\n                    You are quite. The raconteur.\n\nINT. QUOYLE'S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT\n\nPetal naked in near-darkness, moves with authority toward the\nmassive lumpy creature nearly overflowing his bed. Draws the\ncovers back.\n\nStares.\n\n                               PETAL\n                    Christ.   I won the lottery.\n\nClimbs on, the lithe move of a leopardess.         Feeding time.\n\n                              QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                    It was pretty much like that for\n                    a month.\n\nPetal RIDING in silhouette, with great, violent swoops.            CLOSE on\nhis face, his eyes. Lovelight.\n\n                              QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                    Somewhere in there. We got married.\n\nINT. BAR - NIGHT\n\nHorrible place. Smoke and bodies. Quoyle alone, carrying his\nsloshing beer, apologies unheard, toward...\n\n                              QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                    After that, I had to follow her to\n                    see her.\n\n...the back of Petal, talking to a big guy in a shiny suit.\n\n                              QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                    Which I know was wrong of me.\n\nCloser.   Close enough to hear...\n\n                              PETAL\n                    What do you think? You want to\n                    marry me, don't you?\n\nHOLD on Quoyle's face. The lovelight has never left.          It shines\nthrough the shock. As if in apology...\n\n                              QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                    She didn't know she was pregnant.\n\nDISSOLVE to...\n\nINT. PARLOR - DAY\n\nOne-year-old BUNNY is SCREAMING in a rickety crib festooned with\nmobiles and bright toys. HEAR Quoyle POUNDING in. He reaches to\nlift her...\n\n...WAY UP, starts running around the faded little parlor making\ncheerful airplane noises, as he DIVES and SWOOPS the shrieking kid,\nuntil he...\n\n...stops. Sniffs. Oh. Gives her a kiss, which doesn't put a dent\nin the screaming, and flops her down on the diaper table. She is\nscreaming LOUDER. He is fumbling with the diaper, the Baby Wipes,\ngetting a wad of ten or so at once. When...\n\n...the phone rings. He runs off. Runs back, lifts Bunny, diaper\ndangling from the tape stuck to her skin, and SNATCHES up the\nphone, hoping with everything in him that it's...\n\n                          PETAL (O.S.)\n                 Hey. How do you make an Alabama\n                 Slammer?\n\nHe takes a breath.     Can hear the noise of a rowdy spot.     Country\njuke box.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                 Uh.    Where are y...\n\n                              PETAL (O.S.)\n                 Alabama.     Hence, the question.\n\nBunny.   Has stopped screaming.\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                 Come home.     I'll make you one.\n\n                           PETAL (O.S.)\n                 That's a swell idea. Now go look on\n                 top of the fridge, where I keep the\n                 Mr. Boston. I'll wait.\n\nWhat should he do? He sets Bunny carefully on the floor. She\nstarts screaming again, and he LIFTS her quick, cuddles her. LOPES\noff, leaving the phone on the floor...\n\n...RACES back in with the Mr. Boston, a bag of pork rinds, and\na pacifier. Something for everyone. As he flips the pages, he\nmurmurs into the phone...\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                 You okay?     Except for being thirsty?\n\nShe laughs, almost friendly.      He smiles.   Ever hopeful.\n\n                           PETAL (O.S.)\n                 I'm busy, I'll see y...\n\n                             QUOYLE (reads)\n                   Ounce Southern Comfort, ounce Sloe\n                   Gin.

He glances down at Bunny,\nworking the pacifier. Murmurs to the receiver...\n\n                               QUOYLE\n                   Me too.    I'll tell Bunny you miss her.\n\nHang up the phone. Kiss a baby. Eat a pork rind. Slow. As he\ngazes down on Bunny, we PUSH INTO her face, and MATCH DISSOLVE\nto...\n\nINT. BUNNY'S ROOM - NIGHT, FIVE YEARS LATER\n\n...an ECU of Bunny, now six years old, asleep in the flickering\nblue light of a nearly-mute TV. Apparently she was watching\nSportscenter. PAN the darkened shoebox room. Toys everywhere, in\na clutter. A pile of used Barbies, limbs jutting in all\ndirections, waiting for a mass grave. BACK to Bunny, to see...\n\n...she sleeps in her father's lap. His chin resting on her head,\nan industrial-size bag of cookies handy. Somewhere, a door OPENS..\n\n...SLAMS HARD. Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurches\nINTO the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and he\nhurries to stop the door before it slams in his face.\n\nWhen she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever.\nHer laser glare. What the fuck do you want?\n\n                               QUOYLE\n                   There's.    Cold chicken.\n\nReally? She tears off her jacket, revealing that she has left her\nshirt somewhere and is down to her bra. She stalks toward him.\nStraight to the doorway. He flinches.\n\n                             PETAL\n                   Find yourself. A girlfriend.\n                   With what you got down there,\n                   you'll do fine.\n\nQuoyle swallows.     Shakes his head.\n\n                             PETAL\n                   Only thing can work, here.    Is\n                   divorce.\n\nNo.   No.   Tears of shock pool in his eyes.\n\n                           QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                 I knew we had our problems. But\n                 I never thought I'd hear that word.\n\nShe shivers with disgust. Walks around in a frustrated circle.\nBack to his face. Are you sure? What does a girl have to do? And\nnow...\n\n...the tears are on his face.     She flashes her hardest look.      And\nyet...\n\n...her slender fingers reach out.     Wipe his face, not as roughly as\nshe might have intended.\n\n                           PETAL\n                 Your funeral, pussy.\n\nAnd CLOSES the door, quietly, but firmly.      In his face.\n\nHe stares at it. His lips part. But no sound comes.           Instead, he\nwalks the few steps to Bunny's room, to find her...\n\n...wide awake.   Sitting on the edge of her bed.     No question, she\nheard it all.\n\nSo Quoyle smiles. He reaches to the top of her battered armoire.\nHis eyes damp but dancing for his daughter. Pulls down...\n\n...a box of chocolates. Their stash.       He sits on the floor.     Opens\nthe lid, like buried treasure.\n\nShe comes to cuddle in his lap.     He feeds her one.   She feeds him\none. They've done this before.      As they chew...\n\n                           QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                 I knew if I could take it. In the\n                 end. It would all work out.\n\nINT. CITY ROOM - MIDDAY\n\nEveryone trooping back from lunch, twos and threes. Quoyle last,\nalone, still stuffing down a snack cake as he heads for the coffee\npot. There's one answering machine for everybody here, glowing a\nred number 2. Someone hits it, and everybody shuts up a beat, to\nsee if they got lucky.\n\n                           MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n                 Lila, it's Daniel.

A shrug is plenty.\n\n                           FATHER (O.S.)\n                 Quoyle, this is your father. Calling\n                 you. Dicky's machine is full. Your\n                 home one's broke. Well. It's time\n                 for your mother and I to go.\n\nQuoyle listening.      Go?\n\n                              FATHER (O.S.)\n                    Instructions about the undertaker.\n                    The cremation.

Lots of them.\n\n                              FATHER (O.S.)\n                    You'll have to make your own way.\n                    I did. Nobody gave me nuthin'.\n                    Other men woulda give up, turned to\n                    bums. I sweated, wheeled barrows of\n                    sand, went without so you and yer\n                    brother could have advantages. Not\n                    that you did much with your chances.\n\nEverybody just openly staring now.       Quoyle's snack cake and coffee\nfrozen in mid-air.\n\n                              FATHER (O.S.)\n                    Hasn't been much of a life.

Sounded that way. Despite the hateful coarseness of\nthis message, Quoyle is deeply moved. Lips pursed inward to stem\ntears. In the silence...\n\n                              FAT GUY (trying)\n                    Were they sick, or something?\n\nQuoyle stares into distance.       Somewhere, feet shuffle.\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                    Brain tumor and liver cancer.\n                            (afterthought)\n                    One apiece.\n\n                              FAT GAL (sad for him)\n                    That's rough.\n\nHe nods, it is that. Wanders       on over to his desk. They're still\nwatching, but he doesn't seem      to notice. Turns his ratty Rolodex\nwith solemn slowness. Not to       dishonor the moment. Finds the\nnumber, dials. Winces at the       harshness of the voice he hears.\nThen...\n\n                               QUOYLE\n                    Dicky.   It's Mom and Poppa.

QUOYLE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nQuoyle enters carrying a spray of violets.     HEAR Springer turned up\nloud. He goes to the parlor to find...\n\n...MRS. MOOSUP, the babysitter, smoking and swigging a Pepsi.

QUOYLE'S PARENTS' HOME, BROOKLYN - DAY\n\nQuoyle moving in his parents' cluttered parlor like a man\nunderwater. A room as drab, as neglected, as Brooklyn through\nthe window. He stands at a shelf now, staring at a row of framed\nphotos. Lifts one...\n\n...a BOY of 15, bundled for winter, stands by a frozen pond.\nStocky, sullen, something unpleasant in the narrow eyes. Next\nto him, not touching, a GIRL, big for 12. Rawboned, husky. Flat\ngaze, like something's dead or hidden.\n\nQuoyle walks to the table. A cardboard box has been filled with\nmementos. A slip of paper: AGNIS HAMM, a telephone number. The\nphone is RINGING now. Quoyle staring at the paper. Finally, lifts\nthe phone, breathes an absent greeting, and...\n\n                           MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n                 Is this Mr. Guy Quoyle?\n\n                           QUOYLE (weary)\n                 He's not here.\n\n                           MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n                 This is Lt.

COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES - DAY\n\nQuoyle moving his bulk FAST down a corridor, a uniformed COP almost\nskipping alongside to keep up, watching Quoyle like a hawk all the\nway to....\n\n...the threadbare common room. Kids playing, arguing, sleeping,\nstaring at an antique TV. Quoyle goes THROUGH them all, cop\ndoggedly in his wake, and sinks to his knees beside...\n\n                          BUNNY\n                I can't do this.\n\nBunny on the ratty sofa, legs dangling, holding out a vintage\nGameboy.

He can take a hint.\n\n                            BUNNY\n                 Petal went to Florida.       She'll be\n                 back soon.\n\nHe looks in her eyes.      Shakes his head.

Turns the huge Ziploc\nupside down to COVER the urn. Then, in one deft movement...\n\n...UPENDS the urn, a cascade of ash tumbling into the Ziploc.\nSeals it. Sets it to one side. Then, from her purse...\n\n...another ziploc already filled with replacement ashes. She pours\njust enough into the urn. That should do it. Stashes the rest\nback in her purse. Turns now to lift...\n\n...the Ziploc with her brother's remains.     Stares at it.   Think\nHamlet with Yorrick's skull.\n\n                             AGNIS\n                   What say, Guy?

The DRIVER is\ngross and bald, snot suspended from his nostrils. He lets go of\nthe wheel to run his hairy hands UNDER Petal's dress, while through\nthe shotgun window, we see...\n\n...Quoyle FLYING along outside, like a superhero. Except he is\nshocked bug-eyed by the tableau.

DECK, PORT-AUX-BASQUES FERRY - DAY\n\n...Quoyle    blinking awake on the deck of a pitching ferry. Fog\nand cliff    and the raw Atlantic.

And it's just an\n                 interview.\n\nWhen Quoyle looks back in at Bunny, he sees she is staring off at\nsomething with full attention. He follows her gaze to...\n\n...a honey-haired MOTHER with her small BOY snuggled in her lap.\nShe is feeding him an ice cream bar with evident tenderness. And\nthough the child's face is blissfully vacant, she murmurs to him\nwith serious intent.\n\nINT. CAR, GREAT NORTHERN PENINSULA - DAY\n\nQuoyle driving a winding, rutted road, high above the coastline.\nCracked cliffs in volcanic glazes. Long-abandoned settlements\njutting from raw granite.

Lonely and\nscary as any haunted house.\n\n                          AGNIS\n                Empty 44 years.

CUT to...\n\nREAR ANGLE of Quoyle and Bunny, each rolled over onto one side,\nasleep in their sleeping bags. His arm across her protectively.\nHers across Warren, who sleeps curled to her chest.

Making some craft project with\ngreat care. Quoyle can breathe again, she's safe. Ambles out,\ncrouches beside her. Close.\n\nShe keeps working. Almost eerie concentration.

How's that for us livin' a\n                   charmed life?\n\nQuoyle nods, if a bit cautious.      Dennis squints out across the bay.\n\n                             DENNIS\n                   Agnis says yer buyin' a boat.\n                   Sooner's prob'ly better'n lat...\n\n                             QUOYLE (quiet smile)\n                   I'm not buyin'. No boat.\n\nSounds pretty sure of that.      Punctures the amiable ambiance with a\nshard of silence.\n\n                             AGNIS\n                   Well, course we're buy...\n\n                             QUOYLE (to Dennis)\n                   Buggit, huh? Any kin to my boss on\n                   the Gammy Bird?\n\nThe silence.     Just got thunderous.   A full beat.\n\n                              DENNIS (low)\n                   Oh, yeh.   He's m'dad.\n\nEven the eyes glance down.      What is that?   In the wake of it...\n\n                             AGNIS (cheerful)\n                   Gonna chat up yer daughter, or just\n                   ignore her as usual?\n\nQuoyle nods. Better do that. Dennis sends a shy smile, as if\napologizing for the awkwardness. Quoyle holds up a finger, be\nright back, and...\n\n...heads on over to where Bunny is reading to Warren.\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   Warren threw up in your sleeping bag.\n                   She's got a stomach problem.\n\nQuoyle takes a breath to answer, but stops.     He's caught a whiff.\n\n                             QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                Headline.     Dog Fart Fells Freelance\n                Reporter.

Then, he crouches down...\n\n...strokes Warren, too.     Good dog.\n\nINT. GAMMY BIRD - MORNING\n\nQuoyle enters. Billy Pretty's on the phone, hand cupped over the\nreceiver, like it's top secret. Nutbeem's tuning his ancient\nshortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought\nto be. And as Quoyle sets down his sack lunch and thermos, as he\npeels off his parka, he's staring straight into the eyes of...\n\n...Tert Card across the way. Wearing a wicked and mysterious\nsmile. As Quoyle's butt lowers toward his chair...\n\n                          BOOMING VOICE (O.S.)\n                ATTENTION QUOYLE!\n\nOuoyle JUMPS a foot.   Looks from Card to Billy to Nutbeem.

Through the glass of the only private office, sits a\nrumpled codger with a bullhorn. JACK BUGGIT, has his rubber boots\nup on the desk, scale-spattered overalls over his compact, sinewy\nbody. His hair is wisps and shocks, and his face is strewn with\nstubble split by a leprechaun's grin around a stained hand-rolled\nciggie.\n\n                          JACK (into bullhorn)\n                DOES PAYIN' YER SHAMEFUL WAGE ENTITLE\n                ME TO A PERSONAL AUDIENCE?

The grin more\nrowdy than his boy's. But the charm is there and more so.

This ties you\n                 with me, an' I own the place.\n\nHolds out a brown fisherman's hand.   Quoyle takes it.\n\n                           JACK\n                 Pleased t'meetcha, Billy says yer\n                 workin' out.\n\nA wink.\n\n                           JACK\n                 Tert Card says he's keepin' an eye\n                 on ya. Since he's a self-servin'\n                 liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it\n                 means he's jealous. And Nutbeem...\n\nLifts the bullhorn...\n\n                           JACK (into bullhorn)\n                 NUTBEEM'S TEMPORARY ANYWAY!

Soft spot for the Brit.\n\n                           JACK\n                 Nutbeem's obsessed with actual news.\n                 Makes up for it by manning the sexual\n                 abuse desk. Can't keep up with the\n                 volume there, we're runnin' three,\n                 four a week.\n\nLeans forward.   Like he's dishing the lowdown.\n\n                           JACK\n                 Card's in charge. Ya hear this and\n                 that 'bout his typos, but typos is\n                 part of Gammy Bird. Everyone gets\n                 a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out.\n\n                   Better'n a crossword.\n\nStabs out his cigarette.     Pulls a new one from a damp little box.\n\n                              JACK\n                   An' Billy. Well, Billy's a writer\n                   and a fisherman. Me, I'm just a\n                   fisherman.\n\nOffers the box.

But the eyes flicker, and\nQuoyle is sorry he opened his yap.\n\n                             JACK\n                   Naw, my boy's passed. Went to sea\n                   and there he rests. Bless his bones.\n\nHis glance goes to a photo. Jack and a strapping blond son.\nNot Dennis, that's for sure. Somehow, we are suddenly down to\nbusiness...\n\n                             JACK\n                   Want two things from ya, Quoyle.\n                   First. You cover every local car\n                   wreck, take pictures. Front-page\n                   photo every week, whether we have a\n                   wreck or not, an' we always do. When\n                   we don't, we dip into Card's file,\n                   he's got some beauties.\n\nINTERCUT...half a red Geo being fished out of the water. Petal's\nlifeless torso hanging backwards out the door, arms gracefully\nextended like a ballerina or Olympic diver. Over this...\n\n                             JACK (O.S.)\n                   Knack to this. If there's a dark\n                   patch on the ground, it reads blood,\n                   whether it's motor oil or Diet Coke.\n                   Gloves, hat, lyin' in the road...\n\nBACK to Jack.     Canny and keen.   He knows this stuff.\n\n                             JACK\n                   ...somethin' that humanizes, makes\n                   ya feel. That's what a wreck is.\n                   It's always saying, 'There but for\n                   the grace of God...'\n\nDo ya follow?     Quoyle follows.\n\n                            JACK\n                  Plus. We're starting a feature on\n                  the shipping news. What ships come\n                  in, what goes out. Whatever's of\n                  interest. Throwin' it to you, son.\n                  Chance to shine.\n\nA beat.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Mr. Buggit. I'm not.     Well, a\n                  water person.\n\nAh.   Jack takes this in.     The smile returns.\n\n                              JACK\n                  Chance.    To shine.\n\nIf you catch my drift.      Quoyle shuts up.\n\n                            JACK\n                  One peculiarity. I'm no joke,\n                  son, and I don't tolerate jokes\n                  about Newfies. Or them that does.\n\nSMASH CUT to...\n\nINT.

Boy says, okay,\n                  but I only want a Newfie girl.\n\nHis audience is Quoyle and Nutbeem. Each holds a squidburger of\nhis own, tentacles dangling.

A small house, its grassy\nyard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures,\ngalloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps\non sticks. A zoo of the mind. To one side, a table piled with\ncrafts, ignored by...\n\n...fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions, like bundled,\nunbridled banshees. Looks like fun. Two harried MOTHERS are\ntrying to cope with the chaos. And there, under a tree...\n\n...the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry. And in\nthe rain. She is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant-faced\nSON. He trips and sprawls, but he is laughing. The woman smiles\ntenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair.\n\nQuoyle gets up his courage. Walks Bunny over to them.       As we\narrive, the woman looks up...\n\n                              QUOYLE (really nervous)\n                 Hullo.     It's our first day, and I\n\n                  was wond...\n\n                            BUNNY\n                  What's wrong with him?\n\nQuoyle freezes.    She means, of course, the blankly-staring boy.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong\n                  with you? There's nothing wr...\n\n                            WOMAN (to Bunny, softly)\n                  Sure, there is. This is Herry, and\n                  he has Down's Syndrome. It means\n                  he learns things very slowly.\n\nOh.   HERRY smiles at Bunny.      Suddenly, wonderfully.\n\n                            BUNNY (to Herry)\n                  Know how to be a dog?\n\nShe DROPS to all fours and starts YAPPING like a terrier. Herry\nLAUGHS with delight. Tumbles down to the grass and does his\nimpression of a Chihuahua on speed.\n\n                            BUNNY (to the woman)\n                  He looks fast to me. Maybe he's\n                  cured.\n\n                               WOMAN\n                  Maybe.\n\nThe kids waddle off in their canine personas. Alone with the woman\nnow, Quoyle is near-catatonic. Come on, brain!\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Which one of those women is in\n                  charge here?\n\nThe woman looks at him. Clear cornflower eyes. As comfortable in\nsilence as he is agonized. Then, she squints out at the other\nwomen, desperately running ragged after the kids.\n\n                            WOMAN\n                  Neither of 'em.      They're just moms.\n\nOh.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Well, my lord, whoever runs the\n                  place should be giving this a\n                  little more attention.\n\nShe looks back at him, blankly.\n\n                               WOMAN\n                  You think.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  I mean, children need structure.\n                  No one's even guarding that craft\n                  table, they could be running around\n                  with scissors and get hurt.\n\nThe woman's eyes bottomless, unreadable.       The silence excruciating\nfor poor Quoyle. He clears his throat.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                  Um.   I write for the newspa...\n\nBut she stands.    The grace and quickness of a jungle cat.\n\n                           WOMAN\n                  Well. I'd better get to work, I\n                  see. Providing structure and all.\n\nBrushes off her skirt.       He is in the dawning panic of beginning to\nrealize...\n\n                            WAVEY\n                  I'm Wavey Prowse, and this is\n                  my place. Pardon our antiquated\n                  emphasis on individuality and the\n                  freedom to have fun.\n\nHeads off with a loose-limbed stride.       Spins back around...\n\n                               WAVEY\n                  Oh, yeh.     Running with sharp\n                  objects?     We save for Tuesdays.\n\nGot it? He gawks like a stupid animal.        Nods, got it.   She's\nalready gone.\n\nEXT. BARGE DECK - DAY\n\nQuoyle and Billy Pretty stroll the teak deck of a massive,\nelegantly-outfitted BARGE. The wiry little fellow keeps his\nsmile to his eyes...\n\n                            BILLY\n                  Well, she don't wear a ring, cause\n                  she lost her husband at sea. Just\n                  after the boy was born.\n\nOh.   Quoyle nods, blandly.      As if it is a matter of no real concern\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Well, I was just...\n\n                            BILLY\n                  ...sharpenin' those observation\n                  skills. First tool of a quality\n                  reporter.\n\nKeep walking.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 She has wonderful.     Posture.\n\n                           BILLY (has to smile)\n                 Yer know, I never notic...\n\n                           MELVILLE (O.S.)\n                 JESUS F. CHRIST! YOU BOYS WANT THIS\n                 STORY OR NOT?\n\nLook up ahead to the bow, where a rolling bar has been set up.\nBAYONET MELVILLE is mixing drinks. He has a florid face and\nstriking white hair. Dapper, arrogant, a guy with more money than\nhe's worked for. As we approach...\n\n                           MELVILLE\n                 Ever seen anything like her?\n\nQuoyle looks to the sour-faced middle-aged lady, who glances\ndisdainfully at us above her gimlet. SILVER MELVILLE used to be\npretty and rich. She's still rich.\n\n                           QUOYLE (politely)\n                 No sir, your wife is very lovl...\n\n                            MELVILLE\n                 I mean.   The ship.\n\nOh.   Billy keeps a straight face.     Silver ROLLS her eyes.\n\n                           MELVILLE\n                 It was built for Hitler. You've\n                 heard of Hitler? Up here in Canada?\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 Oh, yessir. He was in all the\n                 papers. Way back.\n\nSilver snorts a laugh. Melville wonders if that was irony.\nLooking at Quoyle, he doubts that's possible.\n\n                           MELVILLE\n                 Finest botterjacht ever built in\n                 Holland. Flat-bottomed, she can\n                 go right up on shore in a storm.\n                 Incredibly heavy, forty tons of oak.\n                 Not unlike the barges of Henry VIII\n                 and Elizabeth I.\n\n                           BILLY (helpful)\n                 We heard a them, too.\n\n                           SILVER\n                 Tell them what happened.     In\n\n                  Hurricane Bob.\n\nHe looks at his wife. Clear in a glance they hate each other's\nguts. Go on, she nods. Tell it.\n\n                            MELVILLE\n                  Pounded twelve beach houses.\n                  Expensive ones. To rubble.\n\n                               SILVER\n                  WHAMM!\n\nDrunk and mean.    And smarter than he is.\n\n                            SILVER\n                  Now tell them. Who let our\n                  insurance lapse.\n\nSilence.\n\n                            SILVER\n                  Took six very expensive lawyers to\n                  weasel us out of it. An inch from\n                  bankruptcy.\n\nShe winks.\n\n                            SILVER\n                  Moral of the story? When you marry\n                  a tour guide. Confine his authority\n                  to mixing the drinks. Same again,\n                  dear?\n\nAnd holds out her glass.       Billy looks out to sea.   Like he hasn't\nheard this.\n\n                            QUOYLE (cheerful)\n                  So. What brings you folks up\n                  from Long Island?\n\nA beat.    While husband and wife glare at each other.\n\n                            SILVER\n                  My dining salon needs refitting.\n                  And the best custom yacht upholsterer\n                  in the Northern Hemisphere just\n                  moved here. I was forced. To follow.\n\nShe turns to Quoyle.       Who just gapes at her.   Open-mouthed.\n\n                               QUOYLE (softly)\n                  Oh.   My.    God.\n\nINT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY\n\nQuoyle enters, impressed by the progress of the renovation.\nWindows are in, walls patched, floor sanded, lights are working.\n\nThrough the place into...\n\n...the kitchen, which is in surprisingly usable shape. Agnis sits\nalone at a butcher block table with a set of ledgers spread before\nher. A large mug of tea. A bottle of Bushmill's Irish.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   You are a woman of mystery, Aunt.\n                   Mystery and surprise.\n\n                             AGNIS (still working)\n                   Silver Melville says you was out\n                   there. Be nice in yer story, she's\n                   payin' for a piece of this house.\n\nSilence.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   You said upholstery.   Never said\n                   yacht uphol...\n\n                             AGNIS\n                   ...never said not. Ask better\n                   questions, you got a chance fer\n                   better answers. Got my shop set\n                   up in Killick-Claw, now.\n\nLooks up.    Sees he's dazzled by how she moves right along.\n\n                             AGNIS\n                   Two good workers. Mrs. Mavis\n                   Bangs is an old plow horse like\n                   m'self. But Dawn...\n\nShe winks.\n\n                              AGNIS\n                   Dawn's young and on the sexy\n                   side. You oughta drop by and\n                   say hullo.\n\nHe absorbs that.     How fast can he change the subject?\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Where's Bunny?\n\nAgnis looks at him.     Reaches for the Bushmill's.\n\n                             AGNIS\n                   Upstairs, in what will soon become\n                   her room. She'll be all right.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   What does that mean?\n\nShe pours some whiskey into her tea cup.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Little early in the day f...\n\n                            AGNIS\n                  Warren died today.    That's what that means.\n\nDrinks the whiskey.    Stares straight in his eyes.     Sees his sorrow.\nThe honesty in...\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Poor old girl.\n\nAgnis deciding.    Whether to tell him...\n\n                            AGNIS\n                  I used to live with someone named\n                  Warren. Died of cancer, after\n                  nine years together. Dearest soul\n                  on this earth.\n\nQuoyle shocked. What can he say? His empathy so naked, so real,\neven Agnis has to soften her voice...\n\n                            AGNIS\n                  Went from the funeral, and bought\n                  that dog. Named her Warren. Just\n                  so I could say the name a hunnerd\n                  times a day. Women are foolish, huh?\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  I never thought so.\n\nA good moment for them.    It holds a beat.\n\n                            AGNIS\n                  Bunny wants to bury the dog with\n                  me. But I told her I'd rather do\n                  it alone.\n\nQuoyle nods.   Rises slowly.   He'd better go to her.\n\n                            AGNIS\n                  Some advice about the child?\n\nAnother sip.\n\n                            AGNIS\n                  Don't get down on her level, the way\n                  you do. She'll never respect you.\n\nINT. BUNNY'S ROOM - DAY\n\nBunny sits on the floor in dim light, wearing an enormous blue\nsweatshirt. Obviously dad's. Her naked Barbies sit in a semi-\ncircle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and\nfoil from chewing gum wrappers. Quoyle enters, and sits close\nbeside her. Watches in silence, as she works.\n\n                            BUNNY (not looking up)\n                  Warren died today. She's not\n                  coming back.\n\nNo tears.   Just a hollow sound in her voice.\n\n                            BUNNY\n                  That's the difference.\n\nHe knows what she means.      Strokes her hair.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Another necklace, huh?    Can\n                  I help?\n\n                            BUNNY\n                  You can watch.\n\nOkay.   He looks at the Barbies.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Do I have to take my clothes off?\n\nShe looks up at him.     Straight to his eyes.\n\n                            BUNNY\n                  You look better with 'em on.\n\nGoes back to work.     He watches her.\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                  You know.    You do look good\n                  in blue.\n\nEXT. ROAD - DAY\n\nQuoyle driving the wagon, Dennis at his side. Up ahead on the\nroad, two figures. Herry holds tight to his mom's hand. Quoyle\npulls over, and they stop. Wavey squints at him, against the sun.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Give you folks a lift?\n\nThat extra beat before she says...\n\n                            WAVEY\n                  We're enjoyin' the walk, thank you.\n\nDoesn't smile.    Doesn't look angry either.      Just comfortable.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Well. My aunt can't bring Bunny to\n                  the daycare, she's got her shop now.\n                  But I worked it out with my boss. So\n                  I'll be bringin' her come next week.\n\nNo reaction.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  If that's all right.\n\n                            WAVEY\n                  Love to have her. I'm sorry,\n                  Mr. Quoyle, about the other time.\n                  Women can be moody, you know. And\n                  temperamental.\n\nNow she smiles.    One-tenth power.     Still a dazzler.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Only the best ones.\n\nDid she like that?    Hard to tell.     She looks around him...\n\n                            WAVEY\n                  Good afternoon, Dennis. Give our\n                  respects to Beety and Marty.\n\nHe waves, will do. She takes Herry's hand, starts off down the\nroad. Quoyle sits and watches.\n\n                            DENNIS\n                  Excellent posture.\n\nQuoyle looks over.    His pal shrugs.\n\n                            DENNIS\n                  People talk.\n\nEXT. SHORELINE - SUNSET\n\nRear ANGLE of Agnis, walking over stones to the edge of the sea,\ncarrying something in her arms. Walking to meet the sun, as it\ngives its last to the shimmering water.

Pulling himself to his feet, he hears...\nRUSTLING. Looks up, just as...\n\n...a WHITE DOG appears through the bushes. Red eyes. Lips curled\nback. A frozen second of mutual indecision, and Quoyle...\n\n...SCREAMS and falls on his butt.     The dog...\n\n...TAKES OFF, bounding down a path we hadn't noticed. Toward an\nupright SILHOUETTE. Who steps into sun just long enough to\nbecome...\n\n...a MAN, grizzled and scrawny and quick.      Gone in a flash.   Like a\nskinny ghost. And there, on his butt...\n\n...Quoyle laughs softly.

Snatches the suitcase from its\nperch. Brings it back to shore, holding it high. Already, he is\nmaking the face of someone smelling something he'd rather not.\n\nHe sets it down. The face is worse.     His curiosity running the\nshow, he unhooks the latch...\n\n...and stops. Because he's staring inside.

Bunny sits at the little table, a\nlarge mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her, little Herry at\nher side. They are watching Freakazoid on a tiny TV. Bunny\nshovels in a mouthful of popcorn. Then makes a sage, if\nunintelligible, comment about the show to Herry. Still chewing,\nshe takes another huge handful of popcorn...\n\n...Herry opens his mouth like a baby bird. Bunny stuffs the snack\nin. It's a stare-and-chew, side by side. Just alike.\n\nANGLE...cozy parlor. Quoyle sits in a Barca-lounger with a huge\nbowl of chips in his lap. He is watching hockey on a modest TV,\nthe action is fierce.

I've been workin' longer hours.\n                   So Dennis and Beety were kind enough\n                   to bring Bunny to the daycare. Fed\n                   her a lotta meals, too. They're real\n                   friends.\n\nQuoyle's smile tries to sell the innocence of his absence.\n\n                             WAVEY (very quiet)\n                   I thought you forgot. That I'm your\n                   friend, too.\n\nNo smile from her. She wants him to know she was hurt.           He shakes\nhis head, serious now. No, I didn't forget.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   You want another sandwich?    There's\n                   roast pork.\n\nHe holds up what's left of his four-decker.          This is plenty.   Takes\na huge bite to show how much he likes it.\n\n                               WAVEY\n                   You said.    You'd read me your\n                   article.\n\nHe did, he nods.     But just now he's scared to. And so she smiles.\nWhich traps him.     He pulls out a single sheet of paper. Clears his\nthroat.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Nobody Hangs a Picture of an Oil\n                   Tanker. That's the header.\n\nShe nods. Likes that.

Eight schooners heading\n                   out to fishing grounds, sails spread\n                   it like white wings. Beautiful. Beyond\n                   compare.\n\nThis means something to him.       Hear it in his voice.\n\n                            QUOYLE (reads)\n                  More common today is the low black\n                  profile of oil tankers. Like the\n                  ruptured Golden Goose, which last\n                  week bled 14,000 tons of crude onto\n                  seabirds, fish and boats at Cape\n                  Despond.\n\nHe stops.    As if revisiting that little thought in his mind.\n\n                            QUOYLE (reads)\n                  There will be more and more tankers.\n                  They will grow old and corroded, and\n                  their tanks will split. They have\n                  already done to fishing. What their\n                  spill has done to fish.\n\nHe sneaks a glance.

Whatcha think?\n\nShe reflects.\n\n                            WAVEY\n                  I think when Card sees it, he'll\n                  split a gut. I think he'll sit up\n                  nights thinking of cheap shots to pay\n                  you back. I think he'll never stop\n                  until you're fired.\n\nQuoyle keeps nodding at each point.          Yep.   Yep.\n\n                            WAVEY\n                  I think I haven't been so proud. Of\n                  a friend. Since I don't know when.\n\nQuoyle's heart explodes in his chest.          And shines in his eyes.\nThere is a long silence.\n\n                            WAVEY (softly)\n                  Maybe another sandwich. There's\n                  roast pork.\n\nHe swallows.    He just doesn't want to cry from happiness.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Well, sure.\n\nINT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY\n\nCLOSE on Card. Who is RIPPING the single page in half.

And as he stares, there is something below it. Something in\na cove protected from intrusion by a jagged ring of menacing\nrocks...\n\n...it is a MAN in a yellow suit. His head under the surface as if\nlooking for fish. Arms and legs spread out like a starfish, the\nbody slides in and out of a small cave. Tugged by the sea like a\ntop on a string.\n\nQuoyle stares in frozen shock.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                Headline. Reporter Becomes Magnet\n                For Dead Men.\n\nNo way in past the pounding surf, the savage rocks.    So Quoyle\nturns sharply. Squints across the bay.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                What was my panic? He was already\n                dead. Maybe I thought, in some dim\n                way...\n\nCLIMBS into his boat, TURNS the engine over.    KICKS it in overdrive\ntoward the town across the bay.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                ...if it wasn't too late for him.\n                It wouldn't be for Petal.\n\nSTREAKING out, toward the black sky.    Racing to open sea where the\nchop INCREASES drastically. Closer.     Closer...\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                Once I was past the shelter of the\n                lee shore, and into the real wind.\n                I realized my mistake.\n\n...clear of the point's protection, the wind ROCKS the tiny craft,\nswells coming BROADSIDE. The boat RISES, then DROPS with cruel\nspeed. Quoyle tries to swing the boat around, the propeller RACES,\nthe bow PITCHES violently, SLAMMING down, the stern SWAMPED, the\nhull filling, swerving broadside just as the oncoming sea HITS with\nall its force, and the little boat...\n\n...rolls OVER, Quoyle suddenly FLYING under water, limbs flailing\nin all directions...\n\n                            QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                Headline.    Reporter Becomes Anchor\n                Man.\n\nINTERCUT...Quoyle's dad FLINGING him into the public pool, the\nyoungster SINKING like an anvil in a profusion of bubbles, and\nCUT...\n\nBACK to Quoyle, struggling madly somehow to the surface, THRASHING\ntoward the overturned boat, GRASPING the stilled propeller shaft,\nwhich causes the bow to lift, the next wave turning the boat\nupright, FILLING it with water, and it SINKS forever, as Quoyle...\n\n...TUMBLES once more beneath the surface, watching the boat\nDISAPPEAR into darkness below him.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                Stupid. Stupid to drown with Bunny\n                so young. No life jacket, no floating\n                oar. No sense.\n\nBack to the surface, GASPING for air. And then, daintily rowing a\nsmall boat, unaffected by the waves, her filmy dress rippling in\nlight breeze...\n\n                          PETAL\n                Look, it floats.     Just like you.\n\nIs the lilting smile cruel?   Or only the irony that conveys\nintimacy, even affection.\n\n                          PETAL\n                Maybe it's filled with fat.\n\nAnd VANISHES. In her place, bobs a red BOX. A plastic beer\ncooler. He LUNGES for it, GRIPPING the handles, resting his chest\non its top.\n\nThe waves RISE, mountainous now, and he rises and falls with them.\nHe has been swept a mile from the nearest shore.\n\nINTERCUT...a winch pulling part of the Geo, streaming mud, from\nswiftly flowing water. Police and bystanders gathered.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                And I wondered. Am I going where\n                she's gone?\n\nBACK to the bay. A barely-conscious Quoyle still clings somehow to\nthe plastic cooler. But hours have passed. Light is fading.\n\n                          QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                ...and will I see her?\n\nHe turns. And there she is. Beaming at him from the bow of her\nlittle rowboat, a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk. It could be\nlove. From behind her a light GLOWS, giving Petal the aspect of an\nangel.\n\nShe drops a wink.   FADES away.    And the light becomes...\n\n...the BEAM from a fishing boat. Quoyle squints his swollen eyes,\nas strong hands WRENCH him from his box. From the sea. A voice\nwarbles, distorted by wind and Quoyle's diminished consciousness...\n\n                          JACK\n                Jesus Cockadoodle Christ!     I knowed\n                somebody was out here.\n\nQuoyle's teeth are chattering so hard, his body shivering so\n\npainfully, Buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down on a\nwriggling mound of fish.\n\n                           JACK\n                 Thank god fer yer figure, me old son.\n                 A thin man woulda froze.\n\nQuoyle burrows into the fish, like nestling in a down comforter.\nJack covers him with a heavy tarp. Crouches down close...\n\n                            JACK\n                 Good.   Yer lost th'boat.\n\nINT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\nDim light. Quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet.   His\neyes flutter. Open. Where...?\n\n                           VOICE (O.S., very soft)\n                 It's all right. You're in heaven.\n\nHis head SNAPS around. She's sitting just beside the bed in half-\nshadow. Her oxblood knitting across her lap.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                 Actually.    It's just my bed.\n\nNow he sees the cigarette.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Actually, it's not. I just wanted\n                 to see your eyes bug out like that.\n\nNow he sees the smile.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 You don't smoke.\n\nHis voice was a croak. So he CLEARS his throat with a massive and\ndisgusting effort. It is gross and funny, and she smiles again.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Only when I'm worried.      I don't\n                 worry much.\n\nHe rolls over, to see her better.      They are very close.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 You don't have to, I'm all right.\n                 I'm in heaven.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 I'm not worried.    About you.\n\nOh.   As he draws a breath to ask...\n\n                             WAVEY\n\n                   You're in the boys' room at Jack's\n                   house. Wonder how long since Dennis\n                   slept here.\n\nShe glances to the nightstand. Beneath the dim lamp.       A picture of\nJack and blond son Jesson. Guess what they're doing.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   Mrs. Buggit called, knew Bunny was\n                   still with me. The kids are camped\n                   out in the parlor.\n\nA beat.\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                   Nice.   You sittin' up with me.\n\nA longer one.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   S'okay. Someday you'll do somethin'\n                   nice for me.\n\nHe nods.   He will.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Who you worried ab...\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   You didn't find a second dead man.\n                   Just the rest of the first one.\n\nAh.   He nods.   Well, that figures.\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                   I asked.   Who you worried about?\n\nOn this, she stubs out her cigarette.      Takes another from the pack.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   You said Bunny talks to Petal at\n                   night. You ever listen?\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Not really. Wouldn't be right.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   Well, I'm not that nice a person.\n\nSTRIKES a match.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   She plays Petal. Talks to the\n                   Barbies, like Petal talking to her.\n\nBrings her cigarette.   To the flame.\n\n                          WAVEY\n                She says she's sorry she left them.\n                It was just to see if they could be\n                good girls. And they were...\n\nAnd.\n\n                          WAVEY\n                ...and she loves them.\n\nHis eyes at once rapt and suffering.     She watches that.\n\n                          WAVEY\n                The Barbies look better naked, Bunny\n                looks good in blue, guess who said\n                that?\n\nDraws on her smoke.\n\n                          WAVEY\n                So we talked. Just before Petal\n                left her with that...stranger? Bunny\n                had snapped her mom's bead necklace.\n                That's why she's making more.\n\nDo you understand?\n\n                          WAVEY\n                When she's made enough.     She'll\n                be forgiven.\n\nTears are pooling in his eyes.   Hers, too.     She keeps going...\n\n                          WAVEY\n                She saves Petal a room at the house,\n                but she's also got the key to the old\n                place. In case her mom would rather\n                go there.\n\nA thin stream of air escapes from his lips.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                And she talked about it.      Just like\n                that.\n\n                          WAVEY\n                Sure, I lied. I said nice things\n                about her mother.\n\nBitter smile.\n\n                          WAVEY\n                See, there's only one problem.\n                Petal isn't gone.\n\nQuoyle thinking.     Madly.   What can he do?\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   So we're patient. And we wait, and\n                   we're good to her.\n                             (beat)\n                   And. Maybe. Time.\n\nShe stares back.     Unease to match his own.   Maybe time.\n\nINT. ALVIN YARK'S BOAT HOUSE - DAY\n\nA wiry wisp of an aged elf, ALVIN YARK is shaping the center beam\nof what will become a tidy boat. Its wooden skeleton across two\nsawhorses in his spacious workshop.\n\n                             ALVIN (sings softly to himself)\n                   Oh, the Gandy Goose, it ain't no use.\n                   It ain't no use, the Gandy Goose.\n\nQuoyle, Wavey and Dennis stand in a row.

From her face as she responds, she has\nalready devoted, over time, more professional attention to this\ntroublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator.\n\n                          BUNNY (O.S.)\n                She told him that recess was almost\n                over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip\n                special, an' he could hold it.\n\nHerry, seemingly, disagrees. Still holding his crotch, he jumps up\nand down with greater agitation. She grabs him, rather roughly, by\nthe arm. Marches him over to...\n\n                          BUNNY (O.S.)\n                She made him stand against the wall.\n\n...and walks off, pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away. He\nscreams, pumping his fists in frustration. Grabs himself,\nsuddenly. Whether or not we can see the dampness spread, we can\nsee his humiliation all too clearly. As his tears come...\n\n...a figure BOLTS into frame from behind Mrs. Lumbull. Hunched\nover like a linebacker, full speed ahead, LAUNCHING herself into\nthe back of the large woman's knees. Her feet go UP, and the rest\nof her goes...\n\n...DOWN like the proverbial amount of bricks. Herry's tears stop\nfast. Watching the woman shriek, and keep shrieking. Makes him\nlaugh. CUT...\n\nBACK TO...the berry path.   They are sitting on a fallen log.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                See, a good dad would say hitting\n                is always wrong. You coulda hurt\n                her bad. I guess you know that.\n\n                          BUNNY\n                She wasn't hurt for real.     Just\n                screamed like a baby.\n\nQuoyle pulls out a single Snickers bar.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Wish I'd seen it.     It really sounds\n                   funny.\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   Petal'll think so, too.\n\nHe looks at her.      Nods, probably will.    Peels the candy bar free of\nits wrapper.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Well, there won't be any trouble at\n                   school. I'II take care of that.\n\n                              BUNNY\n                   How?\n\nHe breaks the candy bar in half.        Tho not quite equally.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Because the best thing about people.\n                   Is they can forgive each other. I\n                   heard that this morning.\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   That teacher. Is gonna forgive me?\n\nHe nods.   Oh, yeh.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   That. And she won't want the story\n                   printed in the paper.\n\nOh.\n\n                              BUNNY\n                   Well.   I don't wanna forgive her.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Me neither.\n\nHe holds out the two pieces of candy. She takes them both.         the\nbigger one in his mouth. As he chews...\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   I had to do it. 'Cept for Wavey,\n                   I'm the only family Herry's got.\n\nShe nibbles at her own piece.\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   Like the ghost.     Who's not a ghost.\n\nHmmn?\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   The one who ties the knots?     You're\n\n                  the only family he's got.\n\nRight?   Her father doesn't react.       He's even stopped chewing.\n\n                              BUNNY\n                  You said.\n\nAnd slowly.    Quoyle nods.    I said.\n\nEXT. NOLAN'S SHED - DAY\n\nQuoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed, hidden at the\nfoot of his cliff. He carries a big carton, which we see has made\nthe journey slow and awkward. Across the gravel now, to...\n\n...the door. HEAR the fire crackling, see the smoke curling.\nTakes a breath. Knocks softly. Then LOUDER.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  UNCLE NOLAN? CAN I COME IN?\n\nNo answer.    Juggle the box, lift the latch.      Enter...\n\nINT. NOLAN'S SHED - NIGHT\n\nThe old man and the dog huddled together at the fire. They look\nover with red eyes. Just alike. Only one growls. Quoyle finds a\nsmile, a soft voice...\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                  Uncle. My daughter Bunny and I.\n                  We got you some hot bread. And some\n                  meat. Some dried fish. Some squash\n                  and vegetables...a cake...some warm\n                  clothes...\n\nNolan is listening. Sharp-eared, sharp-eyed. What trick is this?\nSo Quoyle sets the carton down in the squalor. Takes out a loaf of\nfresh bread. One step forward. Lay it down.\n\nGood faith offering.    And...\n\n...Nolan scuttles to it. Like a wary crab. He tears off a chunk\nof bread. Nibbles. He likes it. And as he eats...\n\n                            QUOYLE (softly)\n                  You tied those knots, huh?\n                  At my house?\n\n...crouches down to the old man's size.        Almost close enough to\ntouch.\n\n                            NOLAN\n                  Ain't yer house, it's th' Ouoyle\n                  house!\n\nHe's found the meat.

Got run outta Omaloor Bay a\n                 hunnerd years ago. Dragged that house\n                 across th' ice. On spruce runners.\n\nStuffs some into his face.      Like this, even better.\n\n                           NOLAN\n                 Hadda lash it to th' rock.

That's\n                 cause she can't face me. I knows she\n                 killed 'im.\n\nA moment.

Long ago. A girl of 12, rawboned,\nhusky, skating alone. We've seen her, in the photo at Quoyle's\ndad's house. And as she skates, she looks up to see...\n\n...a boy of 15, stocky, sullen. He was in the same photo. Only\nnow, he steps onto the ice. Unbuttons his pants. Begins to slide\ntoward her on the soles of his fishing boots. She looks around.\nSnow banked on all sides of the pond. Nowhere to run on her\nskates.\n\n                           NOLAN (O.S.)\n                 Her brother, me son. She only\n                 had th' one.\n\nThe girl, breathless, skating this way and that. The boy closing\nin, cutting off her angle. A deadly endgame. There are no words.\nAnd...\n\n...he is ON her. Pulling her TUMBLING to the ice in SLO-MO.\nNo sound but their hot breath, the grunt of the struggle, and\nCUT BACK to...\n\n                           NOLAN\n                 Course no one alive knows no more.\n                 So her an' me...\n                           (winks)\n                 Our. Little. Secret.\n\nINT.   AGNIS' NEW SHOP, KILLICK-CLAW - DAY\n\nAgnis and Mavis are showing Wavey their new shop. It is big and\nbright with more elaborate fittings, the amount of work piled up\ncarries the scent of success. Quoyle trails behind, as Agnis dotes\non Wavey like a prize new daughter-in-law. When she turns, she\nsees her nephew staring...\n\n                           AGNIS\n                 What? My hem crooked?      As if\n                 I was wearin' a hem.\n\nHe was staring pretty intently.    Realizes that.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                 Naw, I just come from seein' your\n                 cousin Nolan.

What do you think of\n                 my dress?\n\nEverybody turns on that one. Mavis cuts her alter ego Agnis a\nlook. Can you believe this slut?\n\n                           DAWN\n                 I wore it just for you.\n\nShe actually looks pretty good in it.      Wavey noticing that.\nWatching Quoyle say...\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                 That was more consideration.       Than\n                 I deserve.\n\nPolite banter? Or outright flirting? Hard to tell if it's Wavey\nor Agnis who disapproves more. Dawn ignores them.\n\n                           DAWN\n                 Did your aunt tell you about all\n\n                 the money?\n\nAgnis just blinks.   Can scarcely believe she heard that.\n\n                           DAWN\n                 Agnis told us it came from Macau.\n\n                           AGNIS (quietly)\n                 Hush yoursel...\n\n                           DAWN\n                 ...from Silver Melville.

JOHN'S - DAY\n\nNot London, but it might as well be. Wavey and Quoyle atop a red\ndouble-decker bus, wind whipping their hair. She is watching the\nbig city flow past, drinking every inch of it. He's watching her.\n\nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY\n\nWavey carries an armload of little girl's tights and corduroy\npants, picking through a bin of barrettes. Quoyle appears with a\nfistful of neckties. Holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a\ntime, each more breathtakingly godawful than the last. Well? She\nSHIVERS with disgust. Lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser-\nvative one she's already picked for him. He SHIVERS, just as she\ndid. They share the trace of a grin, just alike. He walks off.\n\n...Wavey trying on furry hats in a full-length mirror, as Quoyle\nkeeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful. She\npouts and poses like a runway model, basically frowning that the\n\nhats aren't working. He's staring at her as if nothing else exists\nin the universe. She knows it.\n\n...Wavey alone at a cash register. The checker is ringing up a\nselection of lacy bras and panties. Suddenly, Wavey looks up to\nsee Quoyle at the register one aisle over, staring fixedly at her\npurchases. Seeing she's noticed him, he holds up a huge pair of\nloud boxer shorts he's buying, and WAVES them at her. She laughs\nand waves her bras right back. Civilians watching think they're\nin love.\n\nEXT./INT. ST. JOHN'S - DAY/NIGHT\n\n...Quoyle and Wavey stroll the grounds of Nolan's future retirement\nhome. It is twilight, and the modest place looks pleasant and\nwelcoming. Quoyle listens earnestly, as the director points things\nout. Wavey watching Quoyle, her gaze not so disapproving after\nall.\n\n...CLOSE on Quoyle with a bowling ball, poised, glaring our way.\nHere he comes. Stumbles. Lets go. REVERSE ANGLE to see the ball\nrolling, rolling real slow. Quoyle turns his back, strides away\nwith confidence like he doesn't even have to watch, this is too\neasy. Wavey points, look. He turns in time to see two pins fall.\nPumps his fist. YESSSS!\n\nINT. BAR - NIGHT\n\nIt's late. It's dim. It's as romantic as urban Newfoundland will\never get. Our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a\npassably stylish bar. Piano playing show tunes, but soft. He\npulls from his pocket...\n\n...a travel brochure.

She did.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                  Still. Seems like we could figure\n                  out. Something.\n\nEven Quoyle. Has the message. He looks down at his beer, as he\nthinks about what he should say. Turns the glass in his fingers.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  A friend told me once.

Almost to himself.\n\n                            QUOYLE (a murmur)\n                  It's the engine of life.\n\nHe looks up.

To have a\n                   real friend. When you're. Lonely.\n\nThe last word was a tough one.       It makes her nod. She stares in\nhis eyes for the longest time.       And when she speaks, he can scarely\nhear her voice...\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   I know you have to stay tomorrow.\n                   To sign the papers.

Watching his worst nightmare unfold before\nhis eyes.\n\n                              WAVEY\n                   And I'm not feeling so well.\n                   What I get for mixing vodka and\n                   beer, huh.\n\nShe gets to her feet.       She does seem a little unsteady.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   So I'll grab a taxi. You stay and\n                   finish. Listen to the music.

She shakes her head, half-\ngrinning at how foolish she feels.        She smiles at him now. Like\nshe means it.\n\nAnd leaves.     Without another word.\n\n                             QUOYLE (V.O.)\n                   She did stay my friend.

NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - TWILIGHT\n\nQuoyle GROANING under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum\npulled from the back of his wagon. Plenty more to go. Staggers\ninto...\n\n...Nutbeem's   tiny, threadbare trailer. Every conceivable surface\nunder stacks   of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts, cheese\nand red-eyed   olives. Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice.\nQuoyle peers   into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom...\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  What's the barrel for?\n\nSEE it now.    Half a sawed-off empty BARREL, with MOLASSES stenciled\n\nin orange, fills the shower stall.\n\n                           NUTBEEM\n                 I'm British.

We are\nimmersed in the ungodly WHITE NOISE of an all-gentleman's Newfie\nsoiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assorted\ngrunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As we\nstruggle to look around...\n\n...every square inch is    crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks.\nTert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which has\nbecome a handy urinal.     Near the door, Dennis holding forth, arm\ntight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoyle\nfights his way...\n\n...OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCH\nwilder, given the elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER the supine form o\nBilly Pretty, who is singing to himself. Finds Jack Buggit with a\nbeer in one hand a rum in the other. Wraps a drunken arm around\nJack's neck. Starts to talk in his ear. Jack looks suspicious. A\nFIGHT breaks out a few feet away. They don't notice. Closing in,\nto hear...\n\n                           QUOYLE (shouting against the din)\n                 SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY ALL SIT DOWN\n                 ON THE GIRDER. THE BRIT OPENS HIS\n                 LUNCH BOX. 'OH, NO! SCOTCH SALMON\n                 AGAIN! FAREWELL, BOYS!' AND HE\n                 JUMPS OFF THE GIRDER TO HIS DEATH.\n\nJack nods.   Grins.    That's pretty funny.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 THE QUEBEC GUY OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX.\n                 'MON DIEU! MEAT PIE AGAIN! AU\n                 REVOIR CRUEL WORLD!'

Jack is chuckling already.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 AT THE FUNERAL. THE BRIT' S WIFE\n                 SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME HE HATED\n                 SALMON?' FRENCHY'S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY\n                 DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT\n                 PIE?' STATIE'S WIFE SAYS, 'I DON'T\n                 GET IT. HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!'\n\nQuoyle is chortling.   But Jack stares him dead in the eyes.\n\n                           JACK\n                 YOU'RE SURE. THE FELLER WAS A STATIE.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                 OH, YAR.

AXE\n                 'IS FOOKIN' BOAT! GOT YER CHAIN\n                 SAW, NEDDIE??\n\nAn idea that wins IMMEDIATE MASS APPROVAL. Soused Nutbeem's eyes\nopen bug-wide, as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the\ndocks. Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective.\n\nAnd rather suddenly.   Quoyle is left alone.\n\nAmong the conscious, that is.\n\nINT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nKnitted wool, the color of oxblood, lies across a timeworn leather\nottoman. In front of it, little Herry dances a shuffle-foot jig of\nhis own design. The music seeps from a venerable accordian, played\nearnestly by his serious mom, nodding and tapping her foot to the\ntime of his steps.\n\nThere is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry. His grin\nsplits his round face. His eyes say that his heart is dancing.\n\nPULL SLOWLY BACK...through the window, past the porch, across the\nfront yard. To a figure. By the fence. He stands motionless.\nExcept his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of the\nmusic.\n\nWe can't tell how much Quoyle sees.    But his eyes say that his\nheart is drowning.\n\nEXT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - MORNING\n\nAs Quoyle shuffles up, we see Nutbeem's trailer has been turned\ncompletely OVER onto its side. Walls are crushed and splintered.\nIt's a train wreck.\n\nSitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it, Nutbeem,\nand Dennis swig beers.\n\n                          NUTBEEM (cheery)\n                You're looking dishy, Q.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                Feeling that and more.

You're moving in with Dennis, no\n                matter how fond you are of his wife.\n\nQuoyle looks sadly at the trailer.    Realizing it was his place that\ngot trashed.\n\n                          NUTBEEM (laughs)\n                And the boat! Omigod!\n\n                          BILLY\n                I'm some disgusted.    With the human race.\n\n                          NUTBEEM\n                I'da never made it, anyway. Storms\n                would have blown me to bits. You\n                boys saved my life. Yes, you did.\n\nThe boys look at each other.    Humiliated by his generosity.\n\n                            NUTBEEM\n\n                   I've gathered my savings, and am\n                   flying to Brazil. Where water is\n                   swimming pool green. And I grill\n                   yellowtail steaks with lime and\n                   garlic, watercress and Tobasco.\n                   Touch of curry.

And back.\n\n                             BILLY\n                   It's too bad.\n\nWhich seems to cover everything.\n\nEXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - DAY\n\nQuoyle alone with Jack in open water.

Wants him to help\n                   put out th' newsletter fer them\n                   oil rig suppliers.\n\nYup.     Believe it.\n\n                             JACK\n                   He was sassy an' he was smug. Oh,\n                   there's a waitin' list, he assures\n                   me. They only skims th' cream.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Well, don't get all weepy-eyed abou...\n\n                             JACK\n                   Truth t'tell. I was a wee help.\n                   B'hind the scenes, doncha know.\n\nKeeps working.\n\n                                JACK (quietly)\n                   Sometimes.     Enough is enough.\n\nNo arguments arise.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Well, Billy'll do a helluva job...\n\n                             JACK (nods)\n                   ...right where he is.

You don't mean...\n\n                             JACK\n                   Spot I'm in, Christmas and all.\n                   Might have to offer th'mess. To you.\n\nQuoyle swallows.       Arguably the proudest moment of his life.\n\n                                QUOYLE\n                   Course.     I'd need a raise.\n\nJack looks at him for the first time.        A real twinkle behind...\n\n                             JACK\n                   Y'know. Yer do have the sense God\n                   gave a doughnut.\n\n                             QUOYLE (genuinely touched)\n                   I'II try to live up to that.\n\nSaid with such sincerity, Jack can only nod.          Good.\n\n                             JACK\n                   Any other outrageous demands?\n                   Seein' as yer got me over a\n                   barrel.

Like a 60-watt bulb in a\nbrownout. Quoyle swallows the rest.\n\n                            JACK\n                  You were sayin'...?\n\nQuoyle sucks it up.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  His whole life would be changed.\n                  If he could come upon. A fishing\n                  license.\n\nJack's eyes.   Flat and cold as the cod he's gutting.\n\n                            JACK\n                  Well, there's only one a those\n                  issued per family. So how exactly\n                  would he do that?\n\nThis is not.   Going well.   A dangerous silence.\n\n                            JACK\n                  Even doughnuts, y'know.   Can\n                  push their luck.\n\nINT. WAVEY'S PARLOR - DUSK\n\nThe day care contingent more organized today. Sort of. Bunny\nleading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as...\n\n...Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents. As he\nshrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winking\nlights. The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmade\nby these children. He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light!', only to\nhave Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway.\n\nMixed emotions, to be sure. A feeling of family he can at least\nvisit, yet will never be his own. The sad edge catches up with\nhim, so he strolls on into...\n\n...the kitchen. Wavey baking, what else.      She smiles to see him.\nA friend's smile.\n\n                            WAVEY (Southern belle)\n                  Why, Mistuh Quoyle. You shouldn't\n                  have!\n\nHe smiles back.    Takes her in for a telling beat, before...\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                  Uh.   I didn't. Most of these\n\n                 are for Herry.\n\nEven better.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 There's two. Are yours.\n\nThey are on top. Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging,\nfine-motor-control-challenged, personal style. Be sets them on the\ncounter.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                 You prob'ly want to wait for\n                 Christmas.\n\nMeaning, please don't. So she wipes her hands on her apron.    Lets\nhim see her eyes dance just a flicker.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Oh, I'm much too excited.\n\nDelicately unwraps the first. Lifts out a PORCELAIN TEAPOT, finely\npainted with an assortment of BERRIES. She holds it in her hands,\nat once admiring and wistful. Wondering if there's a message about\ntheir moment together while berry-picking.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 It's from a museum catalogue.       But\n                 it's not real. It's a copy.\n\n                           WAVEY (still gazing at it)\n                 It is my favorite teapot.\n\nA simple pronouncement. She opens the second, flat and narrow. It\nis a TURQUOISE BRACELET. Actually, kind of stunning. She blinks,\ntaken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 It's nice for your eyes.     I thought.\n\nShe doesn't sayanything.   Lets it dangle from her fingers, catch\nthe light.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 It's for everyday. You don't have\n                 to save it for special.\n\nShe looks to him. Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants.\nHer voice perhaps softer than she even intends...\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Oh, I'll save this, all right.\n\nCovers.   With only a slightly more than friendly smile.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 And I'll think of you.     When I\n\n                put lot on.\n\nHe can only nod. He'd like that.    She holds up one finger, wait a\nsecond. And hurries off.\n\nSo he waits. Looking at her kitchen. Feeling his feelings.         She\nis back, with two boxes. Sets them down. Nods, go ahead...\n\n...one is heavy and square. He opens it to find a LEATHER-BOUND\nCASE. He looks at her, smiles in his childlike way. Opens the\ncase, which reveals...\n\n...two leather-bound VOLUMES. One a dictionary.      The other a\nthesaurus. He is obviously moved.\n\n                          QUOYLE (a murmur)\n                You must have me mistaken. For\n                a writer.\n\nAnd when he looks up.\n\n                          WAVEY\n                I don't make mistakes.     About\n                that kind of thing.\n\nHe stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other\npackage. Big and flat, but not heavy at all. He lifts the lid,\nand pulls out...\n\n...a huge comfy SWEATER.   In oxblood wool.    He is completely\nstunned to realize...\n\n                          WAVEY (so pleased)\n                Well, you can't be surprised. You've\n                seen me knitting it for months.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                It was so big, I thought it was a\n                tea cozy for your car. But if it's\n                for me, it has to be bigger, huh?\n\nPut it on, put it on! So he slips it over his head. Big enough\nand then some. This worries her. She plucks at it...\n\n                           WAVEY\n                Well.   You'll grow into it.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                You kiddin'? After the holidays,\n                we'll have to stretch it.\n\nHe's just beaming. Hugs himself to show how warm it is.      The\nsilence is companionable. Then...\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                Not used to a woman.     Giving me\n                presents.\n\nShe raises a brow.     Can scarcely believe that.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  One Christmas with Petal, I gave her\n                  eleven things. And I wrapped them.\n                  And watched her open them up.\n\nShe holds her friendly smile.     But her eyes have changed.\nSlightly.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  She didn't have anything for me.\n                  Like every year. But this one\n                  time, she said, 'Wait a minute.'\n\nWait a minute.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  She ran to the kitchen. I heard\n                  the fridge open. She came back.\n                  With her hands hidden behind her.\n                  Then, she held out...\n\nEven his voice.    Betrays the longing.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                  Two brown eggs. She gave them\n                  to me from her own hands. They\n                  were cold.\n\nHe smiles, self-conscious.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Must sound really stupid.   But\n                  they meant a lot to me.\n\nSilence.   A soft...\n\n                             WAVEY\n                  Well.   It's the thought that counts.\n\nHe nods.   He's glad she understands.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  I broke 'em, careful. Made her an\n                  omelette with 'em. And I saved the\n                  shells. In a little box.\n\nShe can't help but show her surprise at that.\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                  Oh, yeh. They're on a shelf\n                  behind my desk. At the paper.\n\nHe looks worried now.     Shouldn't have brought this up.   And seeing\nthis...\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   I know how it is. To hold onto\n                   something good. In the middle of\n                   all the bad.\n\nHe nods.     But feels truly awkward now.     So...\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Well. I gotta collect Bunny.\n                   Beety's gonna have supper waiting.\n\nRight.     She nods.   She understands this, too.\n\n                                WAVEY\n                   Thank you.     Thank you, very much.\n\nTakes her teapot and her bracelet.        Holds them.     A gentle barrier.\nHer hands now too full for a hug.\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                   Well.   Merry Christmas!\n\nWith a wonderful smile.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   Merry Christmas.\n\nWith one of her own.\n\nINT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\nQuoyle enters a packed auditorium, festooned for Christ's birthday\nwith every trimming imaginable. Rough fishermen in black jackets\nthey wear once a year, women in finery, schoolkids at their well-\nscrubbed best, antsy with anticipation. The BUZZ is audible,\npalpable. No Broadway opening could hope for this level of\neagerness.\n\nAs Quoyle comes down the aisle, we see faces we know. Boys from\nNutbeem's party. Billy Pretty with Jack and Mrs. Buggit. Alvin\nYark and his bird-like wife. The old-timer who sold Quoyle his\nboat. Mavis Bangs with an empty seat next to her, must be saved\nfor Agnis. All the kids from daycare. Still, Quoyle searching for\nthe face he doesn't find. And finally...\n\n...to the third row, where Dennis and Beety have saved him a seat.\nBeety gives him a peck on the cheek, and he smiles, settling in,\nnervous as hell, just as...\n\n...the school principal, still dressed for England, walks to the\nmike at center stage. Holds up her hands like the disciplinarian\nshe prides herself on being, and they quiet pretty fast.\n\n                             PRINCIPAL\n                   Your friends and neighbors, and\n                   most of all, your children. Have\n\n                worked hard to bring you the best\n                pageant ever.\n\nTHUNDEROUS applause, whistling, stamping. She is frustrated for a\nmoment. Then, waves cheerily against the din, shouting...\n\n                          PRINCIPAL\n                LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN!\n\nAnd RUNS off-stage, as we DISSOLVE THROUGH a SERIES OF ANGLES...\n\n...the Big Ugly Guy who led the raid on poor Nutbeem's boat stands\nin a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk, singing DANNY BOY in\nthe sweetest tenor one could dream of. PAN an audience, rapt,\nmotionless. Pavarotti never had more respect.\n\n...Bunny and Marty walk timidly to the front of the stage. Marty\ndressed in Christmas reds and greens. Bunny all in blue, which\ndoes look good on her. Kids CALL OUT their names. The place falls\nquiet. And the girls begin to sing a plaintive West African HYMN\nin small brave voices that sometimes harmonize. It is unexpected\nand breathtakingly courageous. Two dads in the third row have\ntears flooding their eyes...\n\n                          DENNIS (gruff whisper)\n                Not bad, my kid, eh?\n\n                            QUOYLE (gruffer whisper)\n                I'll say.    She's as good as mine.\n\n...Agnis Hamm walks out alone onto the stage, wearing a brown\njersey, tweed skirt, yellow stockings and red slippers. She has\nan odd look on her face, all serious and curious. The laughter and\ncalls die away to silence. Suddenly, one of her feet SCRATCHES at\nthe stage, her arms become WINGS, and with a CROONING and CACKLING\nshe metamorphoses into a PEEVISH HEN protecting an egg. The house\ncomes DOWN with laughter and UNISON applause. Quoyle glances back\nat Mavis Bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and WHISTLES\nin pure delight.\n\n...Wavey Prowse walks onto the rear of the stage, in a long black\nsmock, carrying her accordion. She turns to the wings, nods, and\nout comes little Herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes. A\nbeat of silence. Mom calls out: ONE, TWO, THREE, rolls into a\nsavage hornpipe and Herry commences the JIG Quoyle once glimpsed\nthrough a window. Three hundred HEELS coming STOMPING down in\nperfect rhythm and lift Herry into a joyous bouncing, rattling\nperformance that builds in intensity until the finish. He runs\nto the edge of the stage, bows DEEP from the waist, stands beaming\nin their applause. Then RACES offstage, his mom following with\ndignity, and we go with her into the wings...\n\nOnce there, Wavey slips OUT of the smock, revealing to the dimness\nof the wings, that she is wearing dancer's tights over drop-dead\nlegs. A close-fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles,\ncrystal diamonds, and dozens more glittering baubles that send a\nshimmer of prisms with her every breath. Herry hands her a top\n\nhat, a cane, and...\n\n...she STALKS back onto the stage, her lithe body strutting and\nglinting. A hush of stupefaction falls, only to be washed away\nby SHOUTS and WHISTLES, the kind of which have not been heard\nsince Gypsy Rose Lee startled her first roomful of rubes. In\nthe bedlam...\n\n...she TWIRLS the top hat on one finger, FLIPS it up in a double\nsomersault, catching it square on her head. She leans on her cane\n\nAnd when at last they quiet...\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 We all know Billy Pretty's ways.\n                 Never save fifty cents, if you\n                 can save a dollar.\n\nShe winks.   They laugh.   Billy laughing loudest.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Well, last Feb'ry, Billy wants\n                 t'get his grandfather clock repaired.\n                 Calls old Leander Mesher. Local\n                 call. No charge.\n\nTwirls the cane recklessly.    In the third row, a goggle-eyed Quoyle\ncouldn't blink if he tried.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Well, says Leander, the big cost is\n                 pickup and delivery. Got t'charge\n                 fifty dollars, each way. Two strong\n                 boys. Gasoline. Air in the tires!\n\nThat's right.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 There's no cost for air in yer\n                 tires!, says Bill.

Light snow just\nstarting to fall. A truck pulls up beneath a tree. Out climbs...\n\n...Wavey. Looking grim, walking slow. Crosses the road to a\nweathered diner. The woman who only smokes when she's worried,\npulls out a pack of Camels. Looks through the diner's frosted\nwindow...\n\n...a lone customer sits nursing his coffee. He is 40, lean, very\nattractive. Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own. Wavey\nlights up. Watches in silence until...\n\n...the man looks up. Their eyes meet through the glass.      Hold.\nAnd on his faint smile...\n\nShe turns her back.   Starts up the road.\n\nANGLE...he is walking beside her now. Snow drifting lazy, her\nsmoke curling up. He watches her anger, how cold and quiet and\nclosed. Smiles at her profile...\n\n                           HEROLD\n                 I shoulda come last night.

And you love me.\n\nShe stops walking.     Flips her cigarette off into the snow.       Turns\nnow...\n\nLooks into his face.     And sighs.\n\nEXT. SHORELINE - DAY\n\nRear ANGLE of Agnis, crouching in the lightly falling snow. At the\nedge of the sea. The spot where she once sent her dog to rest.\nHEAR footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks. A bulky figure\ncomes into frame. Crouches down beside her. Close.

Here comes\nthe hole card...\n\n                              WAVEY\n                   You have to think it's love.\n                   Because if it's not, you're dead\n                   inside. So you keep that flame a\n                   flickering. Cos it's all you'll\n                   ever have.\n\nPure contempt.     And honesty.\n\n                              WAVEY\n                   You see.   You're a good liar, too.\n\nLifts the cap.     Screws it back on the bottle.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   Where's the damn eggshells?     That's\n                   all I came to see.\n\nAnd from his prison of shock and shame.      He points to a shelf.      She\nis OFF his desk, like a panther...\n\n...SNATCHES the tiny padded box with its treasure.          RAISES it high\nto smash it, and...\n\n...stops.    To see the panic.    In his eyes.\n\nIt brings tears.     Pooling in hers.\n\nAnd she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency\nrequires.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   Can you guess how I know about\n                   Petal?\n\nHe cannot.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   Because you and I.   Are kindred\n                   souls. After all.\n\nAnd that.    Is what she came to say.\n\n                             WAVEY\n                   So I told my husband. To fuck\n                   himself. And the ego he rode in on.\n\nShe crosses the floor. Scoops up her coat.         Walks, just a little\nwobbly, to the door. Sighs.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Thanks for the mirror.\n\nNods.   Means that.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 If I don't see you.   Happy New Year.\n\nAnd leaves. The door closes quietly.      Quoyle looks from it.   To\nthe eggshells.\n\nAnd back.\n\nINT. DENNIS' HOUSE - LATER\n\nANGLE...Dennis and his wife BEETY bundled together asleep, as a\nferocious storm HOWLS around the house.\n\nANGLE...Quoyle awake on the sofa in Dennis' parlor. Clutching his\nblankets around him. Eyes jumping with every SHRIEK of the\nmarauding wind. Mind racing with thoughts of Wavey. And\neggshells.\n\nANGLE...Bunny asleep with Dennis' daughter MARTY. The room seems\nto vibrate under the violence of the weather's assault. CLOSE on\nBunny now, and...\n\n...her eyes OPEN. A strange intent in them. A knowledge. She\nslips from Marty's bed in her thin blue nightdress. Through the\nhouse in the dark, as the wind SCREAMS its warning. Into the par-\nlor where her father sleeps, as the wind suddenly INVADES, and...\n\n...SUCKS her straight UP the chimney and out INTO the heart of the\nstorm. SAILING like a loosened kite out across the black water.\nOut and out, as gray light rises, to...\n\n...Quoyle Point, where she is blown FLAT against a granite boulder\njust in front of the Green House, which SHIVERS and pleads against\nthe wind, its steel cables STRAINING, and suddenly from within the\nhouse, lights come ON...\n\n...the WHITE DOG is in a window. No longer snarling and menacing,\nbut whining pitifully, begging to be saved. And on the second\nfloor...\n\n...PETAL alone, wild-eyed with terror. She is dressed all in blue,\nand her daisy-chain necklace flies about her throat as she POUNDS\nagainst the glass, her eyes staring directly AT her daughter, who\ncan only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house...\n\n...begins to come LOOSE, the first cable SNAPPING and WHIPPING\nabout with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power, then the\nNEXT, and ANOTHER, and with Petal still visible, HOWLING in horror,\nwindows BURSTING everywhere else like flash bulbs, the house...\n\n...slides FREE, along the rocks, toward the cliff, Bunny screeching\n\nas it goes OVER the edge, TUMBLES down toward the sea, and Bunny...\n\n...sits BOLT UPRIGHT in bed, a single GASP as her dad is THERE,\nholding her tight. She is soaked with sweat. But her eyes are not\nwild. They are filled with the knowing.\n\n                            BUNNY (a whisper)\n                 Daddy.   The Green House is gone.\n\nHe smooths her hair. The wind bellows in rage.       Little Marty\nsomehow sleeps on, undisturbed, beside her.\n\n                           BUNNY (a whisper)\n                 I didn't dream it. Don't say I did.\n\nEXT. QUOYLE POINT - DAY\n\nThey climb from the station wagon into cold, clear sunlight.\nStare in wonder at the naked rock. The snapped, spent, cables.\nOnly shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the\ncliff.\n\nBunny RUNS toward the debris, and through it.     To a tangle of\nbushes near the cliff.\n\nHe walks to a broken cable. Crouches. His eyes running over the\nspace. Where his ancestor's home once stood. And then. He\nturns...\n\n                           QUOYLE (calls out)\n                 What you got there?\n\nWe see now. Bunny has unearthed a huge wooden crate from its\nhiding place. Too engrossed in counting its contents to respond.\n\nAs he comes over...\n\n                           BUNNY (not looking up)\n                 Petal's things.\n\nShe is counting her treasure trove of NECKLACES. More than any\nsound mind could imagine. Yet, in their infinite variety, somehow\nwonderful. A testimonial to the power of love.\n\n                           BUNNY\n                 I think they're all here.\n\nShe looks up.   Sees him staring so fixedly at them.\n\n                           BUNNY (alerted)\n                 What's wrong?\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 They're beautiful. I never saw\n                 'em. All together.\n\nOh.   The kid doesn't smile.   She decides whether to ask him...\n\n                           BUNNY\n                 Will she be proud to wear 'em?\n\nHe looks in her eyes.     His heart breaks behind his smile.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                 Well.    Any woman would.\n\nEXT. JACK BUGGIT'S SKIFF - MORNING\n\nSteel gray morning. The sea is more than a little rough, as Jack\nlays out his lobster traps. Two other boats, not too close by,\nappear and disappear in mist. He is checking the lines, knotting\nhefty weights onto the traps to take them down.\n\n                           JACK (sings to himself)\n                 Oh, th' Gandy Goose she ain't no uuuuse\n                    Cos all her nuts'n bolts is...\n\nStops.   Halfway to lowering the next trap over the side.\n\n                           JACK (mutters)\n                 Sweet Jesus. I'm turnin' inta\n                 Alvin Cockadoodle Yark!\n\nAs it nears the water line, Jack's cat SKIPPER TOM suddenly LEAPS\ndown ONTO the trap. Jack blinks.\n\n                           JACK\n                 What is this? Suicide attempt?\n\nTries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion, but the\ncat JUMPS BACK to the boat, Jack STUMBLING out of his way, STEPS in\nthe coiled line which WHIRRS as the trap goes...\n\n...DOWN, the line STRANGLING Jack's leg and WHIPPING him flailing\nOVER the side in one startling heartbeat. Almost comic to watch.\n\nBut then. It is very quiet.      Air bubbles appear at the surface.\nIn a few seconds...\n\nThe water is unbroken.     The boat bobs silently in the swells.\n\nINT. ALVIN YARK'S BOAT HOUSE - DAY\n\nQuoyle and Alvin inspect Quoyle's newly-finished boat. It is a\nbeauty, to be sure, and the old builder watches Quoyle lovingly\nrunning his hand across the smooth gunnel. Alvin doesn't smile.\nThat's not his style.\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 Gotta paint the name. What'll it be?\n                 'The Tall And Quiet Woman'?\n\nQuoyle glances over.     The old boy's eyes are dancing.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 You knew Billy's dad?\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 Ever'body knows ever'body. But\n                 Billy's pap didn't invent the\n                 Four Women in a Man's Life.\n\nQuoyle nods.   Guess not.\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 Well. Which one is Bunny, I wonder?\n                 The Maid in the Meadow, mebbe.\n\nBut Yoda is just staring at him.     And quietly...\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 Doncha know? They're all the same\n                 woman. That's the point.\n\nHis pupil blinks.   Like a crystal bullet of clarity his brain.\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 The Maid in the Meadow, that's\n                 her innocence and play. The\n                 Stouthearted Woman, is when you\n                 need to lean on her.\n\nFor some reason he could never name.     Tears are pooling in eyes.\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 The Tall and Quiet Woman? That's\n                 the silent partner who always walks\n                 'longside, so's yer never alone.\n\nQuoyle is nodding, now.     It all seems so right.\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 And the Demon Lover. That's just\n                 the frostin' on th' cake.\n\nA soft knocking at the door.\n\n                            ALVIN\n                 When y'find the woman who's all\n                 four? That's when y'got yer one\n                 true love.\n\nThe bird-like woman enters.     The old man nods toward her.\n\n                           ALVIN\n                 ...like m'Gertie.\n\nBut she isn't alone. A man enters behind her. It is Dennis\nBuggit. And there are tears on his face. He brings a dreadful\nsilence with him, because the face is an open grave.\n\n                          DENNIS\n                My dad went over the side this\n                mornin'. Tangled in th' sling-\n                stone line.\n\nA sob escapes from this strong man's throat.    He ignores it.    No\none knows what to say.\n\n                          DENNIS\n                If you could write a memorial t'\n                him. Fer t'morrow's Gammy Bird?\n                I'd be real grateful.\n\nEXT. JACK BUGGIT'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nThe road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons\nFolks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house. Ever'body\nknows ever'body.\n\nINT. JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nEvery room is filled with folks who wear their best. There is\neating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move\nthrough the crowd. As if some have taken hold of a wake's well-\nmeaning purpose. Others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and\nconfusion. There are children here, some hold a parent's hand,\nsome giggle with each other. Snapshot of a community. Struggling\nto cope.\n\nQuoyle and Bunny enter, holding hands, looking around.      As they\ncross the room...\n\n...two figures step into their path. Two women holding hands,\ntheir bodies close together. Their feeling for each other open for\nall to see. One is Agnis. And the other. Isn't Mavis Bangs.\n\n                          DAWN\n                Happy New Year, Mr. Quoyle. I'm\n                sorry I missed you at the pageant.\n\nSlightly startled, Quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemn\noccasion. At the proud look on his aunt's face.\n\n                          DAWN\n                I was in the wings, a course.\n                Wasn't our girl somethin'?\n\nOur girl, a course, is Agnis.   Who nearly blushes at the\ncompliment.\n\n                          DAWN\n                I say, y'have t'love a woman. Who's\n                in touch with her inner chicken.\n\nWell, who could argue with that. Dawn leans up, kisses Quoyle on\nthe cheek. And with surprising softness...\n\n                              AGNIS\n                   Nephew.   You okay?\n\n                                BUNNY\n                   He's okay.     He's not sleeping in\n                   the box.\n\nHer great aunt looks at this child. Bends to plant an unexpected\nkiss on the top of Bunny's head. The kid squirms, tugs her dad\nfirmly off, as he sends a parting wave.\n\nInto the parlor now. Quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past\nJack Buggit in his open coffin, resting on black-draped sawhorses.\nDennis and his mom stand by Jack, a hand and a word for each. And\nmoving into the line...\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   Remember what I told you.\n\nHis words a murmur.     Hers are bolder...\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   If he's not sleeping.     Why do they\n                   call it a awake?\n\nHe thinks.   As if it is a worthwhile question.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   We're the ones have to be awake.\n                   To how much we love him...\n\nNods to himself.     Yes.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   And how we should be good to each\n                   other. While we have the chance.\n\nHe looks down.     They are almost there.\n\n                                QUOYLE\n                   You think?\n\nShe is thinking. Keeping the thoughts to herself. At the coffin\nnow, he lifts her up to see. Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of\nhimself. Serene behind violet eyelids.\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   He looks like he's sleeping.\n\nDennis looks over.     His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his\nfriend.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   That's cos he's peaceful. No\n                   worries, anymore. No troubles.\n\nHe sets her down.     Clasps Mrs. Buggit's hand.     And from his\n\npocket...\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                I found this in Jack's drawer at\n                the paper. I don't know if it's\n                somethin' special...\n\nAn enameled wreath with the initial R, backed by a long, sharp pin\nShe tears up again, just to see it.\n\n                          MRS. BUGGIT\n                Oh, it's his lodge pin.    We were\n                lookin' all over.\n\nShe smiles bravely as she takes it.    Leans up to kiss his cheek.\n\n                          MRS. BUGGIT (a whisper)\n                Dennis showed me what y'wrote fer\n                th' paper. Did Jack proud.\n\nSo they look at each other. Dennis clears his throat, looks away.\nAnd then, Quoyle is leading Bunny off.\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                You hungry? There's sandwi...\n\n                          BUNNY\n                Petal's peaceful, too.\n\nJust a statement of fact.    To no one in particular.   Dad squeezes\nher hand. Manages...\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                You bet.    You can count on tha...\n\nBut she lets go. Scampers to a corner of the room.      To Herry\nProwse. And his mom.\n\nSo Quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat. And when\nWavey looks up. She is glad to see him. As he reaches her...\n\nShe holds up her wrist. Dangling from it, her turquoise bracelet\nShe wore her best for Jack. Quoyle stands very close. One last\nthing from his pocket...\n\n                          QUOYLE\n                New Year's present.\n\nA small box. Wrapped as careful as he could.     She looks to his\neyes, really?\n\n                            QUOYLE\n                Oh, yeh.    It's a Quoyle tradition.\n\nWell, in that case. She takes it into her slender fingers. Undoes\nthe ribbon, the paper. Lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue...\n\n...eggshells. Crushed almost to powder. Her heart comes straight\nto her eyes, even before the whispered...\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                   Thanks.   For the mirror.\n\nAnd across the room, Mrs. Buggit leans with trembling hands to fix\nthe Lodge pin to Jack's lapel. Shaking as she is, the hand\nlurches, the big pin goes PLUNGING, and...\n\n...a rattling COUGH. Rolls across this room. The world falls\nsilent. Jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out,\nstaring into the box.\n\n                             DENNIS\n                   DAD'S COME BACK!\n\nAnd LUNGES to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the\ncoffin's wedge. A sudden ROAR, there are SCREAMS, there is even\nLAUGHTER and WHISTLING, complete chaos. And in the bedlam, a tug\non Quoyle's coat...\n\n                              BUNNY\n                   See.   He woke up.\n\nEXT. OMALOOR BAY - DAY\n\nSunlit day of crystal perfection. The majesty of ice and towering\nrock and shimmering water. A scale so majestic, any cynic would be\nhard put to deny God's hand. And gliding into FRAME...\n\n...a tiny skiff.     On its maiden run.   We CLOSE to see...\n\n...painted on its side. THE FOUR WOMEN. One woman is rowing just\nnow, doing all the work. Her son sleeps in the bow. And in the\nmiddle of the little boat...\n\n...father and daughter. Are unpacking the picnic lunch.        There is\na lot of food. This could take awhile.\n\n                             BUNNY\n                   That's a funny thing to say.   For\n                   the first thing he said.\n\n                             QUOYLE\n                   What? 'I'm keepin' m'damn lobster\n                   license'?\n\nYeh.   That.\n\n                              QUOYLE\n                   Maybe he just said it. To make\n                   your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard.\n                   You think?\n\nShe keeps unpacking.      Her face quiet and serious.   Her thoughts her\nown.\n\n                           QUOYLE (very softly)\n                 It's not fair, is it. That Jack\n                 woke up. And Petal didn't.\n\nAnd since he's said her thought aloud.      She tells him...\n\n                              BUNNY\n                 Well.     The world's not fair.     You\n                 said.\n\nShe's not looking up.      But he knows she's listening.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 That's something the world is\n                 always teaching us. And sometimes,\n                 the learning comes later.\n\nThat gets through.    Both adults can see it.\n\n                           QUOYLE (a murmur)\n                 You taught me that.\n\nEyes resolutely down, she nods.      Remembers.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 You know. What we wait for?\n                 It's like the main stem of this\n                 boat. It gives us our shape.\n\nHer brow furrows.    Doesn't understand that.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 See, I know why you saved a place\n                 for Petal. All this time.\n\nOn this.   She looks up.     Her dad is smiling from his eyes.\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 Cos I'm the daddy. And you learn\n                 how to do. By watching me.\n\nAnd...\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 You just watched.     Better than\n                 I knew.\n\nStill holding Bunny's eyes. He beckons to the woman rowing.\nC'mere, a second. So Wavey sets down her oars. Slides over.\nAnd Quoyle whispers to his daughter...\n\n                           QUOYLE\n                 Watch this.\n\nHe leans his face. To Wavey's mouth. A kiss so tender, even a\nchild can't turn away. The moment lingers. And when it ends...\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 I'm thanking your daddy.     For all\n                 my presents.\n\n                           BUNNY\n                 There was only two.\n\nWavey looks at this girl.\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 More than two. Everything I need.\n                 Except...\n\nExcept.   She gathers all the courage it takes to say...\n\n                           WAVEY\n                 Except a necklace.\n\nAnd waits. We can feel her heart pounding in her throat.       Bunny\nstares back with eyes no one could read. And then...\n\n                           BUNNY\n                 I got a box of 'em.   You could\n                 pick one.\n\nA hush over this bay.   A woman stunned and grateful.\n\n                           BUNNY\n                 Then you'd have everything you need.\n\nWell, that seems true. So, the woman nods.       Her eyes flutter down.\nIn the silence, she unwraps a sandwich...\n\n                           WAVEY (a murmur)\n                 You want the cheese?\n\n                            BUNNY\n                 No.\n\nOkay, then. She hands that one to Quoyle.       And as she and Bunny\nlook for another, we PULL...\n\n...UP and AWAY, an AERIAL ANGLE swirling above the shimmering bay.\nThe boat so far below us. The people tiny specks. They could be\nanyone.\n\nAnyone at all.\n\n\nFADE TO BLACK.   ROLL END CREDITS.\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping News, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0E.
