LAUNDROMAT, MOCKINGBURG, NEW YORK - NIGHT\n</b>\nGlaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes,\nempty Coke machine flashing all lights orange. Only two dryers are\nhumming. It's very late. Keep PANNING to...\n\n...a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumpled\nnewspapers from a dryer. She flattens and folds them meticulously,\nher glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission.\n\n...a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on\na neat cloth atop a dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette,\nolives. Bottle of red. An air of competence, of indomitable\nupbeatness. He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were\nnormal. More curious about...\n\n...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if\ncramming for life's midterm exam. Thoughtful. Circles one,\nslowly. Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and four\nempty snickers wrappers. His version of cold supper. He reaches\nfor the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he...\n\n...rises. Goes to the candy machine. Drops in his 65 cents, hits\nthe button. The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the\nmechanism at the last moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One more\nretelling of the story of his life. He BANGS the machine half-\nheartedly. Nope. Shakes it with his shambling strength. Nada.\nPOUNDS the coin return button. Hat trick. He empties his pocket.\nStudies the results. Not enough. And without so much as a sigh...\n\n...he ambles back to his dryer. Starts to unwrap the last\nSnickers. Partridge taking this all in. But Mata Hari of the\nNeat Newspapers goes to the candy machine, KICKS it violently. Out\nfall the Snickers and the 65 cents. She scoops up both, turns in a\nsingle motion to...\n\n...GLARE death at the enemy. Quoyle opens his mouth to comment.\nBut. Doesn't. Resumes unwrapping his supper, as...\n\n...his dryer STOPS. He pops it open. Stares in. Blinks.\nSuddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor\nto reveal they have been...\n\n...STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid the\npile. This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level.

It is also his worst suit.\nPartridge points to the only enclosed office, and gives his buddy a\nhearty thumbs-up. Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a\nglaze of panic. We see now that he is chewing, somehow. On the\nway into the office, he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the\ncoffee. Enters...\n\n<b>INT.

BUNNY'S ROOM - NIGHT, FIVE YEARS LATER\n</b>\n...an ECU of Bunny, now six years old, asleep in the flickering\nblue light of a nearly-mute TV. Apparently she was watching\nSportscenter. PAN the darkened shoebox room. Toys everywhere, in\na clutter. A pile of used Barbies, limbs jutting in all\ndirections, waiting for a mass grave. BACK to Bunny, to see...\n\n...she sleeps in her father's lap. His chin resting on her head,\nan industrial-size bag of cookies handy. Somewhere, a door OPENS..\n\n...SLAMS HARD. Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurches\nINTO the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and he\nhurries to stop the door before it slams in his face.\n\nWhen she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever.\nHer laser glare.

He flinches.\n\n<b>                             PETAL\n</b>                   Find yourself.

In his face.\n\nHe stares at it. His lips part. But no sound comes.           Instead, he\nwalks the few steps to Bunny's room, to find her...\n\n...wide awake.   Sitting on the edge of her bed.     No question, she\nheard it all.\n\nSo Quoyle smiles. He reaches to the top of her battered armoire.\nHis eyes damp but dancing for his daughter. Pulls down...\n\n...a box of chocolates. Their stash.       He sits on the floor.     Opens\nthe lid, like buried treasure.\n\nShe comes to cuddle in his lap.     He feeds her one.   She feeds him\none. They've done this before.

A small house, its grassy\nyard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures,\ngalloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps\non sticks. A zoo of the mind. To one side, a table piled with\ncrafts, ignored by...\n\n...fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions, like bundled,\nunbridled banshees. Looks like fun. Two harried MOTHERS are\ntrying to cope with the chaos. And there, under a tree...\n\n...the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry. And in\nthe rain.

SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n</b>\nQuoyle enters a packed auditorium, festooned for Christ's birthday\nwith every trimming imaginable. Rough fishermen in black jackets\nthey wear once a year, women in finery, schoolkids at their well-\nscrubbed best, antsy with anticipation. The BUZZ is audible,\npalpable. No Broadway opening could hope for this level of\neagerness.\n\nAs Quoyle comes down the aisle, we see faces we know. Boys from\nNutbeem's party. Billy Pretty with Jack and Mrs. Buggit. Alvin\nYark and his bird-like wife. The old-timer who sold Quoyle his\nboat. Mavis Bangs with an empty seat next to her, must be saved\nfor Agnis. All the kids from daycare. Still, Quoyle searching for\nthe face he doesn't find. And finally...\n\n...to the third row, where Dennis and Beety have saved him a seat.\nBeety gives him a peck on the cheek, and he smiles, settling in,\nnervous as hell, just as...\n\n...the school principal, still dressed for England, walks to the\nmike at center stage. Holds up her hands like the disciplinarian\nshe prides herself on being, and they quiet pretty fast.\n\n<b>                             PRINCIPAL\n</b>                   Your friends and neighbors, and\n                   most of all, your children.

Then, waves cheerily against the din, shouting...\n\n<b>                          PRINCIPAL\n</b><b>                LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN!\n</b>\nAnd RUNS off-stage, as we DISSOLVE THROUGH a SERIES OF ANGLES...\n\n...the Big Ugly Guy who led the raid on poor Nutbeem's boat stands\nin a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk, singing DANNY BOY in\nthe sweetest tenor one could dream of. PAN an audience, rapt,\nmotionless. Pavarotti never had more respect.\n\n...Bunny and Marty walk timidly to the front of the stage. Marty\ndressed in Christmas reds and greens. Bunny all in blue, which\ndoes look good on her. Kids CALL OUT their names. The place falls\nquiet. And the girls begin to sing a plaintive West African HYMN\nin small brave voices that sometimes harmonize. It is unexpected\nand breathtakingly courageous. Two dads in the third row have\ntears flooding their eyes...\n\n                          DENNIS (gruff whisper)\n                Not bad, my kid, eh?\n\n                            QUOYLE (gruffer whisper)\n                I'll say.    She's as good as mine.\n\n...Agnis Hamm walks out alone onto the stage, wearing a brown\njersey, tweed skirt, yellow stockings and red slippers. She has\nan odd look on her face, all serious and curious. The laughter and\ncalls die away to silence. Suddenly, one of her feet SCRATCHES at\nthe stage, her arms become WINGS, and with a CROONING and CACKLING\nshe metamorphoses into a PEEVISH HEN protecting an egg. The house\ncomes DOWN with laughter and UNISON applause. Quoyle glances back\nat Mavis Bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and WHISTLES\nin pure delight.\n\n...Wavey Prowse walks onto the rear of the stage, in a long black\nsmock, carrying her accordion. She turns to the wings, nods, and\nout comes little Herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes. A\nbeat of silence. Mom calls out: ONE, TWO, THREE, rolls into a\nsavage hornpipe and Herry commences the JIG Quoyle once glimpsed\nthrough a window. Three hundred HEELS coming STOMPING down in\nperfect rhythm and lift Herry into a joyous bouncing, rattling\nperformance that builds in intensity until the finish. He runs\nto the edge of the stage, bows DEEP from the waist, stands beaming\nin their applause. Then RACES offstage, his mom following with\ndignity, and we go with her into the wings...\n\nOnce there, Wavey slips OUT of the smock, revealing to the dimness\nof the wings, that she is wearing dancer's tights over drop-dead\nlegs. A close-fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles,\ncrystal diamonds, and dozens more glittering baubles that send a\nshimmer of prisms with her every breath. Herry hands her a top\n<b>\n</b>hat, a cane, and...\n\n...she STALKS back onto the stage, her lithe body strutting and\nglinting. A hush of stupefaction falls, only to be washed away\nby SHOUTS and WHISTLES, the kind of which have not been heard\nsince Gypsy Rose Lee startled her first roomful of rubes. In\nthe bedlam...\n\n...she TWIRLS the top hat on one finger, FLIPS it up in a double\nsomersault, catching it square on her head. She leans on her cane\n\nAnd when at last they quiet...\n\n<b>                           WAVEY\n</b>                 We all know Billy Pretty's ways.\n                 Never save fifty cents, if you\n                 can save a dollar.\n\nShe winks.   They laugh.   Billy laughing loudest.\n\n<b>                           WAVEY\n</b>                 Well, last Feb'ry, Billy wants\n                 t'get his grandfather clock repaired.\n                 Calls old Leander Mesher.

Light snow just\nstarting to fall. A truck pulls up beneath a tree. Out climbs...\n\n...Wavey. Looking grim, walking slow. Crosses the road to a\nweathered diner. The woman who only smokes when she's worried,\npulls out a pack of Camels. Looks through the diner's frosted\nwindow...\n\n...a lone customer sits nursing his coffee. He is 40, lean, very\nattractive. Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own. Wavey\nlights up. Watches in silence until...\n\n...the man looks up. Their eyes meet through the glass.      Hold.\nAnd on his faint smile...\n\nShe turns her back.   Starts up the road.\n\nANGLE...he is walking beside her now. Snow drifting lazy, her\nsmoke curling up.

You okay?\n\n<b>                                BUNNY\n</b>                   He's okay.     He's not sleeping in\n                   the box.\n\nHer great aunt looks at this child. Bends to plant an unexpected\nkiss on the top of Bunny's head. The kid squirms, tugs her dad\nfirmly off, as he sends a parting wave.\n\nInto the parlor now. Quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past\nJack Buggit in his open coffin, resting on black-draped sawhorses.\nDennis and his mom stand by Jack, a hand and a word for each. And\nmoving into the line...\n\n<b>                             QUOYLE\n</b>                   Remember what I told you.\n\nHis words a murmur.     Hers are bolder...\n\n<b>                             BUNNY\n</b>                   If he's not sleeping.     Why do they\n                   call it a awake?\n\nHe thinks.   As if it is a worthwhile question.\n\n<b>                             QUOYLE\n</b>                   We're the ones have to be awake.\n                   To how much we love him...\n\nNods to himself.     Yes.\n\n<b>                             QUOYLE\n</b>                   And how we should be good to each\n                   other. While we have the chance.\n\nHe looks down.     They are almost there.\n\n<b>                                QUOYLE\n</b>                   You think?\n\nShe is thinking. Keeping the thoughts to herself. At the coffin\nnow, he lifts her up to see. Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of\nhimself. Serene behind violet eyelids.\n\n<b>                             BUNNY\n</b>                   He looks like he's sleeping.\n\nDennis looks over.     His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his\nfriend.\n\n<b>                             QUOYLE\n</b>                   That's cos he's peaceful. No\n                   worries, anymore. No troubles.\n\nHe sets her down.     Clasps Mrs. Buggit's hand.     And from his\n<b>\n</b>pocket...\n\n<b>                          QUOYLE\n</b>                I found this in Jack's drawer at\n                the paper. I don't know if it's\n                somethin' special...\n\nAn enameled wreath with the initial R, backed by a long, sharp pin\nShe tears up again, just to see it.\n\n<b>                          MRS. BUGGIT\n</b>                Oh, it's his lodge pin.    We were\n                lookin' all over.\n\nShe smiles bravely as she takes it.    Leans up to kiss his cheek.\n\n                          MRS. BUGGIT (a whisper)\n                Dennis showed me what y'wrote fer\n                th' paper. Did Jack proud.\n\nSo they look at each other. Dennis clears his throat, looks away.\nAnd then, Quoyle is leading Bunny off.\n\n<b>                          QUOYLE\n</b>                You hungry? There's sandwi...\n\n<b>                          BUNNY\n</b>                Petal's peaceful, too.\n\nJust a statement of fact.    To no one in particular.   Dad squeezes\nher hand. Manages...\n\n<b>                            QUOYLE\n</b>                You bet.    You can count on tha...\n\nBut she lets go. Scampers to a corner of the room.      To Herry\nProwse. And his mom.\n\nSo Quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat. And when\nWavey looks up. She is glad to see him. As he reaches her...\n\nShe holds up her wrist. Dangling from it, her turquoise bracelet\nShe wore her best for Jack. Quoyle stands very close. One last\nthing from his pocket...\n\n<b>                          QUOYLE\n</b>                New Year's present.\n\nA small box. Wrapped as careful as he could.     She looks to his\neyes, really?\n\n<b>                            QUOYLE\n</b>                Oh, yeh.    It's a Quoyle tradition.\n\nWell, in that case. She takes it into her slender fingers. Undoes\nthe ribbon, the paper. Lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue...\n<b>\n</b>...eggshells. Crushed almost to powder. Her heart comes straight\nto her eyes, even before the whispered...\n\n<b>                              QUOYLE\n</b>                   Thanks.   For the mirror.\n\nAnd across the room, Mrs. Buggit leans with trembling hands to fix\nthe Lodge pin to Jack's lapel. Shaking as she is, the hand\nlurches, the big pin goes PLUNGING, and...\n\n...a rattling COUGH. Rolls across this room. The world falls\nsilent. Jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out,\nstaring into the box.\n\n<b>                             DENNIS\n</b><b>                   DAD'S COME BACK!\n</b>\nAnd LUNGES to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the\ncoffin's wedge. A sudden ROAR, there are SCREAMS, there is even\nLAUGHTER and WHISTLING, complete chaos. And in the bedlam, a tug\non Quoyle's coat...\n\n<b>                              BUNNY\n</b>                   See.   He woke up.\n\n<b>EXT. OMALOOR BAY - DAY\n</b>\nSunlit day of crystal perfection. The majesty of ice and towering\nrock and shimmering water. A scale so majestic, any cynic would be\nhard put to deny God's hand. And gliding into FRAME...\n\n...a tiny skiff.     On its maiden run.   We CLOSE to see...\n\n...painted on its side. THE FOUR WOMEN. One woman is rowing just\nnow, doing all the work. Her son sleeps in the bow. And in the\nmiddle of the little boat...\n\n...father and daughter. Are unpacking the picnic lunch.        There is\na lot of food. This could take awhile.\n\n<b>                             BUNNY\n</b>                   That's a funny thing to say.   For\n                   the first thing he said.\n\n<b>                             QUOYLE\n</b>                   What? 'I'm keepin' m'damn lobster\n                   license'?\n\nYeh.   That.\n\n<b>                              QUOYLE\n</b>                   Maybe he just said it. To make\n                   your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard.\n                   You think?\n\nShe keeps unpacking.      Her face quiet and serious.   Her thoughts her\nown.\n<b>\n</b>                           QUOYLE (very softly)\n                 It's not fair, is it. That Jack\n                 woke up. And Petal didn't.\n\nAnd since he's said her thought aloud.      She tells him...\n\n<b>                              BUNNY\n</b>                 Well.     The world's not fair.     You\n                 said.\n\nShe's not looking up.      But he knows she's listening.\n\n<b>                           QUOYLE\n</b>                 That's something the world is\n                 always teaching us. And sometimes,\n                 the learning comes later.\n\nThat gets through.    Both adults can see it.\n\n                           QUOYLE (a murmur)\n                 You taught me that.\n\nEyes resolutely down, she nods.      Remembers.\n\n<b>                           QUOYLE\n</b>                 You know. What we wait for?\n                 It's like the main stem of this\n                 boat. It gives us our shape.\n\nHer brow furrows.    Doesn't understand that.\n\n<b>                           QUOYLE\n</b>                 See, I know why you saved a place\n                 for Petal. All this time.\n\nOn this.   She looks up.     Her dad is smiling from his eyes.\n\n<b>                           QUOYLE\n</b>                 Cos I'm the daddy. And you learn\n                 how to do. By watching me.\n\nAnd...\n\n<b>                           QUOYLE\n</b>                 You just watched.     Better than\n                 I knew.\n\nStill holding Bunny's eyes. He beckons to the woman rowing.\nC'mere, a second. So Wavey sets down her oars. Slides over.\nAnd Quoyle whispers to his daughter...\n\n<b>                           QUOYLE\n</b>                 Watch this.\n\nHe leans his face. To Wavey's mouth. A kiss so tender, even a\nchild can't turn away. The moment lingers. And when it ends...\n<b>\n</b><b>                           WAVEY\n</b>                 I'm thanking your daddy.     For all\n                 my presents.\n\n<b>                           BUNNY\n</b>                 There was only two.\n\nWavey looks at this girl.\n\n<b>                           WAVEY\n</b>                 More than two. Everything I need.\n                 Except...\n\nExcept.   She gathers all the courage it takes to say...\n\n<b>                           WAVEY\n</b>                 Except a necklace.\n\nAnd waits. We can feel her heart pounding in her throat.       Bunny\nstares back with eyes no one could read. And then...\n\n<b>                           BUNNY\n</b>                 I got a box of 'em.   You could\n                 pick one.\n\nA hush over this bay.   A woman stunned and grateful.\n\n<b>                           BUNNY\n</b>                 Then you'd have everything you need.\n\nWell, that seems true. So, the woman nods.       Her eyes flutter down.\nIn the silence, she unwraps a sandwich...\n\n                           WAVEY (a murmur)\n                 You want the cheese?\n\n<b>                            BUNNY\n</b>                 No.\n\nOkay, then. She hands that one to Quoyle.       And as she and Bunny\nlook for another, we PULL...\n\n...UP and AWAY, an AERIAL ANGLE swirling above the shimmering bay.\nThe boat so far below us. The people tiny specks. They could be\nanyone.\n\nAnyone at all.\n\n\n<b>FADE TO BLACK.
