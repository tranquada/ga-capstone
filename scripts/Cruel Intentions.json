MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1\n\n     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and\n     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the\n     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM\n     into a window.\n\n2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2\n\n     A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at\n     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and\n     Freud line the shelves.\n\n     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front\n     of her looking impatient.\n\n     The therapist continues to write notes.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               Jesus. We've been at this for six\n               months.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I know.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               And you haven't made an ounce of\n               progress.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I know.\n\n     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n                    (not looking up)\n               There's no smoking in my office.\n\n     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.\n     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking\n     her head.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               What do you want me to say? That I'm\n               supposed to feel remorse because I act\n               the way I do? The truth is I don't.\n\n     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n               Look, I'm not like all the other kids\n               in high school. I don't care about book\n               reports and extra-credit. Teachers\n               are idiots anyway. The only challenge\n               out there for me is women. You see a\n               girl you like. You pursue them. You\n               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               But you said you have the worst\n               reputation.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I do.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               Don't you want to change that?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Let me tell you something, doctor.\n               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.\n               They say they don't, but they don't\n               mean it. They all think that they're\n               the ones that are going to \"save me.\"\n               The trick is to let them think it's\n               true.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               I think that's all the time we have\n               for today.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Same time next week?\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               No. This is going to be our last\n               session.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Why? I like spending time with you.\n               You know, you're quite attractive for\n               a woman your age. You have killer legs.\n               Killer.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a\n               lot of money to send you here. I'm\n               trying to help you.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big\n               help.\n\n     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n               He was a coke addict, you know.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               You think you can come in here with that\n               cute little smirk on your face and try\n               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,\n               Sebastian.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               It works a little.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               No it doesn't. I see right through you.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               You do?\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               I hope for your sake you grow out of\n               this immature phase. It's going to get\n               you into trouble.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Well, you don't have to get nasty about\n               it.\n\n     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               My daughter, Rachel.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Yummy.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an\n               exceptionally well rounded young\n               woman, who happens to be attending\n               Princeton this fall. She's way too\n               smart to fall for your line of b.s.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Really? Care to make a wager on that?\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               Good luck, Sebastian.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               What, nervous I'm going to win?\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               Would you please leave.\n\n     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)\n               Asshole.\n\n     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her\n     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of\n     Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo\n     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)\n               Rachel, it's mom.\n\n                                                  INTERCUT WITH:\n\n3    INT.

GREENBAUM\n               Who told you?\n\n                              RACHEL\n               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.\n\n     She continues to cry.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM\n               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep\n               breath, and step out of the circle.\n\n                              RACHEL\n               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,\n               mom.

GREENBAUM\n               You son of a bitch.\n\n     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several\n     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her\n     expressionless as the elevator doors close.\n\n                              DR.

He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.\n\n                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)\n               Fuck off, Harold.\n\n     He gasps.\n\n5    EXT.

She sits with a forced smile on her\n     face and listens attentively as -\n\n     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite\n     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful\n     teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt\n     with a Koala Bear on it.\n\n                              MRS.

You've always been an\n               inspiration to Beau and I on raising\n               her.

ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18\n\n     Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               So what year are you going into?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Junior.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Got a boyfriend back home?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               No.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Why not?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               I don't know. Relationships seem too\n               distracting. I'd rather concentrate on\n               my studies.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               You a lesbo?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n                    (annoyed)\n               No.\n\n     She bends over to pick up the saddle.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Nice.\n\n     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Are you often this offensive on a first\n               encounter?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I was just being honest. You happen to\n               have a nice ass. Sorry.\n\n     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I read your teen beat manifesto.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               You did?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I must say I found it rather appalling.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               That's a first. Most people praised me\n               for it.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Most people are morons. I mean who are\n               you to knock what you've never experienced?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my\n               belief that people shouldn't actually\n               experience the act of love until they are\n               in love and that people our age are too\n               immature to be in touch with those\n               emotions.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Oh really?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Take yourself. You've slept with several\n               women. Are you happier because of it?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               How do you know I've been with several\n               women?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               A friend wrote me.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n                    (pissed)\n               Well maybe you should get to know the\n               person before you judge them instead of\n               listening to some bullshit gossip.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...\n               but you still didn't answer the question.\n\n     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Who the hell is taking the time to write\n               letters, spreading this shit about me?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               It's not really important.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're\n               not going to be friends.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Why are you being so dramatic?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm\n               trying to deal with them and the last\n               thing I need is people spreading shit\n               about me.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Alright, I said I was sorry.\n                    (beat)\n               Can we start over again? I think we've\n               gotten off on the wrong foot.\n\n     She approaches him and they shake.\n\n                              ANNETTE (cont'd)\n               Annette Harrison.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Sebastian Valmont.\n\n     She smiles, but before he releases her hand:\n\n                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since\n               you've never had sex do you touch\n               yourself?\n\n     She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n               What did I say?\n\n19   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      19\n\n     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.\n\n                              RONALD (O.S.)\n               That's good, that's good.\n\n     WE PULL BACK\n\n     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD\n     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African\n     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a\n     music lesson.\n\n                              RONALD (cont'd)\n               Now let's try the A minor scale.\n\n     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.\n\n     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.\n\n                              RONALD (cont'd)\n               Once more, and remember the third note\n               is flat.\n\n     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.\n\n                              CECILE\n               Oh, I suck. I suck.\n\n                              RONALD\n               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.\n\n     Cecile takes a deep breath\n\n                              RONALD (cont'd)\n               You're concentrating too much on your\n               bowing. Let it flow.\n\n     He stands and sits behind her.\n\n                              RONALD (cont'd)\n               Here, let me help you.\n\n     He places his hand over hers.\n\n                              RONALD (cont'd)\n               Now close your eyes and let's try again.\n\n     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds\n     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's\n     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.\n\n     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses\n     her face.\n\n     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach\n     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes\n     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens\n     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.\n\n     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table\n     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.\n\n     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.\n               Your playing was beautiful.\n\n     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile\n\n                              CECILE\n               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's\n               giving me music lessons over the\n               summer.\n\n     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.\n\n                              RONALD\n               Pleased to meet you.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Likewise I'm sure.\n\n                              CECILE\n               Ronald is one of the few high school\n               students attending Juliard. He's\n               composing his first opera.\n\n                              RONALD\n               It's based on the life of Doctor\n               Martin Luther King.\n\n                              CECILE\n               Doctor King is my favorite.\n\n     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him\n     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.\n\n                              RONALD\n               I guess our hour's up. Same time\n               tomorrow?\n\n     Cecile nods.\n\n20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20\n\n     Another nice home in Connecticut.

McConnell hates me.\n               I fingered his girlfriend at the game\n               last year.\n\n                              BLAINE\n               I don't think that bothered him.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               What do you mean?\n\n                              BLAINE\n               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight\n               ends on and off the field.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Are you shitting me?\n\n                              BLAINE\n               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak\n               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd\n               go at it for a while, then as soon as\n               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You\n               know -\n                    (imitating Greg)\n               \"What are you doing, man?

The only reason why\n               I let him continue with his charade is\n               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.\n\n                              BLAINE\n               Not anymore. Football team started\n               practice last week. He's already called\n               me to hook up.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Really. You think you could arrange a\n               little get together with him tonight on\n               my behalf?\n\n                              BLAINE\n               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing\n               Spartacus on television tonight.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Outstanding.\n\n                              BLAINE\n               Don't think it's not going to cost you.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               No problem. Just make sure your front\n               door is unlocked. Shall we say the\n               \"stroke of midnight\" no pun intended?\n\n     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.\n\n22   EXT.

Cecile does\n     as instructed and they start to make out.\n\n     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands\n     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and\n     continues her seduction.\n\n     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under\n     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.\n\n     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other\n     and smile.\n\n                              KATHRYN (cont'd)\n               Not bad.\n\n                              CECILE\n               That was cool.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Maybe you should try it on your friend\n               Ronald sometime.\n\n                              CECILE\n               What are you saying?\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Oh come on Cecile.

I\n               questioned whether or not to tell you,\n               but something like this could destroy\n               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't\n               want to see her get hurt.\n\n     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales\n     counter.\n\n                              KATHRYN (cont'd)\n               I hope I did the right thing in telling\n               you.

I left my credit cards at home.\n\n     Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse.\n\n                              MRS.

Well let me tell you\n               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.\n               Do you think I relish the fact that I\n               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty\n               four seven, so I can be considered a\n               \"laaaady.\" Do you think I take great\n               delight when I hear - \"Kathryn is so\n               wonderful.\" \"Kathryn is a model child.\"\n               \"Kathryn is going to make an excellent\n               wife one day.\"\n                    (beat)\n               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the\n               upper East Side and sometimes I want to\n               kill myself for it.

We played three games of backgammon\n               and...\n\n     She throws him a look.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking\n               mind. I hate doing charity.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad\n               person.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Yes it does.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               No, it doesn't.

You know what\n               your problem is? You take yourself way\n               too seriously.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I do not.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Lighten up.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I am lighten. Can we drop this?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Fine.\n\n     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's\n     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a\n     face. Sebastian looks over.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               What are you doing? Stop it, it's\n               distracting.\n\n     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n               Cut it out.\n\n     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               No.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               No?\n\n     She makes the face again.

I don't know - it was weird.\n               At first it felt icky, then it felt\n               kind of okay. Then, I started getting\n               really hot and then I started shaking\n               and then like, I don't t know... it\n               felt like an explosion, but a good one.\n\n     Kathryn laughs.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Cecile, you had an orgasm.\n\n                              CECILE\n               I did?\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               I'm so proud of you.

Cecile embraces her, happy.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Now listen. Now that you're on your\n               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.\n               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him\n               instruct you.\n\n                              CECILE\n               I don't love him. I love Ronald.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a\n               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,\n               Cecile.

It's just\n               that nobody talks about it.\n\n     Cecile takes the information in.\n\n                              CECILE\n               It's like a secret society.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               That's one way of looking at it.\n\n                              CECILE\n               Cool.\n\n58   EXT.

That's the amazing part of\n               it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du\n               Soleil acrobatics, just standard\n               missionary stuff, but it was... ah\n               forget it.

You don't love me\n               anymore.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a\n               contest.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               At first it was, but now it's become\n               something bigger.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Kathryn, you know I love you.

You're just saying this because\n               you lost the bet.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Is that what you think?\n\n     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her\n     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it\n     aside, spreading her legs.\n\n                              KATHRYN (cont'd)\n               Alright, come on, let's get it over\n               with.

You're a joke. She's\n               turned you into jelly. What do you want\n               to be, one of those losers who walk\n               down the halls holding hands and\n               smiling. People used to respect you.\n               They feared you and now you're going to\n               throw that all away.\n\n     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.\n\n                              KATHRYN (cont'd)\n               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but\n               now he's just another love-struck\n               faggot. One of the many.\n\n80   EXT.

Sebastian looks nervous.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Why so nervous?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I've never done this before.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               How have you dumped girls in the past?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Screening calls. Any suggestions?\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               I knew this guy last summer in the\n               Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the\n               time were madly in love with each\n               other. But she had this huge weight\n               problem. His friends taunted him\n               mercilessly about it. You know, \"How\n               do you breathe when she sits on your\n               face?\" \"It's embarrassing for you to\n               be seen with her.\" Finally he couldn't\n               take it anymore and decided to dump\n               her. She flipped and he went on the\n               defensive. I distinctly remember him\n               saying the same thing over and over\n               again. \"I'm completely fucked up.\"\n               \"I'm completely fucked up.\" \"I'm\n               completely fucked up.\"\n                    (beat)\n               Poor fatty never had a chance.\n\n82   EXT.

I'm completely\n               fucked up.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               What are you saying?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Why aren't you understanding?\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               I love you.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I know. I wish I felt the same.\n               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think\n               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm\n               completely fucked up.\n\n     Annette bursts into tears.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Why are you trying to hurt me?\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to\n               see what you were like in bed.\n\n     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.\n     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with\n     his hand.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)\n               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea\n               would appreciate you acting like a\n               total psychopath.\n\n     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               You don't know how to love.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               You don't even know me. The fact of the\n               matter is there is some one I love.\n               She's smarter, prettier... you don't\n               even compare to her. The only reason I\n               am here is because she wants us to be\n               exclusive.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               But you knew this was important to me.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               What, your virginity? Well that's over\n               now.\n\n     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves\n     towards her.\n\n                              ANNETTE\n               Please go.\n\n     He opens the door.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.\n\n     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette\n     continues to sob.\n\n86   EXT.

Right now\n               they're having a little get together\n               in my love shack at the Grand Central\n               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile\n               over you, but I promised him I would\n               see you through your crisis.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               Well done.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               Thank you.

But it\n               amused me to make you ashamed of it.\n               You gave up on the first person you\n               ever loved because I called you names.\n               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that\n               you chose me over her, but please\n               understand, I never loved you,\n               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little\n               toy I play with. And now you've\n               completely blown it with her. I think\n               that's the saddest thing I've ever\n               heard.\n                    (smiles)\n               Cheers.\n\n     She clicks his glass and drinks.

One. Two... three.\n\n                              KATHRYN\n               I think you have your answer.\n\n                              SEBASTIAN\n               War it is.\n\n     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind\n     him.\n\n89   INT.

I don't know what I can\n               possibly say to rectify the harm I have\n               caused you. For once in my life I'm at\n               a loss for words.\n\n97   INT.

My whole life has been a\n               joke. I prided myself on taking joy in\n               others' misery.\n\n98   INT.

I\n               wish more than anything I could take it\n               back, but I guess that's not possible.\n\n99   INT.

He sent it to me the day\n               before he died. Everything about you is\n               in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs,\n               the menages, your bout with bulimia,\n               the affair you had with your guidance\n               counselor and how he gave you... eww.\n               Let's see, then there's your coke\n               problem...

You're going to do what I tell\n               you to do, wear what I tell you to\n               wear. You're going to befriend the\n               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.\n               Think of the social ramifications it\n               will cause. You and I are going to turn\n               this school around. And do you know why\n               you're going to do it?\n                    (beat)\n               Cause your ass is mine.\n\n     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully\n     on the mouth, then shoves her back.

She takes\n     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.\n\n     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing \"Goodbye To Love.\"\n\n     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's\n     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in\n     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.\n\n108  EXT.
