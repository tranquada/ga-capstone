BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY\n\nFlying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at\nspitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central\nAlaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nA thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills\nlike a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to\ntundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the\ncoming of autumn.\n\nOn the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott\nMountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and\njagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all\nNorth America once looked -- raw, indomitable.\n\nThen, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching\nacross the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.\nBisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,\ndepending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long\nTrans-Alaskan Pipeline.\n\nEven the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant\nby the vastness of the land.  It goes on, and on, and on...\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nA lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel\ntrail running parallel to the pipeline.  The weather turns\nsour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's\npath.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nThe man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven,\ndetermined.  He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a\nbusiness suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.\n\nEric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a\npredator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote.  But the\nfootprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nThe weather becomes more oppressive.  Heavy snow, gale winds\nand sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous.  Eric\nstrives stubbornly forward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n1\tCONTINUED:\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEric has gathered some branches.  He tries to make a fire.\nMoisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar\nof his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the\ncold.\n\nHis hands are too numb to hold the matches.  After several\nattempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of\nwood, exhausted and frustrated.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nThe snow has covered the pile of branches.  Eric still sits\nnext to it, partially covered in snow himself.\n\nERIC\n\nHis face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a\npurplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over.\nThe wind HOWLS around him.  The snow sticks to his eyelashes\nand hair without melting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEND DREAM\n\n2\tINT.  DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nEric bolts up in bed.  Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits\nup and hugs him.  All that can be seen of her in the dark is\na lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.  After a\nmoment, Eric kisses her.  He shakes off the dream and lies\nback down.\n\n3\tEXT.  HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY\n\nA metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a\npipeline support piling:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR\n\t\t\t\t  PRIVATE PROPERTY\n\t\t\t\t  NO   TRESPASSING\n\t\t\t\t  NO\t  HUNTING\n\t\t\t\t  NO\t TRAPPING\n\t\t\t\t  NO\t SHOOTING\n\nWIDER\n\nEric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead\nof him.  Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's\nconfident and resolute in attitude.  His clothes have a\ndistinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan\ncotton shirt.  His down parka is unzipped in the sunny,\nwindless, forty-degree afternoon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n3\tCONTINUED:\n\nHe pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a\nfour-power scope mounted atop it.  He peers through the\nscope.\n\nHIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE\n\nHe puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big,\nivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nAnne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens\nin her hand, holding her breath in anticipation.  She's\ntwenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue\neyes.  She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born\nin it.\n\nEric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger.\nBut instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of\na CO2-powered dart gun.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nThe tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy\nshoulder.  The wolf takes off running, but almost\nimmediately slows, sits, then lies down.\n\nEric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing\ndeeply.  Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tWhat a beauty.\n\t\t\t(to Anne Marie)\n\t\t\tHand me the transmitter.\n\nAnne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device\nattached to a steel collar band.  Eric puts the collar\nloosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all\nthe while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal.\nAnne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some\nphotos.\n\nWith the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric\nbacks away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its\nnarcosis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tHe's coming around fine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNE MARIE\n\t\t\tBe right back.  I left my\n\t\t\tcamcorder in the car.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n3\tCONTINUED:  (2)\n\nFOLLOW ANNE MARIE\n\nas she hurries back to their International Scout.  On the\ndoor of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick,\nunder which are the words:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.\n\nAnne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.\n\nANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF\n\nEric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and\ntrots unsteadily away.  Near the treeline the wolf turns,\nglances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nAnne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat.  Looking through\nthe viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline\npiling and a rock formation.  Eric turns toward her and a\nglint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tAnne Marie!  Stop!\n\nShe glances down.  Something metal is half-buried in the\ndead leaves and gravel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tDon't move.\n\nEric runs over.  He pokes at the object with a stick.  With\na SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half.  Anne\nMarie jumps back.  Eric brushes the dead leaves on the\nground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the\ngully.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tGoddamn trappers!\n\nHe angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing\nseveral others attached to one another by a long chain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tTakes nerve, laying traplines on\n\t\t\trestricted land.\n\nEric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the\npipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n3\tCONTINUED:  (3)\n\nUsing the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the\nHaul Road.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNE MARIE\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tHe still might be around.  I saw\n\t\t\tfresh tire tracks coming in.\n\nHIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE\n\nThe road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,\nnorth and south.  In the distance, a jeep is parked on the\nHaul Road.  Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow\nravine.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nEric hurries down the footpegs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tMan and a jeep, about a mile and\n\t\t\ta half down.\n\nHe jumps into the Scout.  Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into\nthe hatchback.  As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.\n\n4\tINT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)\n\nIt races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.\n\n5\tEXT.  HAUL ROAD\n\nStartled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uproots\nhis traps and runs out of the ravine.  He WHISTLES and\nanother Trapper appears nearby.\n\n6\tINT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP\n\nThey pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep.  It's\noddly well-equipped, however.  Bolted to the dashboard is an\nexpensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver\nwith a round locating screen.  They zoom off.\n\n7\tINT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)\n\nEric stomps on the gas.  The dust from the jeep obscures his\nview but he's gaining on them anyway.  Anne Marie hangs on\nand squints her eyes against the choking dust.\n\n\n\n8\tINT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)\n\nThe driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.\nHis entire outfit is made of animal hide.  He has long red\nhair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic\nsneer.  While driving, he scans along the pipeline.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLEMALLE\n\t\t\tWhere the fuck did you drop\n\t\t\tCorbett off?\n\nIn the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and\nlooks grim.  He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly\nmatted hair and tired grey eyes.  He's dressed in a brown\nlong coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw\nholster strapped to his leg.  Despite his intimidating air,\nconfrontation is not his style.\n\nHe spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy\ncreek.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\t\tHe's over there.\n\n9\tEXT.  HAUL ROAD\n\nTurning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the\ncreek bed without slowing.  Bouncing, it comes down hard\nagainst the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark.\nLeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the\nmud.\n\nEric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.\n\n10   INT.  SCOUT\n\nEric opens his door.  To Anne Marie:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tStay here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNE MARIE\n\t\t\tBe careful -- there're two of\n\t\t\tthem.\n\nEric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne\nMarie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tIf I unzip my parka, stick this\n\t\t\tout the window.\n\n11   EXT.  HAUL ROAD\n\nEric confidently approaches the jeep.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n11   CONTINUED:\n\nThen, a third trapper climbs from the creek.  He's got a\nline of traps slung around his neck and a world of\nexperience on his face.  He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long\nhuntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.\n\nHe has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's\neyes.  He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton\ncoveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots.  On his belt is\na holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.\n\nEric slows down.  He didn't expect to face anyone as\nformidable as Corbett.\n\n12   INT. / EXT. JEEP\n\nEmboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the\nback seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORBETT\n\t\t\t(to LeMalle)\n\t\t\tNo shooting.  Let's see who's so\n\t\t\tinterested in us.\n\nCorbett has an incongruously affable voice.  He throws his\ntraps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\t\t(to Corbett)\n\t\t\tAin't worth it, Ben...\n\n13   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT\n\nAs Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've\nbeen a great idea.  Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the\nair, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tYou got two counts against you --\n\t\t\ttrapping out of season and\n\t\t\tpoaching on restricted land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORBETT\n\t\t\tCan't be much of a crime, if all\n\t\t\tthey got minding the area is a\n\t\t\tcocky kid.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tI got your plate number, asshole.\n\t\t\tMaybe you feel like spending a\n\t\t\tfew months in jail.\n\nCorbett just smiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n13   CONTINUED:\n\nBut LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep\nwindow.\n\nSeeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowly\nunzips his parka.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLEMALLE\n\t\t\tBen?  Sure you don't want me to\n\t\t\tdrop the fucker?\n\nCorbett doesn't answer.  Then, his eyes narrow and he looks\npast Eric at the Scout.\n\nCORBETT'S POV\n\nThe passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another\nrifle out the window.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nEric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne\nMarie's backing him up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tYou leave and don't come back,\n\t\t\tthat's the end of it.\n\nAfter a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away\nfrom Eric.  He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.\n\nFrustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and\nthrows it in the back seat.\n\nANGLE ON TRAPPERS\n\nMitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine.\nLeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut.\nWhile pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp\npiece of granite.   He cusses and pushes harder.\n\n14   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING\n\nEric walks back to the Scout.  He feels the trappers' eyes\non his back, but forces himself not to hurry.\n\nThe trappers free their vehicle.  Corbett gets in the\ndriver's seat, and they take off.\n\n15   INT.  SCOUT\n\nAnne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic\ntranquilizer rifle back in the window.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n15   CONTINUED:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNE MARIE\n\t\t\t(unnerved)\n\t\t\tGreat idea -- pointing a lousy\n\t\t\tdart gun at some nut with a\n\t\t\thigh-powered hunting rifle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tBastards took off, though, didn't\n\t\t\tthey?\n\n16   EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY\n\nThe trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area.\nNow their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.\n\n17   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)\n\nCorbett broods while driving.  Mitchell looks out the\nwindow.  The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLEMALLE\n\t\t\tAll this fuckin' land, and we're\n\t\t\tlocked out.

SPORTSMEN'S CAMP\n\nA brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a\nbend in a small river.  Scattered about is an assortment of\nexpensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other\ngarbage.\n\nThree toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and\nBLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns.\nThey look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and\nstops.\n\n19   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP\n\nLeMalle grabs his carbine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORBETT\n\t\t\tLeave it here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n\n19   CONTINUED:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\t\tLet's keep going.

SPORTSMEN'S CAMP\n\nCorbett gets out of the jeep.  He regards the Sportsmen,\ntheir shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.\n\nThe Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett.  He\nwalks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksack\nstuffed with dead ermine.  After a long, tense moment,\nCorbett smiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORBETT\n\t\t\tLooks like you've had some luck.\n\t\t\tWhere's your guide?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSPORTSMAN #1\n\t\t\tWe're on our own, if it's any of\n\t\t\tyour damn business.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORBETT\n\t\t\t(re ermine)\n\t\t\tYou did real good.\n\nHe crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLEMALLE\n\t\t\t(to Corbett)\n\t\t\tNo swinging shit.

Nil.  When Corbett turns to him, he lies the\nweapon down.  Sportsman #2 rushes to his friend.\n\nLooking bleak, Mitchell spits again.  Corbett crosses to\nLeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to\nsteal.  Chastised, LeMalle smolders.

DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSK\n\nDevil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny\ndwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk.  The town\nsquats, ugly and temporary-looking, in a dirt clearing fifty\nmiles north of the Arctic Circle.  Thirty miles east of the\nPipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.\n\nAt the edge of town is a gravel airstrip.  Mixed with the\nprospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated\nhouses.  The boon brought by men building the pipeline is\nlong gone.  Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and\nbush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the\ndepression of the oncoming winter.\n\nEnough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually\nblanket the valley with fog.

Yeah, that one's easy;\n\t\t\tyou could glide right in...\n\nSuddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the\ndoor with his left foot.\n\nThe plane flies erratically.  With his right foot, Corbett\nkicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,\njamming it on.\n\n90   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)\n\nThe lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of\nemergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas is\ninstantly discharged.\n\n\n\n91   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)\n\nCorbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.\n\nEric rubs his neck, incredulous.  Corbett's move was too\nfast and too outrageous.  In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS\nto a stop.  Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and\nglide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORBETT\n\t\t\tHope you got your money's worth\n\t\t\ton those lessons.\n\n92   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)\n\nThere's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the\nplateau.  Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.  The plateau\ncomes up fast.\n\nThe plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the\nwind.\n\nIt CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits\nthe jagged granite under the snow.  It stops suddenly,\nflipping tail over nose.\n\n93   INT.  CESSNA\n\nIt rests upside down in the snow.  The men are dazed.\n\nBehind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside\ndown, leaks gas.  In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.\n\nEric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg\ngets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Army\nknife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the\nseat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking,\nEric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully\nwrenching his ankle.\n\n94   EXT.  CESSNA\n\nCorbett rolls out into the snow.  With no time to grab his\nsupplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage.  He and Corbett\ncrawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the\nplane.\n\nA moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine\nand the Cessna EXPLODES.\n\nWIDER\n\nEric tries to stand.  He cries out and falls into the\npowdery snow, clutching at his ankle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n94   CONTINUED:\n\nCorbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage.

Corbett\nfrowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his\narms cuffed tightly behind his back.\n\nEric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register\non his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest of\nhumanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett\nenjoys the view.  And waits.\n\n95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY\n\nThe Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and\ngnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow,\nEric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the\nArctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won,\nsnow-covered mile behind them.\n\nIntricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy\ntundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding\nmosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence\n\nis itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two\nthousand feet lower, the forest begins.

Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred\npounds, it's used to having its way.

She YELLS at the bear, wields\nthe flares like Excalibur and moves forward.\n\nThe bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation\nmeal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the\nthreat.

The bear\nswipes at her, its huge paw inches away.  Anne Marie jabs at\nthe paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more\nquarrelsome.\n\nShe twists around, looking for a defense.  Above her is the\ncabling from the generator to the circuit box for the\nTurtle's electrical system.  She tugs at it, but it won't\nbudge.  The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet\nsnout.

It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a\nwoodpile across from Wilder's cabin.\n\nThe trappers get out of the jeep.  LeMalle has Eric's\nRemington, Mitchell has his Peacemaker, and Viking Bob\ncarries LeMalle's old carbine.  Mitchell spits.

HOT SPRINGS SPA\n\nIt's tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes\nCREAKING.  LeMalle looks around.  The sound of a small DING\nagainst metal above him gets his attention.\n\nHe sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him.\nHe finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder\nand climbs up.  Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the\ncatwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for\nbalance.\n\nLeMalle is directly above the huge central pool.  He ducks\nto go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling\nto a dark corner below.  Suddenly, the twine snaps tight,\npulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling.  The door\nswings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk.  With a\nyelp, he splashes into the water below.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nHidden in the shadows, Eric drops the end of the twine and\nrushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\t(to Corbett)\n\t\t\tThat'll keep him out of the cold.\n\nLEMALLE\n\nclimbs out of the central pool, soaked.   He pulls his wet\njacket off and furiously throws it down.\n\n\n\n199  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA\n\nEric leads Corbett around the back of the spa.  A GUNSHOT\nrings out nearby and a BULLET hits the wall above Eric's\nhead.\n\nMITCHELL\n\nhas seen their faint silhouettes through the snow.  He\npurposely SHOOTS over their heads so he doesn't hit Corbett.\n\nANGLE BEHIND HOT SPRINGS SPA\n\nEric and Corbett crouch down and double back.   They are\nonce again swallowed up by the snowfall.\n\n200  EXT.  ALLEY\n\nViking Bob follows their footprints in between the\nbuildings.  He continues to a point where they converge to\none set, then stop.  He smiles at the naivete of Eric's\nploy.  Looking at the boardwalk railing above, he assumes\nEric and Corbett have swung over it onto the iced-over\nboardwalk.  Pleased with his deduction, Viking Bob continues\nalong the alley.\n\nSNAP!  Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his\nback in the snow.  Biting into his right calf is a huge\nconibear leg trap.  In extreme pain, he struggles to lever\nit open with the barrel of his rifle.\n\n201  EXT.

ALLEY\n\nHearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes\nto Viking Bob's aid.  Between them, they manage to yawn open\nthe jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg.  Viking Bob\ntries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is\nbroken.  Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on.  In\nagony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow.  He tears a strip\nof lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the\nbleeding.\n\n203  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA\n\nAnne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip.\nSuddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle\nlunges at her.

His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air.\n\nAnne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from\nhim.  She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out.\nScrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle.\nHe comes at her again.  Anne Marie moves away and pulls the\n.44 magnum out.  LeMalle stops and glares at her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNE MARIE\n\t\t\t(gasping)\n\t\t\tDon't make me shoot.\n\nShe gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him.\nLeMalle glowers menacingly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tANNE MARIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tWe're going to Sam's cabin.  You\n\t\t\tcan stay in the jail until this\n\t\t\tis over.\n\nLeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle.

Better drop me first shot,\n\t\t\tbitch, or I'll rip your fuckin'\n\t\t\tlungs out.\n\nTaunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down.  Anne Marie is\nparalyzed.  Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony\nfingers around the stock of the Remington.\n\nAnne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifle\nclose, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  Anne\nMarie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away,\nleaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie lets\nher arm fall.\n\n204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN\n\nEric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the\nworst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut\nacross open ground toward the airstrip depot.\n\n205  INT.

YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT\n\nThrough the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the\nplane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the back\nof the airstrip depot.\n\nAs they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric\ncatches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in\na pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n206  CONTINUED:\n\nERIC'S POV - REFLECTION\n\nPeacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming\nright for them.\n\nWIDER\n\nEric takes out the homemade flashbomb.  He lights it, tosses\nit toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with a\nmuffled pop and a bright flash of white light.\n\nMitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flash\nhas temporarily clouded his vision.\n\nEric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and\nwaits for Mitchell to move on.\n\n207  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT\n\nMitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his\nshoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse\nbleeding from his right shoulder.  Mitchell blinks, still\nhaving trouble seeing.  LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet\nand points in Eric and Corbett's direction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLEMALLE\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\t\tOver there...\n\nHe hoists his Remington.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\t\tHold it.

He swings the rifle up,\nleft-handed, and SHOOTS.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nThe bullet just misses Eric.  He panics and wildly returns\nFIRE with the .357.\n\n208  EXT.

Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the\ndepot.  There is no further movement.\n\nEric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward\nthe depot.\n\n209  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT\n\nReaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over\nsomething.  It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the\nwall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage.  Eric gasps.\nAnguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell.  Mitchell pulls\nhim closer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMITCHELL\n\t\t\tGlad to see you're okay.

How does it\n\t\t\ttaste?\n\nWiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.\n\nWIDER\n\nThen, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them.  Eric\nstuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the\npadlock off the back door of the depot.  He pushes Corbett\ninside.\n\n\n\n210  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT\n\nThe pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and\nremoves his Walkman headphones.

Go\n\t\t\tback and open the side door.\n\n\nShaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat\nbelt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,\nand obliges the little lady with the big gun.\n\n\n\n212  INT.  AIRSTRIP DEPOT\n\nThe depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's\nCauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with\na corrugated steel roof.  Boxes, wood palettes and hand\ndollies are piled haphazardly about.\n\nEric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,\ninching toward the front door -- the door leading to the\nplane.\n\nSuddenly, a string of overhead lights come on.  Eric goes\nfor the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and\nNeff have come in the front door.  Kenai stomps his feet and\nshivers.  Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps\nforward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMEYERLING\n\t\t\tNobody wants any more killings;\n\t\t\twe all agree to that, correct?\n\t\t\t(no one argues)\n\t\t\tThat's good.

Face it, Ben.\n\t\t\tThere's no room in Alaska for you\n\t\t\tany more.\n\nMeyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of\nEskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish-\nand bear-spears.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMEYERLING\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tYou're as antiquated as this\n\t\t\tshit.\n\nMeyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n212  CONTINUED:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\t\tKeep back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCORBETT\n\t\t\tYou're quite a piece of work,\n\t\t\tMeyerling.

Eric stands his\nground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nSuddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and\nfurs dragging at his feet.  His right side is bathed in\nblood.  Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down\ndead.  In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the\nmassive Remington.\n\nHe hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a\nround into the chamber with his injured right arm.  Bracing\nhimself, he levels the rifle at Eric.\n\nHearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.\n\nCorbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his\nhandcuffed hands, and hurls it.\n\nThere is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.\n\nLeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear\nstuck clear through his chest.\n\nSome packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by\nthe muzzle blast.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nThere is a moment of silence.  Corbett looks at the other\nweapons near him, and then at Meyerling.  Threatened,\nMeyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.  Before Eric can do\nanything, Meyerling FIRES.\n\nThe IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(CONTINUED)\n212  CONTINUED:  (2)\n\nWith a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his\ngrasp.
