Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. \n\tHands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces\n\tthe arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast\n\tpocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs\n\tto EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. \n\tThe hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to\n\thim.

Looking inside the\n\tpark where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. \n\tCutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to\n\tRykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster\n\tand sticks it in his pocket.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE ON METER\n</b>\n\tto $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTAXI DRIVER\n</b>\t\tI can't believe this guy got off. \n\t\tUnbelievable.\n\n\tJordy takes out money.  All he's got is fifty bucks and he\n\tcrams it into the slot.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJORDY\n</b>\t\tWhatever's leftover, keep.\n\n\tJordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is\n\tcoming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is\n\tsitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with\n\trage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up\n\tand walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand\n\tgrips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.\n\n<b>\tHIGH WIDE SHOT\n</b>\n\tMany policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. \n\tAll are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE:\n\n<b>\tHAWKINS\n</b>\n\tand his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and\n\tfrazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she\n\tlooks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a\n\tdisgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch -\n\tanxious - looks at his cameraman.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHAWKINS\n</b>\t\tHe said he'd be here.

Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from\n\tthe van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his\n\tcar, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the\n\tPOLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at\n\tCutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCUTLER\n</b>\t\t...my client was suffering from a major\n\t\tillness of schizophrenic nature wherein\n\t\tduring times of intense stress, as a\n\t\tresult of paranoid and psychotic\n\t\tdelusions - there was impairment of his\n\t\tability to appreciate wrongfullness...\n\t\tThis is a victory for the mentally ill!\n\n\tJordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on\n\tEmil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,\n\tthe celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? \n\tMax's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam\n\tin his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other\n\tcops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their\n\tplace in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler\n\tcontinues:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCUTLER (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t...before Emil boards the police boat\n\t\tand heads for Rykers Island where he\n\t\twill be checked into the psyche ward, I\n\t\twant to say one last word to you all...\n\t\tAs you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg\n\t\tRazgul into committing these murders,\n\t\tyet Oleg is still out in the street, a\n\t\tfree man, filming gruesome murders...

He is sprawled on the ground. \n\tHis videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.\n\n<b>\tOLEG'S VIDEO POV\n</b>\n\tas it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He\n\tlooks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLEG\n</b>\t\tA film...by Oleg Razgul.\n\n\tAnd Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins\n\tjumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLEG (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tHow was that?\n\n\tOleg's head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs\n\tover to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad\n\tEmil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n</b>\t\tWait a minute.  Where are you going? \n\t\tLearn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of\n\t\tpublic opinion.  Take the credit, you\n\t\tneed it.\n\n\tShe turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push\n\tthe hair out of his face but he stops her hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJORDY\n</b>\t\tNo thanks.\n\n\tJordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It's\n\tEDDIE'S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. \n\tShe looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens\n\tpointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. \n\tHe doesn't want to make a statement.  He still doesn't want\n\tthe fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because\n\the was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE\n</b>\t\tCut.\n\n\tHer cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. \n\tJordy turns and walks away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tGet a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to\n\t\tme.\n\n\tJordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS\n\tback to Nicolette.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tWell, he wouldn't talk to us, but you\n\t\tsaw it.\n\n\tThe CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is\n\tnow on:\n\n<b>\tTHE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE\n</b>\n\tWe PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.  Nicolette finishing her\n\tstand up:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICOLETTE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tNew York City has a new hero, Fire\n\t\tMarshal Jordan Warsaw.  I hope that Fire\n\t\tMarshal Warsaw's heroic actions this\n\t\tafternoon will help with his other legal\n\t\tproblems.  WB11 has also learned that\n\t\tthe fire Marshal has retained an\n\t\timmigration lawyer to help Daphne\n\t\tHandlova with her case.  We wish her\n\t\twell.  This is Nicolette Karas, live at\n\t\tBattery Park, WB11 New York.  Good\n\t\tnight.\n\n<b>\tTHE SCREEN\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t FADES TO BLACK.\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>15 Minutes</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=John Hertzfield\" title=\"Scripts by John Hertzfield\">John Hertzfield</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/15 Minutes Script.html#comments\" title=\"15 Minutes comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:57:06.841017"}
