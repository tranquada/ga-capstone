As the sedan suddenly\naccelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the\nsedan's front tire and fires.\n\nThe tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams\ninto a parked car, pitching the driver violently against\nthe unyielding interior of the sedan.\n\nAn instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed\ndrivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.\n\nWith the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has\nto deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.\n\nBourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on\nedge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is\ncut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,\narrives and opens fire.\n\nThe police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as\nBourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single\nshot.\n\nThe increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a\nnew threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs\nthe officer's radio.\n\n                   BOURNE\n          10-13.

He gets to his feet\n      swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded\n      figure. The man slumps over.\n\n      Bourne stares at what he's done.\n\n                          HIRSCH (CONT'D)\n                You're no longer David Webb.\n                From now on you'll be known as\n                Jason Bourne.

It's\n      locked.\n\n                                                            102\n\n\n322   INT.

Then he turns and shoots out the\n      room's mirrored observation window. Bourne dives through\n      it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.\n\n\n      SERIES OF SHOTS\n\n      Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.\n\n\n352   EXT.

It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12\n      stories down.\n\n      He races to another ledge -- the East River below him. But\n      he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of\n      the building to hit the water.   He backs up to get a\n      running leap.\n\n      As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on\n      him.\n\n                             PAZ\n                   Why didn't you take the shot?\n\n      Bourne looks at him.\n\n                             BOURNE\n                   Do you even know why you're\n                   trying to kill me?
