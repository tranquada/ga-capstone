Frank is a\r\n      man of average size, average build... she peers over her\r\n      glasses at him. And her expression slowly changes.

Ackerman calls out after her.\r\n      \r\n<b>                                  ACKERMAN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                Cara...\r\n      \r\n      She pauses.

I don't work for you\r\n                anymore.\r\n      \r\n      She walks past him.    For a moment Ackerman and Frank look\r\n      at one another.\r\n      \r\n<b>                                  ACKERMAN\r\n</b>                Mr.   Taylor...   you're free to go.\r\n      \r\n      He looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect.\r\n      \r\n<b>                              ACKERMAN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                It seems I underestimated you.\r\n      \r\n<b>                              FRANK\r\n</b>                     (American accent)\r\n                It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman.\r\n<b>                                                              99.\r\n</b>      \r\n      \r\n      With that, Frank steps out of the room.    Ackerman's\r\n      attention is distracted by--\r\n      \r\n<b>                                GOYAL\r\n</b>                 Sir... over here.

Ackerman comes over and looks.\r\n      \r\n      INSERT CLOSE UP - the only thing in the safe is a single\r\n<b>      FLASH DRIVE.\r\n</b>      \r\n      Goyal signals to one of the TECHS. He opens a laptop on\r\n      the desk and they plug in the FLASH DRIVE to check the\r\n      contents.\r\n      \r\n      While they are doing this, Ackerman bends to inspect the\r\n<b>      BIO-METRIC LOCK.\r\n</b>      \r\n<b>                                ACKERMAN\r\n</b>                 He was here.\r\n      \r\n      Jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen.\r\n      \r\n<b>                               GOYAL\r\n</b>                 Account numbers... access codes...\r\n                 unless I'm mistaken... he left the\r\n                 money behind.\r\n      \r\n<b>                               JEAN LUC\r\n</b>                 A mistake perhaps?\r\n      \r\n<b>                               JONES\r\n</b>                 How much is there?\r\n      \r\n      Goyal scans down to a total...\r\n      \r\n<b>                               GOYAL\r\n</b>                 Looks like 744 million.\r\n      \r\n<b>                               JONES\r\n</b>                 That's no mistake...\r\n                      (walks over)\r\n                 That's his tax bill.\r\n      \r\n      She holds out her hand to the TECH who has just removed\r\n      the FLASH DRIVE.\r\n      \r\n<b>                               JONES (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                 I'll take that.\r\n      \r\n      She slips it into her pocket, then turns to Ackerman.\r\n<b>                                                          100.\r\n</b>      \r\n      \r\n      Ackerman has moved away.

And\r\n                where did he go?\r\n      \r\n      Ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his\r\n      back. For the briefest of moments, Frank looks back up\r\n      at him and their eyes connect.\r\n      \r\n      Frank gives him a little smile.   Cara takes his arm to\r\n      climb onto the boat.\r\n      \r\n      CLOSE ON ACKERMAN:   his eyes narrow.   He knows.\r\n      \r\n      For a moment he doesn't move. Then, in spite of himself,\r\n      a small smile creeps over his face too.\r\n      \r\n<b>                              ACKERMAN\r\n</b>                Because Pearce was cleverer than\r\n                all of us.\r\n      \r\n<b>                                                          CUT TO:\r\n</b>      \r\n      \r\n<b>      EXT.
