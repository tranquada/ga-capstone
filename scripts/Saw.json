As it passes, we see just under \n               the water part of a young man\u0092s face. His eyes are closed. The \n               light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S \n               A W. The title fades away.\n \n               The tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the \n               end of a tub of water, just near someone\u0092s bare foot. The camera \n               cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. This is ADAM. \n               Suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his \n               mouth and gasping for air. As he wakes up and struggles within \n               the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging \n               it. The water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the \n               tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached \n               to it. The room itself is pitch black, but we can still just \n               barely make him out in the dark. Adam lifts himself out of the \n               tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. \n               He manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes \n               that his ankle is chained to something. He feels his way over \n               to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain \n               that is attached to it. He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, \n               and a bit hysterical.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Help! Someone help me! (He stops when \n                         he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere \n                         in the room. He looks out into the darkness \n                         and calls out.) Is someone there? Hey! \n                         (He turns back to the corner to which \n                         he is chained, says in a slightly softer \n                         but still panicked voice) Shit, I\u0092m \n                         probably dead.\n \n               Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a man\u0092s low, raspy \n               voice. It startles Adam. The voice, we will soon learn, belongs \n               to LAWRENCE.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         You\u0092re not dead.\n\n               Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his \n               arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever \n               is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Who\u0092s that?

Hang on a second, I think I found \n                         something.\n \n               With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very \n               bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, \n               starting from Lawrence\u0092s end and moving towards Adam. As they \n               come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch \n               black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms \n               to cover his face. In the light we now see that he is in his \n               mid-twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped \n               shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned \n               rat from the tub. It takes him a moment but his eyes finally \n               start to adjust, and he looks around the room. He and we see \n               Lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing \n               by the light switch and the door. He is on the opposite end of \n               the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. He \n               wears a blue button-down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. \n               He is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair \n               and even paler skin. Dark circles are under his eyes. Both men \n               are barefoot.\n \n               Lawrence\u0092s eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. \n               Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does \n               Adam\u0092s, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror \n               on his face. We see lying face down the body of a man who has \n               blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only \n               boxer shorts and a tee shirt. In his left hand is a gun, in his \n               right hand is a micro cassette recorder. A gunshot and a scream \n               are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360\u00b0 angle above \n               and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him.\n \n               \n               The shot cuts to Adam, who reels in shock and disgust.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         Holy shit!\n\n               He turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. \n               Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying \n               the body with a look of fear and concern. Adam stops coughing \n               and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around \n               the room. He looks down at his chain then starts to completely \n               freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (screaming) HELP!!! (He falls back onto \n                         his bottom on the floor as he yanks \n                         at the chain as hard as he can.) HELP!!! \n                         Help!\n \n               Lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, \n               appalled look at his behaviour. It seems that Lawrence, despite \n               being in the situation he\u0092s in, is above that kind of uncontrolled \n               reaction. He speaks a bit coldly.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         No one can hear you.\n\n               Adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to Lawrence, \n               his breathing fast and heavy. His voice is not yelling anymore \n               but still just as hysterical.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         What the fuck is this?\n\n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         Calm down, just calm down. (He knows \n                         that to remain calm is to remain in \n                         control, something he must be no matter \n                         what the situation.) Are you hurt?\n \n                         \n               Adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         I don\u0092t know...yeah!\n\n               Lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against \n               it for support.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (calmly) What\u0092s your name?\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         (sarcastic) My name is Very Fucking \n                         Confused!

In the meantime, we see Adam thinking. He pauses, then reaches \n               down and starts going through his pockets. There is nothing in \n               the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic \n               baggie with a white envelope in it. He unfolds the baggie; the \n               envelope says ADAM. He stares at it in his hands, wondering what \n               it is.\n \n               Lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances \n               over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing. He sees Adam holding \n               the baggie. Adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro \n               cassette tape. A close up shows the words Play Me written on \n               the tape label. Adam holds it in his hand, studying it. Lawrence \n               turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what \n               Adam has in his hand.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         What is that?

First, he holds up a similar tape to Adam\u0092s. \n               It also says Play Me. Then he holds up a single bullet, studying \n               it, not sure what it\u0092s there for yet. Then, he holds up a tiny \n               key. He bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try \n               to unlock his chains with the key. It doesn\u0092t seem to be working.\n \n               \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (frustrated, mumbling to himself and \n                         to the key) Come on, come on, come on....\n \n                         \n                                     ADAM\n                         (seeing that it doesn\u0092t seem to be working \n                         on Lawrence\u0092s lock) Throw it over here.\n \n                         \n               Lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds \n               up the key and throws it.

Adam \n               very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the \n               floor towards him.

As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves \n               closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer \n               to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side \n               of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking \n               anyone, including Tapp, in the eye.

The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting \n               as Paul\u0092s cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron \n               contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering \n               her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, \n               as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up.\n \n                                     AMANDA\n                         (VO) I woke up.

And metal.\n \n               She continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera \n               circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device \n               on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long \n               wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen.\n \n               The view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an \n               old television set, which suddenly switches on, startling her. \n               After a brief moment of static, the frightening image of a demented \n               clown-like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks, \n               its red eyes leering at Amanda from the screen. She stares at \n               it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion. \n               The doll speaks, the jaw moving; it is the voice of Jigsaw.\n \n               \n                                     JIGSAW\n                         (from the TV) Hello Amanda.

Here\u0092s what happens if you lose. \n                         (The video moves next to the doll, to \n                         a device like the one she\u0092s wearing \n                         attached to a mannequin head. As he \n                         continues, explaining what it is, her \n                         breathing grows faster and heavier, \n                         and her moans pick up more.)

When the timer at the \n                         back goes off, your mouth will be permanently \n                         ripped open. Think of it like a reverse \n                         bear trap. Here, I\u0092ll show you.\n \n               The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The \n               doll\u0092s head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera \n               zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! \n               The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. \n               Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to \n               a close up of the doll.\n \n                                     JIGSAW\n                         (from the TV) There is only one key \n                         to open the device. It\u0092s in the stomach \n                         of your dead cellmate. Look around, \n                         Amanda. Know that I\u0092m not lying. You \n                         better hurry up. Live or die. Make your \n                         choice.\n \n               The video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda \n               begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the \n               chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements \n               fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the \n               other and stands up quickly. That\u0092s when the cord in the back \n               of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, \n               her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins \n               its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling \n               at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck \n               there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she \n               can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her.\n \n               \n               The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in \n               the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, \n               who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda.\n \n               \n                                     AMANDA\n                         And then I saw the body.\n\n               We switch back into Amanda\u0092s cell. Over her shoulder, we see \n               near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. \n               Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, \n               her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next \n               to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his \n               shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. \n               She sobs harder, hunched over him.\n \n               Quick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of \n               the shot.\n \n                                     AMANDA\n                         There was a knife.\n\n               Back to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small \n               knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her \n               shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick \n               shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. \n               The camera moves to a shot of the man\u0092s face, when...\n \n               HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to \n               speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He \n               cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged \n               him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; \n               he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what she\u0092s about to \n               do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly \n               stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs \n               down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands.\n \n               \n               A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, \n               eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as \n               she stabs down a few more times. Then back again to the table \n               in Lawrence\u0092s interrogation room. Sing throws down an evidence \n               baggie with a used syringe in it.\n \n                                     SING\n                         (VO as camera pans up to Lawrence) He\u0092d \n                         been injected with an opiate overdose. \n                         He couldn\u0092t move or feel much of anything.\n \n                         \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         You mean....he was alive?\n\n                                     SING\n                         (staring, nods slightly) Was.\n\n               Back to Amanda\u0092s Interrogation room, her head still hung, still \n               sniffling. A view of Tapp as he asks\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         What happened after you took it off?\n \n                         \n               Cut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines \n               for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back \n               again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to \n               interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then \n               back to the cell.\n \n               Amanda\u0092 s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ she\u0092s \n               holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying \n               to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. \n               She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the \n               back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it \n               snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching \n               scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking \n               back and forth.\n \n               Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing \n               the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring \n               at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares \n               at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only \n               stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering \n               at her, then speaks.\n \n                                     JIGSAW\n                         Congratulations.

Not anymore.\n \n               Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, \n               her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight \n               spasms. She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. Cut to Tapp.\n \n               \n                                     TAPP\n                         You are, in fact, a drug addict.

(She lets out a sob, briefly \n                         nodding once.) Are you grateful, Mandy?\n \n                         \n               She finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first \n               time.\n \n                                     AMANDA\n                         (softly) He...helped me.\n\n               As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks \n               over his shoulder into Lawrence\u0092s room, right in his direction. \n               He may not see him, but he knows he\u0092s there. The camera then \n               cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, \n               the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into \n               an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are.\n \n               \n               Adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has \n               been listening to Lawrence\u0092s story. He looks up across to Lawrence.\n \n               \n                                     ADAM\n                         (softly) Are you sure it\u0092s him?\n\n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (nods slightly) Yeah, I\u0092m sure.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         (becoming a little hysterical again. \n                         He speaks accusingly) How do I know \n                         you\u0092re telling the truth?

He \n                         looks over to the mirror on the wall, \n                         studying it, thinking.)\n \n               Lawrence notices that Adam\u0092s ranting has ended, glances over \n               at him.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         What?\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         (looks over at Lawrence, then back at \n                         the mirror.) It\u0092s a two-way mirror.\n \n                         \n               Adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches \n               over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a \n               loose padlock. He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can \n               against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly \n               startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam \n               reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that \n               at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass \n               breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind \n               a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. \n               We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it \n               as well.\n \n               Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking \n               at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and \n               Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The \n               shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver \n               surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type \n               equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A man\u0092s \n               voice speaks, though it doesn\u0092t sound quite the same as on the \n               Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove \n               raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen.\n \n                                     MAN\n                         (OS, Taunting) I can see you...\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         (from on video) So that\u0092s what this \n                         is.

Adam stands in a threatening pose to the \n               camera, speaks angrily, loudly to it, his voice dripping with \n               sarcasm.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Can you hear me in there?

It seems that he is \n               almost becoming as sick of Lawrence\u0092s attitude as Lawrence is \n               of his.

(Adam \n                         backs off a bit. Lawrence pauses a moment, \n                         his voice changes to calm but sad.) \n                         I\u0092ve been the last thing I said to my \n                         daughter.\n \n               Lawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind \n               him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot \n               of a little girl\u0092s bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl \n               is Diana. She\u0092s about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light \n               brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite \n               teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over \n               her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling \n               very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above \n               her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits \n               up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She \n               remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner \n               to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her \n               face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly \n               heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a \n               strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of \n               the Gordon Household.\n \n               The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of \n               the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture \n               in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of \n               a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as \n               it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room \n               towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy \n               bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted \n               glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into \n               the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, \n               fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long \n               blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite \n               her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into \n               the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching \n               her mother sleeping. Alison\u0092s eyes slowly open; the feeling of \n               being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. \n               She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter \n               with concern.\n \n                                     ALISON\n                         Diana, Honey, are you okay?

Looking \n                         up at her, she places her hands on her \n                         daughter\u0092s arms.)

Lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp \n               on Diana\u0092s side table. Diana lies in bed, slightly propped up \n               against her pillows and stuffed animals.

He saunters over \n               to the gagged and bound Diana and Alison, on the floor and tied \n               to a corner end of the bed. Alison, her eyes streaming tears, \n               struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but \n               fails.

Our view is from inside the car \n               as it pulls up alongside the building. A police radio can be \n               heard in the background. So can the sound of a gun being loaded \n               and cocked.\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         (VO) At least we\u0092ll have the cover of \n                         darkness.\n \n                                     SING\n                         (VO) Yeah, well, so will anybody else.\n \n                         \n               A shot of inside the factory, various clutter and tables piled \n               up on one another. No signs of life...yet. A bang from the outside \n               of the door is heard. A couple more bangs and a shot of the giant, \n               sliding wooden door as it slides open, and Sing steps in, holding \n               out his shotgun, ready for anything waiting for them. Cut up \n               to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from Paul\u0091s \n               razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, \n               Tapp in front, Sing covering behind them. They come up another \n               level, one that has been recently used we see as Tapp points \n               over to a desk with a computer, a radio, and some other miscellaneous \n               items. Then, right next to the desk, we see the K2K graffiti \n               from the video.\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         I got you...\n\n               They continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link \n               fence. There is a slightly raised platform, going along part \n               of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. Tapp \n               goes up the steps. On the raised area are some tables covered \n               in heavy red cloth. Tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls \n               back the covering. He reveals a small diorama of the bathroom \n               scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls, complete with the body, \n               dolls representing each of them.\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         What the hell is this?.......(his voice \n                         almost a whisper) Oh shit...\n \n               They move onto the next table, and Tapp pulls back the cloth \n               covering that one, revealing the leering Puppet from Amanda\u0092s \n               video. Tapp stares at it wide-eyed. Next to the puppet is a strange, \n               boar-like mask with long dark hair. The camera pans back so we \n               have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that \n               Tapp and Sing had passed by. Tapp leans in closer to look at \n               the puppet, when suddenly the still-covered form starts to move \n               and muffled moaning sounds are heard. It startles the detectives.\n \n               \n                                     SING\n                         Oh fuck!\n\n               They both go over and stand on either side of it, taking one \n               end of the red cloth whipping it off. Underneath is a man tied \n               to a chair with duct tape over his mouth, held in place by a \n               manacle around his neck. A contraption on the chair holds two \n               power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed \n               directly at his temples. His eyes wide, he moans through his \n               tape at the detectives.\n \n               Suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of \n               the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns \n               ready.\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         (looks to Sing, says softly) Wait Sing!\n \n                         \n                                     SING\n                         (trying to keep his voice low but coming \n                         off a bit loudly) What?\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         (eager) Let\u0092s see what he\u0092s gonna do.\n \n                         \n                                     SING\n                         Why?

The man in the chair \n               protests loudly through his gag and struggles as much as he can \n               in his chair. Sing and Tapp go and hide behind a tarp covering \n               the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe lined \n               in red comes up on the elevator. The elevator stops, and the \n               figure moves forward, slowly and carefully. He goes up the steps \n               to the man in the chair. The figure\u0092s hood is up; we do not see \n               his face. As he walks, he seems like he might be having a somewhat \n               difficult time with it.\n \n               He reaches and uncovers the man, who begs in muffled tones through \n               the gag.

Sing \n               spins around and then starts chasing Jigsaw through the warehouse, \n               out of the room and down a flight of stairs. He moves down a \n               long, misty corridor, gun up, moving quickly but still cautiously. \n               He takes a right, goes down another flight of stairs then takes \n               another right, stopping and looking down a short flight of stairs. \n               Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat. \n               He drags himself along the floor.\n \n               Back to Sing, who cocks his shotgun, then moves down the stairs \n               very cautiously. He takes a left around the corner, finds himself \n               facing down another corridor, where he sees Jigsaw trying to \n               get away. He takes aim.\n \n                                     SING\n                         (shouting) Freeze or I\u0092ll shoot!\n\n               Jigsaw continues moving, so Sing fires. He hits, and Jigsaw goes \n               down. Sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. Jigsaw \n               doesn\u0092t move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly \n               move forward towards him. Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles \n               to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing.\n \n               Back to Sing, moving further down the hall. He gets about halfway \n               down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip-wire. Over \n               it are some cobwebs hanging down. He reaches to part them, and \n               steps forward into the wire. As he steps we see a shot of a shotgun \n               with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger. Sing looks up, \n               and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down \n               directly at him fire. Sing is hit, blood splattering against \n               him and the wall. We see only from his shoulders down. He spasms \n               for a moment, then falls forward to his knees. Cut to Tapp, who \n               is making strange vowel sounds, moving down the flight of stairs \n               just before the hallway where Sing now is.\n \n               On his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. \n               We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor. Jigsaw starts moving \n               and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further \n               down the hall. Sing\u0092s body finally falls forward onto the floor, \n               spasming still. Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against \n               the wall a couple of times. We see Jigsaw as he gets to the end \n               of the hall and starts sliding a large door open.\n \n               At that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns \n               into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on \n               the stairs. Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go \n               left. Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees \n               Sing, who has stopped spasming. His eyes widening, Tapp removes \n               the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards Sing, his \n               mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping \n               coming out. The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and \n               then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sing\u0092s body, including \n               a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now \n               missing.\n \n               At the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, \n               sitting on his couch. The shot shows a good view of the scar \n               across his neck.\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         (weak, desperate) Had you...had you \n                         on your knees.

Lawrence leans over and picks up \n               his hacksaw, going over to the tiles where the X is and starts \n               hitting the tiles with the handle of the hacksaw. He breaks through, \n               reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling out a small \n               brown box with a hinged lid. He can\u0092t believe it. He looks to \n               Adam, a small grin on his face.

He gets \n               out of the car, shutting the door and going over to a phone on \n               the wall to dial security to let him out. When he dials, though, \n               it gives him a busy signal. As it beeps, we cut to another shot \n               of his car in the mirror. The back door on the passenger side \n               starts to slowly open. Back to Lawrence, who hangs up the phone, \n               aggravated, and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone. He \n               opens it and dials. Back in the mirror, we see something get \n               out of the car on its hands and knees. It is in a red robe and \n               has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair. Lawrence \n               finishes dialing, holds the phone to his ear but receives the \n               same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom, indicating that \n               he cannot make outgoing calls. Perplexed, he holds up the phone, \n               trying to get a better signal. Alongside the car, the thing moves \n               even closer now. It gets up slowly. We see that it is wearing \n               the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of Jigsaw\u0092s \n               workshop. It suddenly rushes upon him as he\u0092s distracted with \n               his phone and grabs him.\n \n               Cut back to Lawrence sitting on the floor in the bathroom, still \n               holding the phone.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (His eyes distant, off in his memory) \n                         That...thing.

He\u0092s getting an idea. \n               He takes a cigarette, glances over at Adam, who still has his \n               head down in his hands. He dips the end of the cigarette in the \n               blood, then puts it back in the box. He starts to get up. Adam \n               looks up, sees him standing.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         What are you doing?\n\n               Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips \n               off the lights. We see a shot of Zep startling when the lights \n               go out on the monitor, then we go back to the darkened bathroom.\n \n               \n                                     ADAM\n                         Hey!

I want you to play along with me \n                         on this.\n \n               Zep leans in, trying to hear what\u0092s being said, but the static \n               of the video is too loud. He tries to adjust the sound, but to \n               no avail. Shot goes back into the bathroom, where Lawrence is \n               finishing saying something to Adam.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         You got that?

Lawrence glances at the \n                         surveillance camera, then looks to Adam.\n \n                         \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (trying to be nonchalant) So you uh, \n                         still want that cigarette?\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Um...yeah, sure.\n\n               Lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where the poisoned \n               cigarette is, but takes the other un-dipped one instead. He throws \n               it to Adam, who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands. \n               Lawrence throws the lighter as well. Adam puts the cigarette \n               between his lips and reaches down, picking up the lighter. He \n               glances over at Lawrence, who watches him intently. Adam just \n               shrugs then lights up. He takes a long drag, then exhales in \n               a sigh of relief and with a smile. He takes another drag then \n               suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound \n               coming from his throat. His head jerks more then the rest of \n               his body, his eyes widening. His hand drops the cigarette and \n               goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, \n               almost squeaky choking sound in his throat. The sound grows louder \n               as he falls to his knees, then back a bit, his left arm held \n               out in front of him dramatically. He falls backwards onto the \n               floor, twitching some more, still choking. He lets out a long \n               cough, suddenly stops jerking, and closes his eyes. The death \n               in its entirety is very, very fake.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (watches Adam, then turns to the surveillance \n                         camera, speaks with angry finality) \n                         There!

Where \n                         are they?!\n \n               Suddenly, we go to a shot of Adam lying there and a loud, electrical \n               buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he cries \n               out. He spasms and jerks around as he is electrocuted, and Lawrence \n               looks upon him in shock. Finally, the electrocution stops, and \n               Adam sits up slightly, gasping, eyes wide.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (he shrieks in pain and shock) Jesus \n                         Christ!!\n \n               Lawrence\u0092s reaction is not one of concern; he simply can\u0092t believe \n               that Adam just screwed up the plan.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (disbelief) What?\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         (wide eyed) I just got electrocuted!\n \n                         \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         What?

That was \n                         our way out!\n \n               Adam looks at him in shock, cannot believe Lawrence would think \n               he\u0092d make something like that up.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (yelling at him) Did you hear what I \n                         said?

(He leans over \n                         and picks up his saw, sits down and \n                         starts trying to saw through his chains \n                         again, grunting. Adam, in the meantime, \n                         just sits back against the wall, breathing \n                         heavily, looking dazed. Lawrence continues \n                         to franticly saw, but it doesn\u0092t work. \n                         He gets pissed off and throws the blade \n                         down.) Ah, Damn it!!\n \n               Back to Adam, still looking dazed. Suddenly, a look of realization \n               dawns upon his face. The electrocution has jogged his memory.\n \n               \n                                     ADAM\n                         (wide-eyed) I remember everything now. \n                         (Lawrence glances over at him.) I remember \n                         how I got here.\n \n               Flashback to Adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, \n               a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to \n               music on his headphones. He walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. \n               He gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red-lit hallway \n               to his apartment. He goes inside, closing the door behind him \n               then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the \n               table and opening the fridge. The entire apartment is very rundown, \n               decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as Adam described \n               it earlier. There is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper \n               is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty.\n \n               Adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. He sighs, \n               then closes the door. He heads over to his darkroom, closing \n               the door behind him. The lighting is dark red. He puts the camera \n               down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, \n               takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts \n               them down off to the side. He sighs tiredly and goes over to \n               a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, \n               ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. \n               It is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. The man is in fact \n               Lawrence. To the left of that one is a shot of Lawrence in the \n               parking garage with his hand over his eyes.\n \n               The camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole \n               in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing \n               the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to \n               black, industrial music playing over the shot.\n \n               Cut to Adam sleeping in the now pitch-black darkroom, his head \n               down on the table. He wakes up abruptly, as though he hadn\u0092t \n               meant to fall asleep. He looks around, confused, wondering why \n               all the lights out. He gives a Great, another problem type of \n               sigh. He stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. \n               He moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. Another \n               aggravated sigh. He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the \n               counter, presses the on button but it doesn\u0092t work. Pissed, he \n               shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesn\u0092t \n               work. He looks at it, scoffs.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Great.\n\n               Suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere \n               in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks \n               up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out \n               in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black \n               apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but \n               trying to be brave.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Is someone there? (he takes a picture, \n                         the flash lighting up the area in front \n                         of him.) I can hear you. (He takes another \n                         picture, the flash lighting up a living \n                         room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward \n                         more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping \n                         away for light.)\n \n               Suddenly, from behind him, an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard. He startles, \n               spinning around.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (his voice alarmed but confused at the \n                         same time) What the...? (He snaps a \n                         picture in its direction and sees the \n                         Puppet from Jigsaw\u0092s workshop and video \n                         sitting in an armchair, continuing its \n                         evil laugh.) Christ! (He reaches down \n                         and finds a baseball bat on the floor, \n                         and starts hitting the doll as hard \n                         as he can until the laugh starts to \n                         fade and then just dies out. ) What \n                         the...\n \n               He hears the sound of movement again, coming from just behind \n               him in a closet. He goes on alert again, holding up the baseball \n               bat and the camera.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Who is that?! Who\u0092s in there?!

As soon as the flash goes \n                         off we see the red-robed pig thing that \n                         originally grabbed Lawrence quickly \n                         move forward and grab Adam.)\n \n               Suddenly, the cell phone rings. Lawrence looks down at it in \n               slight surprise. Adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as \n               well. Lawrence glances over at Adam and then carefully reaches \n               down, picks it up and answers it. The scene will cut back and \n               forth to Diana and Alison in the room and Lawrence on the phone \n               for the duration of the conversation.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (not sure what to expect) Who is this?\n \n                         \n                                     DIANA\n                         (on the phone, sobbing) Daddy?\n\n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         Diana?

I\u0092m not gonna let anybody hurt \n                         you. You got that? (Diana nods) Okay, \n                         that\u0092s my good girl. (She starts crying \n                         as her hands work behind her to loosen \n                         the rope around them.)\n \n               Cut back to Adam in the bathroom, looking up slightly from his \n               position. He glances back down at the photographs on the floor, \n               notices something odd about one of them. He furrows his brow \n               and gets down on his hands and knees, reaching over and picking \n               it up, leaning back and looking at it, studying it. Camera cuts \n               to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white surveillance \n               camera, sitting on the floor. Adam\u0092s next line is a voice over \n               over this shot.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Hey, was there someone else at your \n                         house last night besides your wife and \n                         daughter?\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (on camera) No.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         (still on camera) Well, there\u0092s someone \n                         here. (He tosses the photo to Lawrence, \n                         whosits up, picks it up and looks at \n                         it. After a moment, the shot cuts back \n                         to a regular view of them, in the room.)\n \n                         \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (realization) I know him. (We see the \n                         photo as well. It is a shot looking \n                         up into Lawrence\u0092s window, with Zep \n                         standing there, looking out, completely \n                         unaware of his picture being taken.) \n                         Zep! (Cut to a shot of Zep listening. \n                         The shot goes back and forth between \n                         him as his eyes widen while Lawrence \n                         makes his threats.) His name is Zep. \n                         He\u0092s an orderly at my hospital. (his \n                         voice becomes a growl, furious) Zep. \n                         You perverted little psychopath. I\u0092m \n                         gonna take great pleasure in seeing \n                         you pay for this! You bastard fuck!\n \n                         \n               Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with \n               a very worried look. He points up to it.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from \n                         his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads \n                         at 6:00.) We\u0092re out of time.\n \n                                     DIANA\n                         (crying) Mommy help me!\n\n               Alison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his \n               chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving \n               near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly \n               replaces Diana\u0092s gag and then her own, and resumes her position \n               with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep \n               steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows \n               slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to \n               just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and \n               leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes \n               his head sadly. He speaks calmly.\n \n                                     ZEP\n                         Dr. Gordon\u0092s time is up. Now I\u0092ve gotta \n                         do what I\u0092ve gotta do, and...I\u0092m afraid \n                         it has to be you that tells him he failed. \n                         (He undoes her gag, holds the phone \n                         to her head and his gun in front of \n                         her chest.)\n \n               Quick cut to the bathroom, where Lawrence is still looking at \n               the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window. The phone \n               rings, startling them both. Lawrence quickly answers it.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (speaking quickly, the growling voice) \n                         Is that you Zep, you bastard!? (Adam \n                         gets up from his corner, moves forward \n                         slightly) I know its you, you son of \n                         a bitch!\n \n                                     ALISON\n                         Larry?\n\n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (his eyes widen, his fierce tone replaced \n                         with worry) Ally?\n \n               Cut into the bedroom.\n\n                                     ALISON\n                         (looking right at Zep, firmly) You failed.\n \n                         \n               Quickly, she grabs Zep\u0092s gun and pushes him hard over to her \n               left. He is taken by surprise and goes down easily.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (who can only hear the sound of a struggle) \n                         Hello? Hello?\n \n               Alison rips the gun right from his hand, quickly backs up an \n               stands. She keeps the gun aimed right at Zep. He sits up slightly, \n               trying to slowly get up, but she keeps the gun fiercely aimed \n               at him, keeping him there. His eyes are wide, likely his one \n               thought right now is Fuck.\n \n                                     ALISON\n                         Don\u0092t move, stay on the ground. Give \n                         me the phone. Give it to me! (He sits \n                         up a bit, carefully slides it to her. \n                         He is watching her, looking for an opportunity \n                         to overcome her once again. She picks \n                         the phone up, still keeping her eyes \n                         and her gun at him.) Larry?\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         Ally! Honey, are you all right?\n\n                                     ALISON\n                         No! No we\u0092re not...(Zep starts to move \n                         up a bit more, his right hand out, leaning \n                         against the edge of the bed. Ally threatens \n                         him more fiercely with the gun.) Get \n                         down!

He leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand, and \n               they start struggling with it. Diana starts screaming. Lawrence, \n               on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle. In \n               wrestling for the gun a shot is let off, and Diana continues \n               to scream.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (panicked) Ally!\n\n               Cut to a shot of static on Tapp\u0092s TV set, then Tapp waking up \n               to the sound of gunfire. He quickly looks over to the window.\n \n               \n               Back to Zep and Alison, who are still fighting for the gun. Zep \n               manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position, \n               but she still holds on tight. Another shot goes off. Cut to a \n               shot of Tapp, who hears it, then looks at the TV. He sees the \n               flash from the window on the television. He picks up his handgun \n               and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. Back in the apartment, \n               we see Diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. Zep \n               gets behind Diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and \n               the gun upwards. Another shot is fired off.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (screams) Ally! (Adam watches him with \n                         wide eyes.)\n \n               The shot cuts back into the bedroom.\n\n                                     DIANA\n                         Mommy, help me!\n\n               The struggle moves over and into the dresser. Zep gets the gun \n               in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly \n               pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. \n               She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. \n               He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching \n               his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes \n               over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the \n               residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with \n               his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly. He sees Zep on \n               the floor squirming around and aims at him, screaming.\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         Freeze!\n\n               Zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesn\u0092t \n               hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zep\u0092s head. Zep clutches \n               the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, \n               hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing \n               forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can \n               only imagine what he\u0092s hearing.\n \n               Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column \n               and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana \n               and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses. \n               Tapp fires back, but his gun jams. Zep sees Alison and Diana \n               run from the room, and his attention goes to them once more.\n \n               \n                                     TAPP\n                         (trying to fix his gun) What the fuck?\n \n                         \n               Zep gets up off the floor more, but just then Tapp gives up on \n               his gun and charges at Zep, screaming. He tackles Zep, knocking \n               him flat on his back. Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him \n               from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still \n               on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand.\n \n               \n               Back to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase \n               on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapp\u0092s head. The blow \n               stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his \n               gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. \n               He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen.\n \n               \n                                     ZEP\n                         Mrs. Gordon? (drops old cartridge out \n                         of his gun, pops in a new one) Diana?! \n                         (His breathing is fast, desperate. He \n                         clutches the wound on his leg.) I\u0092m \n                         gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. \n                         (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles \n                         over to the computer station, taking \n                         keys from the desk and then hobbling \n                         down the hall and out the door. We see \n                         Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep \n                         glances over and sees Tapp get to his \n                         feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway \n                         and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, \n                         just a we bit dazed from the hit. He \n                         empties his gun cartridge and replaces \n                         it, then runs towards the door, screaming.\n \n                         \n               Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. He\u0092s just \n               a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there \n               is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung \n               onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adam\u0092s eyes widen and he \n               starts to panic.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Lawrence!

Lawrence \n                         is out.) Lawrence, get up!\n \n                                     CUT TO\n                         Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with \n                         Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They \n                         race through the streets as fast as \n                         they can.\n \n               Cut back to the bathroom. Adam looks around him, not sure what \n               to do, panicking. Lawrence can\u0092t be dead, he can\u0092t be alone in \n               here. He can\u0092t handle this alone. He needs his calm, collected \n               Doctor, no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (crying out, close to tears) Lawrence! \n                         Get up! I need you! (He leans down and \n                         finds a piece of debris on the floor, \n                         throws it at Lawrence. It doesn\u0092t hit \n                         him. He leans down, picks up another, \n                         throws it. This one bounces onto the \n                         floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence, \n                         who begins to stir. A moment, and Lawrence \n                         starts to move more, reaching for his \n                         head and sitting up. Adam cries out \n                         in relief.) Oh, thank God! I thought \n                         you were dead!\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (sits up, dazed and confused) He...he \n                         electrocuted me...\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         I told you! The same thing happened \n                         to me, see? I wasn\u0092t lying, see?\n \n               Lawrence leans over and grabs his chain, the source of the electrocution. \n               Suddenly, he snaps.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (screaming) FUCK THIS SHIT!!\n\n               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle \n               with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly \n               moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the \n               floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it.\n \n               \n               In the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front \n               of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing \n               down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears \n               him and follows the sound down the hall.\n \n               In the bathroom, the phone keeps ringing. Lawrence grabs the \n               hinged box, turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone \n               with it. He cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again. He \n               tosses the box away, crying/screaming as he tries to reach the \n               box with his arms. Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing \n               what to do.\n \n               Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning \n               from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off \n               further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving \n               in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, \n               he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. \n               Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp \n               ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He \n               leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains \n               standing. If he got hit, it isn\u0092t clear where. Zep then turns \n               and quickly hobbles further down the hall.\n \n               Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone \n               as it keeps ringing.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries \n                         loudly.)\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (Frightened but trying to stay calm \n                         for Lawrence.) Lawrence, calm down. \n                         There must be a way out of this! (It \n                         seems to be a complete role reversal \n                         for the two of them from the beginning, \n                         where Adam was the one freaking out \n                         and Lawrence was calm. Here, Adam is \n                         terrified but still calmer than Lawrence, \n                         who has just lost it.)\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (screaming) I can\u0092t be calm!

He quickly \n                         turns and sits up, grabbing the chain \n                         and pulling it as he lets out a terrible \n                         scream of rage. Adam\u0092s hands are up \n                         clutching his head, trying to keep his \n                         cool but having a very hard time.)\n \n                         \n                                     ADAM\n                         (Loudly trying to speak over Lawrence\u0092s \n                         continued loud, primal screams.)

Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up.\n \n                                     TAPP\n                         I\u0092m gonna kill you you sick asshole!\n \n                         \n               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally \n               breaks down, clutching the chain and screaming more.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (desperate, losing his attempted calm \n                         stance) Lawrence, stop it!\n \n               Lawrence sits up, stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming. \n               He starts to unbutton his blue button-down shirt. That is too \n               slow, however, so he starts to rip it open.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (sobs in his voice) Lawrence, please \n                         calm down! There\u0092s a way out of here, \n                         there\u0092s a way out!\n \n               Lawrence gets his shirt off, down to a plain white tee shirt \n               underneath. He starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot \n               and ties it off. Adam realizes what he is preparing to do, completely \n               loses it and freaks out, screaming.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you \n                         doing?!\n \n               Lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting \n               it for a brace. The look in his eyes is one of complete madness \n               and desperation. He takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts \n               it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while Adam \n               begins to scream in complete horror. Lawrence screams through \n               the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrence\u0092s \n               shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming \n               and wincing.\n \n               Back to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves \n               into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching \n               up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep \n               to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs \n               him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. \n               Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him \n               forward against a cage wall.\n \n               Back to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck \n               and shirt.\n \n               Back to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of \n               twisted glee is upon Tapp\u0092s face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to \n               the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl \n               up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing \n               it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing \n               position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, \n               trying to take the gun.\n \n               Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming \n               and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits \n               up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward \n               a bit.\n \n               Back to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. Zep \n               squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between \n               Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp. He pulls the trigger \n               and the shot hits Tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former \n               detective.\n \n               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. \n               He finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks \n               at it. Adam watches him in terror.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         (screaming/crying) What are you doing?! \n                         (Lawrence crawls on farther, towards \n                         the body.)\n \n               Cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in Tapp\u0092s chest. Tapp \n               remains standing a moment, in shock, gasping, then falls down \n               backwards onto the floor. Zep is still on his knees, holding \n               the gun up at a diagonal. Tapp\u0092s eyes flutter, then finally close. \n               Zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down \n               another hall.\n \n               Back in the bathroom, Lawrence reaches the body. He takes the \n               gun, opens the chamber.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         What are you...(He suddenly realizes \n                         Lawrence\u0092s intentions.

The \n               sound of a lock being undone and a bang is heard.

He then looks to Lawrence and aims \n               his gun at him, shaking his head.\n \n                                     ZEP\n                         You\u0092re too late.\n\n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (weakly) Why?\n\n                                     ZEP\n                         It\u0092s the rules.\n\n               Zep is about to pull the trigger when suddenly Adam comes to \n               and grabs his ankle, pulling him down. The back of Zep\u0092s head \n               hits the floor hard. Adam pulls him towards him, struggles to \n               get the gun from Zep\u0092s hand, screaming. The gun goes off once \n               off to the side. Adam moves Zep\u0092s arm back and forth, and it \n               goes off again. Finally, Adam slams Zep\u0092s arm down and gets the \n               gun away from him, tossing it away. He slugs Zep hard across \n               the face, stunning him. Lawrence starts crawling towards them. \n               Screaming like a madman, Adam sits up and grabs the toilet seat \n               lid from the toilet, and slams it down onto Zep\u0092s head as hard \n               as he can. He repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in \n               half. Lawrence reaches the two and reaches up for Adam\u0092s arm \n               as Adam brings the broken lid down again. Lawrence grabs his \n               arm and Adam drops the lid, falling forward a bit and clutching \n               his shoulder wound with his free hand, crying hard. Lawrence \n               moves in, touching his head to Adam\u0092s.\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (his voice very weak and shaky) You\u0092re \n                         going to be all right. (Adam stops sobbing \n                         for a moment) You\u0092re just wounded in \n                         the shoulder. I have to go and get help.\n \n                         \n                                     ADAM\n                         (grasping Lawrence\u0092s shirt, begging.) \n                         Don\u0092t leave me! No!\n \n               Lawrence nods, pulling away from him and starts to crawl off. \n               Adam reaches for him as he turns himself around and away.\n \n                                     ADAM\n                         No!! (he keeps crying) No! No! (Lawrence \n                         crawls towards the door.) Lawrence! \n                         Lawrence!\n \n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         (he pauses, turns to look back at Adam) \n                         Don\u0092t...Don\u0092t worry, I\u0092ll bring someone \n                         back, I promise. (He continues crawling \n                         on, out the door while Adam watches \n                         him pathetically, still crying and reaching \n                         out for him.)\n \n               Lawrence makes it out the door, and starts dragging himself down \n               the hall. Adam is now alone in the room with two corpses. Adam \n               looks to the door one more time then turns to Zep\u0092s body. He \n               pulls himself on top of him, wincing at his shoulder pain.\n \n               \n                                     ADAM\n                         (thinking) Key...key...\n\n               He starts going through Zep\u0092s pockets, patting him down. He finds \n               Zep\u0092s wallet, opens it and feels through it; there\u0092 s nothing \n               of value to him right now. He tosses it down. He continues feeling \n               for something, suddenly feels something in Zerp\u0092s coat pocket. \n               His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his \n               shoulder. He pulls out a tape recorder. He stares at it, his \n               eyes and mouth starting to widen. He glances down at Zep, then \n               at the tape recorder. Sitting up a bit more, he presses play. \n               It is Jigsaw\u0092s voice.\n \n                                     JIGSAW\n                         (VO) Hello Mr. Hindle.

(As he says each name, \n                         the following image of them appears: \n                         A shot of Mark screaming with the safe, \n                         Paul in his cage while still alive, \n                         Amanda in her mask in the chair, Zep \n                         watching on the monitor, Adam holding \n                         the tape recorder to his ear, Lawrence \n                         holding the tape recorder to his ear. \n                         Then, a shot of the Puppet on the video \n                         as he says) I want to play a game.\n \n                         \n               Back to the shot of Adam staring at him, shocked. Suddenly, Adam \n               looks down, grabs Zep\u0092s gun and aims for John. But before he \n               can pull the trigger John holds out the remote for the electricity \n               and starts to electrocute Adam, who starts jerking around and \n               drops the gun. As he spasms, a very, very fast montage of images \n               from the entire film from beginning to the end, starting with \n               a shot of Adam being electrocuted after his fake death, then \n               Lawrence, then going back to the beginning, all the way up and \n               ending with Adam stretched out on top of Zep, spasming still \n               from the electrocution. Suddenly the electricity stops and he \n               gasps, raspy loud breathing. John turns away, starts towards \n               the door. Adam can only watch after him.\n \n                                     JOHN\n                         (VO) Most people are so ungrateful to \n                         be alive.

John moves out \n                         the door, slowly.) But not you. (Adam \n                         reaches out for him and screams. John \n                         turns around and takes the door handle, \n                         starting to slide it shut.) Not anymore.\n \n                         \n               Adam SCREAMS as loud as he can in terror and despair as John \n               pauses for a moment with the door halfway shut, and says\n \n                                     JOHN\n                         GAME OVER.\n\n               John slams the door shut the rest of the way, and we are left \n               in darkness with the sound of Adam screaming No! Don\u0092t!!! over \n               and over and crying. The screams fade out, and is replaced by \n               the ending titles and instrumental music.\n \n               THE END\n\n               \n               \n\n\n\n\nSaw\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0James Wan\u00a0\u00a0Leigh Whannell\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:36.996844"}
