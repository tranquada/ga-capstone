INT.  \"THE DRAGON\" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                            1.\n\n       A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa-\n       poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which\n       rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)\n\n       The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange,\n       haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it\n       weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.\n\n2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2.\n\n       From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty\n       face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-\n       up American baseball cap.\n\n       Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns\n       and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.\n\n3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3.\n\n       Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the\n       stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around\n       the pagoda.\n\n       Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and\n       its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star\n       of the stage show:\n\n       WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or-\n       chestra wails the accompaniment.\n\n       But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys\n       the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash\n       and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of\n       somber-looking Chinese men in suits.\n\n       Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to\n       go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short\n       Round leave.\n\n4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4.\n\n       As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a\n       tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but\n       we don't see his face.\n\n       Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door-\n       man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the\n       way.\n\n       A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check\n       girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.\n       We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear-\n       ing work boots caked with mud.\n\n5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5.\n\n       The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily\n       on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber\n       Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.\n\n       As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a\n       cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as\n       the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --\n\n       And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham-\n       mer toward an enormous brass gong --\n\n       The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette-\n       girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face\n       for the first time:\n\n       It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The\n       TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:\n\n                                SHANGHAI - 1935\n\n       At the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi-\n       ana.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Dr. Jones.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Lao She.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Nee chin lie how ma?\n\n       Lao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his joke.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Wah hung how, nee nah?  Wah hwey\n                       hung jing chee jah loo nee kao\n                       soo wah shu shu.\n\n       LAO SHE looks angry and his men's smiles fade.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       You never told me you spoke my\n                       language, Dr. Jones.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       I don't like to show off.\n\n       Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's notorious\n       crime-lord.  Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some\n       fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage\n       heap.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       For this special occasion, I\n                       ordered champagne and caviar.\n\n       Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him\n       -- and stubs his cigarette out in it.  The cigarette sizzles and\n       Lao's smiles dies with it.\n\n       There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song.  At the\n       table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you\n                       found Nurhachi?\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Sure, I found him.  Then last\n                       night I had a little trouble.\n                       Somebody tried to slit my throat.\n\n       Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles\n       a bulldog and snarls like one now.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       It was dark, but I think one of\n                       your sons tried to get Nurhachi\n                       without paying for him.\n\n       Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand.  Chen\n       mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and\n       Chen sits down again.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       You have insulted my son.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Next time I'll cut off more than\n                       his finger.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.\n\n       Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the\n       table.  Indiana glances at it.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       As I recall the deal was consid-\n                       erably more.\n\n       Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up to\n       see Willie Scott.  Lao kisses her hand.  Willie is unaware of the\n       explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at Indi-\n       ana.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                                   (to Lao)\n                       Aren't you going to introduce\n                       us?\n\n                                   LAO\n                       This is Willie Scott.\n                             (watching Indy)\n                       And this is Indiana Jones, the\n                       famous archaeologist.\n\n       Willie sits down between Lao and Indy.  She takes out a small\n       mirror to check her make-up.\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me\n                       and is about to deliver him --\n                       now.\n\n       Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second\n       son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol.  Indiana\n       looks worried.  Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-up\n       and coyly teases Indiana.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Well -- I thought archaeologists\n                       were always funny little men\n                       searching for their mummies --\n                                  (yelping)\n                       Aaahhh!\n\n       She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her\n       ribs.\n\n                                   WILLE (Cont'd)\n                       I was only kidding, can't you\n                       take a joke -- ?\n                                  (to Lao)\n                       Lao, he's got a knife!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Put the gun away, sonny.\n\n       Kao Kan glances at his father.  Lao finally nods to his son and\n       he slips the pistol back into his pocket.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Now I suggest you pay me what you\n                       promised -- or your girlfriend\n                       here is going to be squealing a\n                       new tune.\n\n       The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry\n       drama quietly unfolding at this table.\n\n       Willie eyes the blade and whimpers.  She looks imploringly at Lao\n       and he slowly reaches into his pocket.  He puts ten gold coins\n       next to the cash on the table.\n\n       Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that\n       he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham-\n       pagne glass!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Try again Lao -- the deal was\n                       more.\n\n       The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again.  Lao reaches into\n       another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he\n       opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Bingo...you see, Lao, with a\n                       but of persuasion, even you can\n                       be an honest fellow.\n\n       Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table.\n       Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who\n       watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips --\n\n       Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he\n       doesn't drink his champagne.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Look at this!  He put a hole\n                       in my dress from Paris!\n\n       Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at Wil-\n       lie --\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Sit down!\n\n       Willie quickly obeys.  Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his\n       glass to seal the deal --\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       To your health, Dr. Jones.\n\n       Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his\n       glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he\n       reaches for the cash --\n\n       But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash,\n       gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white\n       powder spills out of it --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       What's that?\n\n                                   LAO\n                       A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is\n                       poison.  You just drank the\n                       rest of it.\n\n       Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the\n       bottom of it.  He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear\n       or the poison already taking effect.\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       There is an antidote for this\n                       poison.  You give me Nurhachi --\n                       I give you the antidote.\n\n       Indiana is sweating.  Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand\n       shaking.\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.\n                       Where is Nurhachi?\n\n       Indiana finally reaches into his pocket.  Next to the cash, gold,\n       jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box.  Lao\n       and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel\n       box.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                                (nervously)\n                       This Nurhachi's a very small guy.\n\n       Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Inside are the remains of Nur-\n                       hachi -- the first Emperor of the\n                       Manchu Dynasty.\n\n       Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey\n       powder inside.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Now what about the antidote,\n                       Lao.\n\n                                   LAO\n                             (holding the box)\n                       At last I have the ashes of my\n                       sacred ancestor!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       So, what's the big deal?  Let\n                       me see it --\n\n       Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out\n       of the gold box.  Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor,\n       Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --\n\n                                   LAO\n                       You fool!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-\n                       able little hood!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Let go of her, Lao.  And give me\n                       the antidote.\n\n       Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and\n       the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist\n       and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the\n       money and jewels.\n\n       Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with\n       the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over\n       his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's\n       spine.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                              (smiling at Wu Han)\n                       I like the service here.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                                  (puzzled)\n                       Hey, he's not a waiter...\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       No, Wu Han's an old friend I\n                       brought along.\n                                   (to Lao)\n                       So, the game's not over. Put\n                       the antidote on the table, Lao.\n\n       Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial\n       of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box.\n       Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote --\n       then he hears a muffled report!  And another!\n\n       Wu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi-\n       ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to\n       kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in\n       his seat.\n\n       Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into\n       the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted\n       any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks\n       emotionally to his dying friend.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm\n                       going to get you out of here.\n\n       In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --\n\n                                   WU HAN\n                       Not this time, my friend...\n                             (smiling bravely)\n                       I followed you on many adventures --\n                       but into the great Unknown Mystery,\n                       I go first, Indy...\n\n       Wu Han dies and slumps forward.  Indiana is shattered by the\n       death of his old friend.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you\n                       will soon join him.\n\n       Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face.\n       Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's\n       anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis-\n       ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --\n\n       Indy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over\n       from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai-\n       ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted\n       pigeons that he's just set afire --\n\n       Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the\n       table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs\n       into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor-\n       rified face!\n\n       This the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and\n       all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches\n       for the vial on the table --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       The antidote -- !\n\n       But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk,\n       reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto\n       the table!\n\n       As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the\n       Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face!\n\n       Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the\n       table -- and falling!\n\n       Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the\n       floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's\n       henchmen and the vial rolls away.\n\n       Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench-\n       man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.\n       \n       Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table.\n       Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels,\n       but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps\n       to attack Indy.\n\n       Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial.\n       People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into\n       him, trips and lands on her back.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Look out, damn it, I need that\n                       antidote!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Who cares?  Where's that diamond!\n\n       Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions.\n       Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be-\n       hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at\n       by Lao and his henchmen.\n\n       Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across\n       the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head\n       groddily and splashes water on his face.\n\n       Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the\n       panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly\n       dresses soman is bending to pick it up --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                              (acidly polite)\n                       Excuse me, but I believe that's\n                       my diamond!\n\n       Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie\n       reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles\n       her.\n\n       Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives\n       on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un-\n       suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him\n       flying head first into a row of ice buckets.\n\n       Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the\n       elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the\n       floor -- which camouflages the diamond!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Aw nuts!\n\n       Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of\n       antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs\n       it.\n\n                                   INDIANA (O.S.)\n                       Hey,doll!  Don't move!\n\n       She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart.  Lao and his\n       gunmen rush out to block the way.  Indy rolls off the cart and\n       slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                           (shouting to Willie)\n                       Hey, don't go away!

Indy makes a break for it.\n\n       As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto\n       a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad-\n       sword from the Chinese warrior statue!\n\n       As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then\n       he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass\n       gong.\n\n       The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the\n       sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a\n       helpful shove --\n\n       The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble\n       steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls\n       across the dance floor.\n\n       Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex-\n       ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy\n       runs behind it.\n\n       Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and\n       turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing\n       down on her!\n\n       Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the\n       gong with him --\n\n       Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to\n       get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the\n       club now and start firing machine guns!\n\n       As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind\n       it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor-\n       to-ceiling window!\n\n       Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong\n       crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!\n\n6.

The\n       three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades\n       of white water.\n\n       Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy\n       looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.  Finally,\n       after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow.\n\n36.    EXT.

Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie\n       motionless in the bottom.\n\n       Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail\n       in the almost still water.  Battered and exhausted, but always\n       Indy's \"bodyguard\", Shorty looks over at him worriedly --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy?\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Okay, Shorty.\n\n       Indy looks over at Willie who is moaning.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       You all right?\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       No...

Silhoutted against the blazing sun, the skin-\n       ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft.\n\n       An eerie wind rises and howls.  The old man places his palms to-\n       gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead.  Willie and\n       Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old shaman's\n       silent greeting.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n37.    EXT.

A desolate road runs\n       through the village, along which groups of ptiifully poor vil-\n       lagers stare at the strangers being brought in.\n\n       Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only sand.\n       Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts,\n       eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees.\n\n       Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round,\n       some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding tears\n       down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy passes.\n\n       There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round grows\n       frightened by the odd attention.

A grey-haired man, the village\n       CHIEFTAIN, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and\n       set wooden plates in front of the three visitors.

We hear heavy breathing\n       -- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full moon\n       as an eerie wind rises and howls.

She\n       SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of her!\n\n       Indy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him.  He runs\n       back toward the river.  Stopping on the riverbank, he sees Willie\n       backing away in the water -- Indiana's already starting to pull\n       his boots off --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy!

He leaves his boots on.\n\n                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)\n                       Hurry, help me out of here!\n                       What're you waiting for?!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a\n                       better idea.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What?!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       First of all -- don't panic!\n\n       Willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her\n       arm --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's got me !  Indy, help me!\n\n       Indy runs along the riverbank, trying to get closer to her, but\n       not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to snakes\n       -- see Episode One:  \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\").\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Don't let it pull you deeper!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's pulling me deeper!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Don't let it curl around you!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's curling around me!  Damn it,\n                       stop talking and do something!\n\n       The snake is wrapping around her body and neck -- her head is\n       barely above water --\n\n       On the riverbank, Indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood.\n       But as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to sweat and\n       his fear and loathing overpower him --\n\n                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)\n                       What's wrong?!

He sees the snake starting to drift away\n       from Willie and she starts paddling back to shore, collecting her\n       floating clothes along the way.\n\n       Holding her dripping dress against herself, she walks out of the\n       water toward Indy who smiles at her weakly.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       See -- I got you out...\n\n       She slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth.

It was one\n                       of those bats!\n                                   (staring into\n                                    the darkness)\n                       God, what else is out there...?!\n\n       She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to\n       Indy.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Couldn't keep away, huh?\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Just try and control yourself.\n\n       Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket.\n       then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get\n       some well-deserved shut-eye.\n\n       In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like\n       slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize\n       it's an elephant's trunk.  The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                              (without looking)\n                       Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you\n                       can get closer if you want...\n\n       The elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Honey, I knew you'd be the first\n                       one to give in...\n\n       Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk\n       with a prod.  Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's\n       trunk sniffs Indiana's ear --\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       You're going to start something\n                       I'm going to have to finish.\n                                  (moaning)\n                       Okay, doll, you asked for it.\n\n       Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers!  He nearly jumps\n       out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk.  Willie\n       and Short Round dissolve into laughter.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n54.    EXT.  THE JUNGLE - DAY                                         54.\n\n       Tall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind.  Beneath them, the el-\n       ephants plough through the dense tropical forest.  The sounds of\n       the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the distant\n       hills.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy, look!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       That's it.

He barks commands and the elephants stop.  Indiana\n       jumps down an joins the fearful guide.\n\n       They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight\n       arms.  Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace displays\n       small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their\n       hair.\n\n       Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs\n       away.  Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it:\n       leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles.  Indiana grimaces as he\n       lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...\n\n                                   WILLIE (O.S.)\n                       Why are we stopping here?\n\n       Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is\n       helping Willie down from the elephant.  Short Round jumps down.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       What you look at, Indy?\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Just a statue.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What's the guide talking about?\n                       He hasn't said a word the whole\n                       trip.\n\n       Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in\n       Hindi back to him.  They watch the distressed guide trun the ele-\n       phants and start away with them as fast as possible.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       He's afraid of something.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       He said he couldn't take us any\n                       farther.

Short Round watches the elephants\n       trudging away.  The little elephant turns and looks back.  Short\n       Round quickly wipes a tear from his face.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n56.    EXT.  A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON                            56.\n\n       Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high\n       wall.  Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges along\n       behind them.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       -- shot at, fallen out of a plane,\n                       nearly drowned, squashed by a snake,\n                       attacked by a bat -- I smell like\n                       an elephant!\n                                 (yelling)\n                       I tell you I'm not going to make it!\n\n       Indiana finally stops.  He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks\n       her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way.\n       Willie is surprised and puzzled.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Any more complaints?\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                              (smiling faintly)\n                       Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this\n                       sooner...\n\n       She doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy.  He arrives at\n       the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands close\n       to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       It doesn't feel like there's been\n                       any permanent damage.\n\n       She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles as\n       she sees Pankot Palace:  a sprawling, monumental mixture of Mo-\n       ghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza of Princely\n       architecture.\n\n57.

Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand with\n       lances.\n\n       As the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily to\n       attention and Willie jumps.  As Willie continues across the\n       bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she\n       grins, enjoying the attention.\n\n58.    INT.  THE OUTER COURTYARD                                      58.\n\n       Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway into\n       a glittering courtyard.  The palace seems deserted and forebod-\n       ing.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)\n\n       Indy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous Raj-\n       put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at\n       opposite sides of the courtyard.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                               (frightened)\n                       Hi...(hi)...(hi)...\n\n       Then, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material-\n       izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly.  CHATTAR LAL\n       appraises the intruders suspiciously:\n\n       He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown;  a dirty Chinese\n       kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American carrying a\n       bullwhip...\n\n                                   CHATTAR LAL\n                       I would say you look rather lost.\n                                  (disdainfullt)\n                       But then I cannot imagine where\n                       in the world the three of you\n                       would look at home...\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                                (smiling evenly)\n                       Lost?

Fountains spray in\n       ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour.\n\n       As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical\n       portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall.

Meanwhile, the little Maha-\n       rajah whispers to his Prime Minsiter.

Indy sees a servant lighting a candle.\n\n       Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot.  The\n       candle disappears!  Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again,\n       snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair.\n\n       The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       That is wonderful!

As the young prince practises the\n       grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to\n       a dark figure in robes who appears.\n\n       Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy\n       catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow\n       eyes.  Then the robled apparition seems to disappear.\n\n       Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls\n       the whip for his first attempt.  He flings the whip but it flies\n       back and snaps  -- biting his own  cheek.\n\n       There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs  at the\n       little prince who is holding his wounded cheek.  The incensed Ma-\n       rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.\n\n       Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is\n       tugged taut between the two hostile boys.  As they draw near each\n       other, Short Round sees something weird:\n\n       The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses\n       softly in a strange voice.  Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre\n       transformation...\n\n       Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Okay, Short Round, let go of it.\n\n       Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the\n       little prince.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       The Turks say that a whip can be\n                       an enemy even to its owner.

Short Round still\n       doesn't wake up.\n\n       Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath.\n       He sees the assassin pulling a knife.  Indiana dives as the knife\n       flies through the air and slams into the wall.\n\n       Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet.  As the ass-\n       assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and\n       wraps around the killer's neck.\n\n       The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it\n       from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer\n       gasping for air now as his face turns red.\n\n       Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault\n       which rips the whip out of Indy's hand.  The assassin has an in-\n       stant to grin victoriously --\n\n       Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling\n       where is gets caught on the revolving fan!  The surprised assass-\n       in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling\n       fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--\n\n       And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and\n       dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor.\n       The assassin screams as he is hanged!  His legs twitch in\n       his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up.\n\n       Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instictively leaps off the\n       couch and draws a small dagger --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Don't worry, Indy!

A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by\n       rows of carved stone columns.\n\n       Balconies overlook the temple floor.  Pillared halls leading to\n       dark side chambers.

In her\n       hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a\n       giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who\n       are chanting louder and louder!\n\n       Kali's face is loathsome:  her earrings are two corpses.

The\n       silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the\n       some on the altar.\n\n       This is MOLA RAM, the High Priest of the Thugge cult.  Mola\n       Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his\n       sinister face.  Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic\n       as the unholy goddess rising behind him.\n\n       Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest and\n       realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar Lal\n       in the palace garden.\n\n       As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm\n       up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!\n\n       All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin\n       dragged out by priests.  The man's face and body are wildly\n       painted.  He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame\n       laying atop a large flat stone.\n\n       Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the Indian\n       looks up into the High Priest's grotesque face --\n\n       Suddenly Mola Ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest -- and\n       pierces it!  The High Priests hand sinks into the victim's\n       writing body and rips out his living heart!\n\n100.   INT.

Willie sees that Short\n       Round is in trouble.  She runs over, leaps onto the back of the\n       other guard and starts ripping his hair out.\n\n       Short Round picks up his fallen dagger.  The big guard lurches\n       backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel.\n       Willie falls to the floor.\n\n       Short Round approaches, holding the man at bay with his dagger.\n       Willie turns as the other guard, the one she kneed, crawls toward\n       her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws it.

Suddenly the floor gives\n       way and Indy slips!\n\n       The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with it\n       and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who\n       scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes...\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n124.

He lifts\n       his hands and discovers that they are chained.  In the murky\n       light, he sees Short Round sitting in chains across the cell.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy -- you knocked out when you\n                       fall.  You okay?\n\n       Indiana nods groggily.  He sees a young slave worker in rags sit-\n       ting near Short Round.  Through the iron bars of the cell, Indy\n       sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                              (indicating the kid)\n                       This is Nainsukh -- from the vil-\n                       lage.

Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell,\n       like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n125.

They\n       are stopped at a door and shoved inside.\n\n126.   INT.  MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER                                       126.\n\n       Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber.  It is a terri-\n       fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly\n       icons of the evil Thuggee sect.\n\n       Grotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls.  In a\n       corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with\n       flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of\n       live snakes.\n\n       Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are\n       the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana.  Mola Ram sits\n       in a yoga position near the statue of Kali.\n\n       Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round\n       standing in chains before him.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       You were caught trying to steal\n                       the Sankara Stones.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                                 (shrugging)\n                       Nobody's perfect.

They also search for\n                       the last two stones.  Soon we will\n                       have all five Sankara Stones and\n                       the Thuggees will be all powerful!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Nobody can say you don't have a\n                       vivid imagination.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       You do not believe me?  You will,\n                       Dr. Jones.  You will become a true\n                       believer.\n\n       The door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little Maharajah\n       enters.  Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       Your Highness will witness the\n                       thief's conversion.\n\n       Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy.  They drag him struggling\n       to a rock and chain him to it.  Short Round scuffles as he's\n       pulled aside to watch.\n\n       Remembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi-\n       ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       You will not suffer.  I recently\n                       became of age and tasted the blood\n                       of Kali.\n\n       Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled --\n       it's Nainsukh.  He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing\n       strangely.  Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of\n       blood!\n\n       The guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open.\n       Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death-\n       grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth.  Indy gags --\n\n       Suddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little\n       Maharajah.  Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara-\n       jah is furious.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       Hold him!\n\n       The little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy --\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       You will learn to obey because\n                       you are powerless!\n\n       The little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy\n       sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)\n                       I control you now!\n\n       The Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn.  In-\n       diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned!  The\n       little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his\n       robes.\n\n       Then he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been laid.\n       He grabs the bullwhip.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)\n                       You told me that a whip could be\n                       an enemy to its owner.  We shall\n                       see!  Turn him over!\n\n       As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and\n       chain his ahnds to the rock.  The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he\n       notices Short Round smiling snidely --\n\n       Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts\n       into Short Round's shoulder.  Blood appears and Short Round looks\n       stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to\n       use the whip.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)\n                       As Dr. Jones suggested, I have\n                       been practicing.\n\n       The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again.  Indiana\n       jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his\n       flesh.  The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts\n       across Indy's tattered shirt.\n\n       As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be-\n       ing beaten.  His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer.\n\n       Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.  As the\n       Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but\n       the guards restrain him.\n\n       Indiana groans as he's turned over.  Blood trickles from his\n       mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       The British in India will be\n                       slaughtered.  Then we will over-\n                       run the Moslems and force their\n                       \"Allah\" to bow to Kali.\n\n       Mola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he\n       lifts it toward Indy's face --\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       And then the Hebrew God will fall\n                       and finally the Christian God will\n                       be cast down and forgotten.\n\n       Indy's head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it\n       flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indy's mouth.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!\n\n       Indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down\n       his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the\n       floor --\n\n       We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a fissure\n       appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava\n       oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n127.

Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away --\n\n       Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room.\n       Insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off.

She flies down the moonlit corridors, past\n       the huge wall paintings.\n\n       She stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately, but there is\n       no one around.  She backs away down a hallway and then jumps --\n       seeing something in a mirror:  a face looms behind her and she\n       screams!\n\n       Willie whirls and sees Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister, approach-\n       ing her.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Oh my God, you scared me!

Dressed in a Rajput maiden's outfit, Willie has been jewel-\n       ed and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast as she struggles\n       desperately.\n\n                                   CHATTAR LAL\n                       Your friend has seen and she has\n                       heard -- now she will not talk.\n\n       As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy!

He looks around furtively\n       and sees a guard approaching.\n       \n       Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the\n       tunnel.  He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed\n       out by two chained children.\n\n       The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes his\n       escape using the moving mine car as cover.\n\n139.

He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two\n       guards walking away.\n\n       When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a\n       long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks\n       up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending\n       from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall.\n\n       The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps\n       seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet.\n       Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder.\n       Shorty continues until he is high above the floor.\n\n       Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops\n       climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts\n       and kicks the ladder away from the wall!\n\n       The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide\n       slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings\n       to the other side of the falling ladder --\n\n       Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against\n       the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the\n       roof-hole that leads up to the temple!\n\n       Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the\n       chamber behind the altar.  He looks at the light flaring around\n       the statue of Kali --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy -- !\n\n141.   INT.

Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified\n       as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava!\n\n       The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the\n       crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder.\n\n142.

He\n       peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse!

He eludes the\n       first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head,\n       and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch --\n\n       Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward\n       Indiana.  Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and\n       when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and\n       backhands the little guy brutally across the face!\n\n       The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at\n       wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood\n       from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief.\n\n       Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty.\n       Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse --\n\n       Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to\n       scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her\n       lungs!\n\n       Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with\n       a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing,\n       snarling, his eyes lgowing --\n\n       Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs\n       him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch\n       and just manages to yank it free!\n\n       Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy\n       strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch\n       into Indy's side.  The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it\n       sears his flesh, and he yells in pain.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Wake up!  It's just a nightmare,\n                       Indy!  Wake up, please Indy!\n\n       Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow\n       in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out.  Now it\n       seems like theold Indiana staring at him --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)\n                       Indy, you back?\n\n       Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       No!

Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified.\n       Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks!\n\n       Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face!  Short\n       Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)\n                       We got to help Willie!\n\n       Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick\n       punch in the stomach.  Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and\n       pulley platform.  Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who\n       spills onto the floor.\n\n       A second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial\n       frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel --\n\n       Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly\n       plummets toward the fulminating lava!\n\n       On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the\n       man's own momentum to throw him over his head.  Indy then dives\n       for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --\n\n       Down in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above\n       the spumes of fiery lava.  The heat is so intense now that Wil-\n       lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out...\n       On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa-\n       crificial frame.\n\n144.

Short Round dives and tackles the\n       priest.\n\n       Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy\n       sees him pull a dagger.  He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to\n       let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains\n       screech!\n\n       Below in the crevasse, the iron frame plunges again toward the\n       crimson lava!\n\n       On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan-\n       icked.  Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping Indy\n       away from the cogwheel mechanism --\n\n       Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him\n       in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism.  He grabs\n       a iron rod and throws it into the gears --\n\n       the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop.  Indi-\n       ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously.\n\n       Meanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and\n       grabs a long wrench.  He starts swinging the wrench, keeping the\n       last priests off the platfrom.\n\n       The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana\n       grabs it and swings it over onto the platform.  He looks at Wil-\n       lie anxiously as he releases her bindings --\n\n       Willie moans and moves her head.  Indy pulls her off the frame\n       and she starts coughing.  Gasping for breath, Willie ervives as\n       fresh air flows into her lungs.\n\n       Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana.  Then she\n       notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Look out -- !\n\n       Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and Indiana\n       whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his hand\n       and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice --\n\n       Chattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, at-\n       tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform!\n\n       Crashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto the\n       sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --\n\n       Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time.  He grabs hold\n       of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls!\n\n       Looking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame with\n       Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke!\n       The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten lava.\n\n       Chattar Lal's body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is\n       broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily --\n       and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava.\n\n      scramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they\n       follow him across the altar.\n\n       Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara Stones.\n       Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --\n\n       He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over\n       backwards against the statue of Kali.  Short Round helps stuff\n       the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag.\n\n146.   INT.

THE ALTAR                                                154.\n\n       The childrens' bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- below\n       them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of\n       flame.\n\n       Indy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke\n       from the intese heat rising up.\n\n       On the far side of the plank, the children safely across scatter\n       through the deserted temple toward freedom.\n\n       Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank --\n       Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood --\n       the kid in front pulls the child to safety.\n\n       Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy\n       shouts at them --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       No, wait!\n\n       He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank\n       and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts\n       into flame in the middle.\n\n       Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks!  Indy\n       dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round\n       grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the\n       fiery chasm.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What're we going to do?!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       There's got to be another way out.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n155.   INT.  A TUNNEL                                                 155.\n\n       Indiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine\n       tunnels.  They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a\n       side tunnel.  They stop and peer into a quarry.\n\n156.   INT.  THE QUARRY CAVERN                                        156.\n\n       A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in\n       with loads of rock.  Emaciated children (still unaware of the re-\n       volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving\n       the heavily-loaded mine cars.\n\n       Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper-\n       ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag  the cars up the\n       sloped dump ramp.\n\n       Behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a\n       huge cistern.  From there, chutes deply the rushing water to\n       power the large conveyor belt below it.\n\n       As the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the\n       conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder\n       that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand.\n\n       From the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Those empty cars have got to go\n                       out of the mines.\n\n       Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine\n       cars.  The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun-\n       nels.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Come on, let's see if we can\n                       catch a ride...\n\n       Tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap.\n       Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and\n       crash to a stop against the cars in front.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Okay, Shorty -- go!\n\n       He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past\n       and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends.  Indy\n       pushes Willie  into  position and holds her ready --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I can't!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Go!\n\n       After another car crashes past, Indy shoves her.  Willie runs out\n       -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks!  Willie\n       sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly\n       toward her!\n\n       Indiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the other\n       side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into\n       the cars in front.\n\n       Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the\n       dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       We've got to get across to the\n                       empty cars.  Wait here until I\n                       signal you.\n\n       They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three\n       steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform.  Indy reaches\n       out and grabs one of the passing slave children.\n\n       They see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to\n       him.  He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other\n       children who start making their escapes into side tunnels.\n\n       Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow.  As they\n       start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy\n       motions again angrily --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Come on!\n\n       Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the\n       other side of the platform.  As the man rises he gets taller and\n       taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant coming up behind\n       Indiana.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Come one, what's wrong?\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Behind you!\n\n       Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-foot\n       tall guard.  Indy has to look up to see the man's mean-looking\n       face.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       I see the problem...\n\n       Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant\n       does not flinch, he just belches rudely.\n\n       Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps\n       back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away.\n\n       No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood.  The\n       giant starts toward him.  Indy drops the wood and looks around\n       for a much larger piece of wood.\n\n       As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large piece of\n       lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his\n       stomach.  Willie and Short Round looks startled --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What happened?\n\n       Short Round shakes his head.  They see Indy recover from the\n       spasm as the giant rushes him.  Indy jumps aside, landing on a\n       loaded mine car that is passing by.\n\n       The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out\n       onto it after Indiana.  Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the\n       giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big man's\n       skull!\n\n       Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull.\n       Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large\n       boulder.\n\n       Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a\n       shooting pain again.  Then he yells as he feels yet another stab-\n       bing pain in his left leg.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What's wrong with him?\n\n       Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something!  He\n       looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the\n       little Maharajah!\n\n       The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents\n       Indy.  He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban\n       pin.\n\n       On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which\n       collapses beneath him.  Short Round takes off.  He dashes under\n       the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up\n       to the cistern.\n\n       Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket.\n       He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony\n       and the malicious little Maharajah.\n\n       Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's\n       massive hands throttle his neck.  Indy's head hangs over the end\n       of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --\n\n       The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp\n       and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks\n       down the conveyor belt!\n\n       Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around\n       quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the giant.\n       She trips and swears angrily --\n\n       Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty mine\n       car!  She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the\n       rails toward the conveyor belt.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I got one!  Indy, I got one!\n\n       Near the waterfall, Short Round ascends on the rising bucket\n       chain.  Up on the balcony, the little Maharajah chuckles evilly as\n       he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --\n\n       The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in\n       the back of it!\n\n       On te conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a\n       stabbing pain lacerates his back!  He falls and writhed helpless-\n       ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him.\n\n       Willie shoves the mine car forward.  She sees Indy's desperate\n       situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock\n       crusher!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy, look out!\n\n       She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain onto\n       the balcony.  The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly as he\n       lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's face.\n\n       On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his\n       stabbed face!  Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed and\n       pulverized by the mammoth roller.\n\n       In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the con-\n       veyor slides past a tool bin.  The giant approaches Indy with it.\n\n       Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah.\n       They fall and fight like mortal enemies.  Short Round sees the\n       little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches him in the face.\n\n       Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is still\n       on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, feeling the\n       Maharajah's pin piercing his face.  The giant raises the pick-axe\n       above his head and it about to split Indiana in two!\n\n       On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round\n       dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin!\n\n       On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the\n       and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe.  Indy rolls\n       aside at the last minute!\n\n       The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches\n       forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending the giant\n       flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor\n       belt!\n\n       Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant crawls\n       desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he\n       gets snagged!\n\n       The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher\n       and he's dragged back under it feet first.  The Thuggee giant\n       screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the\n       enormous stone wheel!\n\n       On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the squirming\n       little Maharajah.  The little pricne's eyes still glow yellow as\n       he hollers --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       How you like bing pin cushion,\n                       Mr. Rajah-ha-ha?\n\n       The little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off\n       Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah\n       swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his hand!\n\n       Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kid's\n       hand.  The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand, gasping in\n       astonishment.\n\n       Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the Maharajah's\n       eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was released from\n       Kali's trance.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       Please -- pull it out!\n\n       Short Round yanks the pin out of the little prince's hand.  The\n       Maharajah looks like he's jsut awakened from a bag dream.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       It was the black sleep of Kali...\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       They made me do evil things...\n                       may lord Krishna forgive me.\n\n       Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt.\n       He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his feet\n       and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk.\n\n       The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit\n       where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the\n       crusher.\n\n       Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the\n       balcony.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Get down here, Shorty!  I got us\n                       a ride!\n\n       Willie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her.  She\n       yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds it threat-\n       eningly like a baseball bat --\n\n                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)\n                       Come on, let's see hoe hand your\n                       head is!\n\n       Up on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the edge.\n       The little Maharajah grabs his arm --\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       Please -- listen -- to go out\n                       you must take the left tunnel.\n\n       Shorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Thanks pal.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       I'm going to try to find the\n                       English soldiers.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Good luck.\n\n       Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite\n       to the floor of the cavern.\n\n       There he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing the\n       guard in the gut.  The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks his\n       putt and he splashes into the pool of water.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I don't appreciate being cooked\n                       like a french fry!\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Willie, come on!\n\n       Willie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)\n                       You do pretty good for a girl!\n\n       Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a\n       high platform next to the waterfall.  Mola Ram sees Willie and\n       Short Round pushing the mine cat.\n\n       Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open\n       fire!\n\n       Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie\n       to the far side of the car where they both take cover.\n\n       Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the\n       air and Indiana ducks!  The sword slashes into a wooden railing\n       and the guard tries frantically to pull it out --\n\n       Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then\n       smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses.  Indy\n       hears more gunfire.\n\n       Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above.  He\n       edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight\n       as he unfurls his whip.\n\n       One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and\n       Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's\n       arm and Indy yanks on it --\n\n       The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat-\n       walk.  Indy grabs the gun.  He kicks the guard off the catwalk\n       and the man falls into the waterfall pool.\n\n       As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the\n       catwalk and fires back at them.  A bullet explodes near Mola Ram\n       and he ducks back --\n\n       Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and\n       they jump into it --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy!  Hurry!\n\n       Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry.  Indy\n       takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around\n       him, splintering wood.  Indy reaches the end of the catwalk --\n\n       Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and\n       tacke!

Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up to the\n       front and starts firing.\n\n       Meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, Short Round rides\n       the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad scraping on the\n       metal wheel.\n\n       The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam flying\n       over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams.\n\n       The rifleman in the car behind is relading.

Climb up\n                       to the bridge!\n\n       Willie looks frightened.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Nothing to it -- follow me!\n\n       He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie\n       follows him.  Once under the bridge, they start climbing up the\n       rocks to it.\n\n       Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the\n       water geyser to the other side.  He grabs at scrub brush and\n       finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge.\n\n172.   EXT.  THE ROPE BRIDGE                                          172.\n\n       Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the\n       bridge.  Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines.\n       What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --\n\n       The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely\n       wasn't built by army engineers.  Laying across the two bottom\n       rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings.\n\n       Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up-\n       per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings.\n\n       Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge.  It holds him\n       and he turns and smiles at Willie --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff!\n\n       Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round\n       before he falls into the abyss!  Looking pale and less cocky,\n       Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.\n\n       They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made\n       more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear-\n       stopping up and down movement.\n\n       Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge.\n       He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across\n       already.  Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes\n       his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee\n       guards rush out.\n\n       Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck --\n       the guard spills forward and trips the second guard.  The first\n       man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head.\n\n       The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy\n       ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's\n       sword.  He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd\n       attempts to slice him in two!\n\n       Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en-\n       gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard.  Indy looks\n       at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide\n       the best way to use it --\n\n       Suddenly the guard shouts and charges.  Indy decides shouting\n       must be the \"de rigueur\" technique and shouts back loudly -- the\n       two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts.\n\n       Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes.\n       Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee\n       guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.\n\n       Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as\n       quickly as possible across the rickety span.  He hears shouting\n       ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end\n       of the bridge.\n\n       The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across\n       the bridge.  Struggling   futilely with the guards, Willie shouts\n       at Indiana --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy -- looks out behind you!\n\n       Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind\n       him.  He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured\n       Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him.\n\n       Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with\n       guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above\n       and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!\n\n       A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far\n       end of the bridge.  He stands with the guards who hold Willie and\n       Short Round.\n\n       The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the\n       swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Let my friends go!\n\n       Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy\n       from both sides of the bridge.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       That's far enough!\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       You are in no position to give\n                       orders, Dr. Jones.\n\n       Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       You want the stones, let them go\n                       and call off your guards!\n\n       Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of\n       the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into\n       one of the bottom rope-spans!\n\n       The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I\n                       don't believe you would kill\n                       yourself!\n\n       Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now)\n       step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both\n       sides.\n\n       Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span!\n       It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly.  The bridge\n       jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously!\n\n       Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge.  The\n       High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying\n       span, holding the knife behind them both.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       Your friends will die with you!\n\n       In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off\n       Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him.  He sees\n       Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at\n       their backs.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Then I guess we're all going to\n                       take a big dive!\n\n       Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his\n       hero isn't kidding.  Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she\n       notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a\n       rope support.\n\n       Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and\n       does likewise with her arm --\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       Give me the stones!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Mola Ram -- you're about to meet\n                       Kali -- in Hell!\n\n       Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes\n       through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom\n       ropes --!\n\n       Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late!\n       Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other\n       side are severed --\n\n       The rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and\n       both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as\n       they plunge down into the rocky gorge!\n\n       Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and\n       fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram\n       spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --\n\n       Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the\n       bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang-\n       ling from its moorings at the top.\n\n       There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive\n       realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the\n       top of the now vertical bridge.\n\n       Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while\n       directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life.\n\n       Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and\n       stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto\n       solid ground and turns to help Willie up.\n\n       Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and\n       grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break\n       Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face.\n\n       Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs\n       his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his\n       shirt --\n\n       Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to\n       dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages\n       to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to\n       his death.\n\n       Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen\n       of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only\n       to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.\n\n       Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the\n       back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram\n       turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face.\n\n       Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent-\n       ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In-\n       dy's hand -- Indy falls!\n\n       Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something --\n       meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.\n\n       Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously\n       near the bottom of the bridge.\n\n       Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small\n       gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards\n       have bows and arrows and take firing positions --\n\n       At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks\n       start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him\n       with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.\n\n       Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He\n       reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes\n       into the wood!\n\n       Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing\n       across the chasm directy for him!\n\n       Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells\n       orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows.\n\n       Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu-\n       ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des-\n       perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock!\n\n       The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs\n       him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from\n       beneath them.\n\n       On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire\n       rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns\n       and sees something --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Willie, look!\n\n       They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British\n       cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw\n       up their forses and dismount quickly.\n\n       A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover --\n       they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles.\n\n       As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight\n       below on the dangling bridge --\n\n       Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses\n       insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and\n       Indy yells in pain --\n\n       Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand\n       starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest\n       during the temple sacrifice)!\n\n       Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches\n       at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers\n       away from his heart.\n\n       Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers\n       withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High\n       Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       No, the stones are mine!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re-\n                       peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-\n                       ing)\n\n       As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and\n       starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin to\n       spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       *(He repeats Sankara's warning\n                        in Sanskrit)\n\n       The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain.\n       The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks\n       at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare --\n\n       Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones.  He\n       manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls!\n\n       Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool.  He watches Mola\n       Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into\n       the jagged rocks at the bottom.\n\n       The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel-\n       come the meal that just dropped in.  Jaws flash and teeth rip at\n       the High Priest's likeless corpse.\n\n       And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur-\n       rent and disappears down the river ...\n\n173.   EXT.  THE CLIFF                                                173.\n\n       Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round\n       reach for him at the top.  They pull him up onto the cliff and\n       they all look around exhausted --\n\n       Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun-\n       nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side.\n\n       Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel.\n       He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for\n       his help.  On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting\n       him back.\n\n       Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv-\n       er far below.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I guess Mola Ram got what he\n                       wanted.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Not quite.\n\n       She sees Indy reach into his pocket.  He pulls something out\n       slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       The last Sankara Stone.\n\n       Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana.  She\n       gazes at it and looks delighted --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       And the diamond hidden inside...\n\n       Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes\n\n                                                               CUT TO\n\n174.   EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 174.\n\n       The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a\n       hilltop.  Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing\n       over the rise.\n\n       Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into\n       Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to\n       their homeland.\n\n       Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished:  the\n       barren countryside has been reborn.  They see streams flowing\n       beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting\n       golden grain in the fields.\n\n175.   EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE                                         175.\n\n       Indiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the\n       village road.   Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi-\n       tive dwellings.\n\n       Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants.  The children\n       returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush-\n       ing out to greet them.\n\n       There is laughter and tears as families are reunited.  Indiana\n       sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the\n       village elders.\n\n       The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows.  The\n       three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved\n       as he speaks to Indiana --\n\n                                   SHAMAN\n                       We know you are coming back --\n                                (indicating the\n                                 countryside)\n                       -- when life returns to our village.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's a real miracle.\n\n                                   SHAMAN\n                       Now you see the magic of the\n                       \"rock\" you bring back.\n\n       The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana.  Indy takes the stone\n       out of his bag and unwraps it.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Yes, I've seen its power\n\n       Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them.\n       The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's small\n       sacred mound.  Indy and Willie stay back.
