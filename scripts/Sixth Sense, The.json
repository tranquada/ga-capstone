BASEMENT - EVENING\n\n\tA NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of\n\ta basement.\n\n\tLIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.\n\n\tAnna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands\n\tin the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines\n\ther slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and\n\tcome to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.\n\n\tShe walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.\n\tShe stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she\n\tslides it out.\n\n\tAnna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.\n\tIt's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her\n\tbreath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly\n\tuncomfortable.\n\n\tAnna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster\n\tthan the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst\n\tof LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.\n\n\tWE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.\n\n\tTHE LIGHTBULB DIES.  DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. DINING ROOM - EVENING\n\n\tTwo place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.\n\tTake-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty\n\tbottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.\n\n\tAnna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.\n\tShe hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tIt's getting cold.\n\n\tMALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and\n\ttie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a\n\tbrirfcase next to him.\n\n\tMalcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,\n\tintelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His\n\tcharming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tThat's one fine frame.  A fine\n\t\tframe it is.\n\n\tMalcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a\n\tdining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.\n\tThe frame is a polished mahogany.\n\n\tHe slips on the sweatshirt.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tHow much does a fine frame like\n\t\tthat cost, you think?\n\n\tAnna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tI've never told you...  but you\n\t\tsound a little like Dr. Seuss when\n\t\tyou're drunk.\n\n\tMalcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tAnna, I'm serious.  Serious I am,\n\t\tAnna.\n\n\tAnna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get\n\tit.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention\n\tslowly moves to the framed certificate.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tMahogany.  I'd say that cost at\n\t\tleast a couple hundred.  Maybe\n\t\tthree.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tThree?  We should hock it.  Buy a\n\t\tC.D. rack for the bedroom.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tDo you know how important this is?\n\t\tThis is big time.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI'm going to read it for you,\n\t\tdoctor.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tDo I really sound like Dr. Seuss?\n\n\tAnna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward\n\ther seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to\n\ttickle her.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tIn recognition for his outstanding\n\t\tachievement in the field of child\n\t\tpsychology, his dedication to his\n\t\twork, and his continuing efforts to\n\t\timprove the quality of life for\n\t\tcountless children and their\n\t\tfamilies, the City of Philadelphia\n\t\tproudly bestows upon its son Dr.\n\t\tMalcolm Crowe...  That's you...\n\t\tthe Mayor's Citation for\n\t\tProfessional Excellence.\n\n\tBeat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tWow.  They called you their son.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWe can keep it in the bathroom.\n\n\tAnna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tIt's not real, Anna.  Some\n\t\tsecretary wrote that up.  Don't\n\t\ttell me you thought it was real?\n\n\tAnna's expression becomes serious.\n\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\tShe just keeps staring.  Beat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tDon't do the quiet thing.  You know\n\t\tI hate it.\n\n\tBeat.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tThis is an important night for us.\n\t\tFinally someone is recognizing the\n\t\tsacrifices you made.  That you have\n\t\tput everything second, including me,\n\t\tfor those families they're talking\n\t\tabout.\n\n\tMalcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and\n\tholds them steady.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tThey're also saying that my husband\n\t\thas a gift.  Not an ordinary gift\n\t\tthat allows him to hit a ball over a\n\t\tfence.  Or a gift that lets him\n\t\tproduce beautiful images on a\n\t\tcanvas...  Your gift teaches\n\t\tchildren how to be strong in\n\t\tsituations where most adults would\n\t\tpiss on themselves.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYes, I believe what they wrote\n\t\tabout you.\n\n\tAnna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm\n\tsmiles softly.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tThank you.\n\n\tAnna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWhat are we hugging about again?\n\n\tAnna laughs as she wipes her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tNothing.  There wasn't supposed to\n\t\tbe any crying at this celebration.\n\t\tJust a lot of drinking and sex.\n\n\tMalcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tI would like some red wine in a\n\t\tglass.\n\n\tAnna hands him his glass.  He stares at it.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tI would not like it in a mug.  I\n\t\twould not like it in a jug.\n\n\tMalcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up\n\tlaughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tTWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to\n\tturn on the light.  It doesn't come on.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tBulb's out.\n\n\tAnna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the\n\tbedroom.\n\n\tMALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.\n\n\tA SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the\n\troom.\n\n\tAnna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a\n\tpretend striptease song.\n\n\tMalcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling\n\toff the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her\n\tplayful dance.  She's facing away from him.\n\n\tHe walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's\n\tface turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED\n\tWINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A\n\tlamp lays broken on the ground by the window.\n\n\tMalcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet\n\tawareness.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\tHe's still in the house.\n\n\tA SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.\n\n\tANNA SCREAMS.\n\n\tMalcolm spins around.  His heart stops.\n\n\tMalcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know\n\tsomeone is inside.  Beat.\n\n\tMalcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that\n\tcomes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the\n\tfigure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested\n\tin the back of the bathroom.\n\n\tNO ONE MAKES A SOUND.\n\n\tThe STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes\n\tbulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands\n\tare folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a\n\tpatch of white in his hair.\n\n\tMalcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off\n\tthe stranger.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tAnna, don't move.  Don't say a word.\n\n\tAnna barely nods her understanding.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\t\t(to the stranger)\n\t\tThis is forty-seven Locust Street.\n\t\tYou have broken a window and\n\t\tentered a private residence.  Do\n\t\tyou understand what I'm saying?\n\n\tThe stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock\n\ton Malcolm.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tYou don't know so many things.\n\n\tBeat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tThere are no needles or\n\t\tprescription drugs of any kind in\n\t\tthis house.\n\n\tThe stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm\n\tstumbles back onto the edge of the bed.\n\n\tAnna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of\n\tcolor.\n\n\tThe stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tAre you drunk?\n\n\tThe stranger's stare slides to Anna.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tDid you get him drunk?\n\n\tThe stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A\n\tpenetrating, unwavering stare.\n\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tDo you know why you're scared when\n\t\tyou're alone?\n\n\tAnna's expression instanly changes.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tI know.\n\n\tBEAT.  THE ROOM GOES SILENT.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWhat do you want?  I don't\n\t\tunderstand what you want.\n\n\tThe stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tWhat you promised.\n\n\tMalcolm stops all movement.\n\n\t\t\t     ANNA\n\t\t--My God.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\t--Do I know you?\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tLet's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm\n\t\tCrowe. Recipient of awards from the\n\t\tMayor on the news.  Dr. Malcolm\n\t\tCrowe, he's helped so many children...\n\t\tAnd he doesn't even remember my\n\t\tname?\n\n\tMalcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to\n\ttremble.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tI was ten when you worked with me.\n\n\tBeat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tDowntown clinic?  Single parent\n\t\tfamily?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI had a possible mood disorder...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI had no friends... you said I was\n\t\tsocially isolated.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI was afraid -- you called it acute\n\t\tanxiety...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou were wrong.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tCome on, clear your head...  Male,\n\t\tnine...  Single parent...  Mood\n\t\tdiscorder... Acute anxiety.\n\n\tMalcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tI'm nineteen.  I have drugs in my\n\t\tsystem twenty-four hours a day...\n\t\tI still have no friends.  I still\n\t\thave no peace.  I'm still afraid.\n\n\tTears jump into the stranger's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\t...I'm still afraid.\n\n\tMalcolm stands.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tPlease give me a second to think.\n\n\tMalcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the\n\tstranger.  Beat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tBed Freidken?\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tSome people call me freak.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\t...Ronald...  Ronald Sumner?\n\n\tTears fall down the stranger's face.\n\n\t\t\t     STRANGER\n\t\tI am a freak.\n\n\tMalcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks\n\tin his head.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\t--Vincent?\n\n\tTHE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tVincent Gray?\n\n\tVINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.\n\n\tMalcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep\n\twaters.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tI do remember you, Vincent.  You\n\t\twere a good kid.  Very smart...\n\t\tQuiet...  Compassionate...\n\t\tUnusually compassionate...\n\n\tVincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.\n\n\t\t\t     VINCENT\n\t\tYou forgot cursed.\n\n\tVINCENT is fully crying now.\n\n\t\t\t     VINCENT\n\t\tYou failed me.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tVincent...  I'm sorry I didn't help\n\t\tyou...  I can try to help you now.\n\n\tVincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and\n\traises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING\n\tECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll\n\tonto the bed.\n\n\tVincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER\n\tHORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the\n\tbathroom floor.\n\n\tANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON\n\n\tThe legend, \"Two Years Later\" appears.\n\n\tA man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten\n\tnotes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,\n\t\"Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989.\"\n\n\tThe man's hand touches the name almost reverently.\n\n\tHe glances through the page.

At the top of this new page\n\treads, \"Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998.\"\n\n\tAs the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words\n\tand phrases circled throughout this new case history.\n\n\t\"...Acute anxiety\"\n\t\"...Socially isolated\"\n\t\"...Possible mood disorder\"\n\t\"...Parent status -- Divorced\"\n\t\"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad\"\n\n\tThe hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.\n\n\tWE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm\n\tCrowe.\n\n\tMalcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes\n\tacross the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.\n\n\tA door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.\n\n\tCOLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy\n\twith large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around\n\thim.\n\n\tHis hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.\n\tCole carefully locks the door behind him.\n\n\tHe moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.\n\tAnxiously.\n\n\tThe eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a\n\tpair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.\n\n\tMalcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down\n\tand buttons his jacket.\n\n\tWhen he looks up, Cole is gone.\n\n\tMalcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full\n\tspeed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS\n\tSCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.\n\n\tFor a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He\n\tstuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. STREET - DAY\n\n\tMalcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a\n\tstreet intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a\n\tparking lot.\n\n\tCOLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a\n\tbuilding.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly\n\tornate doors.  He slips inside.\n\n\tMalcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and\n\tthen to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone\n\tand huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all\n\taround it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church\n\tquietly.\n\n\tA SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it\n\tquickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate\n\tdoors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. CHURCH - DAY\n\n\tOnly a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.\n\n\tMalcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for\n\tin the last row of the church.\n\n\tHe moves down the center aisle towards the back.\n\n\tMalcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and\n\tbeige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each\n\tother.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\t\t(soft)\n\t\tPro... Fun... Add...\n\n\tThe words are unintelligible.\n\n\tCole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at\n\thim.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body\n\tstill with fear.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tIt's okay, Cole.  Don't be\n\t\tfrightened.\n\n\tCole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tMy name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  I\n\t\twas supposed to meet you today.\n\t\tSorry I missed our appointment.\n\n\tMalcolm waits for a response.  None comes.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tDo you mind if I sit down?  I have\n\t\tthis injury from a couple of years\n\t\tago and it flares up every once in\n\t\ta while just so I won't forget it.\n\n\tBeat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of\n\tthe seat.  Malcolm sits.\n\n\tCole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and\n\tstares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more\n\tcarefully.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tYour eye frames.  They don't seem to\n\t\thave any lenses in them.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\t\t(soft)\n\t\tThey're my dad's.  The lenses hurt\n\t\tmy eyes.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tI knew there was a sound explanation.\n\n\tMalcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWhat was that you were saying\n\t\tbefore with your soldiers?  Day pro\n\t\tfun.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\t...De profundis clamo ad te domine.\n\n\tMalcolm stares surprised.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tIt's called Latin.  It's a\n\t\tlanguage.\n\n\tMalcolm nods at the information.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tAll your soldiers speak Latin?\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tNo, just one.\n\n\tMalcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.\n\tMalcolm's smile slowly disappears.\n\n\tCole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost\n\thealed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.\n\tBeat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tI like churches, too.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tIn olden times, in Europe, people\n\t\tused to hide in churches.  Claim\n\t\tsanctuary.\n\n\tCole looks up.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tWhat were they hiding from?\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tOh, lots of things, I suppose.  Bad\n\t\tpeople for one.  People who wanted\n\t\tto imprison them.  Hurt them.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tNothing bad can happen in a church,\n\t\tright?\n\n\tMalcolm studies Cole's anxious face.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tRight.\n\n\tMalcolm and Cole just stare at each other.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tI forgot your name.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tDr. Crowe.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tYou're a doctor.

Malcolm loses\n\thimself in his thoughts.\n\n\tWhen Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and\n\ttake a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.

The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...\n\tAn easel stands before a piano.

He stands near the\n\topen door.\n\n\tCole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He\n\tleans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches\n\tCole with a crinkled brow.\n\n\tCole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.\n\n\t\t\t     MR.

Instead, he continues to\n\tpush the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches\n\tover and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.\n\n\tCole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.

The\n\tsight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.\n\n\tCole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.\n\tMarschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.\n\n\tThey stay like that for a while.  Beat.

He silently takes a\n\tseat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes\n\tare hard -- filled with anger.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tHey, big guy.\n\n\tCole stares for a second.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tI don't want to talk about anything.\n\n\tCole lowers his head.  Malcolm just sits and thinks.\n\n\tTHE SOUND OF BOYS PLAYING SPORTS ON THE FIELD OUTSIDE FILTER IN\n\tTHROUGH THE LIBRARY WINDOWS.\n\n\tCole turns his head and stares at the windows.  Malcolm takes in\n\tthe sad vision of this boy.  It affects him.  Beat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tDo you like magic?\n\n\tCole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks\n\tto Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, \"Yes.\"\n\n\tMalcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his\n\tright hand.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWatch the penny closely.\n\n\tMalcolm closes his hand around the penny.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tI do the magic shake...\n\n\tMalcolm shakes his hand in circles.  Cole watches his hand\n\tcarefully.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tAnd suddenly the penny has\n\t\tmagically traveled to my left hand...\n\n\tCole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open\n\tit.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tBut that's not the end of the trick.\n\t\tWith another magic shake, the penny\n\t\ttravels into my shirt pocket...\n\n\tCole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt.  Malcolm taps the pocket but\n\tdoesn't open it.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tBut that's still not the end!...  I\n\t\tdo a final magic shake...  and\n\t\tsuddenly...  The penny returns to\n\t\tthe hand where it started from.\n\n\tMalcolm opens his right hand.  The penny sits quietly in the\n\tcenter of his palm.\n\n\tCole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face.  Beat.\n\tCole cracks a smile.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tThat isn't magic.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tYou just kept the penny in that\n\t\thand the whole time...\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tWho me?\n\n\tMalcolm smiles a mischievous smile.  He places the penny on the\n\ttable.  Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\tI didn't know you were funny.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tI forgot myself.\n\n\tMalcolm and Cole share a warm look.\n\n\tTHE SOUNDS OF KIDS LAUGHING AND PLAYING OUT ON THE FIELD COME\n\tPOURING INTO THE ROOM AGAIN.\n\n\tCole's expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the\n\twindows.  Malcolm leans across the table and whispers.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tCole...\n\n\tCole looks at Malcolm.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\tOne day...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou're going to sound just like\n\t\tthem.\n\n\tBeat.  Cole's chin starts to tremble.  His voice cracks.\n\n\t\t\t     COLE\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tPromise?\n\n\tBeat.\n\n\t\t\t     MALCOLM\n\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\tPromise.\n\n\tMalcolm and Cole sit in silence and listen to THE SOUND OF\n\tCHILDREN PLAYING.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.

A blanket lays crumpled on the\n\tsofa.\n\n\tTHE WOMAN'S VOICE IS COMING FROM A VIDEO PLAYING ON THE VCR.\n\tIT'S A WEDDING VIDEO.

I'm talking about\n\t\tJulie Andrews twirling around like\n\t\ta mental patient on a mountain top\n\t\t-- kind of happy.\n\n\tTHE LARGE BRIDESMAID BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL.\n\n\t\t\t     BRIDESMAID\n\t\t\t(T.V.)\n\t\tYou're really lucky.  She's got so\n\t\tmuch love for you.  Don't tell her\n\t\tI told you, but she said she loved\n\t\tyou from the first time she met you\n\t\ton the street.

MALCOLM AND\n\tANNA ARE SLOW DANCING.  THEY'RE WHISPERING AND LAUGHING WITH EACH\n\tOTHER.  THE HAPPINESS FROM THEM IS TANGIBLE.\n\n\tMalcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images.\n\tHe turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.

BATHROOM - EVENING\n\n\tMalcolm steps into the bathroom quietly.  He stares at the\n\tsilhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower.\n\tAnna stands still, her head tilted back.\n\n\tMalcolm watches quietly.  By his experience, it's clear he's\n\ttaken by his wife's beauty.\n\n\tMalcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the\n\tsink.  Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble\n\tsurface.\n\n\tHe reaches out and picks it up.  The label on the plastic bottle\n\treads,\n\n\t\t\"Zoloft Anti-depressant\"\n\t\t\"To be taken twice daily\"\n\n\tMalcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle.  He gazes at the\n\tstill figure of his wife as the water covers her.\n\n\tMalcolm leaves the bathroom.

He turns white as\n\the stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away.  Cole's\n\teyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet.  Beat.\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY ERUPTS WITH NOISE AS THE CHILDREN RUN IN FROM THE\n\tBACKYARD.\n\n\tTommy Tammisimo is one of the children.

Darren finally gets it.\n\n\t\t\t     DARREN\n\t\tYeah, Cole...  you get to be the\n\t\tone locked in the dungeon.\n\n\tIt happens too quick for Cole to react.

The sword starts to come out.\n\n\tThe villagers GASP.\n\n\tCole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his\n\thead.\n\n\tMerlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE\n\tAUDITORIUM.\n\n\tMalcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light\n\tfor the first time.\n\n\tThe villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry\n\thim around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then\n\tstarts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try\n\tunsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then\n\tcollapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle\n\tthemselves.\n\n\tMalcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable\n\tamong of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying\n\tthemselves on stage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.

He gazes\n\tcuriously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.\n\n\tConfusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An\n\tidentical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.\n\n\tBeat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS\n\tGONE.\n\n\tMalcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks\n\taround in confusion...\n\n\tHis eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.

Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.\n\n\tAnna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his\n\tshirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF\n\tBLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his\n\tside...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower\n\tback pours out blood uncontrollably.\n\n\tMalcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained.\n\n\tANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.\n\n\tMalcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then\n\tbecomes silent.
