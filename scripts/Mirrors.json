NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION                             1A   \n\n     A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform    \n     somewhere in Harlem.                                                \n\n     A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African      \n     American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.      \n\n     He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards     \n     the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.        \n\n     Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back,    \n     searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the     \n     public restroom and runs inside.                                    \n\n\n1B   INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM                            1B   \n\n     The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed        \n     while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -                 \n\n     The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of    \n     the dark.                                                           \n\n     The man checks each stall one at a time.                            \n\n     His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-                 \n\n     A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO       \n     CRAWL THROUGH.                                                      \n\n     He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight.     \n     After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-        \n\n     A wall of bricks.                                                   \n\n     Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door,          \n     fearful of what could be waiting outside.                           \n\n     A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.                         \n\n     He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.              \n\n     Silence.                                                            \n\n     His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the        \n     sound.

It resembles a Cubist         \n     portrait.                                                           \n\n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 2.\n1B   CONTINUED:                                                       1B\n\n\n                              MAN                                          \n                  I'm sorry...

His head resting        \n     against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the          \n     dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another          \n     extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too        \n     frantically-                                                          \n\n     A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.          \n\n     Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-                         \n\n     HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,             \n     WATCHING HIM.                                                         \n\n     Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become                \n     independent. A separate being...                                      \n\n     Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.         \n\n     The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects      \n     the neon lights just like a knife blade.                              \n\n     His eyes turn cold with fear when-                                    \n\n     HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!             \n\n     IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS        \n     OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD.                                     \n\n     Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his        \n     jugular from end to end.                                              \n\n     In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on        \n     the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.                     \n\n                                                           CUT TO:         \n\n\n1C   EXT.

Some of the windows\n     are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an\n     impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's\n     architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic\n     streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.\n\n     What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost\n     ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.\n\n                                                              9.\n\n\n\n\n14   INT.

The display cases, the\n     departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt\n     or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor\n     and rainwater drips down all over the place.\n\n                            MAN (O.S.)                                  \n                It's been five years and they're still                  \n                in a legal battle with the insurance                    \n                companies.

He stops for a moment,\n     facing his reflection in the mirror.\n\n     He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not\n     quite an NYPD uniform...\n\n     Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the\n     mirror and leans forward-\n\n     A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.\n\n     He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it\n     off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on\n     the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This\n     confirms his hunch-\n\n     THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...\n\n     By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.\n\n     Another. And yet another-\n\n     THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS, JUST AS IF A CROWD\n     OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS\n     TO GET OUT...                                                         \n\n     As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO         \n     THE BASEMENT OPENING...                                               \n\n     Ben turns around.

What is happening? Is      \n     he dreaming or hallucinating?                                         \n\n     Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes       \n     fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees      \n     his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!          \n\n     Ben opens it-                                                         \n\n     THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED        \n     IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED.

He opens and closes the door over and over, while         \n     observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful.      \n\n     The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark.         \n     Ben hesitates.                                                        \n\n                                                                16.\n\n\n\n\n24    OMITTED                                                         24    \n\n\n25    OMITTED                                                         25    \n\n\n26    OMITTED                                                         26    \n\n\n27    OMITTED                                                         27    \n\n\n28    OMITTED                                                         28    \n\n\n29    OMITTED                                                         29    \n\n\n30    OMITTED                                                         30    \n\n\n31    OMITTED                                                         31    \n\n\n31A   OMITTED                                                         31A   \n\n\n32    OMITTED                                                         32    \n\n\n33    OMITTED                                                         33    \n\n\n34    OMITTED                                                         34    \n\n\n35    OMITTED                                                         35    \n\n\n36    INT.

He finds\n     some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He\n     briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky...              \n\n     He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant\n     coffee.                                                             \n\n     In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV.

He avoids, as much as possible, looking\n     into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural\n     manifestation.\n\n     The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are\n     all disturbing and unsettling.\n\n     Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble        \n     columns seems alive in the dark.                                    \n\n     As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his\n     attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-\n\n     AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL\n     SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE\n     FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING\n     HAPPENED.\n\n     How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in\n     the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...                               \n\n     Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-\n\n     The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben\n     decides to check it out for himself...\n\n     Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of\n     dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER\n     HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE \"FLASHBACK\"-\n\n     We follow him in the mirror-\n\n     Ben has left the night behind and enters the \"daytime\"\n     department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled.\n\n     Ben continues his journey into the past.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                24.\n45   CONTINUED:                                                       45\n\n\n     The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big\n     sale.

THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A\n     DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-\n\n     EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS\n     AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN\n     AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING.\n\n     Frightened, Ben steps back-\n\n     The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has       \n     rushed to escape death-                                               \n\n     HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH.\n     FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE.                \n\n     In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the      \n     face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN?                               \n\n     Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches\n     fire.\n\n     Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands-\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     IN THE DARK NIGHT SURROUNDED BY THE CHARRED RUINS, BEN QUIVERS\n     DELIRIOUSLY AS HE TRIES TO SMOTHER THE INVISIBLE FLAMES.\n\n     He comes back to reality-\n\n     Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses. What's\n     happening to him? What he just experienced certainly felt real.\n\n     During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the\n     counters.\n\n     Ben bends down to pick it up. The beam illuminates the ground\n     and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER\n     WALLET.\n\n\n\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 25.\n45    CONTINUED: (2)                                                   45\n\n\n      He stretches out his hand to pick it up. The leather is worn-out\n      but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed\n      there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced\n      touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence.\n\n      Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a\n      driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a\n      sturdily built African American man. WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN              \n      RUNNING IN THE SUBWAY, AT THE BEGINNING. The name rings a bell         \n      for him-                                                               \n\n\n46    INT.

A name is embroidered on\n      the shoulder-\n\n      AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSING\n      NIGHT WATCHMAN.\n\n      The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He\n      cannot hold back his police instincts.\n\n      He finally empties out the contents on the table-\n\n      A Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license,\n      Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of\n      paper folded in four-\n\n      Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink-\n\n      ESSEKER                                                                \n\n      Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A           \n      place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts                 \n      everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one       \n      of the drawers.                                                        \n\n                                                     FADE TO BLACK           \n\n\n48    OMITTED                                                          48    \n\n\n48A   EXT.

NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER                               50    \n\n     In the darkness, a rat glides peacefully on the water surface.\n\n     In the basement, the water level continues to rise.\n\n     With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water,\n     Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.\n\n     He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light\n     sweeps across the walls and the piping.\n\n     Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall,\n     he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of\n     dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it\n     off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF        \n     PSYCHIATRY.                                                         \n\n     He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.\n\n     Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer\n     and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The\n     humidity has pearled into droplets.\n\n     He has found the source of the leak.\n\n     His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben\n     digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked\n     water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which\n     the tubing was embedded.\n\n     Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were\n     another room on the other side of the wall.\n\n     He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it\n     with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the\n     gaping black hole that he has just left behind.\n\n     Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot\n     make out what is on the other side.\n\n     He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for\n     him to crawl through-\n\n     ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE       \n     MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY    \n     WALL, INCLUDING THE CEILING, IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS           \n     MIRRORS.\n\n     One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door.                    \n\n     He enters.                                                          \n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               28.\n50   CONTINUED:                                                      50\n\n\n     His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite\n     angles. Ben moves towards the center of the room-\n\n     ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING        \n     IN THE CORNER.                                                         \n\n     It's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security\n     guard's uniform.\n\n     From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's\n     head.

He's not used to\n     getting many deliveries. He flips it over to see who it is from-\n\n     THE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS...\n\n     Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel. He tears away the\n     cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room\n     table-\n\n     A DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND, ALL MIXED UP, ON THE TABLE.\n\n     More or less recent, all the articles relate to the department\n     store and the fire that burned it down...

It confirms the existence of a hidden\n     room.\n\n     Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a\n     large enough opening to access the other side-\n\n     He inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing-\n\n     THE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE THE OCTAGONAL ROOM, SURROUNDED       \n     BY THE MIRRORING WALLS.\n\n     He enters.

From what we can see, Gary\n     grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life.\n     Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly\n     tidy.\n\n                            BEN\n                Do you mind if I stay in here for a\n                moment?\n\n     Mrs. Lewis smiles at him. She too, likes to gather her thoughts\n     in Gary's room.\n\n     Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might\n     help him on the Esseker lead. He opens the drawers and looks\n     through the papers-\n\n     Nothing is of any help to him. The only place left that he\n     hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors\n     seem to invite him to enter...\n\n     What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have\n     imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, and\n     MIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL, FROM THE FLOOR TO THE\n     CEILING! - It's a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben\n     discovered back in the basement of the department store...\n\n                            MRS.

Satan reproduced the young\n                 woman's traits in such a way that Eve\n                 would only see and listen to the image\n                 of herself...

The shrieks\n      resound through the department store again. They seem to come\n      from one of the floors above.\n\n      Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs-\n\n      He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the\n      departments. Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.\n\n      He climbs up to the third floor. The beam of the flashlight\n      sweeps past each nook and dark corner-\n\n      Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail\n      to death.\n\n                             BEN\n                     (shouting)\n                 WHERE ARE YOU?!!\n\n      No answer.

Ben passes the counters and enters the\n      dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire.\n\n      The woman must be in here, hiding somewhere.\n\n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               43.\n61A   CONTINUED:                                                  61A\n\n\n                               BEN                                         \n                   I'm here Ma'am...\n\n      Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his\n      flashlight.\n\n      The woman seems to have vanished.\n\n                               BEN (CONT'D)\n                   Ma'am?

In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms-\n\n      A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY\n      ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN!\n\n      Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE\n      MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM!\n\n      Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it\n      face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened\n      inside.\n\n      Ben unhooks the mirror.\n\n      It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down\n      the wall.\n\n      Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.\n\n      He reaches the last dressing room-\n\n      Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior\n      of the cubicle.\n\n      In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE\n      TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of\n      the body...\n\n      With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards\n      the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover.\n      He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing-\n\n      A NAKED YOUNG WOMAN IS GOING INTO SPASMS AND SCREECHING WITH\n      PAIN.

She dips her fingers into the\n     water to check the temperature. The bathtub is almost full.\n\n     Angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror. When\n     she turns around to climb into the hot bath, HER REFLECTION\n     REMAINS MOTIONLESS IN THE MIRROR, STARING BLANKLY AT EACH OF HER\n     MOVEMENTS.\n\n     Unaware, Angela soaks into her hot bath.\n\n     The water continues to pour from the tap.\n\n     Angela shuts her eyes- It's been a long day.\n\n     IN THE MIRROR, ANGELA'S REFLECTION FIXES HER WITH A COLD GLARE-\n\n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                47.\n65   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   65\n\n\n     Without a word, Angela's reflection brings its hands to its face\n     and digs its fingers into its mouth.

The apartment is\n     entirely flooded.\n\n     Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep\n     the intrusive neighbors away.\n\n     A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the\n     downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police,\n     after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains\n     how \"it was raining blood into her living room\"...\n\n     Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find\n     Larry. He is in charge of the case.                                     \n\n     Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of           \n     the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black\n     hair, floating in the murky water.\n\n     Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and            \n     sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the          \n     chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub.\n\n     The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's\n     naked corpse.\n\n     With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of        \n     hair covering Angela's face-\n\n\n\n\n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               48.\n66   CONTINUED:                                                      66\n\n\n     Taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of          \n     this JAW-LESS FACE.\n\n     Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts         \n     to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention-       \n\n     He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet              \n     mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks.       \n\n     Strange.\n\n     A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns        \n     immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's       \n     destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub.\n\n     A police inspector in the next room, calls out to him-                 \n\n                              POLICE INSPECTOR O.S.\n                  Larry?

The police inspector in the living           \n     room holds a picture frame in his hands.

His haggard face\n     expresses great grief. His sister's death has left him                 \n     distraught.\n\n     He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands.\n\n     The classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his\n     reflection.\n\n     Ben knows that he is being watched.\n\n     Behind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him.

You'll call me back?                      \n                  Ok...\n\n     Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered\n     with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of\n     Gary's investigative research.\n\n     All the articles date back approximately to the same period and\n     are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years\n     ago.\n\n     But not a hint of Esseker.\n\n     Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story\n     together-\n\n     \" Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded \"                    \n\n     \"   Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered...\"     \n\n     \" ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... \"\n\n     \" ...the throat slit open... \"\n\n     \" Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... \"\n\n\n\n\n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              54.\n72   CONTINUED:                                                     72\n\n\n     \" The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly\n     denies the accusation of murdering his family... \"\n\n     \" Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty-\n     The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses.

He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind,\n     surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with    \n     him.                                                                \n\n     As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the      \n     window-                                                             \n\n     What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his\n     family?

Under the blanket, next to him, he spots\n     the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night.            \n\n     The pain is too strong.

He walks up the steps of the porch\n      and peeks inside the house through the front window. In the dark\n      he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching TV. He\n      can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or           \n      turned towards the wall.                                             \n\n      A big dog barks behind the window.

Ben appears next to\n      the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old,         \n      Anna's elder brother.\n\n      Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him-           \n\n                             ROBERT\n                 You know, up to this day, the visions                    \n                 of Anna's fits still haunt me at\n                 night.                                                   \n\n      They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door.          \n\n                             ROBERT (CONT'D)\n                  I helped my father fix up this part\n                 of the basement, especially for her-\n\n      The old man turns the key in the padlock. Slowly, the door\n      swings open, revealing-\n\n                             ROBERT (CONT'D)\n                 Her fits were too violent. My mother\n                 couldn't take her screams anymore.\n\n      What's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY\n      DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more\n      resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST\n      FEROCIOUS BEAST.                                                    \n\n      As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from\n      that time come back to him-\n\n      Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of\n      hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her    \n      howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh.

Since that                   \n                day, I have never had another fit.

NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM / SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS              129\n\n      IN THE BASEMENT, THE CALM HAS BEEN RESTORED.\n\n      Ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror\n      room. In the silence, he waits. He must establish beyond a doubt\n      that it's all over.\n\n      He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water-\n\n      Everything seems to be back to normal. His reflection is\n      deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming\n      placid.\n\n      Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room-\n\n      All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the           \n      metal cage that was holding them in place. The floor is covered        \n      with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water,\n      shimmering in the shadows.\n\n      The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna, or\n      her dead body-\n\n      Nothing...\n\n      Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure -         \n      The woman has vanished.\n\n      He aims his flashlight at the ceiling. The beam of light\n      instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him-\n\n      It's her, or at least what is left of her- A POSSESSED,\n      METAMORPHOSED, HUMAN FRAME. SHE IS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE.\n\n\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               99.\n129   CONTINUED:                                                  129\n\n      WITH HER EYES ROLLED UPWARD, HER SLASHED FACE AND HER BODY\n      PIERCED BY THE SHARDS OF GLASS, SHE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON, DEPRIVED\n      OF ANY HUMAN TRAITS. THE REAL ANNA DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOMENT     \n      SHE OPENED HER EYES AND RELEASED THE FORCES OF THE MIRROR.\n\n      Ben has no time to react before \"Anna\" charges at him.\n\n      He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as\n      much as he can.\n\n      HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN. MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC     \n      CONVULSION, HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST   \n      AND THE WORST EPILEPTIC FIT.                                       \n\n      Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. \"Anna\" spits     \n      blood in his face.\n\n      He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of\n      glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only\n      seems to provide her an intense pleasure...\n\n      \"Anna\" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep,\n      animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.\n\n      In an effortless movement, \"Anna\" pushes him away.\n\n      Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a\n      rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash\n      violently against the brick walls...\n\n      Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.\n\n      Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the\n      underground passageways.\n\n      On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He         \n      strives to regain consciousness...\n\n      Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but- \n\n      \"Anna\" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a\n      backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.\n\n      She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into\n      the wall.\n\n      With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless.     \n      He cannot see his assailant...\n\n      Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand           \n      struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.\n\n      Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. He grabs\n      it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at \"Anna\".\n\n      The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her.\n\n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               100.\n129   CONTINUED: (2)                                               129\n\n\n      Ben is being dragged. He manages to grab hold of one pipe after       \n      the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks\n      off from the wall, LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS.\n\n      Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel.\n\n      He struggles to get back on his feet-                                 \n\n      Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence\n      surrounds the subterranean passageways.\n\n      Ben makes out \"Anna's\" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas      \n      pipe.                                                                 \n\n      With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore-        \n      Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have             \n      replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to      \n      the creature, no matter what happens.                                 \n\n      He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands,      \n      towards what once was \"Anna\"...                                       \n\n      Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge.      \n      Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The       \n      creature thrusts itself against him-                                  \n\n      THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to          \n      keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.                               \n\n      In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES \"ANNA\" ON THE       \n      BROKEN GAS PIPE!                                                      \n\n      IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER            \n      STOMACH BUT-                                                          \n\n      Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems                \n      unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On       \n      the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the          \n      trap.                                                                 \n\n      Ben moves away, keeping an eye on \"Anna\". He takes his gun and        \n      aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he       \n      is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.                      \n\n      The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.                        \n\n      Ben stands by-                                                        \n\n      The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires-\n\n      THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. \"ANNA\" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.\n      THE FIRE SPREADS THROUGH THE TUNNELS.\n\n      Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                101.\n129   CONTINUED: (3)                                                129\n\n\n      SUDDENLY, IN A DOMINO EFFECT, ONE EXPLOSION FOLLOWS THE OTHER.

The brick walls begin to fall apart.\n\n      A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in.\n\n      Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs.\n\n      Totally burnt, flesh charred, \"Anna\" is enraged by her prey's\n      resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben.\n\n      Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls\n      collapse.\n\n      Ben runs as fast as he can.\n\n      \"Anna\" is coming closer to him, when suddenly -\n\n      JUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING\n      HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE.\n\n      Ben narrowly escaped the collapse. He reaches the staircase and\n      catches sight of the exit above when suddenly-\n\n      THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSES OVER HIM.\n\n      Ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the         \n      mirroring water surface DISAPPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE        \n      MIRROR.                                                              \n\n\n129A INT.
