Hey Harry, \n                         get rid of your grenades...\n\n               Laughter is returned from several of the American \n               contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all \n               of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the \n               seat.\n\n                                     SUSAN (OFF)\n                         Billy, what's the matter?\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         My passport!\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         No! \n\n               She bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He \n               grips her arm.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                              (low voice)\n                         Susan - forget it. Go get us a \n                         seat on the plane. Now.\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                              (picking up the \n                              real fear in his \n                              voice)\n                         What is it? . . . Billy?\n\n                                     BILLY\n                              (a fierce whisper, \n                              panic)\n                         For Christ's sake, just GET on the \n                         plane, okay!\n\n               His tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like \n               that.  A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now. \n               She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something \n               is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do \n               exactly as he says. And fast.  She moves OUT OF SHOT.\n\n               BILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his \n               finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work \n               the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under \n               the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers \n               are exiting. BUT THEN:\n\n               BILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle \n               Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely \n               Against the side of the kneecap.\n\n               PAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes \n               into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually \n               coming to rest on:\n\n               BILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his \n               sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his \n               hand. \"Just found it\" expression.\n\n               MOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything, \n               but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant-\n               types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand \n               and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed \n               under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the \n               rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus \n               with the others. All in silence.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two \n               lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table. \n               Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is \n               open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent \n               hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of \n               the passengers impatiently waiting.\n\n               TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table, \n               body-searching the male passengers alternately.\n\n               SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE \n               ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as \n               she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards \n               the ramp of the plane.\n\n               BILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male \n               PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag.  Glides \n               to the head of the line. MOVE TO:\n\n               The FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back \n               partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into \n               foreground as:\n\n               BILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two \n               other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER \n               who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is \n               busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces \n               the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already \n               been searched by the first officer,\n\n               Tension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp.\n\n               BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting.  \n               Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven.\n\n               BILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp.\n\n               TURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping \n               the ARM.\n\n                                     TURK (OFF)\n                         Just a minute!\n\n               BILLY his eyes flattening.\n\n               SUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting.\n\n               BILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND \n               OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the:\n\n               FIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them.\n\n                                     SECOND\n                         Nebu? Did you search him?\n\n                                     FIRST OFFICER\n                              (frowns)\n                         No!\n\n               SECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls \n               him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has \n               been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about \n               eighteen.\n\n                                     SECOND OFFICER\n                         (grunts a command, makes a gesture)\n\n               BILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms.  The OFFICER pats \n               him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely \n               in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he \n               doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips \n               and legs.\n\n               CLOSE BILLY eyes on the sky behind the OFFICER, praying \n               silently for a break.\n\n               TURKISH FINGERS moving up the inside of his legs, onto his \n               belly, touching the hard bulge below the navel. But again \n               not noticing.\n\n               BILLY in limbo, SOUND of his heartbeat.\n\n               SECOND OFFICER pausing, his fingers around Billy's chest, \n               about to let it go, then:\n\n               PLACES HIS HAND suddenly flat on Billy's heart.\n\n               OFFICER, sensing the accelerated Heartbeat, stares at:\n\n               BILLY whose eyes jump, startled by this technique.\n\n               FINGERS like excited spiders quickly run back up into the \n               armpit area.  STOP - right on the packets.\n\n               TURKISH EYES SWIVEL to BILLY EYES CLOSE. Frozen moment.  \n               Then, sudden blur of movement at the edge of frame.\n\n               SECOND OFFICER jumping back, grabbing his pistol from his \n               holster, crouching on one knee, aiming the gun barrel at \n               BILLY, hand shaking. He is terrified.\n\n                                     SECOND OFFICER\n                              (screaming)\n                         Bomb!  He's got a bomb!\n\n               AMERICAN PASSENGERS scream and the deck all around.\n\n                                     AMERICAN PASSENGER\n                         Bomb!  Bomb! \n\n               BILLY stands there, arms straight up in the air, eyes \n               clamped shut, trying not to breathe. CHORUS of rifle and \n               revolver CLICKS OFF as:\n\n               PULL BACK to OVERHEAD SHOT BILLY surrounded by thirty \n               SOLDIERS with rifles pointed at him from all directions, \n               crouched nervously. The PASSENGERS all huddled on the \n               ground.\n\n               BILLY, eyes closed. Edge of frame shows a shaky muzzle a \n               REVOLVER poked into his belly, moving up.\n\n               MOVE to THE FIRST OFFICER, older, more experienced but \n               scared, poking with the revolver; reaches in with his hand \n               cautiously, starts to pull up the turtleneck sweater. MOVE \n               with the hand, revealing the HASHISH PLAQUES around the \n               navel. A pause. His HAND draws the sweater higher.  More \n               PLAQUES.\n\n               FIRST OFFICER'S FACE relaxes. Starts to smile, finding it \n               funny. \n\n                                     FIRST OFFICER\n                              (yells out)\n                         It's hashish. just a smuggler.\n\n                                     SOLDIERS (OFF)\n                              (in chorus echo, \n                              relaxing, chuckling)\n                         Hashish...smuggler...hippy... \n\n               MASTER ANGLE SOLDIERS REGROUPING. PASSENGERS starting to \n               rise from the ground.  \n\n               SUSAN dumbfounded watching all this from the door of the \n               PLANE, starts back down the ramp. But a flow of upcoming \n               PASSENGERS slows her descent.\n\n               BILLY is led roughly by TWO SOLDIERS parallel to the plane \n               his hands on his head. He manages a glance at Susan. A \n               slight but strong movement of the head and eyes. 'No. Don't \n               come down the stairs'\n\n               SUSAN understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost \n               between two worlds. A silent shaping of a puzzled mouth.\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         ...Billy...?\n\n               She is washed back along in the flow of passengers.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               VIP ROOM AIRPORT LOUNGE.  The scene moves very fast, \n               Indicating A sense of chaos.  Much smoke.  Many phone calls. \n               Half A dozen Turkish police OFFICERS Are bizarrely seated \n               In A row of fold up chairs next to A desk. Chattering among \n               themselves (AD LIB) lighting their Turkish cigarettes. \n               They hardly pay attention as:\n\n               MOVE TO BILLY, scared, sweating - backlit by the huge \n               windows overlooking the airstrip. In background, we see \n               the 707 Pan American PLANE beginning to circle towards the \n               runway.  GUARDS have stripped him down to his bare chest \n               and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at \n               once. Then RIP the tape off.  BILLY winces.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE the room. Billy's luggage Is being Tossed.  \n               Clothes fly through the air. A sweatshirt; Marquette \n               University Rowing Team. A 35mm camera. A gift package for \n               his mother ripped open.  A silver Turkish kettle, clanging \n               To The floor. Another package is ripped open and a set of \n               Turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor. Very \n               fast.\n\n               BILLY watches, bewildered. He is stripped of the last plaque \n               in of the confusion is that each time another police officer\n\n               his navel. FOLLOW the plaque clattering onto the pile of \n               forty plaques.\n\n                                     FIRSTOFFICER (OFF)\n                         Name?\n\n                                     BILLY (OFF)\n                         William Hayes.\n\n               MOVE BACK QUICKLY to the OFFICER with notebook at the desk.  \n               Part of the confusion is that each time we see another \n               police officer we see he has another face.\n\n                                     FIRST OFFICER\n                         Vi...

The room is suddenly silent as we \n               TRACK him in, followed by a grinning civilian FLUNKY with \n               a big portable photo instrument and bulb.\n\n               THE FIRST OFFICER jumps up from the desk, makes an \n               obsequious salute to the SECOND OFFICER who arrogantly \n               acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the \n               desk. The FIRST OFFICER moves to the first fold-up chair \n               in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further \n               down. THIS OFFICER, in turn, shoves the next man down. It \n               goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the \n               last man in the row stands up against the wall. But this \n               is all in the background as:\n\n                                     SECOND OFFICER\n                         Name?\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         William Hayes.\n\n                                     SECOND OFFICER\n                         Vil...

He darts \n               a look at\n\n               POLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out.  Another \n               loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this--\n\n               THE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in, \n               obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER \n               jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately \n               move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's \n               hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy, \n               waves to the SECOND OFFICER.  THE CAMERAMAN in background \n               bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is \n               puzzled - what's going on?  His arm is grabbed and he is \n               swivelled around.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE - OVER CAMERAMAN\n\n               BILLY in the middle, flanked by SECOND and THIRD OFFICER, \n               grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders. \n               The FIRST OFFICER, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques \n               into Billy's hands, runs OUT OF FRAME. BILLY looks from \n               side to side. The SECOND OFFICER pats him hard on the back \n               of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. BILLY glances at \n               him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. Thinking \n               this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera.\n\n               CAMERAMAN disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece.\n\n                                     CAMERAMAN\n                         No.. He's smiling. Make him look \n                         miserable.\n\n               SECOND OFFICER slugs BILLY in the stomach with a quick \n               back-handed fist. BILLY groans, sinks to his knees. The \n               plaques fall on the floor.\n\n                                     FIRST OFFICER\n                              (running up)\n                         Gel?  Gel??\n\n               He growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up, \n               gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his \n               arms. The TWO OFFICERS put their arms back on Billy's \n               shoulders. BILLY, in pain, makes the proper expression of \n               misery.\n\n               FLASH!  The bulb goes.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               THE 707 PAN AMERICAN PLANE, destination New York, roars up \n               into the sky. PULL BACK all the way to BILLY sitting next \n               to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near \n               vomiting.  He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic \n               now; as he stares down at his boots. Then remembers \n               something! Surprised.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM. The Turkish OFFICERS talk AD LIB \n               among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders, \n               pointing to the hashish plaques, etc.  \n\n               In center background, we see BILLY submissively lifting \n               his arm for permission to speak,\n\n               THIRD OFFICER nods, approaches, followed by OTHERS.\n\n               BILLY slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his \n               boots, bangs it on the heel and two more PLAQUES clatter \n               to the floor.\n\n               TURKISH MOUTHS drop open.\n\n               BILLY finishes the process with the other boot. An awkward \n               silence OFF.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                              (trying to explain, \n                              innocent)\n                         I forgot...

Continued telephone calls. Much thick smoke \n               all over the room.\n\n               Another DOOR opens OFF.

The sort of \n               smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                              (to one of the guards)\n                         Name?\n\n                                     GUARD\n                              (checking a clipboard)\n                         Vilyum Hi-yes\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                              (looking at BILLY, \n                              repeating it)\n                         Vilyum Hi-yes...   \n\n               And slowly his hand moves up to caress the edge of his \n               hairless upper lip. An erotic gesture in Turkey.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                         Vilyum Hi-yes\n\n               \"Its in my memory locked.\"  He slowly extends his right \n               arm stiff out to his side.\n\n               BILLY watches, fascinated.\n\n               HAMIDOU lets the arm linger; then:\n\n               SMASHES BILLY across the face with an open palm. BILLY \n               shoots back: and smashes against the wall just from the \n               force of one blow.  Stunned.\n\n               HAMIDOU advances, taking a wooden CLUB (FALUKA STICK) about \n               feet three long and three inches wide from a GUARD.\n\n               BILLY scared, emphasizing the words, trying to make himself \n               understood.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         It was cold.

Cold!\n\n               THWACK!\n\n               BILLY'S LEG BUCKLES, where the faluka stick has just smashed \n               him behind the kneecap. He SCREAMS going down.\n\n               BILLY looks up from the floor:\n\n               HAMIDOU with his club in hand.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                              (In some sort of \n                              English, smiles)\n                         No do.

SCREAM.\n\n                                                              SHARP CUT:\n\n               BILLY is hoisted upside-down in his UNDERPANTS ONLY with \n               thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a \n               PULLEY suspended from the ceiling. He is yanked upwards, \n               then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders \n               banging against the stone floor.\n\n               THE PULLEY is LOCKED into place.  (LOUD SOUND)\n\n               BILLY has this surprised look on his face still, through \n               the tears.  What's happening? \n                \n\n               Hamidou motions the GUARDS out of the room (AD LIB).  Turns \n               back to BILLY, raises his club.\n\n               BRINGS IT DOWN FORCE on the soles of BILLY'S BARE FEET.  \n               SCREAM.  He cocks the club again.\n\n               BILLY twists To avoid The blow\n\n               CLUB catches him On The ANKLEBONE\n\n               BILLY SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The SOUND of \n               wood On bone.  Whimpering SOUNDS follow.\n\n               BILLY looking through teary eyes, sure now that he is going \n               to be killed. The CLUB - OFF - smacks sole skin with the \n               same force as the first blow. No let up.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               BILLY still in the same position, vomits all over himself.\n\n               HAMIDOU SPINS the PULLEY to a new position bringing:\n\n               BILLY into a steeper, more vertical position.  He is on \n               the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as:\n\n               HAMIDOU moves around in between his legs. Doing something \n               indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping \n               the stick. Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on \n               his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. But, \n               for Billy, it all BLURS OUT TO:\n\n               JAPANESE SILK SCREEN depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk, \n               fishing placidly by a stream. Then moves to soap carvings \n               of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with \n               astrological symbols paint; on it.

Cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news-\n               papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place.  No \n               guards are on the walls; the only GUARDS are unarmed \n               inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the \n               prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy \n               olive green uniforms and worn boots (they make $1 a month, \n               augmented by bribes).  On one side of the yard is a 2-story \n               ROGUS (cellblock) with barred windows from which Billy and \n               his two companions have just emerged.  On the other side \n               of the yard is another 2-story KOGUS (the children's kogus).\n\n               The COURTYARD is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8O \n               people in it - groups of exotically dressed AFRICANS, \n               AFGHANS, ARABS, MALAYSIANS, EUROPEANS, and predominantly \n               TURKS pacing back and forth talking in little circles, \n               hawking wares, trading illegal currencies.\n\n               Screaming Turkish STREET URCHINS 10-14 years old, share \n               the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising \n               viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing. A \n               bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game.\n\n               Other aspects of the prison which should become evident: \n               1) NOISE - continuous, Loud. Radios, Turkish music, \n               screaming, shouting.  2) CATS - all kinds, some of them \n               pets, some stray, tolerated because they kill the rats. 3) \n               THE PRISONERS all wear their own clothing; the foreigners \n               preferring jeans, clip-clops, sneakers, Sweat suits. 4) \n               THE HEADS of only the new prisoners are shaved, then allowed \n               to grow back. 5) MANY PRISONERS have physical disabilities. \n               Carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses. Boils on the \n               lymph glands around the neck, buttocks, under-arms, \n               sometimes SO painful the victim walks with his arms up in \n               the air.  Arthritic in the knees, hips, ankles. Fungus on \n               the feet.  Many limp.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PRISONERS glance at BILLY as he walks, \n               noting the beating he has taken and sizing him up, then \n               going on with their business.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         The kids?

He grabs ZIAT by the hair, hauls \n               him up and\n\n               LAUNCHES HIS KNEE into HIS FACE.\n\n               ZIAT thuds onto the floor.\n\n               BILLY stomps him in the gut hard.\n\n               ZIAT screams unnaturally shrill.\n\n               BILLY, driven by supernatural anger, now jumps on him and \n               CLAMPS HIS MOUTH right on ZIAT'S open SCREAM.\n\n               A STRUGGLING KISS ensues.\n\n               BILLY pulls back, his mouth filled with blood, spitting \n               out.\n\n               AN UNIDENTIFIED PIECE OF FLESH which Bits the ground with \n               an odd slow motion grace.\n\n               ZIAT - CLOSE in terror; throat cords rippling; eyes bulging \n               with disbelief, body quivering, mouth open and screaming, \n               but it is a SILENT SCREAM and the mouth is a dark hole \n               filled with blood and without a TONGUE.\n\n               BILLY, without a moment's mercy, crashes his fist into \n               ZIAT'S face.\n\n               ZIAT his strength now broken, collapses on his back.\n\n               BILLY crashes his fist again into the hated face. He is \n               GRABBED now by a GUARD, but:\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY shakes the GUARD OFF, then as ANOTHER \n               GUARD runs up, BILLY SLAMS him aside and, obsessed, lunges \n               back down on ZIAT and\n\n               BOTH HANDS CLAMPED TOGETHER high in the air delivers a \n               final blow to ZIAT'S face. The bones shatter. Pause. His \n               ogre unconscious beneath him, BILLY, now in SLOW MOTION, \n               EXTENDS HIS ARMS IN THE AIR - in the fighter's victory \n               gesture, and his eyes glow with the fever in them, and \n               with his mouth and face bloodied, he looks like a savage. \n               No longer Billy Hayes.\n\n                                                              SHARP CUT:\n\n               BILLY bound in a thick leather belt (a kiyis) which screws \n               tightly around the waist and cinches the hands together, \n               is being HAULED in continuing SLOW MOTION through a huge \n               DOOR somewhere in one of the cavernous corridors of the \n               prison.The door is approximately NINE FEET by SIX FEET, \n               strong and wooden with a circular iron handle which one of \n               the GUARDS now pulls open; a GLIMPSE of darkness within.\n\n               THE DOOR CLOSES. SUPERIMPOSE:\n\n                     SECTION 13 - ASYLUM FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE\n\n                                     A YEAR LATER \n\n               MAX, barely recognizable in a torn sheet and with a \n               blackened face, comes rushing into a crowded ROOM, screaming \n               louder than any other inmate. marks on his face, He is \n               enraged, blood dripping from scratch ATTENDANTS in white \n               smocks chase him over the beds. Max is yelling in Turkish.\n\n                                     MAX\n                         Please, will you listen to me?  \n                         Will someone please listen to me?  \n                         JUST LISTEN To ME!\n\n                                     ATTENDANTS\n                         Hamidou! Get Hamidou! Get the \n                         Kiyisl!\n\n               The ATTENDANTS wrestle with him, but he throws them off, \n               tearing around the room mindlessly. In the process we see \n               that not much attention is paid him because everybody else \n               is crazy!  There are 50 other LUNATICS yelling at each \n               other in fights over sheets, blankets, beds, cigarettes, \n               jumping: screaming, pushing, shoving; some babbling to \n               themselves, rocking, crying, chanting, singing.  Several \n               of them (the craziest) are stark naked. some, wrapped in \n               torn blackened sheets, patrol the room like quick ferrets, \n               sharp eyes open for anything they can steal. Others move \n               in meaningless, blank-eyed silence. The walls are filthy \n               black and join the ceilings in arches rather than angles, \n               giving the look of an old dungeon. Fifty beds are lined up \n               right next to each other so that you walk right into your \n               bed.  A constant nerve-racking NOISE. \n                \n               HAMIDOU bursts into the ROOM, the angry look in his eyes \n               spelling real trouble for Max. MOVE with him as he sweep \n               sin on MAX and picks him up with one move and SMASHES HIM \n               against the wall. Max hardly notices.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the leather kiyis from an \n               ATTENDANT, moves in on MAX and starts clamping it around \n               him.\n\n               AN ATTENDANT walks through the room with an apron containing \n               several large pockets bulging with red, green, blue, white \n               PILLS, which he distributes by the handful. \n               \n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                              (crying out)\n                         Hop! Hop!  Hop!  Full moon.  Hop!  \n                         Hop!  Hop!\n\n               THE LUNATICS gobble them up as if they were candy. In some \n               of the clustered areas, nine lunatics occupy as little as \n               three beds.\n\n               MAX is tightly bound now by HAMIDOU, but his body arches \n               against the bindings, his neck straining, his teeth snapping \n               at the air.  HAMIDOU grabs him with one hand by the leather \n               waist, hauls him high up in the air and \n                \n               THROWS MAX half-ways across the room, MAX smashing heavily \n               against some beds, continuing to SCREAM OFF as:\n\n               THE ATTENDANT with the pills-now bypasses BILLY on one of \n               the beds.\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         Hop!  Hop!  Full Moon - take your \n                         pills!\n\n               BILLY gobbles them up. He has changed. Lines in his face.\n\n               No smile, no sense of humor; a brooding silence about him, \n               a straight ahead look. He pays no attention to MAX off; he \n               is in grubby white pyjamas and shower sandals. Rolls back \n               onto hi& bed with its filthy torn sheet, totally ignoring \n               the surrounding commotion, and\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - turning onto his shoulder, BILLY suddenly \n               finds himself face to face with a dark saddened visage. \n               The MAN is very young and stark naked but for an old black \n               rag wrapped around his head and clutched under his chin. \n               His eyes are yellow, the voice pleading.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Cigare?\n                              (pause, same tone, \n                              holds out his palm)\n                         Cigare? Cigare?\n\n               BILLY shakes his head sharply --too sharply --and barks, \n               irritable.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         Go away! \n\n               Turns on his other shoulder, trying to sleep.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN (OFF)\n                         Cigare? Cigare?\n\n               YOUNG MAN in a surprisingly meek tone.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         S'il Vous plait, Monsieur? S'il \n                         vous plait?\n\n               BILLY, really aggravated now, springs up from the bed, and \n               in the quirky way the mad and the eccentric adopt walks \n               determinedly away from the young man, looking back to shake \n               his head bizarrely at him one more time.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               BILLY walking down the aisle bypasses MAX int he kiyis, \n               rolling on the floor, still screaming in Turkish.\n\n                                     MAX\n                         Will you listen to me? PLEASE LISTEN \n                         TO ME!  \n\n               Several LUNATICS are gathered around tormenting him, one \n               of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber; \n               another is playing with his ass. A third one, also in a \n               leather kiyis, is leaning over MAX jabbering and drooling \n               into his face.\n\n               MAX, more enraged by this than the other bodily offences, \n               lunges up sharply and bites the man's FACE. SCREAMS, etc.\n\n               BILLY, paying no attention except for a brief disinterested \n               glance, keeps going into:\n\n               A SECOND ROOM.  MORE  LUNATICS. A screaming OLD MAN is \n               chasing after another OLD MAN who has stolen his tespe \n               beads, waving them back at the first old man who howls \n               with rage, frantic to have his beads back. The second old \n               man throws the beads to a THIRD OLD MAN who hops across \n               the beds with the FIRST OLD MAN chasing him. BILLY \n               intersects.\n\n                                     OLD MAN\n                              (pleading)\n                         Allah!  Allah!  Yok!  Yok!  Yok!  \n                         Brack!\n\n                \n               A LITTLE NERVOUS MAN stares into a broken pocket mirror \n               fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye, trying \n               to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous \n               motion.\n\n               TWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a \n               newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out \n               the paper.\n\n               CHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of \n               movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left-\n               overs. AD LIB curses, yells.\n\n               AN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed.\n\n                                     OLD MAN\n                         Hey American.  Fik!  Fick!  Come.  \n                         Fik!  Fik!\n\n               His blackened teeth leer.\n\n               BILLY, seemingly immune to all of this in some private \n               island of his own madness, walks in his determined way \n               past a PARTITION to:\n\n               A CIRCULAR STONE STAIRCASE leading downwards, the stones \n               damp, dark, slippery. BILLY continues with the same straight-\n               ahead determination to:\n\n               A LONER LEVEL. at last BILLY's expression changes to almost \n               childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks \n               the relative comfort and silence of THE WHEEL.  \n\n               It is a grim, squat PILLAR dominating the room and bearing \n               the weight of the ceiling. And around it some SIXTY LUNATICS \n               trudge slowly, near silently, in counter-clockwise flow. \n               It is a hypnotic shuffle and BILLY blends right in, sliding \n               easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging \n               loosely on the floor, watching:\n\n               THE SOOTHING RHYTHM OF FEET shuffling at a comforting pace.  \n               These are the spokes of the wheel.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               TWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint, eerie illumination \n               to the chamber. One one side, a pot-bellied stove flickers, \n               etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange \n               glow.\n\n               SOME LUNATICS, not walking, hover around the stove.  OTHERS \n               are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that runs \n               the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered \n               with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks.  \n               But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. They \n               are the lowest order of madmen. They have no minds left. \n               They are the damned.\n\n               BILLY walks among them, expressionless. A tall, thin \n               cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up \n               alongside BILLY, looks at him, walks with him. is about \n               fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane \n               than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his \n               wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it \n               have been pulled out. He speaks with a cultured English \n               accent.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                         You're an American?\n\n               BILLY is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground.  \n               AHMET doesn't wait for an answer.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                         Ah yes, America!  My name is Ahmet.  \n                         I studied philosophy at Harvard \n                         for many many years. But actually \n                         Oxford is my real Alma  Mata -   \n                         I've also studied in Vienna. Now I \n                         study here.\n\n               BILLY doesn't notice, shuffles along.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                         ...They put me here. They say I \n                         raped a little boy. I have been \n                         here very long time. They will \n                         never let me go.\n\n               BILLY pays no attention, keeps shuffling on.  Glances at \n               him, smiles.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                         They won't let YOU go either.\n\n               The smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep \n               inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic \n               who is smiling. Billy looks back at his feet.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                         No, they'll never let you go.  \n                         They tell you they let you go but \n                         you stay. You never go from here.\n\n               BILLY plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation \n               like a father lecturing a child.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                         You see we all come from a factory. \n                         Sometimes the factory makes bad \n                         machines that don't work. They put \n                         them here. The bad machines don't \n                         know they're bad machines, but the \n                         people at the factory know. They \n                         know one of the machines that \n                         doesn't work...\n\n               They walk on.  Ahmet's expression changes.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                              (polite)\n                         I think we have spoken enough for \n                         today.  I say good night to you.\n\n               He wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we \n               FOLLOW him out of the circle. He drops to his hands and \n               knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy \n               blackness under the L-shaped wooden platform, disappearing \n               like a cockroach.\n\n               BILLY plods on.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               AN OLD WHITE-BEARDED MADMAN the Hoja, grandiose in his \n               rags, leads MUSLIM PRAYER in the first ROOM. Some of his \n               followers have prayer mats, others a scrap of sheet or \n               newspaper; their tones discordant, still pushing and shoving \n               at each other during the prayer.\n\n               TWO SPASTICS can't follow the routine of kneeling and \n               bending; they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in \n               a ball of arms and legs.\n\n               A FALAKA STICK pokes BILLY wake SOUND of the CHANTING fills \n               room. It is evidently impossible to distinguish night from \n               day because there are no windows.\n\n               ATTENDANTS poke the LUNATICS awake with their \"clubs.\n\n                                     ATTENDANTS\n                         Head count!

Attendants \n               take a redundant and comic head count. The place sounds \n               like a \"yadi yadi room\" the noise fearsome.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n                                     ATTENDANT #1\n                         Sixty two, sixty three, sixty \n                         four....\n\n                                     ATTENDANT #2\n                         Seventy four, seventy five, seventy \n                         six.. .get back there, you! . . . \n                         seventy five, seventy six....)\n\n               ATTENDANTS poke around underneath a bed and pull out a \n               very old trembling VEGETABLE.\n\n               OTHER ATTENDANTS wrap an old DEAD LUNATIC with no teeth \n               and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him \n               away.\n\n               BILLY amid the LUNATICS.  We MOVE closer and closer to \n               him, the head COUNT regressing. The room has become a \n               torture cell - the NOISE LOUDER, LOUDER, closing in on \n               Billy.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               BILLY is led down a CORRIDOR by HAMIDOU into:\n\n               A VISITING room - Cabins are lined up like narrow wooden \n               phone booths.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                         Kabin on-yedi\n\n               BILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes \n               the door, sits in the chair. No one is there. He waits -\n               indifferent to any sense of time. Dirty two glass panes \n               separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the \n               panes.  An erratic microphone is the method of \n               communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the \n               voice.\n\n               HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks \n               in unseen as:\n\n               TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in \n               holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for \n               her to react, and then her face shows the shock.\n\n               BILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he \n               remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is \n               a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at \n               once. His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp \n               it.\n\n                                     SUSAN (OFF)\n                         Oh my God...!\n\n               SUSAN \n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         Billy, what have they done to \n                         you...my God!\n\n               The MICROPHONE makes her voice jarring, gagged. She looks \n               silently.  No sobbing, no big sad looks. Just shock.  Shock \n               of recognition, shock of time gone by.\n\n               BILLY looking at her, his eyes moving down to:\n\n               BILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN, her neck, her breasts straining \n               against the thin shirt.\n\n               SUSAN fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and \n               distinct; not sure she is communicating.\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         ...Billy, your family is fine.  \n                         Senator Buckley just made a special \n                         plea on your behalf in the Senate.  \n                         Newsday has written several big \n                         articles about you.

It sounds all wrong in this context.\n\n               BILLY is still staring at her breasts. He hasn't seen a \n               woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes \n               into his eyes He moves suddenly pressing up against the \n               glass, rabid.  And in Turkish:\n\n                                     BILLY\n                              (in Turkish)\n                         Take it off.

With both hands on \n               the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart.\n\n               BILLY going wild! Against the window. His hand down in his \n               pyjamas.\n\n               HER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a \n               deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and \n               loose.  FULL SCREEN\n\n               BILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN.\n\n               BILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly.\n\n               SUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity.\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         Oh Billy, Billy, I wish I could \n                         make it better for you.

Fear.\n\n               BILLY tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants, \n               slumps against the window.\n\n               SUSAN realizes he has come, surprised.\n\n               BILLY looks at her. Furtive, animal shame. And suddenly he \n               starts to cry. A flood of feelings locked up too long come \n               pouring out. He murmurs some words, Turkish SOUNDS \n               sputtering out in his throat, then:\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         S....

Grabs the PHOTO ALBUM with all her \n               strength, holding it up for him to see through the \n               glass.Then remembering herself, looks around the room to \n               make sure they're alone and in a contained voice:\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         Billy, your father gave me this \n                         for you.

He bought \n                         a ticket.\n\n               BILLY looks from the album to Susan. Possibly there is a \n               gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint. \n               An Attendant BANGS on Susan's door, OFF.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Visiting is over.\n\n               SUSAN quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden \n               weapon.\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         I'll give it to them for you.\n\n               She buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried, on Billy.\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                         You were right Billy don't count \n                         on them, you hear, don't count on \n                         anybody but yourself! \n                         \n\n               The ATTENDANT now swings open her door, annoyed.\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         Let's go!\n\n               Susan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to \n               the bars, hard and practical.\n\n                                     SUSAN\n                              (quickly)\n                         If you stay you'll die Billy!

She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't \n               think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned.\n\n               BILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door.  \n               A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy \n               towards\n\n               A BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under her \n               arm. The door closes.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               BILLY, with the same deadened expression as before, comes \n               down the STAIRS towards THE WHEEL. It is early morning and \n               the walkers haven't started yet. Billy looks at the Pillar \n               a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. Then he \n               starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the \n               normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               BILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are \n               walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for \n               him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking.\n\n               BILLY intersects several more LUNATICS going counter-\n               clockwise They motion for him to turn.\n\n                                     LUNATIC\n                              (grunting)\n                         Gower! \n\n               Tries to block Billy's way, but BILLY shakes his head, \n               brushes by him - determined.  \n               \n\n               AHMET Slides up next to BILLY in his rags.\n\n                                     AHMET\n                         Good morning, my American friend!  \n                         There will be trouble if you go \n                         this way. A good Turk always walks \n                         to the right. Left is communist.  \n                         Right is good. You must go the \n                         other way... It's Good.  \n                         \n\n               More LUNATICS join the flow, gesturing or grunting at BILLY.\n\n               BILLY STOPS, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in \n               the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he \n               walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs.\n\n               AHMET curious about his unusual behavior, follows BILLY.  \n\n                                     AHMET\n                         Why you go?

Later on you'll \n                         know.\n\n               BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET.  His eyes glint \n               with special knowledge and he takes AHMET into his \n               confidence using the latter's tone of voice:\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         I already know. I know that you're \n                         a bad machine.  That's why the \n                         factory keeps you here.\n                              (Lowers s voice)\n                         You know how I know?

He shuffles away.\n\n               BILLY looks at him and turns up the STAIRS.\n\n                                                                    CUT:\n\n               BILLY in his BED. The usual UPROAR. THE ATTENDANT comes by \n               with the pills, offers a handful to BILLY.\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         Hop!  Hop!  Take!\n\n               He takes them, puts a few into his mouth, swallows.  \n               Reflective, unsure.  A RADIO playing OFF blares suddenly \n               with the U.S. Armed Forces Station - JANIS JOPLIN singing \n               \"Take another piece of my heat now, Baby\" then it's switched \n               back to a TURKISH STATION, loud. Billy rises.\n\n               BILLY enters the TOILET with the PHOTO ALBUM tightly \n               clutched under his arm. A dark stone room, very shadowy. \n               Piles of waste on the floor. A vacant-eyed barefoot LUNATIC \n               shuffles past BILLY who goes to one of the four partitioned \n               HOLES cut into the floor.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY squats over it and with his filthy \n               long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the \n               album Susan gave him. Flickering shadows. He looks up \n               absently.\n\n               THREE LUNATIC FACES stare in at him through wooden slats, \n               tongues hanging out and drooling - playing with themselves - \n               OFF.\n\n               BILLY makes a lunatic face and SCREAM kicking at the \n               partition.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! \n\n               THE LUNATICS, petrified, scatter off but ONE LUNATIC skids \n               in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling.\n\n               BILLY slits open the binder to reveal TEN HUNDRED DOLLAR \n               BILLS with Pictures of Mr. Franklin' neatly inserted.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               BILLY has no particular expression on his face.  Reflective, \n               staring at the money; he looks up.\n\n               A LARGE SILHOUETTE is moving towards him.\n\n               BILLY just watches, transfixed, not trying to hide the \n               money.\n\n               HAMIDOU comes into a faint light, looking down at him; \n               glances at the money. Shakes his head gently.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                         No do!  No do! \n\n               Reaches for and:\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - HAMIDOU takes the money from BILLY like \n               candy from a baby, then takes him by the ear and slowly \n               lifts him up.  Billy is like a vegetable in his hands.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                              (in his broken \n                              English)\n                         I tell you I see 'gain...\n                              (into Turkish)\n                         I take you down to bath and your \n                         feet be big like...Breasts\n                              (a gesture)\n\n               HAMIDOU leads BILLY roughly out of the lunatic room, pulling \n               him by the ear.\n\n               HAMIDOU still Pulling BILLY by the ear, guides him through \n               the GUARD QUARTERS.\n\n               HAMIDOU leads him up a narrow winding flight of STAIRS.\n\n                                     HAMIDO\n                         First you make mistake with Ziat, \n                         now you make mistake with money.  \n                         You're not a new Prisoner, Vilyum \n                         Hi-yes.\n\n               The tone of his voice indicates a severe reckoning this \n               time.\n\n               HAMIDOU pulls BILLY by the ear into a large echoing BATH.\n\n               BILLY looking, bent over by the ear - a hint of awareness \n               of new surroundings.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - the BATH is deserted, spooky with greenish \n               Yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling \n               around damp mossy arches. Steam rises off a bath.  Benches, \n               buckets of water.  HAMIDOU swings BILLY around until he is \n               facing him. \n\n               HAMIDOU makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his \n               falaka stick and holstered gun; he will use his hands.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                              (shakes his head)\n                         You've been in prison too long, \n                         Vilyum Hi-yes.\n\n               He takes that: stiff arm all the way back to its full arc \n               and WHACKS BILLY up against the wall.\n\n               BILLY bounces back off the wall. The print of Hamidou's \n               fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the \n               redness of his left cheek. SLAM -  a backhanded whack. \n                \n               BILLY bounces right back from the wall. steadies him.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                         You go crazy here Vilyum Hi-yes. \n                         Many people go crazy here. Best \n                         thing for crazy people is this...\n\n               THE BLOW, in SLOW MOTION comes sailing into:\n\n               BILLY, and we see the brief boxer's distortion of all his \n               face as he flies upwards and back into:\n\n               THE BENCH smashing it. Echo like jarring F.X.\n\n               BILLY is held up by the PAJAMAS, steadied. The Turkish \n               words seem far away, incomprehensible.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU (OFF)\n                         Vilyum Hi-yes.

HAMIDOU \n               suddenly shifts position and snaps Billy into a strenuous \n               wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. He \n               loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back.\n\n               HAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited.\n\n                                     HAMIDOU\n                         ...And I fuck your grandmother and \n                         I fuck your pretty girlfriend... \n                         And I fuck you Hi-yes!)\n\n               A bizarre otherworldly scene. This man is dredging Billy \n               through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the \n               sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam \n               bath as a bedroom. He loosens his hold abruptly, rises, \n               moves off as:\n\n               BILLY holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest, \n               gasping for breath, about to vomit. Pause; he looks up \n               horrified at: \n\n               HAMIDOU pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor.  \n               SSSSSSSSSS!  The awakened STEAM coils like a snake into \n               every cranny of the little room.\n\n               BLURRED VISUALS - HAMIDOU stripping his shirt off. A huge \n               muscular flash of chest,\n\n               A BELT being snapped open.\n\n               BILLY waiting.\n\n               A FIGURE moving through the steam, closer.\n\n               BILLY backing away from it.\n\n               STEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through.  HAMIDOU - his \n               eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun \n               cutting haze. Then disappear again.\n\n               BILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse.  Then \n               very suddenly:\n\n               A HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the \n               hair.  A GRUNT, OFF.\n\n               BILLY his eyes moving fast.\n\n               A FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting \n               forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from \n               the rest of the body.\n\n               A SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it \n               jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then:  \n                \n               BILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation \n               distorting his features and: \n                \n               STEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION \n               and:\n\n               SMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP.\n\n               BLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE - \n               surprise, pain...\n\n               BILLY MOVING.\n\n               A FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again \n               with the genitals. Another SCREAM.\n\n               A BODY hitting the tiles.\n\n               BILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it. \n                \n               A STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming \n               now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another \n               thwack!  The steam seems to clear and\n\n               BILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with \n               the falaka stick with all his might. \n                \n               HAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding.\n\n               His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and \n               strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face, \n               such is the force of this creature but continues to beat \n               him, harder, harder.  His expression filled with a life \n               energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost.  \n               Again, Again -\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         Babba sikijam, Hamidu!

Again \n               he tries, and now shoots off.\n\n               THE CAB Roars past the roadblock.\n\n               THE COPS AND SOLDIER, scattered by the shots, now scream \n               at each other. They run.  SHOTS are fired.\n\n               BILLY guns the cab down the road, flying.\n\n               CLOUDS OF DUST trail the cab.\n\n               THE TANK starts to roll after it. Full speed. The HALFTRACK \n               follows, the MEN riding it shouting.\n\n               BILLY looks back, then looking ahead sees something.\n\n               P.O.V - a speck in the far distance. Another ROADBLOCK.\n\n               BILLY decides, then - \n\n               THE CAB swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently \n               rolling FIELD on the border of the road, pock marked with \n               HILLS.\n\n               THE TURKS come roaring down the road, pointing to the cab.\n\n               LOW ANGLE - the TANK makes a flat out stop, gears grinding.\n\n               THE GUN TURRET swings left.\n\n               THE CAB in the far distance, at an angle to the tank, starts \n               running up an incline.\n\n               THE TANK FIRES.\n\n               P.O.V. - SHELL BLASTS WIDE OF THE CAB. \n\n               BILLY, startled, looks back, guns for the top of the \n               incline.\n\n               HIS P.O.V. - ANOTHER SHELL now blasts to his front right, \n               closer.

BULLETS \n               whistle and pop nearby.\n\n               BILLY running. He tears off his jacket.\n\n               SOLDIERS pass the wrecked car, at the top of the incline \n               shouting, pointing and firing at\n\n               BILLY in the distance.\n\n               ONE SOLDIER seems lighter than the others and takes off in \n               a sprint as the OTHERS follow.\n\n               THE HALFTRACK now crests the incline and gathering full \n               gear and momentum, roars off down the slope after Billy.\n\n               CLOSE BILLY running sweat all over him. In background, the \n               HALFTRACK and running FIGURES.\n\n               BILLY runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun starting \n               to set ahead of him in the Greek mountains.\n\n               MOUNTAINS - must make those mountains.\n\n               BILLY running all out - eyes fixed on them, breathing, \n               skipping heartbeats.\n\n               THE PERSONNEL CARRIER bypasses the FAST SOLDIER who slows \n               down, panting. Billy has outrun him.\n\n               OTHER SOLDIERS run up in the distance.\n\n               BILLY, tireless, obsessed, runs right into a POPPY FIELD.It \n               is a splendid beautiful scarlet red, set off by the dipping \n               rays of the sun.\n\n               HIS FEET smashing down the poppy plants.  Fast - THUCK!  \n               THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!

They have him.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE the HALFTRACK closing the distance on BILLY \n               now thirty yards apart.\n\n               BILLY looking back, starting to fade. Huge wheezing gasps \n               of breath.\n\n               SOLDIERS running up looking at \n\n               THE HALFTRACK in the distance.\n\n               SOLDIERS yell.\n\n                                     SOLDIERS\n                         Minefield!

Confused. Turns bout back to yell something \n               and:\n\n               ENORMOUS EXPLOSION The HALFTRACK disintegrates in a tank \n               landmine.\n\n               BILLY thrown to the ground by the force of the blast, looks \n               back, GASPS!\n\n               A BURNING WRECKAGE. Black spirals of smoke.  Secondary \n               explosions.\n\n               BILLY stumbles up. A gash of blood is on his temple but he \n               doesn't know it or feel it such is his stress. He runs on, \n               SHOTS whistling towards him from the poppy field.\n\n               TURKISH OFFICER screaming angrily at Billy, cursing, shaking \n               his fist at the sky.\n\n               BILLY, in the forest, is totally out of breath and out of \n               eyesight of the pursuers. He stops against a tree.  FROG \n               SOUNDS. The gurgle of water. Muddy ground. He looks:\n\n               THE MARITAS RIVER rushing ahead. A strong current.\n\n               BILLY peels off all his clothing except his pants, not \n               delaying one more moment. He feels he must keep going. And \n               he's right. DOGS are barking OFF.\n\n               A SNARLING ATTACK DOG is tearing through the minefield, \n               fast, ahead of the others.\n\n               BILLY looks, sees it.\n\n               THIRTY YARDS - the huge DOG coming right at him!\n\n               BILLY runs for the edge of the bank and plunges in.\n\n               THE ATTACK DOG sprints up to the edge of the river bank \n               and without a moment's hesitation, plunges right in after \n               him.\n\n               BILLY lashing into the current with a fierce breast stroke, \n               is swept downstream kicking futilely.\n\n               THE DOG, its jaws open and clacking, is also swept down \n               river.\n\n               BILLY going under, coming back up - fighting, still \n               fighting.\n\n               THE DOG struggling sails past as\n\n               BILLY hauls himself out of the river, going in a circle, \n               dizzy. Falls. Struggles up again. Looks back. Must keep \n               going. Must.\n\n               THE BASE OF' MOUNTAIN - hilly, rugged.\n\n               BILLY runs, drags, runs again.  He is a lamentable sight - \n               naked except for ripped wet pants, barefoot, bleeding, \n               muddied.  Dimly he makes out:\n\n               A FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT. Some cows, goats, chickens. NO \n               sign of people.\n\n               BILLY staggers towards it. Wears something. A rooting SOUND.  \n               Stops. Something familiar about it.\n\n               A FAMILY OF PIGS snort and root in the mud, little piglets \n               running around.\n\n               BILLY staggers towards them, muttering to himself.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         Pigs...!  Pigs...! \n\n               Then yells in the recognition of it\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         Pigs... You... Beautiful... \n\n               BILLY BILLY falls to his knees in the confined pen; the \n               pigs run around squealing. Trying to reach out for one of \n               them, he falls face first into the mud and lies there. \n               Pause.  A wooden DOOR squeaks open OFF. BILLY slowly turns \n               his muddy eyes over his shoulder.\n\n               BILLY P.O.V. - TWO SOLDIERS, khaki-colored uniforms, \n               helmets, olive faces, mustaches, approach cautiously from \n               the farmhouse, rifles ready.  Following them is an OLD \n               FARMER, Further behind in the doorway is his WIFE and \n               CHILDREN.\n\n               BILLY muttering to himself, in Turkish.\n\n                                     BILLY\n                         Greek?...  Greek?... \n\n               THE SOLDIERS approach close, stand above this strange \n               figure, look at each other.\n\n                                     SOLDIER\n                         Ti leei?\n                         (What is he saying?)\n\n                                     2ND SOLDIER\n                         Mou fainetai san Toupkika\n                         (It sounded like Turkish) \n\n               BILLY with dimming strength.\n\n               BILLY\n\n               THE FARMER understands, makes a vigorous nod of his head.\n\n                                     FARMER\n                         Malisee...Ellada! \n                         (Ah, yes...

Curiosity. \n               Recognition. Shock. Love.\n\n               And then they move. But we don't hear their movements. It \n               is SOUNDLESS reunion; the SISTER running out first in SLOW \n               MOTION, the MOTHER following last, crying; the GRANDMOTHER \n               too infirm to move, the shaking her head from side to side \n               in SLOW MOTION, her tears lost somewhere in the wrinkles \n               of her face. \n\n               BILLY surrounded by FAMILY - SLOW MOTION - SOUNDLESS.  His \n               eyes flooding. All the feelings in him.
