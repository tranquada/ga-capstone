BATHROOM, YORK HOUSE, LONDON - DAY (MID-1930'S)              1\r\n\r\n    A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free\r\n    standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs -\r\n    bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's \"Trumpet\r\n    Volunteer\".\r\n\r\n    A head emerges.\r\n\r\n    White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing\r\n    naked wet body in white towels.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   INT.    DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY                        2\r\n\r\n    The ritual continues with crisp military precision.\r\n\r\n    CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and\r\n    unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp,\r\n    thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and\r\n    Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown.\r\n\r\n    This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white\r\n    shirt.\r\n\r\n    Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet\r\n    and gartered legs to be inserted.\r\n\r\n    Mirror-polished boots are laced tight.\r\n\r\n    Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received.\r\n\r\n    Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling\r\n    field of ribbons and medallions.\r\n\r\n    Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted.\r\n\r\n    Polished buttons are fastened.\r\n\r\n    Multi-coloured collar clasped shut.\r\n\r\n    White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed\r\n    and placed upon brilliantined hair.\r\n\r\n    PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known\r\n    to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second\r\n    son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a\r\n    sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which\r\n    he's been bedecked.\r\n\r\n    Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:\r\n           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BERTIE\r\n                   You look like a Christmas tree.\r\n\r\n    He smiles wanly.\r\n\r\n\r\n3   EXT.    INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY            3\r\n\r\n    THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill.\r\n\r\n    Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess.\r\n\r\n    Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH -\r\n    considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land,\r\n    truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from\r\n    all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously,\r\n    creating a happy chaos.\r\n\r\n    Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave.\r\n\r\n    Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and\r\n    four, wave back from their nursery window.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   INT/EXT.

The BBC said it wouldn't\r\n                   rain.\r\n\r\n    BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators,\r\n    prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs,\r\n    agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry\r\n    placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of\r\n    the day.\r\n\r\n    A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose\r\n    spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants.\r\n\r\n    REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back.\r\n\r\n    The first drops splatter against the glass.      Elizabeth sighs.\r\n\r\n                             ELIZABETH (CONT'D)\r\n                   Never trust the wireless.\r\n\r\n    Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour,\r\n    which segues into a GARGLING sound.\r\n           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     4.\r\n\r\n\r\n5   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                                5\r\n\r\n    A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling\r\n    while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the\r\n    ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He\r\n    expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth\r\n    fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an\r\n    atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb,\r\n    and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the\r\n    control room.\r\n\r\n    The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three...\r\n    two...\r\n\r\n                             BBC NEWS READER\r\n                   Ladies and Gentlemen: good afternoon. This\r\n                   is the BBC National and World Programmes\r\n                   taking you to Wembley Stadium.\r\n\r\n    He speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones.    There's no higher\r\n    creature in the vocal world.\r\n\r\n\r\n6   EXT.    WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY                                        6\r\n\r\n    ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas\r\n    hiding the spectators from view.\r\n\r\n    Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded\r\n    chairs with the other dignitaries. They are:\r\n\r\n    KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and\r\n    uniform, accompanied by his wife.\r\n\r\n    QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame.\r\n\r\n    DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed,\r\n    balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority.\r\n\r\n    WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is\r\n    lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition.\r\n\r\n    STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed.\r\n    His hair, as always, parted down the middle.\r\n\r\n    NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin,\r\n    lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk.\r\n\r\n    A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on\r\n    springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening,\r\n    even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a\r\n    blow. Elizabeth sees his terror.\r\n           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  5.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ELIZABETH\r\n                   Why wasn't he told?\r\n\r\n                             COSMO LANG\r\n                   Ten million people listening around the\r\n                   world, Mam. Possibly more.\r\n                       (as though Bertie didn't\r\n                        exist)\r\n                   His brother, and father, have been\r\n                   broadcasting since last year.\r\n\r\n    The King, growing impatient, hisses:\r\n\r\n                             KING GEORGE V\r\n                   Get on with it. Show what you're made of!\r\n\r\n    Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of\r\n    confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots,\r\n    chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.\r\n\r\n                             BERTIE\r\n                   Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.\r\n\r\n    It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter.\r\n    A man who cannot speak in public.\r\n\r\n    Lang whispers to Churchill.    When Lang whispers, everyone can\r\n    hear.\r\n\r\n                             COSMO LANG\r\n                   I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage\r\n                   for all the world. And on such an important\r\n                   occasion.\r\n\r\n    Lang really is a piece of work.\r\n\r\n    For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this\r\n    point on in the script.\r\n\r\n                             BERTIE\r\n                   No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was\r\n                   standing before you today.\r\n\r\n    POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas. No response. This is going\r\n    to be a torment for him, and his audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n7   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                             7\r\n\r\n    A glowing dial on the face of a studio radio.

He\r\n     knows he's considered by all, especially himself, unfit for\r\n     public life.\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth is devastated.\r\n\r\n                              KING GEORGE V\r\n                    Just needs more practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n9    EXT.

RECEPTION ROOM, LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY     10\r\n\r\n     Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all.\r\n\r\n     The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat\r\n     decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her\r\n     features.\r\n\r\n     She waits. Coughs.    No response.    Calls imperiously:\r\n\r\n                              ELIZABETH\r\n                    Are you there?\r\n\r\n     From behind a door:\r\n\r\n                              LIONEL (O.S.)\r\n                    In the lav.\r\n\r\n     Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's\r\n     further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed,\r\n     and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his\r\n     forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His\r\n     demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although\r\n     Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.\r\n    TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                        7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LIONEL (CONT'D)\r\n            \"How poor are they that have not patience!\r\n            What wound did ever heal but by degrees?\"\r\n\r\n                          ELIZABETH\r\n            Pardon?\r\n\r\n                      LIONEL\r\n            Iago...world's greatest villain.

His\r\n            position requires public speaking upon\r\n            occasion. A torment.

His Majesty: King\r\n             George the Fifth.\r\n\r\n                       KING GEORGE V\r\n                 (to the mike)\r\n             \"I can only say to you, my very very dear\r\n             people, that the Queen and I thank you from\r\n             the depths of our hearts for all the\r\n             loyalty and - may I say so? - the love with\r\n             which this day and always you have\r\n             surrounded us.

BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT                                18\r\n\r\n     The edge of the crowd is visible. One can sense a vast sea of\r\n     humanity. When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the\r\n     murmur becomes a ROAR. When the King steps out, it becomes\r\n     tumultuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n19   EXT.   BALCONY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS                  19\r\n\r\n     The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of\r\n     Canterbury, other Royals, and dignitaries. The noise is\r\n     deafening. The King beckons impatiently for someone still\r\n     inside to join them. It's Bertie, with Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n                            BERTIE\r\n                  They didn't come to see us, Father.\r\n\r\n                             KING GEORGE V\r\n                  Pretend.\r\n\r\n                            BERTIE\r\n                  Where's David?\r\n\r\n                             KING GEORGE V\r\n                  Bedding his American whore.

Elizabeth is stunned at the\r\n     prospect.\r\n\r\n     The ROAR of the crowd segues into the ROAR of machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n20   INT.   MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY                                20\r\n\r\n     Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral. WORKERS are lined up\r\n     dutifully to hear the visiting Royal. Bertie's lips move, but\r\n     with the noise he cannot be heard. Elizabeth watches in relief.\r\n\r\n     Then a FOREMAN, trying to be helpful, signals.     The machinery\r\n     halts, the factory falls silent.\r\n        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     18.\r\n\r\n\r\n     At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries\r\n     Bertie forward.\r\n\r\n                            BERTIE\r\n                  What's needed is cooperation...\r\n\r\n     Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory\r\n     brings Bertie's stutter back in full form.\r\n\r\n                            BERTIE (CONT'D)\r\n                  ...buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses...\r\n\r\n     One of the workers sullenly pulls a chain, releasing a blast\r\n     from a steam whistle that drowns Bertie out.\r\n\r\n\r\n21   EXT.

LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                        24\r\n\r\n     A totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A\r\n     world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two\r\n     slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish\r\n     rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging\r\n     from the ceiling. Recording apparatus.

For the second time in the\r\n                  lives of most of us we are at war. For we\r\n                  are called, with our allies, to meet the\r\n                  challenge of a principle which, if it were\r\n                  to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized\r\n                  order in the world. It is the principle\r\n                  which permits a State, in the selfish\r\n                  pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties\r\n                  and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the\r\n                  use of force, or threat of force, against\r\n                  the sovereignty and independence of other\r\n                  States. Such a principle, stripped of all\r\n                  disguise, is surely the mere primitive\r\n                  doctrine that might is right, and if this\r\n                  principle were established throughout the\r\n                  world, the freedom of our own country and\r\n                  of the whole British Commonwealth of\r\n                  Nations would be in danger.\r\n                            (MORE)\r\n       TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     113.\r\n\r\n                            BERTIE (V.O.

It is to this high\r\n                  purpose that I now call my people at home\r\n                  and my peoples across the seas, who will\r\n                  make our cause their own. I ask them to\r\n                  stand calm, firm, and united in this time\r\n                  of trial. The task will be hard. There may\r\n                  be dark days ahead, and war can no longer\r\n                  be confined to the battlefield. But we can\r\n                  only do the right as we see the right, and\r\n                  reverently commit our cause to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n90   INT.
