Then, halfway through the round, Cassius' eyes\n          have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first\n          combination with a few hard shots that, to Liston's surprise,\n          rock Liston's head back.

(We're aware that any Liston\n          shot could knock out Cassius if it connected.) Then Cassius\n          soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides,\n          dances, clinches, circles away...UNTIL...\n<b>          \n</b><b>          AT THE END OF THE ROUND\n</b><b>          \n</b>          Cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big\n          lefts Liston's way that rock his head back two times.\n          Liston's so furious, he flips, charging Cassius, who hits\n          and ducks at the same time.

Then Ali dips, throws a left, which\n          George takes on the shoulder...a BIG RIGHT HAND to George's\n          head. The crowd goes nuts. George clinches, picks up Ali\n          and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. As he\n          puts Ali down, Ali pushes George's head down and away and\n          Ali clocks him with ANOTHER RIGHT. Foreman clinches and\n          drives Ali back to the rope. Ali throws ANOTHER RIGHT that\n          lands. Ali dances, circles, stays out of Foreman's way.\n          Then he slams him again with a right.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                                                       134.\n</b><b>          \n</b>          Foreman gets Ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations\n          and a hook that nails Ali in the body and a wild shot hits\n          Ali on the side of the head. CLOSER ON ALI...stunned, his\n          eyes clear. He's just taken a Foreman shot. He pushes\n          Foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and\n          circles. Foreman ties him up again. Ali pushes out, dances\n          and hits HIM with a RIGHT.
