MOM's feet moving past -- then DAD'S \n               feet. We may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents \n               come in -- from the boy's eyes which never leave the sketch \n               he is drawing.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Suddenly a MOUNTAIN LION is \n               visible, stretched hugely across a rock. It growls \n               ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the \n               cave. Silence.\n\n               Jim, thunderstruck, gaping. A gallery of ancient INDIAN \n               PETROGLYPHS surround him on all sides. Curious, oblong \n               figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the \n               hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities \n               proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of \n               Creation.\n\n               Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities -- \n               staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face...\n\n<b>               DOORS SONG \n</b>               There's danger on the edge of town \n               Ride the King's highway \n               Weird scenes inside the gold mine \n               Ride the King's highway west, baby\n\n               The sound of a rattle -- \"shichishichi\" -- he realizes he's \n               being watched. By what? He whips his eyes everywhere. A large \n               LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of \n               a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue \n               and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull...

He turns. The lizard is looking at him.\n\n               The GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him. We are \n               looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of light, \n               some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no \n               lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible Spanish descent \n               dialect or huararchi.\n\n<b>                                     INDIAN GHOST VOICE\n</b>                         ...you are a prince among white men, \n                         yet you are a warrior among us.
