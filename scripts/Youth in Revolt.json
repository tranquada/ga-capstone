He goes to\n          the shower   head next to Nick and turns it on.\n          Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing\n          himself off. Jerry gurgles water and spits.

Nick\n          spots the chamber at the end where Sheeni's naked form\n          showers, obscured by tacky stained glass.\n          He kicks off his slippers. Hangs his robe on a hook.\n          He approaches the stall.\n          Flashing super:       Thundering Erection\n          He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray.\n          He embraces her. Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of\n          white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles... It's Mrs.\n          Saunders! She looks up startled.\n          Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream. Mrs. Saunders\n          starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered.\n          She hurls a bar of soap.\n          The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing\n          on the slippery tile. He goes down, taking Mrs. Saunders with\n          him. They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape.\n\n                              MRS. SAUNDERS\n\n                    RAPE! RAAAAAPE!\n          Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches\n          out and pulls Nick up.\n\n                              SHEENI\n                    Get out quick!\n          Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her\n          mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats.\n\n          INT. CAFE - DAY\n\n          Nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as\n          he brings his coffee to his lips. He hears the door open and\n          looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni. She joins him\n          at the table.\n\n                              NICK\n                    Should I go to the sheriff's now?\n\n                              SHEENI\n                    No. I managed to convince Mother\n                    you were retarded and couldn't read\n                    the sign.\n\n          \n\n                                                                     28.\n\n          \n          Nick nods thankfully.\n\n                              NICK\n                    Say, where were you anyway?   We\n                    said five minutes to six.\n\n                              SHEENI\n                    I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are\n                    always discreetly late. It's\n                    expected of us.\n\n                              NICK\n                    Swell. And the punctual guy fries\n                    in the chair for rape.\n\n                              SHEENI\n                    Don't complain. At least you got to\n                    shower with a naked woman.\n                        (licking donut powder off\n                         her fingers)\n                    What are your plans today?\n\n                              NICK\n                    My parents want to go to\n                    Middletown. Jerry has the moronic\n                    notion of buying a trailer there\n                    before we leave.\n\n                              SHEENI\n                    I should like to come with you,\n                    Nick. The more time we spend\n                    together the better. I fear when\n                    you leave we might never see each\n                    other again.\n          Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought.\n\n          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY\n\n          Sheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind\n          tunnel. She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks.\n          Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of\n          his thigh.\n          As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off\n          and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake.\n\n          EXT. GEEZER'S MANOR - DAY\n\n          Estelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut\n          rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it\n          might not make the trip back.\n          In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard.\n\n          \n\n                                                                     29.\n\n          \n\n                              JERRY\n                    What's your cash price?\n\n                              GEEZER\n                    I said in the ad.

Those rusty propane\n                    tanks are a fire hazard. The roof\n                    probably needs work. I couldn't go\n                    above eight hundred.\n          The geezer ponders the bad news.

He cuts across the lawn.\n\n                              NICK (V.O.)\n                    Fran\u00e7ois wanted to torch the\n                    trailer where it sits, but I've\n                    convinced him a parking lot will\n                    reduce the risk of collateral\n                    damage.\n          The trailer clips the corner of the house. Chunks of stucco\n          fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes,\n          collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of\n          the home.\n          Nick guns it, and with a lurch the trailer splinters free. He\n          dodges the birch tree, but plows over the smaller Asian pear.\n          The Lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street,\n          the trailer weaving back and forth, smashing parked cars.\n\n          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY\n\n          Nick cruises along sedately. He plays with the radio and\n          settles on the Sex Pistols.\n          He looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on\n          the brakes, nearly jack-knifing the trailer.\n          The light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill.\n\n          \n\n                                                                  54.\n\n          \n\n          EXT.

LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY\n          Nick hits the gas and the Lincoln suddenly surges forward,\n          released from the great weight.\n          Nick smiles. Behind him, through the rear window, the trailer\n          can be seen receding into the distance. He glances into the\n          mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill.\n          Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in front of him at the\n          intersection. The gas tank on the Fiat cracks, spurting fuel\n          onto the pavement.\n\n          EXT. BERKELEY - DAY\n\n          Nick leaps from the Lincoln and watches open-mouthed as the\n          vehicular ballet unfolds.\n          Down the hill - the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery\n          van and goes into a spin. The BOHEMIANS sipping espresso at\n          the outdoor caf\u00e9 look up to see the words GOD'S PERFECT\n          ASSHOLE bearing down on them.\n          The delivery van veers out of control. The Bohemians scatter.\n          The truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way\n          through the patio furniture and into the caf\u00e9.\n          A geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood.\n          The trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross\n          street below.\n          KWOMP! Nick turns to see the still-restive Lincoln part from\n          the Fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner.\n\n                              NICK\n                    Oh no! I forgot to set the brake!\n          The DRIVER OF THE FIAT bolts after the accelerating Lincoln,\n          but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog.\n          The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and\n          desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat.\n          MOTORISTS slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer\n          crosses four lanes of traffic. It jumps the curb crashing\n          into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop.\n          A cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in\n          time to get clipped by the Lincoln.\n          The cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken\n          transport. The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom.\n\n          \n\n                                                                  55.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The Lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run,\n          thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked\n          building like a runaway express train.\n          The gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop\n          explodes, the trailer's two propane tanks going off like\n          bombs.\n          The Fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart,\n          sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down\n          on the spectators.\n          The blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken\n          fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill,\n          ending at Nick's feet.\n          Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of\n          smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of\n          dazed chickens. He turns around and does his best to\n          inconspicuously walk OUT OF FRAME.\n\n          INT.

Trent's roommate Ed\n                    said that Trent pokes holes in them\n                    so that he can get Sheeni pregnant\n                    and be with her forever.\n          And with that piece of disturbing info, he leaves them.\n\n          INT.
