BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two\r\n          feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted,\r\n          their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still\r\n          yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.\r\n                         \r\n          A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies,\r\n          Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee-\r\n          deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath,\r\n          fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets,\r\n          pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy,\r\n          nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely\r\n          hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners.\r\n                         \r\n           HAROLD GREEN (V.O.)\r\n           Some of us was in the Second Kansas\r\n           Colored. We fought the rebs at\r\n           Jenkins' Ferry last April, just\r\n           after they'd killed every Negro\r\n           soldier they captured at Poison\r\n           Springs.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

The ones of us that didn't\r\n           die that day, we joined up with the\r\n           116th U.S. Colored, sir.

As he walks into the fog, Clark\r\n          continues reciting in a powerful voice:\r\n                         \r\n           IRA CLARK (CONT'D)\r\n           \" - That this nation, under God,\r\n           shall have a new birth of freedom --\r\n           and that government of the people,\r\n           by the people, for the people,\r\n           shall not perish from the earth.\"\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln watches Clark until the fog's swallowed him up.\r\n                         \r\n                         TITLE:\r\n                         \r\n           JANUARY, 1865\r\n                         \r\n           TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S RE-ELECTION\r\n                         \r\n           THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR IS NOW IN ITS FOURTH YEAR\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. A SHIP AT SEA - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part\r\n          iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing\r\n          through the choppy black waters of an open sea.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no\r\n          railing, open to the sea. The ship's tearing through rough\r\n          water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray. The deck\r\n          is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret.\r\n                         \r\n           LINCOLN (V.O.)\r\n           It's nighttime. The ship's moved\r\n           by some terrible power, at a\r\n           terrific speed.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon,\r\n          indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears\r\n          to recede faster than the fast-approaching ship.\r\n           7.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           LINCOLN (V.O.)\r\n           Though it's imperceptible in the\r\n           darkness, I have an intuition that\r\n           we're headed towards a shore. No\r\n           one else seems to be aboard the\r\n           vessel. I'm alone.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Books everywhere.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy\r\n          frame. He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie\r\n          unknotted, shoeless. He has an open folio filled with\r\n          documents on his lap.\r\n                         \r\n          MARY LINCOLN sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and\r\n          night cap.

LINCOLN'S OFFICE, SECOND FLOOR, WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A working room, sparsely furnished. Lincoln's desk is heaped\r\n          with files, books, newspapers. The desk's near a window, now\r\n          open. Comfortable chairs and a rocker are in a corner. Near\r\n          the fireplace, in which embers are dying, there's a long\r\n          table, eight chairs around it, settings by each chair of\r\n          inkwells and pens.\r\n                         \r\n          Dozens of maps cover the walls and the crowded bookcases.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln opens the door and enters to find his 10 year-old son\r\n          TAD LINCOLN near the hearth, sleeping, sprawled on a very\r\n          large military map. Lead toy soldiers are scattered across\r\n          it.\r\n                         \r\n          A large mahogany box, imprinted ALEXANDER GARDNER STUDIOS,\r\n          is open near Tad's head. The box contains large glass plates,\r\n          each framed in wood; these are photographic negatives. Tad's\r\n          been looking at several, which lie near him on the map.\r\n           11.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln kneels by Tad and looks down at the map, a\r\n          topographical and strategic survey of the no-man's land\r\n          between Union and Confederate forces at Petersburg. He\r\n          scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines.\r\n                         \r\n          He lifts one of the glass plates and holds it to the\r\n          firelight: it's a large photographic negative of a young\r\n          black boy. There's a caption, in elegant cursive script:\r\n          \"Abner, age 12 - $500\"\r\n                         \r\n          And another: \"Two young boys, 10 & 14 - $700\"\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln puts the plates back in the box and closes the lid.\r\n          Carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside, he lies down\r\n          beside Tad. He touches Tad's hair and kisses his forehead.\r\n          Tad stirs as Lincoln gets on all fours; without really waking\r\n          up, knowing the routine, Tad climbs onto his father's back.\r\n          Tad holds on as his father stands, weary, and maybe a little\r\n          surprised to find his growing son slightly heavier than he\r\n          was the night before.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAD\r\n                          (FAST ASLEEP:)\r\n           Papa...\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Hmm?\r\n                         \r\n                          TAD\r\n           Papa I wanna see Willie.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n                          (WHISPERING:)\r\n           Me too, Taddie.

They face an\r\n          audience of officials, clerks, dignitaries, wives, soldiers.\r\n          A Marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of \"We\r\n          Are Coming Father Abra'am.\"\r\n           12.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards. Lincoln moves\r\n          into place; as the crowd applauds, he takes a sheet of paper\r\n          from inside his hat and glances at it. Then he looks up.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           The part assigned to me is to raise\r\n           the flag, which, if there be no\r\n           fault in the machinery, I will do,\r\n           and when up, it will be for the\r\n           people to keep it up.\r\n                         \r\n          He puts the paper away. The audience waits, expecting more.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           That's my speech.\r\n                         \r\n          He smiles at them. They applaud, some laughing. As Lincoln\r\n          turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays \"We\r\n          Are Coming Father Abra'am\" and the audience joins in. Among\r\n          them, Secretary of State WILLIAM SEWARD, 64, in a thick,\r\n          exquisite winter coat and hat, and Lincoln's dapper assistant\r\n          secretary, JOHN HAY, 27. Seward looks pleased.\r\n                         \r\n                          AUDIENCE\r\n           \"We are coming, Father Abra'am,\r\n           three hundred thousand more,\r\n           From Mississippi's winding stream\r\n           and from New England's shore...\"\r\n           We leave our plows and workshops,\r\n           our wives and children dear,\r\n           With hearts too full for utterance,\r\n           With but a silent tear.\r\n           We're coming Father Abra'am...\"\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

That's\r\n           sixty-four Democrats looking for\r\n           work come March.\r\n                         \r\n                          SEWARD LINCOLN\r\n          I know, but that's - They don't need to worry\r\n           about re-election, they can\r\n           vote however it suits `em.\r\n                         \r\n          There's a knock at the office door.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          SEWARD LINCOLN\r\n          But we can't, um, buy the (to Hay:)\r\n          vote for the amendment. It's Might as well let `em in.\r\n          too important.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           I said nothing of buying anything.\r\n           We need twenty votes was all I\r\n           said. Start of my second term,\r\n           plenty of positions to fill.\r\n                         \r\n          Hay opens the door to the outer office, admitting the sound\r\n          of a sizable crowd. JOHN NICOLAY, 33, Lincoln's rather severe\r\n          German-born senior secretary, ushers in MR. JOLLY, mid-40s,\r\n          mud-spattered coat, hat in hands, followed by MRS. JOLLY,\r\n          similarly road-worn, holding a suitcase. Lincoln stands.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN NICOLAY\r\n           Mr. President, may I present Mr.\r\n           and Mrs. Jolly who've come from\r\n           Missouri to -\r\n                         \r\n           MR.

Mrs. Jolly curtseys.\r\n           15.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Mr. Jolly. Ma'am.

They are worried and a little\r\n          awed.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           I heard tell once of a Jefferson\r\n           City lawyer who had a parrot that'd\r\n           wake him each morning crying out,\r\n           \"Today is the day the world shall\r\n           end, as scripture has foretold.\"\r\n           And one day the lawyer shot him for\r\n           the sake of peace and quiet, I\r\n           presume, thus fulfilling, for the\r\n           bird at least, its prophecy!\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln smiles. The Jollys don't get it. Mr. Jolly looks back\r\n          at Seward, who gestures for him to speak, then exhales a\r\n          plume of smoke.\r\n                         \r\n           MR. JOLLY\r\n           (launching into his\r\n                          PREPARED SPEECH:)\r\n           They's only one tollbooth in Jeff\r\n           City, t' the southwest `n this man\r\n           Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla been in\r\n           illegal possession for near two\r\n           yar, since your man General\r\n           Schofield set him up there.

Mr. Lincoln, you always says\r\n           so. With the amendment, slavery's\r\n           ended and they'll give up. The war\r\n           can finish then.\r\n                         \r\n                          SEWARD\r\n           If the war finished first, before\r\n           we end slavery, would -\r\n                         \r\n           MRS.

Next to him\r\n          are Secretary of the Navy GIDEON WELLES, 63, luxurious white\r\n          hair (it's a wig) and a flowing snowy beard; Postmaster\r\n          General WILLIAM DENNISON, 50; Secretary of the Interior JOHN\r\n          USHER, 49; Secretary of the Treasury WILLIAM FESSENDEN, 59;\r\n          and Attorney General JAMES SPEED, 53.\r\n                         \r\n          Nicolay and Hay are in chairs behind Lincoln, taking notes.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n                          (TO STANTON:)\r\n           Thunder forth, God of War!\r\n                         \r\n          Stanton clears his throat. He's noticed the singed edge.\r\n                         \r\n                          STANTON\r\n           We'll commence our assault on\r\n           Wilmington from the sea.\r\n                          (PEEVED:)\r\n           Why is this burnt?

Why,\r\n           instead, are we reading in the\r\n                          HERALD -\r\n           (he smacks a newspaper on\r\n                          THE TABLE)\r\n           - that the anti-slavery amendment\r\n           is being precipitated onto the\r\n           House floor for debate - because\r\n           your eagerness, in what seems an\r\n           unwarranted intrusion of the\r\n           Executive into Legislative\r\n           prerogatives, is compelling it to\r\n           it's... to what's likely to be its\r\n           premature demise? You signed the\r\n           Emancipation Proclamation, you've\r\n           done all that can be expected -\r\n                         \r\n                          JAMES SPEED\r\n           The Emancipation Proclamation's\r\n           merely a war measure. After the war\r\n           the courts'll make a meal of it.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN USHER\r\n           When Edward Bates was Attorney\r\n           General, he felt confident in it\r\n           enough to allow you to sign -\r\n                         \r\n                          JAMES SPEED\r\n                          (A SHRUG:)\r\n           Different lawyers, different\r\n           opinions. It frees slaves as a\r\n           military exigent, not in any other -\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           I don't recall Bates being any too\r\n           certain about the legality of my\r\n           Proclamation, just it wasn't\r\n           downright criminal. Somewhere's in\r\n           between. Back when I rode the legal\r\n           circuit in Illinois I defended a\r\n           woman from Metamora named Melissa\r\n           Goings, 77 years old, they said she\r\n           murdered her husband; he was 83. He\r\n           was choking her; and, uh, she\r\n           grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-\r\n           26.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           wood and fractured his skull, `n he\r\n           died. In his will he wrote \"I\r\n           expect she has killed me. If I get\r\n           over it, I will have revenge.\"\r\n                         \r\n          This gets a laugh.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           No one was keen to see her\r\n           convicted, he was that kind of\r\n           husband. I asked the prosecuting\r\n           attorney if I might have a short\r\n           conference with my client. And she\r\n           and I went into a room in the\r\n           courthouse, but I alone emerged.\r\n           The window in the room was found to\r\n           be wide open. It was believed the\r\n           old lady may have climbed out of\r\n           it. I told the bailiff right before\r\n           I left her in the room she asked me\r\n           where she could get a good drink of\r\n           water, and I told her Tennessee.\r\n           Mrs. Goings was seen no more in\r\n           Metamora. Enough justice had been\r\n           done; they even forgave the\r\n           bondsman her bail.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN USHER\r\n           I'm afraid I don't -\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           I decided that the Constitution\r\n           gives me war powers, but no one\r\n           knows just exactly what those\r\n           powers are. Some say they don't\r\n           exist. I don't know. I decided I\r\n           needed them to exist to uphold my\r\n           oath to protect the Constitution,\r\n           which I decided meant that I could\r\n           take the rebels' slaves from `em as\r\n           property confiscated in war. That\r\n           might recommend to suspicion that I\r\n           agree with the rebs that their\r\n           slaves are property in the first\r\n           place. Of course I don't, never\r\n           have, I'm glad to see any man free,\r\n           and if calling a man property, or\r\n           war contraband, does the trick...\r\n           Why I caught at the opportunity.\r\n           Now here's where it gets truly\r\n           slippery. I use the law allowing\r\n           for the seizure of property in a\r\n           war knowing it applies only to the\r\n           property of governments and\r\n           27.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           citizens of belligerent nations.\r\n           But the South ain't a nation,\r\n           that's why I can't negotiate with\r\n           'em. So if in fact the Negroes are\r\n           property according to law, have I\r\n           the right to take the rebels'\r\n           property from `em, if I insist\r\n           they're rebels only, and not\r\n           citizens of a belligerent country?\r\n           And slipperier still: I maintain it\r\n           ain't our actual Southern states in\r\n           rebellion, but only the rebels\r\n           living in those states, the laws of\r\n           which states remain in force. The\r\n           laws of which states remain in\r\n           force. That means, that since it's\r\n           states' laws that determine whether\r\n           Negroes can be sold as slaves, as\r\n           property - the Federal government\r\n           doesn't have a say in that, least\r\n           not yet -\r\n           (a glance at Seward,\r\n                          THEN:)\r\n           - then Negroes in those states are\r\n           slaves, hence property, hence my\r\n           war powers allow me to confiscate\r\n           `em as such. So I confiscated `em.\r\n           But if I'm a respecter of states'\r\n           laws, how then can I legally free\r\n           `em with my Proclamation, as I\r\n           done, unless I'm cancelling states'\r\n           laws? I felt the war demanded it;\r\n           my oath demanded it; I felt right\r\n           with myself; and I hoped it was\r\n           legal to do it, I'm hoping still.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks around the table. Everyone's listening.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           Two years ago I proclaimed these\r\n           people emancipated - \"then,\r\n           thenceforward and forever free.\"\r\n           But let's say the courts decide I\r\n           had no authority to do it. They\r\n           might well decide that. Say there's\r\n           no amendment abolishing slavery.\r\n           Say it's after the war, and I can\r\n           no longer use my war powers to just\r\n           ignore the courts' decisions, like\r\n           I sometimes felt I had to do. Might\r\n           those people I freed be ordered\r\n           back into slavery? That's why I'd\r\n           like to get the Thirteenth\r\n           Amendment through the House, and on\r\n           28.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           its way to ratification by the\r\n           states, wrap the whole slavery\r\n           thing up, forever and aye. As soon\r\n           as I'm able. Now. End of this\r\n           month. And I'd like you to stand\r\n           behind me. Like my cabinet's most\r\n           always done.\r\n                         \r\n          A moment's silence, broken by a sharp laugh from Seward.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           As the preacher said, I could write\r\n           shorter sermons but once I start I\r\n           get too lazy to stop.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN USHER\r\n           It seems to me, sir, you're\r\n           describing precisely the sort of\r\n           dictator the Democrats have been\r\n           howling about.\r\n                         \r\n                          JAMES SPEED\r\n           Dictators aren't susceptible to\r\n           law.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN USHER\r\n           Neither is he!

I signed the Emancipation\r\n           Proclamation a year and half before\r\n           my second election. I felt I was\r\n           within my power to do it; however I\r\n           also felt that I might be wrong\r\n           about that; I knew the people would\r\n           tell me. I gave `em a year and half\r\n           to think about it.

As if your committee\r\n          joined with all of Washington\r\n          awaiting, in what you anticipated\r\n          would be our comfort in squalor,\r\n          further proof that my husband and I\r\n          were prairie primitives, unsuited\r\n          to the position to which an error\r\n          of the people, a flaw in the\r\n          democratic process, had elevated\r\n          us.\r\n           57.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln, suddenly without anyone in line to receive, looks to\r\n          see the backlog forming behind the radicals.

It's true because it\r\n           works; has done and always will do.\r\n           In his book, Euclid says this is\r\n           \"self-evident.\"\r\n                          (A BEAT)\r\n           D'you see?

Lincoln is on one\r\n          side reading over a stack of documents.

OUTSIDE THE ARMY HOSPITAL - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Robert, brooding, waits in the buggy.\r\n           83.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Hearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see TWO\r\n          BLACK ORDERLIES in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy\r\n          wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas. One orderly pushes\r\n          while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over.\r\n                         \r\n          Robert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood. He\r\n          gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a\r\n          corner of the building.\r\n                         \r\n          Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with\r\n          puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the\r\n          edge of a shallow pit. One orderly pulls the canvas back,\r\n          revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered\r\n          by bullet or bomb.\r\n                         \r\n          Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.\r\n          Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs.\r\n                         \r\n          Robert walks away, unsteady.\r\n                         \r\n          Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling\r\n          paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on\r\n          rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to\r\n          control his hands, his feelings, but he can't. He has a panic\r\n          attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed.\r\n          Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold\r\n          back tears.\r\n                         \r\n           LINCOLN (O.C.)\r\n           What's the matter, Bob?\r\n                         \r\n          Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with\r\n          concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROBERT\r\n           I have to do this!

It shocks them both.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past\r\n          him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROBERT (CONT'D)\r\n           I have to do this! And I will!

For freedom\r\n           he died. I'm his mother. That's\r\n           what I am to the nation, Mr.\r\n           Lincoln.

It's\r\n           going to be so very close.\r\n           You see what you can do.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln leaves Yeaman, considering.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. A WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD IN WASHINGTON - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln stands in front of William Hutton's row house,\r\n          talking to Hutton. The funeral wreath still hangs on the door\r\n          behind them, displaying the marks of time passing: faded,\r\n          weatherbeaten, dusty.\r\n                         \r\n                          WILLIAM HUTTON\r\n           I can't make sense of it, what he\r\n           died for. Mr. Lincoln, I hate them\r\n           all, I do, all black people. I am a\r\n           prejudiced man.\r\n                         \r\n          The door opens slightly behind Hutton. His wife looks out.\r\n          Hutton exchanges a glance with her, and the door shuts again.\r\n           97.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           I'd change that in you if I could,\r\n           but that's not why I come. I might\r\n           be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I\r\n           expect... Colored people will most\r\n           likely be free, and when that's so,\r\n           it's simple truth that your\r\n           brother's bravery, and his death,\r\n           helped make it so. Only you can\r\n           decide whether that's sense enough\r\n           for you, or not.\r\n                         \r\n          Hutton walks slowly back to his house.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           My deepest sympathies to your\r\n           family.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln goes back to his buggy. Hutton pauses at his door to\r\n          watch Lincoln's buggy drive away.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAWN\r\n                         \r\n          The chamber is quiet and dark. Pages and clerks prepare the\r\n          desks, laying out pens and paper, filling inkwells.\r\n                         \r\n          TITLE: THE MORNING OF THE VOTE\r\n                         \r\n           JANUARY 31, 1865\r\n                         \r\n          A CLERK is draping red-white-and-blue bunting on the desks of\r\n          representatives from seceded states. These will of course\r\n          remain unoccupied during the vote.\r\n                         \r\n          The first Congressman to arrive, Thaddeus Stevens clumps in.\r\n          He goes to his desk and sits. He looks around the empty\r\n          chamber, ready and waiting.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - MORNING, SEVERAL HOURS LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Thaddeus Stevens is at his desk. The House is in session, the\r\n          floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing.\r\n                         \r\n          The balcony's packed. Mary and Keckley sit at the front,\r\n          Nicolay and Hay behind them. The Blairs are among other\r\n          officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries.\r\n                         \r\n          There's a sudden quiet, then murmuring. Ashley, Stevens and\r\n          everyone on the floor look up, Ellis, Hollister, Hutton and\r\n          Hawkins among these.\r\n                         \r\n          In the balcony, twenty WELL-TO-DO BLACK PEOPLE, mostly men,\r\n          are escorted by several Senators, including Sumner and Wade,\r\n          to a reserved section of the balcony. The black people glance\r\n          at their surroundings but are rigidly composed.\r\n                         \r\n          Asa Vintner Litton sees them enter. He looks about, at the\r\n          representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors.\r\n          Something powerful strikes him. In a voice coarse with\r\n          emotion, he calls up to the black visitors:\r\n           100.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           ASA VINTNER LITTON\r\n           We welcome you, ladies and\r\n           gentlemen, first in the history of\r\n           this people's chamber, to your\r\n           House!\r\n                         \r\n          There's tense applause. Some of the black guests bow; most\r\n          aren't sure how to respond.\r\n                         \r\n          Yeaman watches this, deeply moved.\r\n                         \r\n          Bilbo catches Hawkins's eye and waves. Hawkins looks\r\n          anxiously around, blushing.\r\n                         \r\n          Everyone is seated, and the place is packed.\r\n                         \r\n          Schuyler Colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum, the\r\n          SERGEANT-AT-ARMS to his right. Colfax gavels the House into\r\n          session. Ashley is at the podium.\r\n                         \r\n                          SCHUYLER COLFAX\r\n           Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.\r\n                         \r\n                          JAMES ASHLEY\r\n           On the matter of the joint\r\n           resolution before us, presenting a\r\n           Thirteenth Amendment to our\r\n           national Constitution, which was\r\n           passed last year by the Senate, and\r\n           which has been debated now by this\r\n           estimable body for the past several\r\n           weeks.

Bilbo\r\n          appears in the doorway, beet-red and gasping for air.\r\n                         \r\n          Hay's too winded to speak. Bilbo holds out the note, limp\r\n          with sweat, and brings it to Lincoln.

He blots, folds and hands it to Hay, who immediately\r\n          reads it, Nicolay looking on.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Give this to Mr. Ashley.\r\n                         \r\n          Hay looks at Nicolay, who can't speak; he waves at Hay to\r\n          speak for him.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN HAY\r\n           I feel, um, I have to say, Mr.\r\n           Lincoln, that this -\r\n           (annoyed, impatient, to\r\n                          BILBO:)\r\n           Could you please just step\r\n           outside?!\r\n                         \r\n           W.N.

The silence this causes lengthens,\r\n          till representatives begin to look to see what's happened.\r\n          Yeaman sits, staring ahead, not responding. Thaddeus Stevens,\r\n          sensing something's happening, looks in Yeaman's direction.\r\n          Yeaman, still staring ahead, mumbles something, but it's\r\n          inaudible.\r\n                         \r\n           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D)\r\n           Sorry Mr. Yeaman, I didn't hear you\r\n                          VOTE -\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE YEAMAN\r\n           (rising to his feet)\r\n           I said aye, Mr. McPherson.\r\n           AYE!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Great surprise, loud cheers and angry shouts.\r\n                         \r\n                          FERNANDO WOOD\r\n           TRAITOR!

To the consternation of the\r\n          Democrats, a mob of gleeful Republicans rushes across the\r\n          aisle that separates the two parties; they surround Yeaman,\r\n          shaking his hand, slapping him on the back.

He can't\r\n          speak. Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed.

Abstention.\r\n                         \r\n          Disgust briefly flashing across his face, McPherson crosses\r\n          out and changes LeClerk's vote to an abstention. The cheering\r\n          and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this\r\n          means for the vote count.\r\n                         \r\n          In the balcony, Bilbo looks at Hawkins, well-pleased.\r\n                         \r\n           THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\r\n           Mr. Alexander Coffroth.\r\n                         \r\n          Coffroth looks towards Stevens, who doesn't look at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          ALEXANDER COFFROTH\r\n           (proud of himself and\r\n           happy about the reward\r\n                          HE'LL GET:)\r\n           I.

Lincoln closes his\r\n          eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed\r\n          with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused\r\n          with grey. His brow has grown smoother.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Once he surrenders, send his boys\r\n           back to their homes, their farms,\r\n           their shops.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANT\r\n           Yes sir, as we discussed.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Liberality all around. No\r\n           punishment. I don't want that. And\r\n           the leaders - Jeff and the rest of\r\n           `em - if they escape, leave the\r\n           country while my back's turned,\r\n           that wouldn't upset me none.\r\n           120.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           When peace comes it mustn't just be\r\n           hangings.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANT\r\n           By outward appearance, you're ten\r\n           years older than you were a year\r\n           ago.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Some weariness has bit at my bones.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           I never seen the like of it before.\r\n           What I seen today. Never seen the\r\n           like of it before.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANT\r\n           You always knew that, what this was\r\n           going to be. Intimate, and ugly.\r\n           You must've needed to see it close\r\n           when you decided to come down here.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           We've made it possible for one\r\n           another to do terrible things.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANT\r\n           And we've won the war. Now you have\r\n           to lead us out of it.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. THE MCLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA -\r\n                         AFTERNOON\r\n                         \r\n          OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in\r\n          the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's\r\n          just happened. No one is speaking.\r\n                         \r\n          TITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA\r\n                         \r\n           APRIL 9, 1865\r\n                         \r\n          ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a\r\n          CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is\r\n          blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse.\r\n                         \r\n          Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside;\r\n          but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at\r\n          Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions:\r\n          pride, defiance, blankness.\r\n                         \r\n          Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his\r\n          staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln.\r\n           121.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that\r\n          Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the\r\n          two men who look awkwardly at one another.\r\n                         \r\n          Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes\r\n          for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union\r\n          Army remove their hats.\r\n                         \r\n          Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises\r\n          his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling\r\n          slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. A BUGGY RIDE THROUGH WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON\r\n                         \r\n          A beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in\r\n          the buggy, driven by the old soldier.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARY\r\n           You've an itch to travel?\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           I'd like that. To the West by rail.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARY\r\n           (shaking her head no:)\r\n           Overseas.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           The Holy Land.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARY\r\n           (a laugh, then:)\r\n           Awfully pious for a man who takes\r\n           his wife out buggy-riding on Good\r\n           Friday.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Jerusalem.

They ride in silence.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARY\r\n           All anyone will remember of me is I\r\n           was crazy and I ruined your\r\n           happiness.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Anyone thinks that doesn't\r\n           understand, Molly.\r\n                         \r\n          She nods; then, tenderly:\r\n           122.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          MARY\r\n           When they look at you, at what it\r\n           cost to live at the heart of this,\r\n           they'll wonder at it. They'll\r\n           wonder at you. They should. But\r\n           they should also look at the\r\n           wretched woman by your side, if\r\n           they want to understand what this\r\n           was truly like. For an ordinary\r\n           person. For anyone other than you.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           We must try to be happier. We\r\n           must. Both of us. We've been so\r\n           miserable for so long.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln's in the shirtsleeves and vest of his formal evening\r\n          wear, his hair brushed down and plastered in place. William\r\n          Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and\r\n          Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch\r\n          whiskey. Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the\r\n          stovepipe hat and gloves on the table.\r\n                         \r\n          John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily\r\n          marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked. He drops\r\n          these on the floor. As they watch Hay:\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           I did say some colored men, the\r\n           intelligent, the educated, and\r\n           veterans, I qualified it.\r\n                         \r\n                          JAMES ASHLEY\r\n           Mr. Stevens is furious, he wants to\r\n           know why you qualified it -\r\n                         \r\n                          SCHUYLER COLFAX\r\n           No one heard the intelligent or the\r\n           educated part. All they heard was\r\n           the first time any president has\r\n           ever made mention of Negro voting.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a\r\n           better speech.\r\n                         \r\n                          JAMES ASHLEY\r\n           Mr. Stevens also wants to know why\r\n           you didn't make a better speech.\r\n           123.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          They laugh. There's a knock on the door; Nicolay enters.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN NICOLAY\r\n                          (TO LINCOLN:)\r\n           Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the\r\n           carriage. She wants me to remind\r\n           you of the hour, and that you'll\r\n           have to pick up Miss Harris and\r\n           Major Rathbone.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln nods. Slade enters with Lincoln's hat, coat, and\r\n          gloves. Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Am I in trouble?\r\n                         \r\n                          WILLIAM SLADE\r\n           No, sir.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Thank you, Mr. Slade.\r\n                         \r\n          Slade hands Lincoln his gloves as Colfax and Ashley drain\r\n          their drinks and rise.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           I suppose it's time to go, though I\r\n           would rather stay.\r\n                         \r\n          He leaves the room.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. AN EMPTY CORRIDOR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE -\r\n                         CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          On the way out, Lincoln tosses the gloves on a side table.\r\n          Slade grabs them, considers chasing after Lincoln, then\r\n          thinks better of it. He walks back towards the office. Then\r\n          some strange feeling stops him, and he turns around again.\r\n          Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down\r\n          the empty hallway.\r\n                         \r\n          Slade watches till Lincoln turns the corner, and he's gone.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. A THEATER - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          The theater is adorned with patriotic bunting.\r\n                         \r\n          Onstage, a Caliph's palace. A YOUNG MAN duels with scimitars\r\n          against a huge, hideous AFRIT. A YOUNG WOMAN in chains cowers\r\n          in distress. The young man gymnastically avoids being killed,\r\n          then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart. The demon\r\n          screams and topples to the ground. The audience gasps as a\r\n           124.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          flame-colored, bejewelled bird rises up from the dead afrit's\r\n          heart.\r\n                         \r\n          The audience applauds. In the center box, Tad Lincoln is\r\n          joining in, as is his companion for the evening, Tom Pendel.\r\n                         \r\n          Onstage, the bird flies off, the young man is freeing the\r\n          young woman, when the scene is halted by the red curtain\r\n          lowering, surprising actors and audience. The music dies,\r\n          the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of\r\n          the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and\r\n          walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken.\r\n                         \r\n          In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on\r\n          the stage, eyes open, alarmed.\r\n                         \r\n          The audience knows something's wrong. Their rising murmur of\r\n          concern dies immediately when Grover raises his hands.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEONARD GROVER\r\n                          (VOICE SHAKING:)\r\n           The President has been shot.\r\n                         \r\n          There are screams of horror from the audience; people leap\r\n          from their seats.\r\n                         \r\n           LEONARD GROVER (CONT'D)\r\n           The President has been shot at\r\n           Ford's Theater!\r\n                         \r\n          The theater is a scene of complete pandemonium. People cry,\r\n          jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats,\r\n          shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible\r\n          in the uproar.\r\n                         \r\n          Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close\r\n          to him. Tad pulls away and begins shrieking, clinging to the\r\n          railing so tightly that Pendel can't pry him loose. Tad can't\r\n          stop screaming, his eyes wide open, seeing nothing.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. THE BEDROOM IN PETERSON'S BOARDING HOUSE - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Mary is gently escorted into a tiny room. A small, hissing\r\n          gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light.\r\n                         \r\n          Stanton, Speed, GENERAL HENRY HALLECK and a MINISTER, are\r\n          standing. Welles sits by the head of the bed. DR. CHARLES\r\n          LEALE, a young army surgeon, and DR. ROBERT STONE, the\r\n          Lincoln family's doctor, stand uselessly by the foot of the\r\n          bed, while DR. JOSEPH BARNES, the Surgeon General, listens to\r\n          Lincoln's faint breathing.\r\n           125.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Robert, in uniform, red-eyed, pale as a ghost, sits at the\r\n          bedside and stares at his father, barely breathing.\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln lies in a crooked diagonal, his knees bent, on a bed\r\n          he's too tall to fit properly, clad only in a nightshirt.\r\n                         \r\n          Barnes moves his head closer, then closer. The room is\r\n          utterly still. Barnes takes out his watch, looks at the time,\r\n          softly clears his throat.\r\n                         \r\n           DR. BARNES\r\n           It's 7:22 in the morning, Saturday\r\n           the 15th of April. It's all over.\r\n           The President is no more.\r\n                         \r\n          No one talks, or moves.\r\n                         \r\n          Stanton looks at Lincoln's body.\r\n                         \r\n                          STANTON\r\n           Now he belongs to the ages.\r\n                         \r\n          Robert begins to weep.\r\n                         \r\n           LINCOLN (V.O.)\r\n           Fondly do we hope, fervently do we\r\n           pray, that this mighty scourge of\r\n           war may speedily pass away.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. THE EAST PORTICO OF THE CAPITOL - NOON\r\n                         \r\n          Lincoln, wearing spectacles, stands at a podium before the\r\n          Capitol Dome, still under scaffolding, under cloudy skies. He\r\n          reads from the two pages.\r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN\r\n           Yet, if God wills that it continue\r\n           until all the wealth piled by the\r\n           bondman's two hundred and fifty\r\n           years of unrequited toil shall be\r\n           sunk, and until every drop of blood\r\n           drawn with the lash shall be paid\r\n           by another drawn with the sword, as\r\n           was said three thousand years ago,\r\n           so still it must be said \"the\r\n           judgments of the Lord are true and\r\n           righteous altogether.\"\r\n                         \r\n          He glances at his audience: 40,000 people from all over the\r\n          country, wounded soldiers, civilians in black. And for the\r\n          first time, in the crowd, not at its edges, hundreds of\r\n          African Americans, civilians and soldiers.\r\n           126.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n           With malice toward none, with\r\n           charity for all, with firmness in\r\n           the right as God gives us to see\r\n           the right, let us strive on to\r\n           finish the work we are in, to bind\r\n           up the nation's wounds, to care for\r\n           him who shall have borne the\r\n           battle, and for his widow and his\r\n           orphan, to do all which may achieve\r\n           and cherish a just and a lasting\r\n           peace among ourselves and with all\r\n           nations.\r\n                         \r\n           FADE TO BLACK.\r\n                         \r\n                         THE END\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nLincoln\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Tony Kushner\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0History\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:29:28.736536"}
