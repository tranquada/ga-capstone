Somewhere's in\r\n           between. Back when I rode the legal\r\n           circuit in Illinois I defended a\r\n           woman from Metamora named Melissa\r\n           Goings, 77 years old, they said she\r\n           murdered her husband; he was 83. He\r\n           was choking her; and, uh, she\r\n           grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-\r\n<b>           26.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n           wood and fractured his skull, `n he\r\n           died. In his will he wrote \"I\r\n           expect she has killed me. If I get\r\n           over it, I will have revenge.\"\r\n                         \r\n          This gets a laugh.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           No one was keen to see her\r\n           convicted, he was that kind of\r\n           husband. I asked the prosecuting\r\n           attorney if I might have a short\r\n           conference with my client. And she\r\n           and I went into a room in the\r\n           courthouse, but I alone emerged.\r\n           The window in the room was found to\r\n           be wide open. It was believed the\r\n           old lady may have climbed out of\r\n           it. I told the bailiff right before\r\n           I left her in the room she asked me\r\n           where she could get a good drink of\r\n           water, and I told her Tennessee.\r\n           Mrs. Goings was seen no more in\r\n           Metamora. Enough justice had been\r\n           done; they even forgave the\r\n           bondsman her bail.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          JOHN USHER\r\n</b>           I'm afraid I don't -\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          LINCOLN\r\n</b>           I decided that the Constitution\r\n           gives me war powers, but no one\r\n           knows just exactly what those\r\n           powers are. Some say they don't\r\n           exist. I don't know. I decided I\r\n           needed them to exist to uphold my\r\n           oath to protect the Constitution,\r\n           which I decided meant that I could\r\n           take the rebels' slaves from `em as\r\n           property confiscated in war. That\r\n           might recommend to suspicion that I\r\n           agree with the rebs that their\r\n           slaves are property in the first\r\n           place. Of course I don't, never\r\n           have, I'm glad to see any man free,\r\n           and if calling a man property, or\r\n           war contraband, does the trick...\r\n           Why I caught at the opportunity.\r\n           Now here's where it gets truly\r\n           slippery. I use the law allowing\r\n           for the seizure of property in a\r\n           war knowing it applies only to the\r\n           property of governments and\r\n<b>           27.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n           citizens of belligerent nations.\r\n           But the South ain't a nation,\r\n           that's why I can't negotiate with\r\n           'em. So if in fact the Negroes are\r\n           property according to law, have I\r\n           the right to take the rebels'\r\n           property from `em, if I insist\r\n           they're rebels only, and not\r\n           citizens of a belligerent country?\r\n           And slipperier still: I maintain it\r\n           ain't our actual Southern states in\r\n           rebellion, but only the rebels\r\n           living in those states, the laws of\r\n           which states remain in force. The\r\n           laws of which states remain in\r\n           force. That means, that since it's\r\n           states' laws that determine whether\r\n           Negroes can be sold as slaves, as\r\n           property - the Federal government\r\n           doesn't have a say in that, least\r\n           not yet -\r\n           (a glance at Seward,\r\n<b>                          THEN:)\r\n</b>           - then Negroes in those states are\r\n           slaves, hence property, hence my\r\n           war powers allow me to confiscate\r\n           `em as such. So I confiscated `em.\r\n           But if I'm a respecter of states'\r\n           laws, how then can I legally free\r\n           `em with my Proclamation, as I\r\n           done, unless I'm cancelling states'\r\n           laws? I felt the war demanded it;\r\n           my oath demanded it; I felt right\r\n           with myself; and I hoped it was\r\n           legal to do it, I'm hoping still.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks around the table. Everyone's listening.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          LINCOLN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Two years ago I proclaimed these\r\n           people emancipated - \"then,\r\n           thenceforward and forever free.\"\r\n           But let's say the courts decide I\r\n           had no authority to do it. They\r\n           might well decide that. Say there's\r\n           no amendment abolishing slavery.\r\n           Say it's after the war, and I can\r\n           no longer use my war powers to just\r\n           ignore the courts' decisions, like\r\n           I sometimes felt I had to do.

It\r\n           sickened me, `n more than that, it\r\n           brought a shadow down, a pall\r\n           around my eyes.\r\n<b>                          (BEAT)\r\n</b>           Slavery troubled me, as long as I\r\n           can remember, in a way it never\r\n           troubled my father, though he hated\r\n           it. In his own fashion. He knew no\r\n           smallholding dirt farmer could\r\n           compete with slave plantations. He\r\n           took us out from Kentucky to get\r\n           away from `em. He wanted Indiana\r\n           kept free. He wasn't a kind man,\r\n           but there was a rough moral urge\r\n           for fairness, for freedom in him. I\r\n           learnt that from him, I suppose, if\r\n           little else from him.

William\r\n          Slade is working the tie and gloves. James Ashley and\r\n          Schuyler Colfax stand with him, holding glasses of scotch\r\n          whiskey.

A YOUNG MAN duels with scimitars\r\n          against a huge, hideous AFRIT. A YOUNG WOMAN in chains cowers\r\n          in distress. The young man gymnastically avoids being killed,\r\n          then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart. The demon\r\n          screams and topples to the ground.

The music dies,\r\n          the gas lights in the house are being raised as the owner of\r\n          the theater, LEONARD GROVER, steps out before the curtain and\r\n          walks to the center of the stage, pale and badly shaken.\r\n                         \r\n          In the box, Tom Pendel glances quickly at Tad, who's fixed on\r\n          the stage, eyes open, alarmed.\r\n                         \r\n          The audience knows something's wrong.
