TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are\nwith her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her\ndaughters - well,  all her daughters except. . . \n\nANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the\nparty, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a\nSERVENT (SONYA) 16,  who is trying to catch up with\nAnastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.\n\n<b>                       SONYA\n</b>                  (whispering)\n          Princess Anastasia - you're\n          late and it's all my  fault!\n\n<b>                       ANASTASIA\n</b>          Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll\n          notice. . . \n\nJust then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair,\nstopping Anastasia with a \n\n<b>                       ANASTASIA\n</b>                  (loudly)\n          . . .  owwwwwwwww!\n\nAll eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that\nshe's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous\nsmile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the\nribbon falls out of her hair and down her back,\nAnastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride.\n\nTatiana sees her and can't help but smile.\n\nThe music suddenly becomes  a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.\nSERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY\nsteps out and begins a proccession through their\nsubjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she\nmakes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has\na beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by\nlarge, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of \nenergy and confidence for a girl her age.\n\n<u>\"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA\"  (OPENING NUMBER)\n\n   The elegant guests sing their admiration as the\nbeautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance\ninto the ball, they're \"the  pride of all Russia\".\nVladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire\nglittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING \nWALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will\nrule forever.</u>\n\nDuring the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful\nCOUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including\nAnastasia dancing gracefully with her father.\n\nUnder a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly\nhandsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a\nshock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross his\neyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, still\nwaltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross the\nroom carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. The\nguests \"Ew\" and \"ah\" at the sumptuous fruit. Anastasia\nsees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a\ndance step, she grabs an orange off thr tray and tosses\nit to Dmitri. He catches it and smiles broadly at her.\n\nSuddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from\nunder the table.

The servants sing about their demanding\nemployers and mockingly imitate their behavior:  they\nimply that they have their own \"party\",  that change is\ncoming.\n\n   While back in the ballroom, the Royalists are\noblivious to the servants discontent and sing their\nsatisfaction with their own lives.\n\n   DRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the following\nscenes.</u>\n\n<b>ON TATIANA\n</b>\nin a large throne-like chair.

Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY\nPUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally\nsee's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine\nshoes, with heels, that she has kicked off.

Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement.\nAnya turns to them.\n\nON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's\nshoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him\nwith great vindication.\n\nBALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and\ngraceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and\ncompletes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri\napplauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks\nhim with her head accidently.\n\nTHEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes\ngracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is\ndirected to join Anya. He does and they dance together,\nwith Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left\nand Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms.
