PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT\n\nElegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an\nORCHESTRA plays.\n\nAll eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which\ndescend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase.\nThrough the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager\nEmpress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is\nseemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are\nwith her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her\ndaughters - well,  all her daughters except. . . \n\nANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the\nparty, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a\nSERVENT (SONYA) 16,  who is trying to catch up with\nAnastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.\n\n                       SONYA\n                  (whispering)\n          Princess Anastasia - you're\n          late and it's all my  fault!\n\n                       ANASTASIA\n          Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll\n          notice. . . \n\nJust then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair,\nstopping Anastasia with a \n\n                       ANASTASIA\n                  (loudly)\n          . . .  owwwwwwwww!\n\nAll eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that\nshe's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous\nsmile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the\nribbon falls out of her hair and down her back,\nAnastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride.\n\nTatiana sees her and can't help but smile.\n\nThe music suddenly becomes  a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.\nSERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY\nsteps out and begins a proccession through their\nsubjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she\nmakes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has\na beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by\nlarge, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of \nenergy and confidence for a girl her age.\n\n\"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA\"  (OPENING NUMBER)\n\n   The elegant guests sing their admiration as the\nbeautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance\ninto the ball, they're \"the  pride of all Russia\".\nVladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire\nglittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING \nWALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will\nrule forever.\n\nDuring the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful\nCOUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including\nAnastasia dancing gracefully with her father.\n\nUnder a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly\nhandsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a\nshock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross his\neyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, still\nwaltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross the\nroom carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. The\nguests \"Ew\" and \"ah\" at the sumptuous fruit. Anastasia\nsees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a\ndance step, she grabs an orange off thr tray and tosses\nit to Dmitri. He catches it and smiles broadly at her.\n\nSuddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from\nunder the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls\nDmitri into an open wall panel.\n\n                       IVAR\n                  (angrily)\n          You're a servent! Never forget\n          your place!\n\n                       DMITIRI\n                  (defiant)\n          Someday my place will be out\n          there!\n\n                       IVAR\n          Never! You're a peasant,\n          Dmitri! Back in the kitchen\n\nRULARS OF RUSSIA (CONT.)\n\n   UNDERSCORE CONTINUES as Dmitri is dragged from his\nhiding place under the table and back to the kitchen.\nIt's like the Moscow circus back there, COMIC MUSICAL\nCONFUSION. The servants sing about their demanding\nemployers and mockingly imitate their behavior:  they\nimply that they have their own \"party\",  that change is\ncoming.\n\n   While back in the ballroom, the Royalists are\noblivious to the servants discontent and sing their\nsatisfaction with their own lives.\n\n   DRAMATIC UNDERSCORE CONTINUES though the following\nscenes.\n\nON TATIANA\n\nin a large throne-like chair. Tatiana is very serious\nand very regal. She slides over to make room for\nAnastasia who sits next to her.\n\n\n                       TATIANA\n          Why were you so late tonight \n\n                       ANASTASIA\n          I was showing Sonya\n          something . . .\n\n                       TATIANA\n          What were you showing her?\n\n                       ANASTASIA\n                  (sheepishly)\n          How to read.\n\n                       TATIANA\n          I thought you were told not to\n          tutor your servants anymore.\n\n                       ANASTASIA\n          I know, but I had to because . . .\n\nAnastasia looks up at Tatiana and sees her smile with\npride.  Anastasia knows she doesn't have to explain.\n\n                       ANASTASIA\n                  (cuddling)\n          Oh, Grandmama, why do you have\n          to go back to Paris?\n\n                       TATIANA\n          It's where I've made my home\n          but I do have something for\n          you . . .\n\nTatiana reaches from behind the chair and brings out a\nbeautiful MUSIC BOX.  Tatiana takes the key, a small\nsilver and enamel flower, on a silver neck chain and\nwinds it up. MUSIC BEGINS, she hands Anastasia the key.\n\nCLOSE UP\n\nthe key bearing the inscription \"Together in Paris\".\n\n                       ANASTASIA\n          \"Together in Paris\"! Oh, when\n          can we be \"together in Paris?!\n\n                       TATIANA\n          When you're older . . .\n\nAnastasia makes a disgruntled face. Tatiana laughs.\n\n\n                       TATIANA\n          Until then, whenever you hear\n          this song, think of me and know\n          that I'm waiting for you.\n\nTatiana puts the key around Anastasia's neck and they\nembrace. Then, suddenly . . .\n\nON THE GRAND CHANDELIER\n\nthe lights begin to fade in and out.\n\nGROUP SHOT\n\nas PEOPLE in the ballroom look around bewildered. Then,\na WHIRLWIND kicks up, sending everyone off the dance\nfloor, as the whirlwind becomes a TORNADO.\n\nSuddenly, an ALBINO BAT (BARTOK) with huge eyes, springs\nout of the funnel, screeching and swooping over the\ncrowd, causing everyone to duck and cover their heads in\nfear.\n\nThe tornada reaches it's peak and EXPLODES in smoke -\nleaving RASPUTIN standing alone in the middle of the\nfloor. He is of indeterminate age, towering over other\nmen in the room, his most striking feature are his eyes\n- which at this moment are burning a fiery red. He is\ndressed in a flowing black monk's robe with a satin rope\ntied around his waist. Connected to the rope is a\nglowing RELIQUARY, a mystical lantern.\n\nVARIOUS SHOTS\n\nof Nicholas, Alexandra, Sophie and Vladimir, Dmitri\npeeking out ofthe wallpanel, Tatiana and Anastasia,\nall of whom are frightened.\n\nNICHOLAS\n\nas he gathers his son and wife to his side\n\n                       NICHOLAS\n          Rasputin!  You're alive . . .\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n                  (advancing)\n          Despite being shot, poisoned\n          and thrown into an icy river . . .\n          YES!\n\n                       NICHOLAS\n                  (honestly)\n          I had nothing to do with it!\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n          You gave the orders!\n\n                       NICHOLAS\n          I did no such thing!\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n          After all I've done for your\n          family - YOU TRIED TO KILL\n          MEEEEEE ! ! !\n\nRasputin swings the reliquary, wrapping himself in smoke\nwhich seems to grow larger. Eerie moaning noises come\nfrom the reliquary. PEOPLE back awayin terror.\n\n                       RASPUTIN (CONT.)\n          The Romanov dynasty ends here!\n          You, your wife and children\n          will all die within the\n          fortnight!\n\n                       ANASTASIA\n          NO!\n\nAnastasia leaves Tatiana and rushes to stand in front of\nher father. Still holding her Music Box, Anastasia's\nshaking hands are the only thing that gives away her \nfear. Rasputin spins toward the voice.\n\n                       ANASTASIA\n          We're not afraid of you!\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n                  (furious)\n          You . . .  my little babushka . . .\n          you'll be so much fun to kill \n          that I'll save you for last!\n\nTwirling the reliquary again, the MOANS grow louder as\nBartok circles around his head. The smoke that emerges\nseems to have almosy a human shape to it.\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n          THIS IS THE END OF THE ROMANOV\n          LINE - FOREVER !!!!\n\nThe tornada of smoke begins again, whipping into a\nfrenzy and then EXPLODING.\n\nThe smoke clears and Rasputin is gone. As the lights\nreturn to normal the Romanov family all stand together,\nand try to look regal and in control once again.\n\n                       TATIANA (O.C.)\n          Some say Rasputin ad harnessed\n          all the dark powers of evil and \n          that it was his curse which \n          brought about the end . . .\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nthe ROMANOV FAMILY fades into a PORTRAIT OF THE FAMILY.\n\n                       TATIANA (O.C.)\n          I will never know for sure.\n          All I do know is that the\n          beauty of our world was soon\n          Gone . . .

That one is a rotten\n          troublemaker, willful. . .\n\n                       SEREBREAKOV\n          I'll break her will. . .\n                  (to Anya)\n          I shall come for you tomorrow\n          at dawn.\n                  (he touches her face as\n                   she pulls away)\n          You will enjoy serving under\n          me.\n\nSmiling in anticipation, he exit.\n\n                       PHLEGMENKOF\n          I couldn't break you - but he\n          can!\n\nAnd she turns to leave in a huff. Anya does one more\nimitation of her, making the CHILDREN laugh. But as\nAnya turns away from her audience, we see her facade\nfade and realize her terror of the future.\n\n\nINT.  ORPHANAGE - NIGHT\n\nThe CHILDREN huddle in their cots under tattered, thin\nblankets. Anya is fully dressed, illuminated by the\n\nlight of a FULL MOON, she ties a dull gray sheets together\nand anchors the \"rope\" to an ice cold radiator and\nthrows the other end out of the window.  She is about to\nclimb out when she looks at the sleeping children and\nsmiles sadly. She walks over to Gregor's bed and puts\none hand lovingly on his head and then reaches over and\ntakes the hand of a sleeping LITTLE GIRL, who opens her\neyes and smiles.\n\n                       GREGOR\n                  (loudly)\n          Anya?\n\nThe other childern wake up as Anya gently \"shushes\" him.\n\n                       GREGOR (CONT.)\n                  (quietly)\n          Are you running away?\n\n                       ANYA\n          No.  I'm running to.\n\n                       LITTLE GIRL\n          Running to?

Home is where\n          you belong and none of us\n          belong here.\n\n                       GREGOR\n          Where is your home, Anya?\n\n                       ANYA\n          I'm not sure but look. . .\n\nAnya shows Gregor the key around her neck.\nCLOSE UP on the inscription:  \"Together in Paris\"\n\n                       ANYA\n          It says \"Together in Paris\".

I have to go and\n          find out.\n\nAnya smiles lovingly at the children.\n\n\"A SOMEPLACE AND A SOMEONE\"\n\n    (Anya's \"I want\" song).  Anya SINGS SOFTLY to the\nchildren about how all she has is the key around her\nneck to the \"someone and thesomeplace\" she was \"lost\nfrom long ago\".  She tells the children that she must go\nfind them again.\n\nUNDERSCORE continues.\n\n                       ANYA\n          I have to go now, before it\n          gets light.\n\n                       GREGOR\n                  (worried)\n          But what if we can't ever find\n          where we came from?!\n\n                       ANYA\n          Then you'll have to make your\n          own home. Lots of people do.\n\nAnya embraces the children and walks to the window.\n\n                       GREGOR\n                  (nervous, sad)\n          Anya! What if we can't find\n          anyone who loves us?!\n\n                       ANYA\n          Then come find me.\n\nGregor is relieved and cuddles into his bed as Anya\nsmiles lovingly and crawls out the window.\n\nEXT.  ORPHANAGE - NIGHT\n\nAnya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots.\nThe knotshold tight, but the old sheet RIPS in half,\nsending her PLUMMETING into a snow drift.  From the\ndepths of the snow we HEAR her voice.\n\n                       ANYA (O.C.)\n          I hope there's no snow in\n          Paris. . .\n\nEXT.  HILLSIDE - DAWN\n\nA glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the\nhorizon. Anya stands at  edge of the hill, looking\ndown on the city of ST.PETERSBURG. The old gray\norphanage looms behind her. Anya \"borrows\" an old,\nbeat-up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the\nhill.\n\nMusic picks up in energy and excitement as Anya zooms on\nher way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises\nand St. Petersburg looms nearer.\n\n\"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE\" (CONT.)\n\n    Music becomes UPTEMPO, HOPEFUL, ACTIVE, ACTIVE. Anya SINGS -\n- full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddls her\nrickety bike toward the city. \"Her heart is on its way\"\nand nothing is going to stop her.\n\nAnya passes though the countryside toward the city. A\npeasant family waves to her as she goes by. A Gypsy\nTroupe performs tricks by the side of the road. A very\nfancy car zooms by.\n\n\"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE\" (CONT.)\n\n   Anya SINGS, imagining who she might be -- anyone from\na peasant to a princess! But it doesn't matter as long\nas she finds her real family.\n\nPeople stare at her as she rides into the edge of the\ncity. She is captivated by all the activity:  cars,\nbusses, stores, long lines of people, etc.\n\n\"A SOMEONE AND A SOMEPLACE\"  (CONT.)\n\n   Anya SINGS -- in this sea faces, there must be\nsomeone who has a clue to her identity.  She'll stop at\nnothing to find the someone who once loved her.  SOARING\nMUSICAL AND VOCAL CONCLUSION.\nEND MUSICAL NUMBER\n\nAnya does not see a cute little PUPPY (MEETOO) with a\nHUGE BONE in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk\nby a pack of much larger, vicious DOGS until he bolts\nacross Anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. She\nwatched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the\nangry pack.\n\nOn reflex, Anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley\nafter him.\n\nEXT.  ALLEY - DAY\n\nMeetoo is trapped.  The PACK surrounds him, ready to\npounce when Anya LEAPS into the middle of the circle.\nThe PACK is startled, but begins to advance on both Anya\nand Meetoo.\n\nAnya doesn't know what to do. She crouches and then. . . \ngrowls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious\nas possible. The PACK exchange a confused look; there's\na girl growling at them. Meetoo stands, suddenly brave,\nbehind her and growls along with her.\n\nSuddenly, Anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder.\nThe pack has definately had enough - some start to back\nout quizzically, others turn and run like hell.\n\nAnya turns to Meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully,\nwagging his tail. Anya picks up the bone and puts it\nback in his mouth.\n\n                       ANYA\n          I think you should be more\n          careful about who you invite to\n          dinner!\n\nMeetoo nods and lets out a little \"bark\" that sounds as\nif he were saying \"retu\".  Anya pats him and heads back\nto her bike.\n\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY\n\nAnya rides down the street. She doesn't see Meetoo,\nrunning like a little maniac behind her.\n\nAnya approaches a STERN LOOKING BUILDING with a sign\nover the door: \"The People's Bureau of Bureaucracy\".\n\nShe leaps off her bike and heads up the stais. Meetoo,\nbreathing heavily from his run, follows and almost\nreaches her when the heavy door slams in his face.  He\nslumps against it, panting, his little paw-to chest.\n\nINT. BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY - DAY\n\nAnya enters and STOPS when she sees. . . LINES and LINES\nof people which seem to go on forever.  She walks down\nthe side of one line, trying to figure out which one to\nstand in.\n\n                       ANYA\n          Could someone tell me. . .\n\n                       PEASANT 1\n          End of the line!\n\n                       ANYA\n          Which line?\n\n                       PEASANT 2\n          Any line.\n\n                       PEASANT 3\n          All lines are good lines.\n\n                       PEASANT 1, 2, & 3\n                  (in unison)\n          In our beloved Soviet Union!\n\nThey turn toward an armed Soviet Guard and smile\nsweetly, hoping he heard their flattery.  He did.\n\n                       GUARD\n          Very good. . . \n\nHe jots something down in his notebook.\n\nON ANYA\n\nas she gets closer to the window. She turns to the\nperson behind her.\n\n                       ANYA\n          Is this the right line to get\n          papers to travel?\n\n                       PEASANT 4\n          Travel?

He can help.\n\nHe shuts the window, only to open it again immediately.\n\n                       CLERK (CONT.)\n          But you didn't hear it from me.\n\nHe shuts the window.\n\n                       ANYA\n                  (doesn't get it)\n          I didn't\n\nHe opens it again.\n\n                       CLERK\n          No.\n\nThe clerk sticks out a sign:  \"Samovar Break - back in\nten minutes\" and slams the window shut.\n\nEXT.  BUREAU OF BUREAUCRACY\n\nAnya steps out of the building, still not seeing Meetoo\nand looks around at the hoards of people waiting in\nlines for everything:  bread, gas, clothes, etc.\n\n                       ANYA\n                  (to herself)\n          Dmitri? There must be a\n          million Dmitris. . . \n\nFOLLOW ANYA\n\nas she wades into the crowded street. Meetoo getting\ntangled in the legs of waiting Soviets.\n\nAnya stops suddenly. She sniffs the air.  Her eyes\nwiden as she recognizes the stench that is floating\nthrough the air.  She spins around and sees Serebreakov\nDIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET.\n\nSerebreakov is on a mission to find Anya.  He turns in\nher direction just as a bus passes.  Anya is gone.\n\nWe now see Anya clinging to the side of the bus as it\ndrives down the street. Meetoo looks, his face dropping\n- he knows he'll never catch up to her now.  Then he\nsees the bus hit a huge pothole and Anya is knocked off\ninto the mud.  Happily, Meetoo trots off in her\ndirection.\n\nAnya approaches TWO PEASANTS who are waiting in line in\nfront of a cafe.\n\n                       PEASANT 9\n                  (to Peasant 10)\n          Which line is this?\n\n                       PEASANT 10\n          The line to get into the line.\n\n                       ANYA\n          Excuse me, do you know\n          Dmitri. . . \n\n                       PEASANT 9\n          I know nothing!\n\n                       PEASANT 10\n          Nothing!\n\n                       PEASANTS 9 & 10\n                  (whispering\n                   simultaneously)\n          Try the tavern/ library.\n\nThey begin to bicker back and forth in forced whispers\nas to wether Dmitri is at the tavern or the library.\nExasperated, Anya walks away.  They call after her.\n\n                       PEASANTS9& 10\n          But we didn't tell you!\n\nAnya rolls her eyes in frustration.  She doesn't see\nMeetoo at her feet.\n\n                       ANYA\n                  (To herself)\n          I wish they'd all stop telling\n          me they didn't tell me!\n\nMeetoo gives a \"retu\" of agreement. Anya looks down and\nsees him.\n\n                       ANYA (CONT.)\n          What are you doing. . .\n\nJust then, she catches another whiff of something foul\nin the air. Anya duck quickly into a doorway and loses\nMeetoo. Anya peeks out. A GARBAGE WAGON full of dead\nfish and rotten food passes Anya.  She sighs with relief,\nit wasn't Serebreakov - it just smelled like him.\n\nAnya steps out of the doorway and approaches a STREET\nARTIST sketching a LARGE PEASANT WOMAN as her TINY\nHUSBAND looks over his shoulder.\n\n                       TINY HUSBAND\n                  (To Artist)\n          Could you get rid of her\n          moustache?\n\n                       ANYA\n          Excuse me - I'm looking for a\n          man named Dmitri. . .\n\nThe Artist quickly scribbles and address on his pad and\nhands it to her without turning around.\n\n                       ARTIST\n          But I didn't write it.\n\nAnya looks down at the note\n\nCLOSE ON NOTE\n\n\"St. Petersburg Art Theatre - 99 Pushkin Street\"\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO\nA SIGN\n\n\"Pushkin Street\"\n\nCAMERA PANS TO:\n\nEXT.

He looks older, of course, but with the same\ndapper mustache. He rolls his eyes.\n\n                       VLADIMIR\n                  (out to audience)\n          Dmitri!

(NOTE:   We don't want to give Dmitri a\nwhole new song here or we'll be too song-heavy in Act I.\nBy giving him a short reprise of Anya's song, we can\neffectively align these two characters emotionally.)\n\nQUICK CUTS:\n\nof various aspirants:\n\n                       ACTRESS 2\n                  (heavy hasal)\n          Oh, Grandmama!

Him.\n\n                       DMITRI\n          I won't laugh - I swear...\n\nThe door opens and Anya comes out in the blue dress\nDmitri stole which at least ten sizes too big for her.\nShe is still wearing her hair up and despite the size\nwhich actually gives her a \"Kate Moss\" waifish look\nwith her men's boots and baggy dress - the blue brings\nout her eyes. Dmitri sees her and BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.\n\n                       ANYA\n          You said you wouldn't laugh!\n\n                       DMITRI\n          It's not you - it's the dress!\n\nAnya storms back into the cabin and slam the door behind her.\n\nINT.\tCABIN - SIMULTANEOUS ACTION\n\nWhen Anya storms into the cabin, she catches a glimpse of\nherself in the mirror.\n\n                       ANYA\n               (to herself)\n          I'm never going to be..\n\nJust then, the slamming door catches the back of her dress,\npulling more than half of it into the door frame. She sees\nin the mirror that the now fitted dress shows a lovely\nwoman's figure. Pleased, she looks at herself.\n\n                       ANYA (CONT.)\n          Well! Maybe I am...\n\nEXT.\tCABIN DOOR - NIGHT\n\nVladimir and Dmitri wait outside the door. The door opens\nand Anya appears, having tied the veil around the waist\nof the dress, making it look fitted and beautiful. Dmitri\nand Vladimir are surprised as Anya walks past them with\nconfidence and throws them a look over her shoulder.\n\n\"REPRISE OF VLADIMIR'S SONG (OVER MONTAGE)\n\nThe tone of the song would now change - - the older,\nwiser person watching as two younger people are\nunwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be\nlight, as are the visuals here, but there would be\nan undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would\nend as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary\nembrace.\n\nMONTAGE: (MOS)\n\nON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully\ndown the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion.\nDmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion.\nAnya looks back and flashes them a smile.\n\nIN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's\nbeen sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where\nAnya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole\nagainst a cold wind. He closes is and see's Anya -\nshe looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her\ncovers and she SLUGS him.\n\nUNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing\nfeet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY\nPUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally\nsee's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine\nshoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo\ngrabs them in his mouth and runs.\n\nON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled\nshoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling\nlike mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement.\nAnya turns to them.\n\nON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's\nshoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him\nwith great vindication.\n\nBALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and\ngraceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and\ncompletes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri\napplauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks\nhim with her head accidently.\n\nTHEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes\ngracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is\ndirected to join Anya. He does and they dance together,\nwith Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left\nand Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither\nof them even try to readjust.\n\nEND MONTAGE\n\nSTILL IN THE SCENE\n\nVladimir walks over to Anya and nervously chatters (he\nknows he interrupted something) as he leads her away\nfrom Dmitri.\n\n                       VLADIMIR\n          You are a natural! I don't know\n          how you ever learned to dance\n          that well! That must have been\n          some high class orphanage ...\n\nEXT. SEA - NIGHT\n\nAs a storm begins to whip up, the wind starts to howl\nand the waves become more violent.\n\nREVERSE ANGLE\n\njust as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the water, we see\nRasputin's face.\n\nINT. CABIN - NIGHT\n\nThe storm is pitching the boat wildly. Vladimir is\nsleeping, snoring loudly. Meetoo, sound asleep, is\nsliding from side of the cabin to the other. Anya\nis looking out the small port hole at the violent\nsea when Dmitri, carrying his back pack, sits on the\nbed next to her.\n\n                       DMITRI\n          I wanted to show you something.\n\nDmitri takes out the music box and hands it to Anya.\nShe is immediately taken by it, something about it ...\n\n                       ANYA\n          It's so beautiful ... and sad.\n\n                       DMITRI\n          Sad?\n\n                       ANYA\n          Lost. it feels lost.

It doesn't\n          matter as long as I find my home.\n\n                       DMITRI\n         Well, the only thing you've got\n         when you've got a home is a fear\n         of losing it! You're lucky you\n         don't remember the revolution --\n         I never had much, but what I did\n         have -- I lost.\n\n                       ANYA\n         I'm sorry.\n\n                       DMITRI\n              (false bravado)\n         Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta\n         make your own way in the world!\n         Don't be sorry for me! I'm going\n         to get what I want don't you worry!\n\nDmitri goes back over to his bed. Anya sees through\nhim and knows how much it all did matter to him.\n\nEXT.\tSEA CLIFF - NIGHT\n\nThe wagon sits on the edge of a high cliff. Rasputin\nstands on the top of his wagon, staring at the sea\ndemonically. The jagged bolts of lightening and the\nicy silver rain make him look all the more menacing.\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n              (low, slow)\n         She's out there ...\n\nThe wind parts his beard and we see Bartok hanging\nupside down in it, trying to stay out of the storm.\n\n                       BARTOK\n         I'm getting a chest cold..\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n         Bartok... a question.\n\n                       BARTOK\n         I'm getting pneumonia. I have\n         a fever. Feel my forehead...\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n         What do you think is the most\n         humiliating way to die?\n\nRasputin's eyes light up as if he just thought of the\nanswer to his own question. Bartok is thrown out of his\nbeard when he makes a sudden turn and leaps off the\nwagon. Bartok follows.\n\n                       BARTOK\n         My cousin Mischa, nice fellow\n         had some dental problems - you\n         didn't want to watch him eat,\n         let's put it that way...\n\nRasputin steps in\n\nINT.\tWAGON - NIGHT\n\nAs Bartok continues, Rasputin moves to the\nreliquary's cabinet.\n\n                       BARTOK\n         ... anyway, a bunch of other\n         bats were hanging in the belfry -\n         I know, cliche, but there you have\n         it, and Mischa, not the brightest\n         bat in the world, decides to hang\n         in the bell. Which was fine\n         for awhile until it started ringing ...\n\t      (shivers)\n         Ewwww, what a mess ...\n\n                       RASPUTTN\n\t      (to reliquary)\n         Show her to me ...\n\n                       BARTOK\n         And it didn't help the tonal\n         quality of the bell, either.\n\nIMAGES, horrifying and frightening, begin to spin\ninto a small tornado. Rasputin throws open the door\nand the TORNADO bursts out streaking across the water.\n\nEXT.\tSEA CLIFF - NIGHT\n\nRasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches\nas it disappears into the horizon of the water.\nLightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally.\n\nINT.\tCABIN - NIGHT\n\nwhich is swaying with the storm. PAN past Vladimir,\nsnoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and\npast Dmitri, sleeping restlessly. Move to Anya, who\nseems quite content.\n\nFrom under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither.\nThey float across the cabin and swirl around Anya.\n\nCLOSE ON:\n\nAnya's CLOSED EYES as the SMOKY IMAGES seem to enter\nher head. She smiles in her sleep and we are in ANYA'S\nDREAM. . .\n\nEXT.\tFOREST - DAY\n\nAnya, in a beautiful white dress, is walking peacefully\nthrough a sunny part of a lovely forest on a spring day.\nShe reaches down to pick some pretty flowers, then looks\nup as it seems to get dark... OMINOUS LOOKING CLOUDS cover\nthe sun. Anya reaches down for another flower when she\nHEARS A GROWL.\n\nAnya spins to see an ENORMOUS BEAR emerge from the trees.\n(All the animals in the dream sequence have a SLIGHT\nresemblance to Rasputin.) Anya is frozen with fear as MORE\nBEARS emerge and head straight for her. She tries to back\naway as the beautiful FLOWERS GROW LONG AND HORRIBLE THORNS\nand wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape.\n\nIt gets darker as the BEAR'S EYES, glowing yellow, multiply\nand move closer. Anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes\nto the safety of a large tree  She climbs the tree and\nescapesthe bears. Looking down, from her perch on a sturdy\nbranch, the ground seems miles away.\n\nSuddenly, the BRANCH JOLTS her and almost falling, she hold\n on to it tightly. But the branch TURNS IN TOWARD\n\nHER - no longer a tree branch, but A HUGE UGLY SNAKE with\nred eyes and huge fangs that come right for her!\n\nAnya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake.\nShe jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a HUNDRED\nYELLOW EYES, FIFTY BLOOD RED MOUTHS AND THOUSANDS OF SHARP\nTEETH. As Anya falls, she lets out a SILENT SCREAM.\n\nA BURST OF SUNLIGHT\n\nas Anya lands in a field of soft GOLDEN WHEAT. Unharmed\nand very relieved, she stands and looks around at the\nbeautiful sunny wheat field.\n\nINT. CABIN\n\nReality. Anya's eyes are closed as she smiles in her\nsleep and sits up in bed. TINY WISPS of smoke still\nswirl around her head. As she gets out of bed, she\nunintentionally steps on Meetoo's tail, waking him.\nMeetoo watches as the sleeping Anya opens the cabin door\nand walks out.\n\nMeetoo rises to follow Anya but the ship pitches, sending\nhim sliding across the cabin floor.\n\nEXT. DECK - NIGHT\n\nAnya walks out on the deck, the ship pitching violently\nin the storm, as she smiles.\n\nIN HER DREAM\n\nAnya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of\na BLUFF. A few yards below the bluff, Anya sees a beautiful\nlittle pond where a FAMILY frolic's in the clear water;\nlaughing, splashing, swiming happily. Anya climbs over a\nlow flowering wall to look closer.\n\nPULL BACK\n\nREALITY: Anya has climbed over the railing of the deck\nand is looking into the black ocean... smiling.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nA SMOKY IMAGE OF THE SAME SCENE\n\nIt's RASPUTIN'S POV as he watches his plan unfold in the\nreliquary.\n\nINT.

DECK\n\nAnya is waving happily at the dangerous water.\n\nIN HER DREAM\n\nAnya is waving to the FAMILY. They turn around toward\nher and she sees that it's the ROMONOV FAMILY, from\nthe frieze that she saw in the palace. She is delighted\nto see them as she feels a distance recollection of who\nthey are to her.\n\nINT. CABIN\n\nMeetoo jumps up and NIPS at Dmitri's hand.

I mean,\n         don't get me wrong - I'm not\n         attracted to him in the physical\n         sense, I just ...\n\nBut Rasputin's not interested, he stares into the\nreliquary and speaks directly to it.\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n         You are toying with me, aren't\n         you?

Anya sees him.\n\n                       ANYA\n          Dmitri ... Grandmama told me.\n\nShe stops. She can tell that something isn't right\nwith Dmitri by the look in his eyes.\n\n                       ANYA\n          Dmitri, what's wrong?\n\nDmitri approaches her slowly, zombie-like, arms\noutstretched.\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n                    (from above)\n          Throw her off the edge!

I know you would\n          never hurt me. You love me.\n\nAs Dmitri come close, she moves toward him and\nkisses him. He blinks and snaps out of it and is\nquite happy that Anya is kissing him.\n\n                       ANYA\n          Dmitri?\n\n                       DMITRI\n          Anya... where are we?\n\nWE HEAR a howl from above and suddenly Rasputin\njumps down. The reliquary tied to his waist, he's\nmore furious than we've ever seen him - his face\nliterally consumed with rage and hatred.\n\nAnya is terrified - but holds her ground as she did\nwhen she was a child.\n\n                       ANYA\n          I guess you aren't as\n          powerful as you thought!\n\nRasputin walks slowly toward Anya and Dmitri, burning with rage.\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n          I'll show you!\n\n                       DMITRI\n          Run, Anya -  go...\n\n                       ANYA\n          I'm not leaving you!\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n          Fighting for fair lady.

Rasputin pushes\nher with his foot and she slides across the floor to\nDmitri.\n\nAnya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as Rasputin,\nchuckling, advances on them. Anya reaches up and grabs\nRasputin's beard, pulling his face forward so that\nDmitri can give him a good roundhouse punch.\n\nThe blow does little but enrage Rasputin. He reaches\nout and with one huge hand, picks Anya like a rag doll\nand takes her to the ledge.\n\n                       DMITRI\n          Anya!\n\nDmitri throws himself against Rasputin several times\nonly to get batted away like a fly.

Rasputin's\nboot SMASHES DOWN on Dmitri's hand, which grips the\ngirder.\n\nDmitri screams out\tin, but doesn't let go. He\nlooks down at Anya and pulls her up while Rasputin\nbegins to pry off Dmitri's fingers one at a time.\n\n                       RASPUTIN\n          This little piggy had a palace...\n          this little piggy had a throne...\n\nAnya swings to another beam and now has firm footing as\nRasputin continues.\n\n                       RASPUTIN (CONT.)\n          This little piggy missed the firing\n          squad..\n\nDmitri is literally holding on with two fingers.\n\n                       RASPUTIN (CONT.)\n          And this little piggy wanted a home...\n          And this little piggy went wee wee\n          wee all the way... down!\n\nAs Dmitri's last finger is preyed away, he falls but\nhis grasp on Anya's hand is firm and she pulls him\nonto where she is standing.\n\nRasputin leans over and bends toward them, three feet\nfrom Anya.\n\n                       RASPUTIN (CONT.)\n          DIE!\n\n\nThe reliquary is dangling. Anya reaches up to grab on to\nit but her aim is off and she HITS it. The reliquary flies\nand SMASHES against the side of the tower, shattering.\nRasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away\nin terror.\n\n                       RASPUTIN (CONT.)\n          NOOOOOOOOO!\n\nON BARTOK\n\nwho covers his eyes.\n\nON ANYA AND DMITRI\n\nwho climb back up to the platform.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nof the Eiffel Tower as the EVIL SPIRITS FROM THE\nRELIQUARY burst out. The SPIRITS take on all the forms\nwe've seen earlier: BEARS, MINIONS, SNAKES, and\ncombinations of all. They grow and swirl, with hideous\nMOANING noises.\n\nAnya and Dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.\n\nON RASPUTIN\n\nas the SPIRITS begin to swarm around him, a TORNADO of\nhorrid beings. Re screams as they pull him off the\nground.\n\nON ANYA AND DMITRI\n\nas the force of the tornado increases, they have to\nhold on to the girders and each other in order not to\nbe sucked in. Bartok is thrown against the side of the\ntower and slithers to the floor.\n\nON RASPUTIN\n\nsuspended over the Eiffel Tower in the maelstrom. He\nScreams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment\nhim and EXPLODE - pieces fly and disintegrate in mid-air,\nin wild colors and smoke.\n\nON DMITRI AND ANYA\n\nwho hug each other in relief. They stand, looking out.\nThe smoke dissipates, showing them the city lights below.\n\nON BARTOK\n\nwho rises, patting his chest- He's about to let out\na Bartokism... but all the emerges are LITTLE BAT SQUEAKS.\nHe's surprised as first, then thrilled. The spell is\nbroken and he's just a bat again.\n\nDMITRI AND ANYA\n\nas he reaches down and picks up the crown that fell off\nher head in the fight. He hands it to her.\n\n                       DMITRI\n          Come on...
