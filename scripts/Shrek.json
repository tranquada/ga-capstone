You and what army?\n\n               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well \n               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail \n               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and \n               begins walking back to his cottage.\n \n                                     DONKEY\n                         Can I say something to you?

Oh!\n \n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks \n               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. \n               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \n               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. \n               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and \n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and \n               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.\n \n                                     DONKEY\n                         Hi, Princess!\n\n                                     FIONA\n                         It talks!\n\n                                     SHREK\n                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's \n                         the trick.\n \n               They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots \n               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a \n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His \n               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles \n               off and walks lightly.\n \n                                     SHREK\n                         Oh!\n\n               Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.\n \n               \n                                     SHREK\n                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit!

He throws the sword down in between several overlapping \n               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that \n               is still around the dragons neck.\n \n                                     SHREK\n                         (echoing) Run!\n\n               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot \n               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\n \n                                     FIONA\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \n                         did it!

Soft music plays \n               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic \n               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.\n \n                                     FARQUAAD\n                         Again, show me again.

Perfect.\n\n               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up \n               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly \n               at her image in the mirror.\n \n               MORNING\n\n               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey \n               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes \n               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along \n               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \n               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \n               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona \n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking \n               in his sleep.\n \n                                     DONKEY\n                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like \n                         it like that.

They are walking through the \n               forest.

Suddenly \n               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into \n               a tree.\n \n                                     ROBIN HOOD\n                         La liberte!
