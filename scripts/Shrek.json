Are \n                         you all right?\n<b> \n</b><b>                                     FIONA\n</b>                         (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, \n                         yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed \n                         to be beautiful.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                     SHREK\n</b>                         But you ARE beautiful.\n\n               They smile at each other.\n\n<b>                                     DONKEY\n</b>                         (chuckles) I was hoping this would be \n                         a happy ending.\n<b> \n</b>               Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...\n\n<b>               THE SWAMP\n</b>\n               ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm \n               a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek \n               and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting \n               carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet \n               which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end \n               up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet \n               instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now \n               has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona \n               walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over \n               singing the song.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                     GINGERBREAD MAN\n</b>                         God bless us, every one.\n\n<b>                                     DONKEY\n</b>                         (as he's done singing and we fade to \n                         black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't \n                         breathe.
