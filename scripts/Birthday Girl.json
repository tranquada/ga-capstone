A simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches \n               her hair. Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and \n               she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, \n               spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. She reaches the top of a \n               hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. \n               We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, \n               up, into the sun.\n\n<b>                                                       FADE THROUGH SUN TO:\n</b>\n               An aerial shot of the rolling English countryside. Nothing \n               but fields and trees for miles. The shot describes a panorama \n               before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to \n               move.\n\n               We fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six \n               lanes of motorway. Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred \n               miles an hour. We fly over the hard shoulder to another field \n               beyond.\n\n               We descend on two young boys in the field. A pornographic \n               magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. One of the \n               boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick \n               up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path \n               and into a suburban garden.\n\n               We fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over \n               children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man \n               mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden \n               trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham.

That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up \n               in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air.\n\n               Blackout. Music. Titles.\n\n               The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on \n               computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in \n               Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English. \n               The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, \n               as the titles appear. Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight \n               and pixellated.

That's that. She wasn't on the flight.\n\n               John wanders away from the gate. He stands about in the swirl \n               in the middle of the airport. People bustle by. Everyone \n               going somewhere.\n\n               Gradually, we get the sense we are being watched. A woman \n               stands nearby. She is about twenty, very beautiful, tired \n               and laden with luggage.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Nadia?\n\n               She nods.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         I'm John.\n\n               They shake hands.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Welcome.\n                              (pause)\n                         Well.

He puts his head back round the door \n               as if there's a real chance it will be shot off. She's facing \n               away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette. It has burnt \n               out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip.\n\n               He approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the \n               cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. \n               He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. Holding the \n               saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. It takes three \n               careful breaths before it drops in the saucer. Unseen by \n               John, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the \n               landing.

His phone rings. He \n               answers it.\n\n               Silence. Then soft breathing.

Both are lying still and \n               breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia \n               yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him.

Without these \n                         life has no flavour, is too serious. \n                         Eat.\n\n               John nibbles some pickled garlic.\n\n<b>                                     YURI\n</b>                         But this vodka.\n                              (pause)\n                         Is love. Only this magic changes you \n                         inside. The moon and the stars and \n                         the sun.\n\n               Yuri offers John the glass. He looks at Nadia, takes it and \n               swigs it down in one. He looks across at Nadia, wiping his \n               mouth, his eyes watering. She looks back at him.\n\n               Alexei begins softly singing a song. As he sings:\n\n<b>                                     YURI\n</b>                         This is a love song, a soldier's \n                         song to his beloved -- Alexei, he's \n                         Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan. \n                         He saw terrible things.\n\n               They listen to the beautiful, sad voice. For the second verse \n               Yuri joins in, a slow stirring lament. For the end Nadia \n               joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising \n               beautifully. John watches in the candlelight.\n\n               John, Nadia and Alexei pose with the cake. Nadia puts her \n               arm round John and Alexei. With a FLASH! Yuri takes a \n               Polaroid.\n\n               The guitar theme returns as we see the Polaroid on the table \n               in close up, developing speeded up. John comes into focus, \n               beaming.\n\n<b>               INT.

John \n               switches the light off and closes the door.\n\n<b>               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               John and Nadia seen from above lying asleep, with their heads \n               together, in the moonlight. Nadia whispers something in her \n               sleep, in Russian. Fast asleep John mutters something in \n               English. Their sleeping, unintelligible conversation, drifts \n               on in the night.\n\n<b>               INT. BANK - DAY\n</b>\n               John sits at his desk in the open plan office.

He rubs his \n               chin.

The two \n               rucksacks are still side by side where they were the night \n               before...\n\n<b>               INT.

He \n               stops -- There on the draining board lies the bloody skin of \n               a rabbit. John jumps out of his skin.\n\n               Next to the rabbit skin is a hand-drawn map. A dotted line \n               winds around the map and ends with an X in a small wood.\n\n               He looks at the rabbit skin, with its eyeless sockets.\n\n<b>               EXT.

A blanket, \n               cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around. Yuri is \n               strumming a guitar. Alexei and Nadia are laughing and \n               chatting. He removes a small twig from her hair and flattens \n               it under his big hand. John watches the gesture. It's so \n               intimate they could be lovers.\n\n<b>                                     YURI\n</b>                              (calls)\n                         John. We can see you hiding.\n\n               John steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group. \n               Alexei has Nadia falling about laughing about something. He \n               smiles at her then nods to John.\n\n               Pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil. Alexei feeds a piece \n               to Nadia with a big hunting knife. Nadia smiles at John, and \n               starts knitting.\n\n<b>                                     YURI\n</b>                         How is bank?\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Fine.

Alexei takes the knife he \n               has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade \n               flat above Nadia's bare stomach. Just before pressing it \n               down he looks across at John. Nadia yelps and sits up. They \n               laugh, and Yuri joins in. John laughs uneasily.\n\n               Alexei notices marks on Nadia's midriff. He asks her about \n               them in Russian.\n\n               John goes white, unable to understand Nadia's explanation. \n               He has no idea what she told him.\n\n<b>               EXT. LAKE IN FOREST - DAY\n</b>\n               At sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear. \n               They jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other.\n\n               John duck-dives under the water and swims through the sunlit \n               streaked green water. We see him under the water, swimming \n               towards us, caught by the sun's rays.\n\n               John surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes. He spots \n               Alexei and Nadia playing in the water. Alexei grabs her and \n               throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash.\n\n               John treads water nearby. He watches them both hold their \n               noses and disappear under the surface.\n\n               They've both vanished. John ducks under the water.\n\n               John's underwater P.O.V.: It's too murky to see anything.\n\n               The two surface, breathing hard, laughing. John watches them.\n\n               Alexei holds Nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss \n               her. But instead he ducks her and holds her under the water.\n\n               John treads water nearby. She's been under a long time.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Hey.\n\n               John begins to swim toward Alexei. Just as he gets near, \n               Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering -- she \n               shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry.\n\n               Alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, \n               almost slapping him. She is very uncomfortable. She swims \n               away.\n\n               Yuri admonishes his friend in Russian. Alexei stares at John, \n               then swims off powerfully back towards the shore.\n\n<b>                                     YURI\n</b>                         He's just having fun.

He tries it on. It's a good four sizes too big, \n               the arms are too long and it hangs down to mid-thigh.

Without warning she slaps his face, equally \n               hard.\n\n               This starts a long silent fight; kicking, hitting, biting, a \n               real struggle.\n\n               Its intensity is almost sexual, but has the edge of real \n               violence.

John has a Thousand \n               Yard Stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone.\n\n               The Waitress comes over.\n\n<b>                                     WAITRESS\n</b>                         Good morning.

Nadia lights a cigarette and they \n               sit in tense silence, the pain of betrayal, and recent \n               violence, thick in the air.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         You can't smoke in here.\n\n               Nadia ignores him.

A waitress comes over and \n               puts down two coffees.\n\n<b>                                     NADIA\n</b>                         I don't expect you to understand.\n\n               It seems as if John has no intention of replying. He sips \n               his coffee, and puts it down. He begins speaking very calmly.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Oh, I don't know.

But, you see, I'm \n                         not in that line of work anymore. \n                         Nowadays I'm a bank robber.\n\n<b>                                     NADIA\n</b>                         You don't understand anything.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         I think that about covers it.

That's got to smart \n                         a bit. I mean strictly in my \n                         observer's capacity it seemed you \n                         two were getting on Pretty Fucking \n                         Famously.\n\n               He sips his coffee.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Unless. Unless this is part of the \n                         routine. You get tied up, stick \n                         around, distract me, they both bust \n                         in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.\n\n<b>                                     NADIA\n</b>                         It's makes it easier.

It's \n                         pretty obvious why.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         That's a relief.

Passengers \n               swirl around him.\n\n               He looks at the binocular in his hands. He removes the \n               binoculars and looks at them. Suddenly he stops. In the case \n               is a folded note marked John. John holds it in his hands -- \n               Slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the \n               case like a bin.\n\n<b>               P.O.V.

He \n               raises them for one last look.\n\n               Nadia, glimpsed through the crowd. We spy someone standing \n               about twenty feet behind her. It is Alexei.\n\n               We watch Alexei approach her. She looks up and is completely \n               thrown.\n\n               Yuri stands about ten feet away, in shades.\n\n               John lowers the binoculars, horrified. He looks again.\n\n               Nadia pulls her arm away. Alexei crouches down in front of \n               her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her.\n\n               Alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away.\n\n<b>               EXT.

John hides behind a car, and watches the taxi pull \n               up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away. He watches \n               the trio head into the hotel.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOTEL PERIMETER - NIGHT\n</b>\n               John skirts around the edge of the hotel.

BACK OF HOTEL - NIGHT\n</b>\n               At the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of \n               windows. Suddenly he drops like he's been shot, and sits on \n               the grass.\n\n               Warily he looks again.\n\n<b>               EXT. / INT.

Nadia is resisting \n               and yells back, but something Alexei says seems to melt her \n               resolve.\n\n               He holds her face, and kisses it. She turns her face. He \n               tries again, and this time she accepts the kiss. Slowly she \n               kisses him back.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He kisses Nadia again and leaves.\n\n               Nadia is alone. She looks very sad and confused.

OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               John watches Nadia walk over to the dresser and search the \n               drawers. She goes over to the bed and looks under the pillow. \n               There she finds what she is looking for. Alexei's hunting \n               knife.\n\n               She hears Alexei coming and stands hard against the window. \n               the huge knife behind her back.\n\n<b>               EXT.

At once he springs \n               up and skirts the building again. He finds a window to the \n               next suite.\n\n               He tries to force it open. Suddenly Yuri's face appears in \n               the window, cupped by his hands peering out into the \n               blackness. John drops down holds his breath.\n\n               John scrambles back to the previous window. With real effort \n               he presses it open.

He is at the opposite \n               end of a corridor from the bedroom. He can hear Alexei's \n               voice.\n\n               Breathing hard, he tiptoes out and stands in the corridor, \n               his back pressed hard against the wall.

He grabs \n               the knife, just as John brains him with one of the guitars. \n               It emits a fruity final chord.\n\n<b>               INT.

The Policeman explains \n               to the airline staff.\n\n               We see that Nadia is one behind in the queue. The Police \n               turn and walk away.\n\n<b>               INT. AIRPORT BOARDING GATE - FLIGHT 1311 TO MOSCOW - DAY\n</b>\n               John pushes his passport and ticket under the perspex window. \n               He glances at Nadia, then looks at the young airport official, \n               the blood beating in his ears.\n\n               For a few interminable seconds the official's eyes burn into \n               John. John turns to Nadia and holds her gaze.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Kam. Kapsi. Schta.\n\n               The subtitle appears: You've saved me.\n\n               Nadia looks down at the floor. She smiles.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT: The passport is snapped shut and pushed back \n               through.\n\n<b>               INT. AIRPORT BOARDING CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\n               John walks without looking back. He turns to see Nadia is \n               behind him. As they round the corner, she hands him a case.\n\n               They walk side by side without speaking.\n\n               Both look forward, straight-faced, as it both are thinking \n               about what it is that they are actually doing. John looks \n               back once, but he keeps walking. He looks across at Nadia, \n               but she doesn't look back.\n\n               They stop opposite the automatic boarding doors. Nadia turns \n               to John.\n\n<b>                                     NADIA\n</b>                         My name's Sophia.\n\n<b>                                     JOHN\n</b>                         Sophia.

John and Sophia walk through, and \n               disappear.\n\n               SFX. The roar of Jet engines.\n\n<b>               EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               With a deafening roar, an Aeroflot Boeing 757 lifts slowly \n               from the runway and climbs up into the night sky, where it \n               becomes a distant star.\n\n<b>               EXT.

She squints up at the \n               sun.\n\n               A voice calls her.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n</b>                         Nadia!\n\n               The girl looks round.\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n</b>                         Nadia!\n\n               She runs past us and we follow to see a couple sitting on \n               the grass having a picnic.\n\n               The girl hurries towards them and we realise the couple are \n               John and Sophia, the girl her child.
