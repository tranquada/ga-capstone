I know this is kind of\n                    random, but I thought I should\n                    write you. We met at that party at\n                    Norman's apartment. I was the INS\n                    guy who hated his life and hated\n                    you. I just wanted to tell you\n                    that I took your advice. I quit my\n                    job and have founded a home in\n                    Botswana for elderly orangutans.\n                    I've never been happier. You told\n                    me to say \"yes\" and it has turned\n                    out to be incredible.
