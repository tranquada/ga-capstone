DON CORLEONE'S OLD OFFICE - CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\nCORLEONE - DAY\n\nstanding impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned\nKing.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.\nThen it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and\nchair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over\nthis, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,\nas THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY\n\nWe can barely make out the funeral procession passing over\nthe burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move\nslowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.\n\nThe MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their\ninstruments harsh and blaring.\n\nThey are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the\ncrude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a\nstrong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the\narms of those walking with her.\n\nBehind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and\npaisani continue alone behind the coffin.\n\nSuddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians\nstop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd\ndirections along the rocky river bed.\n\nThe young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,\nthrowing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.\nWe hear a woman SCREAMING:\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tThey've killed young Paolo!  They've\n\t\tkilled the boy Paolo!\n\nEXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY\n\nacross the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on\nthe parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of\nthe mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and\nveils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to\nwail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the\nmother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his\nfresh blood wetting her strong hands.\n\nEXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY\n\nA boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being\npulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is\nto become The Godfather.\n\nThe VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by\nhis Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the\nornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.\n\nAt various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,\nor lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy\nare shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He\nwears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt\nsloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat\nto protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays\na gold watch and chain over his vest.\n\nHe sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,\nlistening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only\nson.\n\n\t\t\t\tWIDOW\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tDon Francesco.  You murdered my\n\t\thusband, because he would not bend.\n\t\tAnd his oldest son Paolo, because\n\t\the swore revenge.  But Vitone is\n\t\tonly nine, and dumb-witted.  He\n\t\tnever speaks.\n\n\t\t\t\tDON FRANCESCO\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tI'm not afraid of his words.\n\n\t\t\t\tWIDOW\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tHe is weak.\n\n\t\t\t\tDON FRANCESCO\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tHe will grow strong.\n\n\t\t\t\tWIDOW\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tThe child cannot harm you.\n\n\t\t\t\tDON FRANCESCO\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tHe will be a man, and then he will\n\t\tcome for revenge.\n\nAs she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she\nhas practically thrown herself to her knees before him.\n\n\t\t\t\tWIDOW\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tI beg you, Don Francesco, spare my\n\t\tonly son.  He is all I have.  In\n\t\tthe name of the Holy Spirit, I\n\t\tswear he will never be a danger to\n\t\tyou...\n\nSuddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden\na kitchen knife.\n\n\t\t\t\tWIDOW\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tBut I will kill you myself!\n\t\t\t(she lunges at the\n\t\t\tMafia chieftain)\n\t\tVitone, go!\n\nThe boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then\nthere is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother\nflung a distance of five feet from the short range of the\nterrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn\ntheir attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is\nquick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.\n\nEXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT\n\nTwo men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying\nlupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a\nloud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their\nnames are MOSCA and STROLLO.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOSCA\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tOur Friend promises misery to\n\t\tanyone who harbors the boy Vito\n\t\tAndolini.\n\t\t\t(he turns and shouts\n\t\t\tin the other direction)\n\t\tOur Friend promises misery to\n\t\tanyone who harbors the boy Vito\n\t\tAndolini.\n\nINT.

THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT\n\nThe men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far\nin the distance.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOSCA\n\t\t\t(Sicilian O.S.)\n\t\t...misery to any family who harbors\n\t\tthe boy, Vito...\n\nINT. A BARN - NIGHT\n\nFour little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and\nfather bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift\nhim up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load\nof firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically\ncalm little face.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATHER\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tVito...We pray for you.\n\nHe pulls the fabric over the boy's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOSCA\n\t\t\t(Sicilian O.S.)\n\t\t...Andolini...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTROLLO\n\t\t\t(Sicilian O.S.)\n\t\tOur Friend promises misery to any\n\t\tfamily...\n\nEXT.

STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY\n\nhuddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.\nHe does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW\nALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled\ntogether with all their earthly possessions on their way to\nAmerica.\n\nThen, suddenly, the Waltz stops.\n\nTHE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY\n\nSILENCE.

ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY\n\nThe hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in\nthe great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and\nprocessing rooms above.\n\nThere is the babble of many interviews going on\nsimultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.\n\nVito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on\nit: \"Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia.\"\n\nHe stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant\nboys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.\nWeak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,\nderisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles\nto his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in\nan icy hatred.\n\nINT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY\n\nThree or four interviews are crowded into the small room;\nthey are conducted in English.  From the expression on\nVito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we\nrealize that he doesn't understand a word of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tOFFICIAL\n\t\t\t(English)\n\t\tWhat is your name?\n\nThe man waits, impatiently.\n\n\t\t\t\tOFFICIAL\n\t\tYour name?\n\nVito doesn't answer.

QUARANTINE HALLWAY - DAY\n\nThe official stops at each doorway, and reads off a name.\n\n\t\t\t\tOFFICIAL\n\t\tSalvatore Ormenta.\n\nThe man moves into the room, and the group proceeds.\n\n\t\t\t\tOFFICIAL\n\t\tVito Corleone.\n\nNo one responds.  The guard moves to the boy, reads his new\nname tag.  And then, not unkindly:\n\n\t\t\t\tGUARD\n\t\tThat's you.\n\nHe opens the door, and Vito enters the room.\n\nEXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY\n\nThe VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be\nthe view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands\non his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred\nwindow.\n\nThen he turns, and sits in the corner.

Turnbull's a heavy\n\t\tgambler, and into us for over a\n\t\thundred grand, so I figure his\n\t\tinformation is reliable.\n\nNeri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAGEN\n\t\tThe Senator can be set up; but he\n\t\tthinks of himself as a clean\n\t\tpolitician.  So it's got to be on\n\t\tterms he can live with: campaign\n\t\tcontribution, donation to a\n\t\tcharitable cause that he controls,\n\t\tthings like that.  If he gets even\n\t\tthe inkling that you think you're\n\t\tbuying him, he'll freeze up.\n\t\tNevada's a funny state, they like\n\t\tthings both ways here... All right.\n\t\tTurnbull says the Senator will be\n\t\there at two-thirty, and he's been\n\t\tprimed.  He knows you'll want to\n\t\tmeet with him alone, and he knows\n\t\tit's about the Tropicana's license.\n\t\tAt any rate, he expects to be\n\t\tintroduced around to some of the\n\t\tinfluential people here today, and\n\t\tgenerally treated as an ordinary\n\t\tguest.  Just go light on him,\n\t\tMikey, sometimes the biggest crooks\n\t\tdon't like to think of themselves\n\t\tas crooks...\n\nMichael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was\nunnecessary.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAGEN\n\t\tI'm sorry; of course, you know that.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tTwo-thirty.

You have a house here,\n\t\twith us.  You can live here with\n\t\tyour kids...and you won't be\n\t\tdeprived of anything.  I don't know\n\t\tmuch about Merle; I don't know what\n\t\the does for a living; what he lives\n\t\ton.  Why don't you tell him marriage\n\t\tis really out of the question; and\n\t\tthat you can't see him any more.\n\t\tHe'll understand.  But if you\n\t\tdisobey me, and marry this pimp...it\n\t\twould disappoint me.\n\n\t\t\t\tCONNIE\n\t\tIt was my father's money; and I'm\n\t\tentitled to what I need.

He slips in, and makes his way past the open\nwindows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the\nMass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.\n\nHe moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nThree young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nA slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside\nto the alley where he can look into the apartment.\n\nANOTHER VIEW\n\nFanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO\n\nHe begins to wrap the gun.\n\nVIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS\n\nTheir father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious\ngift he has bought for each.\n\nCLOSE ON THE GUN\n\nwrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW\nTILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all\nor none of them.  Then something catches his eye.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nA small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes\nup to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the\nanimal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its\nconfidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's\napartment.\n\nHe steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian\nshouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of\nthe thumping footsteps of Fanucci.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nholding the wrapped gun, waiting.\n\nWHAT HE SEES:\n\nThe white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in\nItalian as he throws the cat out.\n\nVIEW ON VITO\n\nsqueezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST\nresounding in the building.\n\nVIEW ON FANUCCI\n\nHe holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying\nto reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn\nthe buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun\nis exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront\nof his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into\nthis vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.\n\nFanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a\nterrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside\nthe apartment.\n\nVito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,\nquickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.\nNow the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,\nliterally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the\nground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.\n\nEXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT\n\nVito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the\nconclusion of the Mass down below.\n\nCLOSE ON VITO\n\nPausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and\ncandles on the streets below.\n\nHe empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against\nthe side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and\nbreaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.\nHe smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and\nhandle, two separate pieces.\n\nHe then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate\nfragments into various air shafts.\n\nEXT.

Some of the\nmen drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR\nthe music and night sounds of the Festa.\n\nA neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.\n\nQuietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance\nfrom his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of\nwine, and listens to the song.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO\n\nlistening to the song.  He reaches out and takes the small\nhand of his son.\n\n\t\t\t\tVITO\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tSantino, your papa loves you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.\nWe can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built\nalong the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone\nenter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony\nlies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his\nsmall hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,\nAnthony turns, his eyes open.

MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of\nthe large bed.\n\nKay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door\nto his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down\nto the pillow.\n\nVIEW ON THE PILLOW\n\nis a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a\nhat sitting in the back seat.\n\nAn arrow pointing to him is marked \"DAD.\" Under it, a nine\nyear old's handwriting says: \"Do you like it?  Check YES __\nI liked it or NO __ I didn't like it.\" Michael turns,\nlooking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he\nplaces a check next to \"YES.\"\n\nHe starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay\nturns, almost in her sleep:\n\n\t\t\t\tKAY\n\t\tMichael?  Why are the drapes open?\n\nHis eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows\nof the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a\nsecond's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding\nhis son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep\nacross the windows; glass shattering all over the room.\n\nKay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls\ntoward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.\n\nThen, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the\nshouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as\nguards with flashlights come running.\n\nMichael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,\nand then gently:\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tGo with the kids.\n\nEXT.

MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nKay, the children, and some women servants have come down\nfrom the various rooms into the central living area, that\ncan be most easily secured.  The little girl is still\nasleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with\ntheir blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a\ncentral room.\n\nMichael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tIt will be all right.  We were lucky.\n\nShe says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels\nover the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She\nholds her young daughter in her arms.\n\nThe door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is\nholding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and\nputs it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance\naway from Kay.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCCO\n\t\tYour family all seem to be okay in\n\t\tthe other houses; your Mother's\n\t\tstill sleeping.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tAnd?\n\n\t\t\t\tROCCO\n\t\tNo sign of them yet; but they're\n\t\tstill on the Estate.\n\nWe HEAR loud shouting from outside.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEANNA (O.S.)\n\t\tGoddamn you!

Who should be the\n\t\tmanager of a dime store, Joe or\n\t\tJack?  Unimportant.  You do what\n\t\tyou think is right.  You're a young\n\t\tman, and I'm old and sick.  What we\n\t\tdo together in the next few months\n\t\twill be history, Michael; it has\n\t\tnever been done before.

Occasionally, we\nsee a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,\ncarrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all\nof these street impressions, the city is booming with\nactivity, but there is also much evidence of whores and\npimps and little children begging in the streets.\n\nMED. VIEW\n\nThe big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is\nsitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in\nthe back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees\nfour Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their\nhands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.\nThe Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away\nin Spanish.\n\nINT.

He hurls himself\ninto the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A\nsecond later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously\nhaving hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own\nlife to take the life of the Captain.\n\nThere is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.\n\nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL\n\nwatching.

Ask your friends in\n\t\tthis neighborhood about me, they'll\n\t\ttell you I'm a man who believes in\n\t\tshowing his gratitude.\n\nWithout a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto\nstanding in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the\nmoney.\n\nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY\n\nA thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in\nthis Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.\n\nHe carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is\npursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about\nhis own age, eighteen.\n\n\t\t\t\tITALIAN BOY\n\t\tKid, where do you live?\n\n\t\t\t\tANOTHER\n\t\tWhere'd you get those nigger lips?\n\nHe tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,\nsteps in front of him and stops him.\n\n\t\t\t\tITALIAN BOY\n\t\tSay 'bread' in Italian.\n\n\t\t\t\tANOTHER\n\t\tHe dunno.\n\n\t\t\t\tITALIAN BOY\n\t\tGo on; how do you say 'bread' in\n\t\tItalian?  If you're from the\n\t\tneighborhood, you should know how\n\t\tto say 'bread' in Italian.\n\nAn amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee\nhouse, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the\nneighborhood, and loves a fight.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tWhat's up?\n\n\t\t\t\tITALIAN BOY\n\t\tThis kid lives around here, but he\n\t\tcan't say bread in Italian.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tThat's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at\n\t\tthose pregnant lips!\n\nHe giggles at his own joke.\n\n\t\t\t\tITALIAN BOY\n\t\tAre you a Jewboy?\n\nThe boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.\n\n\t\t\t\tITALIAN BOY\n\t\tWell, if you're not a Jew, say\n\t\t'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.\n\nAnd with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,\nsending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a\nclatter.\n\nThe other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to\nthe boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold\nof his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement\nas well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the\nsidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tAlright, alright, cut it out.\n\n\t\t\t\tSECOND ITALIAN\n\t\tWhat for?  He killed Jesus Christ!\n\nClemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tI said cut it out!\n\t\t\t(to the beaten kid)\n\t\tWhat's your name?\n\n\t\t\t\tHYMAN\n\t\tHyman Suchowsky.\n\n\t\t\t\tITALIAN BOY\n\t\tI don't believe it.  In our\n\t\tneighborhood, with a name like that!\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tWhat are those tools?  You work on\n\t\tcars?\n\n\t\t\t\tHYMAN\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tMaybe I know how you can make a\n\t\tcouple of extra bucks working as a\n\t\tmechanic.\n\nThe boy seems agreeable.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tBut you gotta know how to keep your\n\t\tmouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get\n\t\trid of that name.  I'll call you\n\t\tJohnny Lips.\n\t\t\t(he giggles at his\n\t\t\town humor again)\n\t\tCome on...\n\nHe leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the\nside:\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tBread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,\n\t\tpane.  Don't forget.\n\nINT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nA newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new\nproduct \"GENCO PURA\" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a\nnew business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one\nrattling old truck, and a few stock boys.\n\nGenco has become the accountant-business manager, based on\nthe experience working with his father.  But it is clear,\nthat Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the\nnew enterprise.\n\nGenco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the\nsmall divided area that Vito uses as his office.\n\n\t\t\t\tGENCO\n\t\t\t(Sicilian)\n\t\tThe 'patrone' is here.\n\n\t\t\t\tVITO\n\t\tChi?\n\n\t\t\t\tGENCO\n\t\tRoberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'\n\nVito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on\ntiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n\t\tExcuse me, I hope I am not a\n\t\tdisturbance, Don Corleone.\n\n\t\t\t\tVITO\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n\t\tWhat a terrible misunderstanding.\n\t\tOf course, Signora Colombo can stay\n\t\tin the flat.  Who were those\n\t\tmiserable tenants to complain about\n\t\tnoise from a poor animal...when\n\t\tthey pay such low rent.\n\nThen abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,\nand steps back a respectful distance.\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n\t\tYour good heart in helping the poor\n\t\twidow has shamed me, and I want to\n\t\tshow that I, too, have some\n\t\tChristian charity.  Her rent will\n\t\tremain what it was.\n\n\t\t\t\tVITO\n\t\tWhat was that?\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n\t\tIn fact, reduced, bu five dollars!\n\nVito embraces him warmly.\n\n\t\t\t\tVITO\n\t\tI accept your generosity...\n\n\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n\t\tI won't keep you another minute...\n\nHe quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then\nmakes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,\ndeflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned\ntoo jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs\nout of the warehouse.\n\nGenco laughs as he watches.\n\n\t\t\t\tGENCO\n\t\tWe won't see him for weeks!  He'll\n\t\tstay in bed in the Bronx!\n\nClemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice\nthe subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no\nlonger a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an\nimposing leader.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tThis kid is good with cars; he\n\t\tkiijed at the truck, and says he\n\t\tcan keep it going.\n\nVito looks over the lanky young man.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tWhat's your name?\n\n\t\t\t\tHYMAN\n\t\tSuchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tHe's gonna dump that; I call him\n\t\tJohnny Lips.\n\n\t\t\t\tVITO\n\t\tWho is the greatest man you can\n\t\tthink of?\n\n\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n\t\tGo on, answer him when he talks to\n\t\tyou.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...\n\t\tGaribaldi.\n\n\t\t\t\tHYMAN\n\t\tArnold Rothstein.\n\n\t\t\t\tVITO\n\t\tThen take that as your name: Hyman\n\t\tRothstein.\n\nGenco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.\n\n\t\t\t\tGENCO\n\t\tVitone!  Look at this!\n\nVito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly\nchristened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.\n\nEXT.

Was\n\t\tthis alias in certain circles\n\t\tGODFATHER?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tIt was not an alias.  GODFATHER was\n\t\ta term of affection, used by his\n\t\tfriends, one of respect.\n\n\t\t\t\tSENATOR WEEKLER\n\t\t\t(Senator from New\n\t\t\tYork, very smooth,\n\t\t\tpartly liberal,\n\t\t\tTammany Hall)\n\t\tLet me agree with that.  Many of my\n\t\tconstituents are Italian and have\n\t\tbeen honored with that certain\n\t\tfriendship by my close Italian\n\t\tfriends.  Up to this point before I\n\t\thave to leave this hearing to join\n\t\tmy own committee, let me say, that\n\t\tthis hearing on the Mafia is in no\n\t\tway a slur on the Italians by the\n\t\tSenate; nor is it meant to be; nor\n\t\twill I allow it to be.  Italian\n\t\tAmericans are the hardest working,\n\t\tmost law abiding patriotic Americans\n\t\tof our country.  It is a shame and\n\t\ta pity that a few rotten apples\n\t\tgive them a bad name.  We are here\n\t\tto weed those rotten apples out of\n\t\tthe vast healthy barrel of Italian\n\t\tAmericans, who are one of the\n\t\tbackbones of our country.\n\nThere is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator\nposes for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he\nwill not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\tSENATOR KANE\n\t\tI'm sure we all agree with our\n\t\testeemed colleague.  Now, Mr.\n\t\tCorleone, you have been advised as\n\t\tto your legal rights.

I own some stock\n\t\tin some of the hotels, but only\n\t\tvery small amounts.

He has not taken that\n\t\tFifth Amendment as it was his right\n\t\tto do, and which because of the\n\t\textreme legal complexity of this\n\t\thearing, counsel advised him to do.\n\t\tSo, I think in all fairness this\n\t\tcommittee should hear his statement\n\t\tand put it in the record.\n\n\t\t\t\tSENATOR KANE\n\t\tVery well.\n\nAt this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the\nhearing room.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t(reading)\n\t\tIn the hopes of clearing my family\n\t\tname, in the sincere desire to give\n\t\tmy children their fair share of the\n\t\tAmerican way of life without a\n\t\tblemish on their name and background\n\t\tI have appeared before this\n\t\tcommittee and given it all the\n\t\tcooperation in my power.  I consider\n\t\tmy being called before this\n\t\tcommittee an act of prejudice to\n\t\tall Americans of Italian extraction.\n\t\tI consider it a great dishonor to\n\t\tme personally to have to deny that\n\t\tI am a criminal.  I wish to have\n\t\tthe following noted for the record.\n\t\tThat I served my country faithfully\n\t\tand honorably in World War II and\n\t\twas awarded the Distinguished\n\t\tService Cross for actions in\n\t\tdefense of my country.

Only one\n\t\tman has made charges against me,\n\t\tand that man is known to be a\n\t\tmurderer, arsonist and rapist.  And\n\t\tyet this committee had used this\n\t\tperson to besmirch my name.  My\n\t\tpersonal protest can only be made\n\t\tto the people of this country.  I\n\t\tcan only thank God that in this\n\t\tcountry we have a legal system and\n\t\tcourts of law to protect innocent\n\t\tpeople from wild accusation.  I\n\t\tthank God for our democratic due\n\t\tprocess of Law that shields me from\n\t\tthe false charges made by this\n\t\tcommittee's witness.  I have not\n\t\ttaken refuge behind the Fifth\n\t\tAmendment, though counsel advised\n\t\tme to do so.  I challenge this\n\t\tcommittee to produce any witness or\n\t\tevidence against me, and if they do\n\t\tnot, I hope they will have the\n\t\tdecency to clear my name with the\n\t\tsame publicity with which they have\n\t\tnow besmirched it.  I ask this\n\t\twithout malice, in the interests of\n\t\tfair play.\n\nThe television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen\nhands the document over to the committee lawyer.\n\n\t\t\t\tSENATOR ROGERS\n\t\tWe are all impressed.  The committee\n\t\twill now recess over the weekend.\n\t\tHowever, it will continue Monday\n\t\tmorning, at eleven a.m.  At that\n\t\ttime, this committee will then\n\t\tproduce a witness directly linking\n\t\tMr. Corleone to the charges we have\n\t\tmade.  And then, Mr. Corleone may\n\t\tvery well by liable for indictments\n\t\tof perjury.  However, this document\n\t\twill be made a matter of record.\n\nEXT.

Just\n\t\tshow his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tThat's all.  You see, in Sicily, in\n\t\tthe old days... there was only one\n\t\tlegitimate reason to kill a blood\n\t\trelative... only one.

This was between the two\n\t\tbrothers.  Years ago Frankie had a\n\t\tyoung girlfriend; he called her his\n\t\tco-wife.  That was his joke, but he\n\t\tmeant it.  He wouldn't divorce his\n\t\twife... because she was a great\n\t\tcook.  He said he girlfriend made a\n\t\tspaghetti sauce once and it was so\n\t\tterrible he knew he could never\n\t\tmarry her.  He set her up in a\n\t\thouse in Jersey.  She had to be\n\t\tfaithful... and she had to have kids.\n\t\tAnd she did, two, a boy and a girl.\n\t\tHe had her checked out and watched\n\t\tso she couldn't cheat... but the\n\t\tgirl couldn't stand that kind of\n\t\tlife.  She begged him to let her go.\n\t\tHe did.  He gave her money and made\n\t\ther give up the kids.  Then Frankie\n\t\ttook them to Italy, and had them\n\t\tbrought up by his brother Vincenzo.\n\t\tWhere he knew they'd by safe.\n\nKay begins to realize.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\tWhen he saw his brother in the\n\t\thearing room, he knew what was at\n\t\tstake.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI don't think Vincenzo would have\n\t\tdone it.

You are my\n\t\twife, and they are my children...\n\t\tand I love you and I will not let\n\t\tyou leave, because you are MINE!\n\n\t\t\t\tKAY\n\t\tOh, I do feel things for you,\n\t\tMichael; but now, I think it's pity.\n\t\tFor the first time since I've known\n\t\tyou, you seem so helpless.
