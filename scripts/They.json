BEDROOM - \nDAY\nTiny golden \nwheels and gears turning lazily upon metal rods. Mechanical pieces. Small and \nintricate. Glittering in the sunlight.\nREVEAL\nThe gears are \nturning within an ANTIQUE DESK CLOCK sitting on a book shelf, a small pendulum \nswinging back and forth behind the glass housing.\nThe room is \nbarren except for a pair of open suitcases and a bed that's been stripped. \nSitting on the mattress is ...\nJULIA LEVIN \n...\nSmart and \nclever. Dressed in a graduation gown and staring out the window. She seems to be \nlost in thought, immobile, until the bedroom door swings open and ...\nCONNOR LEVIN, \naged seventeen and wearing a suit and tie, steps inside.\nCONNOR\nDad says we \ngotta get moving. We're late.\nJULIA\nI'm getting \nready.\nCONNOR\nYou're sitting \non the bed.\nJULIA\n(dryly)\nThanks for \nclearing that up. I'll be right down.\nHe steps \nout.\nJulia takes a \nframed picture out of her suitcase -- a candid shot of herself standing with her \nMOTHER, forties, a healthy and vibrant woman.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nSure do miss \nyou.\nAbove her, a \nCEILING FAN rotates. Creating a soft HUMMING.\nEXT. WESTWOOD - \nAPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\nJulia walks out \nof the building where her father, GUY LEVIN, an older man with a kind face, \nwaits. Connor is checking his reflection in the car window, adjusting his tie, \nfussing with his hair.\nGUY\nYou ready?\nJULIA\nAll set. I \npacked up everything.\n(remembering)\nOh, except \nMom's clock -- I think there's something wrong with it. It's not telling the \nright time.\nGUY\nI'll get it \nfixed. Probably just needs a few new parts.\nGuy smiles at \nJulia for a moment. Very warmly.\nGUY (cont'd)\nYou look just \nlike your mother.\nJulia is \nmomentarily uncomfortable. But she recovers, smiles and kisses her father on the \ncheek.\nJULIA\nWe'll be \nlate.\nEXT. UNIVERSITY \nOF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES - CAMPUS - DAY\nStudents \ndressed in graduation caps and gowns are gathered on the campus grounds.\nJulia stands by \nherself, taking pictures with a professional Nikon camera. She focuses the \ncamera upon ...\nTERRY ALBA, 22, \nbeautiful and sexy. Very particular and demanding. She smiles perfectly as Julia \nsnaps the picture. But her boyfriend, SAM BURNSIDE, cute and mischievous, \nsporting pink hair and loud clothes, makes a face.\nWinding her \nfilm, Julia searches a moment, then smiles. Raising her camera lens, she snaps a \npicture of ...\nPAUL LOOMIS \n...\nEarly twenties. \nDark hair. Strapping and perfectly handsome. He wears a blue and gold striped \ntie with his starched white shirt and graduation gown.\nHe kisses her. \nPassionate and gentle.\nPAUL\nYou packed \nup?\nJULIA\nReady to move \nin. I'll be storing some of the stuff you've already got. Television. CD player. \nMicrowave.\nPAUL\n(suggestively)\nBed.\nJulia smiles at \nhim.\nJULIA\nBed.\nPAUL\nMed School \ndoesn't start until August. At least not for the freshmen, so we've got plenty \nof time to see Europe, take the car trip up north ...\nJULIA\nI hope it won't \nbe a drag. There's a lot of stuff to move out of my mother's cabin.\nPAUL\nOur friends \nwill be there.

Where's your Dad?\nBeat.\nPAUL\nHe's not \ncoming.\nJULIA\nBut it's your \ngraduation.\nPaul shrugs \nagain. A brief sting of hurt on his face.\nPAUL\nWasn't a good \nenough reason in High School either.\nPaul looks \naway. Julia knows how painful this is and won't insult him by trying to diminish \nit.\nJulia smiles \nand runs her finger across his tie knot.\nJULIA\nI like your \ntie. UCLA colors.\nPAUL\nSchool spirit. \nI am a Bruin.\nThe lines start \nmoving towards the stadium. Hundreds of CHEERS rise up from the graduating \nstudents.\nAs she walks, a \nsound draws Julia's attention. Standing on the lawn is a SMALL BOY, no more than \nfour years-old, SOBBING and clinging to his mother's legs.\nJulia stops \nwalking as she gazes at the child. The line comes to a halt behind her.\nPAUL \n(cont'd)\nJulia. We can't \ngraduate unless you move.\nJULIA\nSorry.\nShe stalks \nwalking again. Paul puts his arms around her.\nEXT. SAM'S \nHOUSE - GARDEN - DAY\nA big, \ntraditional house nestled in the hills. PARENTS and graduating STUDENTS exchange \npolite conversation in the yard.\nEXT. SAM'S \nHOUSE - BACK PORCH - DAY\nSitting between \na pair of open french doors is \"the gang\" consisting of Julia and Paul and Terry \nand Sam. They throw around conversation, ignoring the party.\nTERRY\nIt's secluded? \nNobody said anything to me about the cabin being secluded.\nJULIA\nI said it was a \ncabin in the woods. I thought seclusion was a given.\nTERRY\nI'm no good out \nin the woods. You know what lives in the woods? Animals that sting. Animals that \nbite.\nPAUL\nSo avoid the \nanimals.\nJULIA\nI really \nappreciate you guys helping me. I couldn't move everything alone.\nSAM\nHey, it's our \nlast chance to be together. Terry and I are excited.\n(turns)\nAren't we, \nTer?\nShe's not \nexcited.\nTERRY\nCan I bring my \ncotton bedsheets to the cabin? If I try to sleep in anything but cotton, I get \nhives.\nJULIA\nWhatever makes \nyou happy.\nSam grabs a \nlarge drawing pad from the steps. He opens it.\nSAM\nSpeaking of \nwhich, I've got your graduation gift. As specified.\nJULIA\nLet's see.\nSam holds up a \nsketch of Clark Kent changing to Superman.\nSAM\nLike it?\nJULIA\nIt's great. \nThanks Sam.\nPaul checks out \nthe drawing. His nose crinkles.\nPAUL\nSuperman? Why'd \nyou want a drawing of Superman? \nJULIA\nHe's very \nattractive.\nPAUL\n(staring)\nYou're \nkidding.\nJULIA\nNo.\nPAUL\nHe's not even \nreal.\nJULIA\nI think most \nwomen tend to wonder if Superman is super in every way.\nTERRY\nI don't.\nPAUL\nYou see.

SAM'S \nHOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY\nJulia finishes \nwashing her hands. Dries them. Grabbing her camera and the drawing, Julia opens \nthe bathroom door ...\nINT. SAM'S \nHOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n... and \nfreezes. Standing within an open bedroom is ...\nA BLOND \nSTUDENT.\nAnother college \ngraduate. Tan and attractive. Dressed exactly like Paul -- identical white \nshirt, gold and blue striped tie. He pulls off his tie and unbuttons his \nshirt.\nJulia doesn't \nmove.\nThe student \npeels off his shirt. Her eyes are drawn to a Superman \"S\" insignia tattooed on \nhis shoulder.\nThe student \ncatches sight of Julia in the hallway. Her face turns bright red immediately. \nShe starts to laugh.\nHe smiles at \nher. A bit flattered. Flirting.\nSTUDENT\nChanging into \nsomething more formal.\nHe holds up a \npair of ripped jeans.\nJulia backs \ndown the hallway. Still laughing. Embarrassed.\nJULIA\nI'm sorry. I \nwas just using the ...\n(laughs)\nReally. I'm \nsorry.\nSTUDENT\nI'll forgive \nyou this once.\nShe quickly \nleaves.\nThe blond \nstudent watches her go. A grin on his face.\nEXT. SAM'S \nHOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY\nJulia walks out \nthe back door. Stifling her laughter.\nPaul is talking \nwith Guy on the lawn. Julia SNAPS a picture of them together, winds her film, \nand notices ...\nA LITTLE GIRL \n...\nSweet and \ninnocent. Sitting on a bench. Motionless.\nJulia walks \ntowards her. The little girl is staring across the lawn at a pool shed. \nTransfixed. A group of children are playing on the grass in front of it.\nThe girl \nbecomes aware of Julia's presence and turns around.\nJULIA\nHi.\nGIRL\n(quiet)\nHi.\nSilence.\nJULIA\nYou sitting \nhere all by yourself?\nThe girl slowly \nnods \"Yes.\"\nJULIA (cont'd)\nDon't you want \nto play with the other kids?\nThe girls \nshakes her head \"No.\"\nJULIA (cont'd)\nWant me to \nleave you alone?\nThe girl shakes \nher head \"No.\"\nMore \nsilence.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nWant to mix \nthis up and ask me something?\nThe little girl \nnotices the camera.\nGIRL\nAre you taking \npictures for Sam's family?\nJULIA\nNo, I'm just \n...\n(then)\nI'm a friend of \nSam's. But I'm also a photographer. I take pictures.\nBeat.\nGIRL\nWill you take a \npicture of me?\nJULIA\nWhy?\nGIRL\nSo you won't \nforget me.\nJULIA\n(surprised)\nWhy would I \nforget you?\nGIRL\nBecause they're \ncoming for me.\nA long beat. \nJulia sits next to her.\nJULIA\nWho is?\nGIRL\nThe \nmonsters.\nJULIA\nWhat \nmonsters?\nGIRL\nThere. Behind \nthe door.\nThe girl points \ntowards the pool shed. The rusted door of the shed is slightly open. Just a \ncrack.\nJULIA\nThose other \nkids don't look too scared.\nGIRL\nThey should \nbe.\nBeat.\nJULIA\n(playing \nalong)\nSo how come \nonly you can see them?\nTHE GIRL LEANS \nFORWARD AND SPEAKS IN A HUSHED WHISPER.\nGIRL\nBecause I know \nthey're real. I used to have a little brother, but they came and got him. \nNow my parents say I never had a brother before.\n(pause)\nSoon ... my \nparents won't remember me either.\nSomething about \nthe girl's tone of voice is unnerving. As if she's resigned herself to this.\nA slight wind \nHISSES through the trees. The girl rises.\nGIRL (cont'd)\nI gotta go. \nThey know I'm talking about them.\nJULIA\nWait a \nsecond.\nJulia SNAPS a \npicture of the girl.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nFeel \nbetter?\nThe girl stares \nat her.\nGIRL\nAre you scared \nof monsters?\nJULIA\nNo.\nBeat.\nGIRL\nI am.\nThe girl turns \nand runs across the lawn.\nJulia is left \nsitting on the bench. She glances over at the pool shed again. Raises her camera \nand focuses on the door which is still cracked open.\nShe snaps the \npicture.\nCLICK!\nINT. PAUL'S \nAPARTMENT - NIGHT\nJulia and Paul \nare romantically entangled as they enter the apartment. A little drunk. Kissing \nand frolicking. She strips off his jacket and tie. Paul abruptly stops.\nPAUL\nWait a minute \n...\n(grabbing \nboth sides of his shirt)\nThis is a job \nfor ...\nPaul rips his \nshirt wide open. Buttons popping everywhere. They both start laughing. Joining \ntogether, he guides her towards the bathroom.\nThe wind gently \nHISSES on the balcony. Windchimes spinning.\nINT. BATHROOM - \nNIGHT\nA cloud of hot \nsteam. The soothing rush of warm water running over tanned and naked skin.\nJulia stands \nunderneath the shower, her body relaxing into Paul's chest, his muscular arms \nencircling her body, his lips buried in her neck and shoulders. Her eyes are \nshut. Her expression is calm.\nINTERCUT - \nBLOND STUDENT \nStanding in the \nguest bedroom at Sam's house. Young and muscular. Bathed in sunlight. The tattoo \non his shoulder.\nBACK TO \nJULIA\nHer eyes still \npressed closed. Smiling a little.\nWater continues \nrushing from the shower head, creating a HISS that eventually becomes THE ROAR \nOF THE OCEAN.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT. PACIFIC \nCOAST HIGHWAY - DUSK\nThe setting sun \nblushes crimson across the rolling waves of the Pacific. Streaking along the \nhighway is a RANGE ROVER, packed with luggage, headlights on.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - DUSK\nPaul sits \nbehind the wheel. He's bopping and RAPPING with Sam to HIP-HOP that BLARES from \nthe speakers. Very energized.\nJulia sits on \nthe passenger side, leaning against the window, trying to shut out the music. \nTerry looks just as miserable. Finally, Julia turns off the radio.\nA silent beat. \nThe guys catch their girlfriends' expressions.\nPAUL\nSorry.\nSAM\n(overlapping)\nSorry.\nTerry leans \nforward between the seats.\nTERRY\nSo the cabin \nhas electricity, right? And plumbing? Everything we need?\nJULIA\nUh-huh.\nTERRY\nSo it has \neverything.\nJULIA\nIt has \neverything.\nSAM\nWait a minute. \nI hear a shoe about to drop.\nJULIA\nExcept a \nphone.\nSAM\nBAM! There it \nis.\nTERRY\n(scandalized)\nI need a phone. \nIt's like family to me. Mom, Dad, my brother .... phone.\nJULIA\nSo you're \nroughing it.\nTERRY\nThe last time I \ntried to rough it, I was in therapy for a year. Why didn't your mother have a \nphone?\nJULIA\nI guess she \nwanted to be left alone.\nAt least until \nshe got sick.\nPaul looks to \nher.\nPAUL\nThis won't be \ntoo hard on you, will it?\nStaying at her \nplace?\nJULIA\nIt's okay. I'm \nenjoying this.\nJulia smiles at \nhim. Paul smiles back.\nPAUL\nGood.\nHe switches the \nradio back on and continues RAPPING with Sam. Julia and Terry both stare \nstraight ahead, ears pounding. This is turning into a LONG trip.\nEXT. FOREST \nROAD - NIGHT\nPaul's Range \nRover makes its way down a long, winding road. The Rover's headlights illuminate \nthe woods lining the road on both sides.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - NIGHT\nThe inside of \nthe Range Rover is dark. Only the faint glow from the dashboard lights provides \nany ambient illumination. Sam and Terry are snuggled together in the back seat. \nEverything is quiet.\nJulia is \nthinking. Finally, she breaks the silence.\nJULIA\nDo you believe \nin monsters?\nA beat. \nEveryone else in the car trades looks.\nPAUL\nWe've been in \nthe car too long.\nJULIA\nI'm just \nasking.\nPAUL\nLike what? The \nBoogeyman?\nJULIA\nThe Boogeyman. \nThe thing under the bed. The monster hiding in the closet.\nTERRY\nWhat made you \nthink of that?\nJULIA\nA little girl \nat Sam's house. She was convinced there was a monster trying to get her.\nPAUL\nYou're saying \nyou believe her?\nJulia is \nsuddenly on the spot. She backtracks.\nJULIA\nOf course I \ndon't. There are no monsters. Not really.\nSAM\nSure there are. \nTed Bundy. Son of Sam.\nEd Gein.\nTERRY\nWho was Ed \nGein?\nSAM\nHe was a mass \nmurderer. This old hermit who'd kill people and take the parts he wanted. Heads. \nLivers. Intestines. Sex organs.\nTERRY\nWhy did he use \nthe parts for?\nSAM\nEverything. The \npolice found a skull that was used for a soup bowl. Faces were stuffed and \nmounted like hunting trophies on the wall. Bones were used for furniture.\nPAUL\nHe also wore \ntheir skin. Like clothes.\nTerry recoils \ninto her seat. Grossed out.\nTERRY\nSorry I \nasked.\nSAM\nYou wanted \nproof. There it is.\nJULIA\nBut it's not \nlike he's a monster under the bed.\nSAM\nSo?\nJULIA\nSo why are kids \nafraid of that? \nSAM\nBecause they \nlive in a completely different world than we do.\n(then)\nThink about it. \nWhy do kids pick up on things that we can't? ... Bumps in the night? ... \nfootsteps in the hallway? ... A thumping inside their closet?\nPAUL\nOveractive \nimagination.\nSAM\nWrong. Perfect \nawareness.\n(beat)\nKids have a \nperfect awareness of everything around them. Every sound. Every \nshadow.\nEverything gets \nquiet.\nSAM (cont'd)\nThe Boogeyman \ncould be real. So could monsters. Just because you've never seen them doesn't \nmean they aren't there.\nSilence. The \ncar engine purrs softly. This is starting to make sense. And it's spooky.\nPAUL\nAll right. I'm \ncreeped out. But my bullshit alarm is going off.\nSAM\nYou just can't \nhandle it.\nPAUL\nRight. Because \nit's bullshit.\nJULIA\nSerial killers \naside, my take on this subject is very simple. If I don't have a picture of it \n-- it's not real.\nTERRY\nOkay, is this \nconversation like a radio station? Can we just change the channel? Because \npersonally, I'd like to get to sleep tonight.\nTerry has just \nfinished saying these words, when --\nAN ANIMAL runs out of the woods into the \nmiddle of the road. A black shape in the headlights. Eyes flashing in the \ndark.\nPAUL\nJESUS \nCHRIST!\nPaul SLAMS on \nthe brakes. Too late.\nWHAM! The RANGE ROVER SMASHES into it, \nthrowing the shape into a ditch at the side of the road.\nThe Range Rover \nswerves and comes to a SQUEALING HALT.\nINSIDE THE \nROVER\nEveryone \ncatches their breath. A moment of dead silence.\nPAUL \n(cont'd)\nEveryone \nokay?\nTERRY\n(nods)\nWe're fine.\nJULIA\nWhat was \nthat?\nPAUL\nI think it was \na dog.\nJulia unlocks \nher door.\nJULIA\nWe'd better \ncheck the car.\nShe steps out \nof the Rover. The others follow.\nEXT. FOREST \nROAD - NIGHT\nThe hazard \nlights are switched on. Paul walks around to the front of the Rover.\nThe bumper is \ndented.\nPAUL\nLook at that. \nThere's a couple thousand dollars out of my wallet.\nTERRY\nYou can \nprobably get someone to pop it back.\nPAUL\nSure. For a \ncouple hundred dollars.\nSam looks down \nthe road. He can barely make out a large form resting lifeless in the ditch.\nHe starts \nwalking towards it.\nJULIA\nI'm sorry about \nyour car, Paul ...\nPAUL\n(begrudging)\nYeah, well. \nShit happens.\nThe \nconversation becomes distant as Sam walks slowly up the road, moving past the \nyellow flashing HAZARD LIGHTS which CLICK rhythmically ... click, click, click \n...\nSam approaches \nthe ditch. Darkness is all around.\n.... click ... \nclick ... click ...\nHe kneels down \nalongside the body of the animal. Very little is visible of the corpse except \nfor its dark, mangled form sprawled across the dirt.\nSam picks up a \nstick and pokes at the body. Nothing happens.\nHe pokes at the \ncorpse again.\nThe hind legs \nof the corpse suddenly twitch. A reflex action. Sam leaps back. The life nearly \nscared out of him.\nA flap of \nhairless skin slides away from one of the animal's hind legs. Sam leans forward \nto get a better look, becoming simultaneously repulsed and fascinated.\nSAM\nHey guys!\nPAUL\nWhat?\nSAM\nTake a look at \nthis.\nJULIA\nIs it a \ndog?\nSam glances at \nthe dead corpse and back to his friends again. He looks shaken.\nSAM\nI don't \nknow.\nThe rest of the \ngroup moves down the road. A weird unease has started to settle in.\nPaul and Julia \nkneel down in front of the corpse. It's almost unrecognizable. The darkness \nsmothering the road keeps them from getting a handle on any of the body's \nfeatures.\nPAUL\nIt looks like a \ndog to me.\nSAM\nDid you see the \nleg?\nPAUL\nWhat about \nit?\nSam takes the \nstick and gently pushes away the flap of torn skin for a better look. The group \nleans forward.\nA deep bleeding \nwound has been exposed. Through the torn flesh and blood pumping over charcoal \nskin, the group can see bones flashing into the moonlight. But intermingled with \nthe animal's skeleton are ...\nPIECES OF METAL \n...\nGlittering and \nclean. A series of connected stainless steel threads and pallid bone that have \ngrown together.\nSAM\nEver seen \nanything like that?\nPAUL\nNo.\nSAM\nIt looks like \nsteel. Like someone put steel into its body.\nPAUL\nI don't think \nit was put in there. It looks like it grew that way.\nJULIA\nThat's \nimpossible. What kind of animal has steel in its skeleton?\nTerry steps \nforward tentatively.\nTERRY\nWhat are you \nlooking at?\nJULIA\nAre you sure \nit's dead?\nPAUL\nCome on, honey. \nIt's a dog. Not a zombie.\nSAM\nJulia? Where's \nyour camera?\nJULIA\nIt's in the \ncar.\nPAUL\nI've got \nit.\nPaul races back \nto the Range Rover and opens the passenger door. He withdraws Julia's \ncamera.\nJulia takes a \nstep back into the middle of the road. The wind is sifting through the trees, \ncreating a soft HISSING noise as the branches dance and twist in the \nshadows.\nPaul returns \nand hands the camera to Sam.\nSAM\nYou want to \nturn it over?\nPAUL\nI'm not \ntouching it.\nSam kneels \ndown. He points the camera and shoots.\nThe camera \nflash cuts through the darkness and falls upon the corpse. But only for a \nmillisecond of clarity.\nTwisted metal. \nSkin. Appendages. Madness.\nBoth of the \nyoung men stand frozen, thunderstruck, staring down at the misshapen shape in \nfront of them. A long period of amazed silence follows.\nSAM\nThat's wrong. \nThat's all wrong.\nPaul shakes his \nhead.\nPAUL\nThat's not a \ndog.\nTERRY\n(stunned)\nWhat were those \nthings coming out of its back?\nPaul starts \nrecoiling. His stomach is getting weak.\nPAUL\nThat's not a \ndog.\nThe cool summer \nwind WHISTLES through the trees around them.\nSAM\n(sickened)\nThat doesn't \neven make sense.\nJULIA\nPaul ...\nPaul looks over \nat her.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nLet's get in \nthe car.\nSAM\nWe need some \nflashlights.\nTERRY\n(hushed)\nScrew the \nflashlights.\nSAM\nWhat the hell \nis it?\nPAUL\nDude. We're \noutta here.\nJulia and Paul \nwalk briskly to the Range Rover. Sam and Terry follow them, glancing back over \ntheir shoulders.\nSAM\nWhat the hell \nis it?!\nPaul tosses the \ncamera into the Rover's back seat. He SLAMS the door shut. Julia opens the front \npassenger door.\nA soft THUMPING \nfrom the woods. Almost like footsteps.\nJULIA\nGet in the \ncar.\nJulia hops into \nthe front seat and SLAMS her door.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - NIGHT\nThe atmosphere \nis quickly turning into panic. Paul jumps behind the wheel as both Sam and Terry \nclose their doors.\nSAM\nI want to know \nwhat that thing was.\nPaul presses \nthe automatic door lock. THUNK.\nJULIA\nPaul, start the \ncar.\nPAUL\nKeys ...\nHe searches his \npockets. They're empty. He checks his jacket.\nSAM\nI want to know \nwhat it was.\nPAUL\nWill you shut \nup?\nPaul fishes out \nthe car keys from his jacket pocket. He starts the ignition. The engine ROARS to \nlife.\nJULIA\nGo.\nA heavy THUMP. \nRight outside the back window. Sam and Terry instinctively look towards the rear \nhatch.\nTERRY\nThere's \nsomething behind the car.\nJULIA\nGO!\nPaul hits the \ngas.\nEXT. FOREST \nROAD - NIGHT\nThe Range Rover \ndisappears into the night.\nThe calm and \nunnerving quiet of the woods are left behind. The wind WHISTLES softly.\nEXT. SANTA MIRA \n- FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nA fast food \njoint at the side of the road.\nINT. FAST FOOD \nRESTAURANT - NIGHT\nEveryone is \nsitting quietly at a table. Fast food leavings are littered across their plastic \ntrays. Nobody is saying anything or looking at one another.\nFinally ...\nSAM\nI want to get \nthe body.\nEveryone's face \ndrops into shock. Paul almost laughs.\nPAUL\nYou do that. \nWe'll wait for your ass right here.\nSam leans \nforward in his seat. Intense.\nSAM\nNothing about \nthat thing looked right. Absolutely nothing. There was metal in its \nskeleton.\nTERRY\nMaybe it wasn't \nmetal. It might've just looked like metal.\nSAM\nThere were \nfucking gears, for Chrissake.\nPAUL\nFine. Go back \nout there. Do whatever the hell you want. But count me out. I'm done.\nJULIA\nWe've already \ngot a picture, Sam.\nSAM\nLet's get a few \nmore then. I want to get a good look at that thing up close.\nTERRY\n(adamant)\nI'm not going \nback there.\nSAM\nLet Julia \ndecide. It's her camera.\nThe group \nstares at Julia. She remains silent.\nPAUL\nYour call.\nJulia stares \nback at all of them. A moment.\nA small CHILD \nbegins CRYING and SCREAMING in the restaurant. Julia flinches at the unexpected \nsound, glancing over at the child's parents as they quiet him down.\nShe rises from \nthe table. \nJULIA\nI have to use \nthe bathroom.\nShe walks \nstraight into the bathroom.\nAfter she's \ngone ...\nTERRY\nI'm not going \nback there.\nINT. FAST FOOD \nRESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT\nLarge and \npoorly lit. Several closed bathroom stalls face a row of sinks and a huge \nmirror.\nA toilet \nFLUSHES. Julia leaves one of the stalls and pulls the door closed behind her. \nShe moves to the mirror, washes her hands, and retrieves a brush from her \npurse.\nWater DRIPS \nfrom one of the leaky pipes in the bathroom while the fluorescent bulb over the \nmirror CRACKLES softly. Julia is about to brush her hair, but something unnerves \nher. She cocks her head slightly. A feeling.\nShe turns \naround and checks out the bathroom. The doors to the stalls are all closed shut. \nEmpty and quiet.\nShe starts \nbrushing her hair. A few moments pass. Then, she stops and listens to the water \nDRIPPING from the pipe. Julia turns back around and looks at the bathroom.\nOne of the \nstall doors all the way at the end is now slightly open. Not much. Just enough \nto reveal a patch of darkness and gloom within.\nThe sound of \nwater dripping abruptly stops. Silence follows.\nJulia looks \nlike she's about to crawl out of her skin. She quickly shoves her brush back \ninto her purse and leaves.\nINT. FAST FOOD \nRESTAURANT - NIGHT\nJulia walks \ntowards her friends as they collect themselves. Everyone is slow getting their \nstuff together.\nJULIA\nI want to \nleave.\nPAUL\nHold up. We're \ncoming.\nThe CHILD \nstarts CRYING again. Pointing at the bathroom.\nThis disturbs \nJulia further.\nJULIA\nPaul?\nPAUL\nOkay. Slow \ndown.\nThe group \nleaves the table.\nEXT. FAST FOOD \nRESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS\nThe group \nemerges from the restaurant. The parking lot is almost deserted. No people are \nin sight.\nJulia moves \nleisurely towards the Range Rover, just ahead of Terry and Sam -- but she'd walk \na lot faster if Paul's arm weren't draped around her shoulder. She looks tight \nand nervous. Her eyes scanning the parking lot.\nThe cars are \nempty. Sidewalk litter dances in the wind.\nInside one of the parked cars, a featureless \nSHAPE is sitting behind the wheel. The shape turns and stares at \nthem.\nEveryone piles \ninto the Range Rover. Julia throws a nervous glance back at the SHAPE in the \ncar.\nHe's still \nwatching them.\nEveryone piles \ninto the car.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - CONTINUOUS\nPaul starts the \nengine and pulls out of the parking lot. Julia relaxes into her seat, \nrelieved.\nEXT. SANTA MIRA - TOWN STREET - \nNIGHT\nThe Range Rover \nheads off into the woods.\nEXT. CABIN - \nNIGHT - ESTABLISHING\nA rustic home \nsurrounded by huge pine trees and beach grass overlooking the ocean. There are \nno neighbors in sight. Paul's Range Rover is parked out front.\nINT. CABIN - \nBASEMENT - NIGHT\nThe basement is \nsaturated in a bright red light. Julia is developing a photograph within a small \nbasin. Paul and Terry are seated on the stairs. Sam is pacing.\nSAM\nHow much \nlonger?\nJULIA\nThirty seconds. \nIt's coming out.\nSAM\nI still think \nwe should get the body.\nWe could drive \nout there, haul it into the car ...\nPAUL\nI'm not loading \nthat thing into my car.\nI don't give a \nshit what it is. It's not coming back here.\nJulia lifts the \ndeveloped picture out of the basin.\nJULIA\nDone.\nShe switches on \nthe light. The group crowds around her.\nSAM\nWhat is it? \nWhat does it look like?\nThe photograph \nis blurred. The body is indistinguishable.\nJULIA\nDamn.\nSAM\nWhat happened \nto the picture?\nJULIA\nOut of \nfocus.\nSAM\nWhat do you \nmean it's out of focus? I took the picture. The flash went off.\nJULIA\nSam, this is a \nprofessional camera with a zoom lens. You can't just point and shoot.\nA quiet moment \nas they stare at the picture.\nPAUL\nWell, so much \nfor that.\nSam looks at \nthe picture, then at his friends. With a look of somber frustration, Sam quietly \nturns and charges up the stairs, taking two at a time.\nAfter he's gone \n...\nTERRY\nIt's not a big \ndeal. Whatever it was.\n(then)\nHe'll get over \nit.\nEXT. SANTA MIRA \nCOASTLINE - BEACH - DAY\nCloudy and \novercast. A set of colorless waves CRASH into the rocks. Sam and Julia and Terry \nwalk just beyond the rippling surf, arguing with each other.\nSAM\nI can't get \nover it. That thing looked wrong. Completely wrong.\nJULIA\nOf course it \nlooked wrong. Paul rammed it with his car.\nSAM\nWhat about the \nblood? It wasn't red ... it was black -- it was like ... oil coming from \na busted engine.\nJULIA\nI must've \nmissed that.\nSAM\nLet's find it. Cut it up. Study \nit.\nTERRY\n(measured)\nSam, I realize \nthat you're an extroverted comic book artist and I'm a neurotic. But it's only \nnow at this moment that I'm wondering why we're dating.\nSam turns back \nto Julia --\nSAM\nI'll pay you to \ntake me back.\nJULIA\nYou don't have \nto pay me. Take the car.\nSAM\nThe Rover's a \nshift. I can only drive an automatic.\nJULIA\nAsk Paul.\nSAM\nHe's out \nrunning. Besides, you heard him last night. He'd never do it.\nJulia stares at \nhim.\nJULIA\nIt's a dead \nanimal. \nSAM\nSo come with \nme. You take the pictures this time. If it's just a dead animal, then you're \nright and I'm wrong. But if it's not, we've got a picture of it.\nJULIA\nA picture of \nwhat?\nBeat.\nSAM\nA monster.\nA set of \nfoaming waves HISS as they slide along the sand.\nJulia stands \nwith her arms folded. There's something really creepy about it which she doesn't \nwant to admit.\nJULIA\nMonsters don't \nexist. \nSAM\nWhat...?\n(pause)\nSayin' yes ... \nor saying no?\nJulia stares at \nhim, deadpan. Sam just stares right back.\nEXT. FOREST \nROAD - DAY\nThe same lonely \nstretch of road from the night before.\nThe Range Rover \nappears around a corner and pulls over to the side of the road. Julia opens her \ndoor, camera in hand, and gets out. Sam follows her lead.\nSAM\nThis is it?\nJULIA\nI think so. You \ncan see the way the road turns sharply to the left. The rest of the drive was \nstraight.\nSAM\nYou've got \nfilm, right?\nJULIA\nA new roll. You \ncan have all the pictures you want.\nJulia and Sam \nstart searching the ditch. Feet crunching in the dirt. Moving away from the \ncar.\nA soft THUMP \nechoes from somewhere in the woods. A place just beyond the wall of pine \nbranches and shrubbery that shivers in the breeze.\nSam and Julia \nlook around. They wait. Nothing. Nobody.\nSAM\n(slight \ngrin)\nThe Boogeyman \nlives here.\nJULIA\nSo will you if \nyou keep talking like that.\nThey keep \nwalking. A beat passes.\nSAM\nJulia? Can I \nask you something?\nJULIA\nGo ahead.\nSAM\nLast night on \nthe road, after I took the picture and we started walking to Paul's car, did you \nhave the same feeling?\nJULIA\nWhat \nfeeling?\nSAM\nThat we were \nbeing chased.\nJulia doesn't \nsay anything.\nShe stops cold \nin her tracks. Just ahead of her, resting motionless in the ditch, is ...\nA BODY ...\nSwathed in dark \nfur, twisted at a pathetic angle, huge gashes in its side. The corpse of a Doberman pinscher. Flies are BUZZING \nand swarming over the dog's open wounds.\nJulia and Sam \nmove towards the dog's lifeless form.\nJULIA\nThere's your \nmonster.\nSAM\nThat's a \ndog.\nJULIA\nRight.\nSam kneels in \nfront of the corpse. Waves off some flies.\nSAM\nThat's not what \nI saw.\nJULIA\nI don't see any \nother corpses on the side of the road, do you?\nA long moment. \nSam stares back down at the Doberman's body.\nSAM\nThat's not what \nI saw.\nCLOSE ON THE \nDOG\nEyes slightly \nopen. A misshapen form plagued with flies.\nThe sound of \nINSECTS SWARMING drowns out the WIND HISSING through the trees.\nEXT. FOREST - \nWALKING TRAIL - DAY\nPaul is jogging \nthrough the woods. A light mist hangs in the cool air. The sounds of the forest \nsurround him.\nSuddenly, the \nbirds stop singing. Paul becomes aware of this. He stops running and looks \naround. The forest is deathly still.\nThe sound of a \nTWIG being crushed underfoot. Then nothing.\nAnother moment. \nPaul keeps going, a chill on his spine, looking back over his shoulder.\nEXT. SANTA MIRA \n- TOWN SQUARE - DAY\nA picture \npostcard community consisting of quaint storefront shops and manicured \nparks.\nPaul stands \nright in front of a freshly painted realty office building with a picketed \nfence, sipping a Coke, watching a HOMELESS WOMAN across the street screaming and shouting at traffic. She's right next \nto the parked Range Rover.\nJulia walks out \nof the realty office.\nPAUL\nFinished?\nJULIA\nDone. The cabin \nhas a buyer.\nPAUL\nWhat about the \nmovers?\nJULIA\nThey're coming \non Sunday afternoon so we'll have to start packing.\nThe homeless \nwoman starts walking off down the sidewalk. Moving away from the Rover's parking \nspace.\nPAUL\nGood. She's \nleaving. I thought we were gonna have to make a run for the car.\nJULIA\nI feel sorry \nfor those people.\nPAUL\nMe too. But \nthat doesn't mean I want to get screamed at.\nJULIA\nPeople are \nignoring her. Maybe that's the only way she can get attention.\nPAUL\nShe's doing a \ngood job. Kept me away.\nThey start \ncrossing the street towards the car.\nJULIA\nHow does \nsomeone end up like that?\nPAUL\nI think we're \nwitnessing it first-hand with Sam. What did you guys find on the road \nanyway?\nJULIA\nA dog.\nPaul stares at \nher. Surprised.\nPAUL\nReally?\nJULIA\nYeah. \nPersonally, I'm glad we didn't find Frankenstein's monster.\nPAUL\nYou just like \nbeing right.\nJULIA\n(grins)\nDamn \nstraight.\nEXT. CABIN - \nWALKING TRAIL - DAY\nSam heads away \nfrom the cabin, his drawing sketch pad under his arm, moving into the woods.\nINT. CABIN - \nBASEMENT - DAY\nA picture is \nlifted out of the developing basin. The shot of the little girl from the party. \nHer expression is distant. Tortured.\nBathed in the \nred light, Julia gazes at the picture for a moment, then places it to the side. \nShe goes to work on the next piece of developing paper into the basin. She \nwaits. Rocks the basin a bit.\nThe TIMER in \nthe basement TICKS.\nThe picture \nstarts to manifest. The photo of the children and pool shed at Sam's house.\nJulia frowns \nslightly. Something is wrong with the photograph as the details become more \ntangible. She lifts the photo out of the basin. Mystified.\nCLOSE ON: THE \nPHOTO\nStanding just inside the shed's door is a \nBLURRED FIGURE. Featureless. Barely distinguishable. Hiding in the \ndark.\nEXT. WOODS - \nWALKING TRAIL - DAY\nSam is sitting \non a fallen tree trunk, sketching on his drawing pad with a feverish \nintensity.\nCLOSE ON: THE \nDRAWING\nA rough drawing \nof the animal's leg, intertwined with steel rods and metal threads which \nculminate in a large pulley where the hip bone should be.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nA warm and \ncomfortable cabin. Simple and subdued.\nPaul is seated \non the couch, typing into his powerbook which is hooked up into a phone jack in \nthe wall. Julia stands next to him, holding the photograph.\nJULIA\nI've never seen \nanything like this before. I thought it might be a flaw in the negative, but now \nI'm not so sure. Will you take a look?\nPAUL\n(not \npaying attention)\nOkay.\nHe keeps \nwatching.\nJULIA\nToday.\nPAUL\nI'm busy.\nJULIA\nYou're in a \nchat room with a bunch of strangers.\nPAUL\n(defensive)\nThey're \nfriends.\nJULIA\nOh yeah? What \nare their last names?\nThey sit face \nto face. Paul is speechless for a moment, then impatiently takes the photograph \nand looks at it.\nPAUL\nI don't see \nanything.\nHe puts the \nphoto down and gets back to the chat room.\nJULIA\nYou didn't even \nlook.\nPAUL\n(he \ndidn't)\nI looked.\nJULIA\nThere's \nsomebody in the shed. I couldn't see it when I took the picture, but now it's \nthere.\nPAUL\nI know. Usually \nwhen you take a picture, you can't see a blur.\nPaul smiles at \nher. Completely smug. Julia stares right back.\nJULIA\nGive your \n\"friends\" my best.\nJulia takes the \nphotograph and leaves. Paul types into his computer: \"JULIA SENDS HER BEST.\" The \nmessage pops up next to his user name. Within seconds, several other user names \nin the chat room respond with \"WHO'S JULIA???\"\nINT. KITCHEN - \nNIGHT\nTerry is \nsitting on the counter, twirling her hair and chatting on a CELL PHONE. Julia \nenters the kitchen.\nTERRY\n(on \nthe phone)\nI'm not \nkidding, Dana. There's no phone.\n(beat)\nThere's a jack \nand the phone line works, but there's no phone. Uh-huh. Paul was \nable to get on the internet. I'm using his cell.\nJULIA\n(quietly)\nI need you to \nlook at something.\nTerry nods.\nTERRY\nHold on.\nJULIA\nHere.\nJulia holds out \nthe picture. Terry looks it over briefly.\nTERRY\n(polite)\nNice \npicture.\nShe gets back \nto her phone conversation.\nTERRY (cont'd)\nI'm back.\n(beat)\nI don't know if \nhe has any free minutes, but he definitely won't after this conversation. \nUh-huh. Thank God for AirTouch.\nFrustrated, \nJulia takes the picture and leaves the kitchen.\nEXT. CABIN - \nFRONT PORCH - NIGHT\nThe air is \ncompletely still. A hush has fallen. The only sound is the ocean and crickets chirping in the grass.\nJulia wanders \noutside holding some of the developed photographs from the party. Sam is sitting \non the front steps, working on his drawing.\nJULIA\nSam? Could you \nlook at...\nSam looks up \nfrom his drawing pad.\nSAM\nWhat?\nBeat.\nJULIA\nNever mind.\nJulia sits on \nthe porch glider and looks through the photos. The little girl looking back over \nher shoulder. The blurred shape inside of the shed.\nA moment \npasses. Julia shuts her eyes as a slight breeze comes up. She slips into a \ndream-like state, calm and relaxed, before opening her eyes to find ...\nTHE BLOND \nSTUDENT\nSitting back on \nthe hood of a sports car. Wearing a white tank top undershirt. The tattooed \"S\" \ninsignia visible on his shoulder. Bathed in soft moonlight. He even looks good \nin the dark.\nTheir eyes \nmeet. Smiles are traded between them. The wind sifts gently over the porch.\nIt's all very \ndream-like.\nINT. CABIN - \nBEDROOM - NIGHT\nA spacious \nbedroom. Typical. \nJulia is \nalready in bed and wearing a night shirt. Paul is grinding out a set of \ncrunches.\nJULIA\nIt just would \nhave been nice if somebody had looked at it. You were on the internet. Terry was \non the phone. I felt like I was living with a bunch of machines instead of \npeople.\nPAUL\nSomeone's \noverreacting.\nJULIA\nWould you look \nat it again?\nPAUL\nI already did. \nAnd I still don't see anything. \nPaul gets into \nbed.\nJULIA\nThat little \ngirl said there was a monster in the shed.\nPAUL\n(kisses \nher)\nIt was probably \nanother dog. Good night.\nHe switches off \nthe light. Paul turns over and goes to sleep.\nJulia sits for \na moment in the dark. Alone with her thoughts. She looks over at the walk-in \ncloset across the room.\nThe closet door \nis slightly open. Just a crack. Not enough to provide any clear view of what \nlies within, but just enough for something -- monsters included -- to peek \nout.\nJulia stares at \nthe closet. Spooked. She knows better, but it's dark and her primal fears are \ntaking control.\nJULIA\n(to \nherself)\nStupid.\nShe gets out of \nbed and tiptoes to the closet, shutting the door. Then she gets back into bed. \nSmiling to herself, she goes to sleep.\nEXT. CABIN - \nNIGHT\nThe wind is \npicking up. Trees rustle.\nINT. CABIN - \nBEDROOM - NIGHT\nThe clock on \nthe night table reads 3:15 AM. Julia turns over in her sleep and stirs awake. \nShe groggily looks over towards the closet. Julia practically sits up in \nbed.\nThe closet door is wide open.\nA childhood \nnightmare come to life. Julia's breathing quickens. She reaches towards the \nother side of the bed.\nJULIA\n(a \nwhisper)\nPaul?\nHer hand finds \nnothing but sheets and empty space. There's nobody there. She quickly turns to \nlocate her boyfriend. But he's gone.\nShe tries to \nswitch on the light. CLICK.\nThe light stays \noff. She tries again. CLICK.\nNothing \nhappens.\nThen, she hears \nit. A faint sound. Almost like a shuffling. The sound of something \ndragging itself lightly across the floor to the edge of the bed.\nJulia's throat \nhas gone dry. Carefully, she creeps towards Paul's side of the bed and checks \nthe floor.\nThere is \nnothing in sight. The only sign of movement are the shadows from the trees \noutside.\nThere is only \none place left to look. Julia cautiously steps down to the floor. Sinking down \non her knees, she gently lifts up the dust ruffle and looks into the inky \ndarkness underneath the bed. The space is empty.\nJulia drops the \ndust ruffle and sits up, GASPING.\nA BLACK SHAPE \nIS STANDING BEHIND HER.\nThen, a \nfamiliar voice comes from it.\nPAUL\nHey ... it's \njust me.\nPaul switches \non the light. He's wearing a UCLA sweatshirt.\nJULIA\nThe light \nwouldn't turn on.\nPAUL\nWorks now.\nJulia catches \nher breath. The fear finally draining from her.\nJULIA\nWhere were \nyou?\nPAUL\nI was cold so I \ngot a sweater from the closet. And I went to the bathroom. Why were you looking \nunder the bed?\nJulia isn't \nquite sure how to answer. She's embarrassed.\nJULIA\nI thought there \nwas something in the room.\nPAUL\n(skeptical)\nSomething? Like \nwhat?\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - DAY\nSHRRRIIIIPPP. \nPacking tape is pulled back from a roll.\nJulia finishes \ntaping up a cardboard box. Terry is packing some books into another box of her \nown.\nTERRY\nYou thought there was a monster in the room? And \nyou admitted it?\nJULIA\nI didn't know \nwhat else to say.\nTERRY\nAdvice. When \nyou don't know what else to say, you lie.\nJULIA\nBut I really \ndid hear something.\nTERRY\nYou're worse \nthan my boyfriend.\nJulia looks \ntowards the front door.\nSam is sitting \non the porch steps, sketching on his pad, oblivious to everything around \nhim.\nJULIA\nHe's in his own \nworld, isn't he?\nTERRY\nThat's an \nunderstatement. I have a sinking feeling that sex is out of the question for \nthis trip.\nThis sparks \nsomething in Julia. She hesitates, looking through an open doorway where Paul \ncan be seen packing some clothes. Julia speaks to Terry in confidence.\nJULIA\nDo you \nfantasize about other people?\nTERRY\nIf I haven't \nyet, I probably will by the time we're ready to leave.\nHesitant \nbeat.\nJULIA\nI've been \nfantasizing about a guy.\nTERRY\nAnyone we \nknow?\nJULIA\nBlond. Good \nlooking. Nice body.\nTERRY\nI'd like to \nknow that.\nJULIA\n(hushed)\nHe has a \nSuperman tattoo on his shoulder.\nTerry's mouth \ndrops. The girls move closer together.\nTERRY\nNo.\nJULIA\nYes.\nTERRY\nNo.\nJULIA\nYes.\nTERRY\nWhen did this \nstart?\nJULIA\nSam's party. I \nwalked out of the bathroom and he was changing out of his suit. He lost his tie, \nhis shirt ... and then he spotted me.\nTERRY\nWhat did you \nsay? Keep going?\nJULIA\nI got out of \nthere. But I've been fantasizing about him ever since.\nTERRY\nFuck yeah. \nPower to the people.\nJULIA\nBut Paul is the \nperfect boyfriend. Top to bottom. He's gorgeous. He's smart. He's gonna be a \ndoctor.\nTERRY\n(continuing)\nHe never gets \nupset about anything ...\nJULIA\nWhat the hell \nis wrong with me?\nTERRY\nIt's just a \nfantasy.\nJULIA\nYeah, but when \nI made love to Paul on grad night ... I thought of him.\nTerry \nstares.\nTERRY\nWow.\nJULIA\nI know. Don't \ntell Paul about this. I'd rather not test the whole \"he never gets upset about \nanything\" part.\nTERRY\nAre you \nokay?\nJULIA\nI don't know. I \nthink I'm flipping out. Seeing things in pictures. Thinking that there's a \nmonster in my closet.\nTERRY\n(rising)\nYou're being \ntoo sensitive. We woke up with our closet wide open and I'm not upset about \nit.\nJulia \nreacts.\nJULIA\nYour closet was \nopen?\nTERRY\nHaving to wash \nmy hair without an all-natural conditioner. That upsets me.\nShe walks out. \nJulia sits quietly in the living room, left alone with her own puzzled \nthoughts.\nINT. CABIN - \nHALLWAY - DAY\nJulia is \nwalking down the hallway. She happens to pass the bathroom door which is \nslightly open.\nJULIA'S POV\nWithin the \nbathroom. The BLOND STUDENT is toweling off. Completely naked. The tattoo \nplainly visible on his shoulder. His eyes lock on hers.\nJulia REACTS, \nand runs straight into Paul. She JUMPS.\nJULIA\nJesus. You \nscared me.\nPAUL\nI'm sorry.\nJULIA\nIt's okay. I \nwasn't looking.\nPAUL\nI'm going for a \nrun.\nJULIA\nOkay. See you \nwhen you get back.\n(remembers)\nOh, Paul? Don't \nleave the closet door open anymore, all right?\nPAUL\n(confused)\nHuh?\nJULIA\nThe closet. \nLast night. You left it open.\nPAUL\nI closed it \nafter I got my sweatshirt.\nJULIA\nDid not.\nPAUL\nSerious. I \nthought you opened it.\nJULIA\nWasn't me.\nA moment.\nPAUL\nWell damn, \nJulia. Your monster isn't just noisy, he's also inconsiderate.\nHe kisses her \non the cheek and takes off. Julia stands alone in the empty hallway, a chill \nrunning down her spine.\nINT. BEDROOM \nCLOSET - DAY\nThe door slowly \ncreaks open. Julia stands in the doorway, surveying the closet -- a cluttered \nand claustrophobic space despite its size. Clothes draped on hangars. Cardboard \nboxes stacked on shelves. Shadows.\nJulia moves \ninside and pulls a string hanging from a light bulb which acts as a switch. \nTick-tick. The bulb stays dark. She tries again.\nTick-tick.\nThe light still \nwon't come on.\nJulia carefully \nlooks through some of the clothes. Nothing. She kneels down and checks the \nfloor.\nA long CREAKING \nbehind her. The natural light fades.\nJulia looks \nover her shoulder, a bit skittish, as the closet door eases back towards the \ndoorjamb. But there's nobody there. Just the faintest hint of a draft.\nJulia keeps \nsearching through the clutter. Moving shoes and boxes out of the way. \nSearching.\nThen, she spots \nsomething glittering in the ribbon of light coming from the closet doorway. A \nsmall object resting in the corner. Julia reaches down and picks it up ...\nA PIECE OF \nMETAL ...\nSmall and \nintricate with erratic markings. Twisted and strangely ornate. The shape and \ntexture of the metal is almost completely alien.\nJulia holds the \nmetal into the light. Extremely curious. Behind her, a shadow moves ...\nCRASH. Julia \nSCREAMS, dropping the object and whirling around as a cardboard box SMASHES down \nbehind her. Tumbling from one of the shelves above. Old shoes scatter across the \nfloor.\nJulia catches \nher breath. Heart pounding.\nOn the floor, \nthe metal object sparkles in the light. A draft HISSES through the open closet \ndoor.\nEXT. FOREST \nROAD - DAY\nThe Range Rover \nraces down the empty road.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - DAY\nJulia sits \nbehind the wheel. Her eyes intense. She looks over at the passenger seat where \nboth her purse and the metal object are located.\nEXT. SANTA MIRA \n- FOREST ROAD - DAY\nThe Range Rover \nstreaks out of the woods towards Santa Mira.\nEXT. SANTA MIRA \n- LIBRARY - DAY\nJulia walks up \nthe front steps leading to the library -- a weathered building that overlooks \nthe town square. A banner hangs over the front entrance. It reads ...\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nWELCOME TO THE FOUNDER'S DAY FAIR\nINT. LIBRARY - \nREADING ROOM - DAY\nThe stacks are \ndeserted and still. Julia sits at a reading table, flipping through a book, \nsurrounded by long rows of bookshelves.\nINTERCUT - THE \nBOOK\nJulia flips \nfrom page to page, allowing momentary glimpses of various drawings: vampires, \nwerewolves, witches, a ghastly thing crawling out from under a maiden's bed.\nON JULIA\nas she puts \ndown the book and grabs another from a stack on the table. She opens it and \nstarts paging through.\nCLOSE ON - THE \nBOOK\nAs Julia finds \na drawing of a sleeping child. Just beyond the bed is an open closet door, the \nhorrid face a MONSTER watching the child from within.\nJulia shivers \ndown to her soul. A familiar feeling of late.\nA slight \nSQUEAKING catches her attention. She looks across the reading room to find \n--\nA YOUNG BOY\nTen years old. \nTow-haired. Sitting a few tables away but almost directly opposite her. He's \nwearing a Superman shirt.\nHe smiles \ntimidly and waves. Julia waves back.\nA THUMP behind \nher. Julia turns and looks over her shoulder. She barely catches sight of a \nshadow slipping across the wall in the stacks.\nThe SCRAPING of \nchair legs against the cold floor. Julia looks back towards where the BOY was \nsitting. The chair is pushed back and empty.\nAnother \nTHUMPING in the stacks. Then silence.\nA feeling of \nanxiety washes over Julia as she grabs some of the books and leaves.\nEXT. CABIN - \nNIGHT\nIt's getting \ndark. Moonshadows shift across the lawn.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nSoft rock seeps \nfrom a pair of portable compact disc player speakers. Paul removes a lid of \ngrass and some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint. Everyone looks pretty \ntoasted. Cardboard boxes and candles are everywhere.\nSam is sitting \noff to himself. He's still drawing on his pad. Julia is reading one of the books \nfrom the library.\nJULIA\n(takes \na hit)\nMonsters. \nSymbols and dream images. Now you see, I don't agree with that. I think \neverything has some kind of physical representation. People can't just come up \nwith this stuff.\nPAUL\nYou did a good \njob last night.\nJulia hands him \nthe metal object from the closet.\nJULIA\nAnd this? What \ndo you make of this?\nPAUL\nWhere'd you \nfind it?\nJULIA\nIn the closet \nyou didn't leave open.\nTERRY\nWhat's she \ntalking about?\nPAUL\n(wearisome)\nMy girlfriend \nbelieves in the Boogeyman.\nJULIA\nI never said it \nwas the Boogeyman. Maybe it's some primeval energy that causes a response in \nhuman beings. This could be the physical representation of that energy.\nPAUL\nJulia. It's \npiece of shit.\nTERRY\nI disagree.\nJulia turns \nhopefully to Terry --\nJULIA\nYes?\nTERRY\nIt's the \nphysical representation of a piece of shit.\nPot-induced \nlaughter. Julia takes back the object.\nJULIA\nYou're not \nbeing objective about this. Have either of you ever been scared? Really \nscared?\nPAUL\nI'm scared \nright now that you've smoked too much.\nJULIA\nPaul ...\nPAUL\nOkay. Sure. \nI've been really scared.\nJULIA\nLike when?\nBeat.\nPAUL\nMaybe when we \nhit the dog.\nSam looks \nunsettled.\nSAM\nYou mean \nthis?\nSam tosses his \nsketch pad into the center of the floor. Everyone leans forward, getting a good \nlook at Sam's detailed drawing of --\nTHE ANIMAL LEG \n...\nCompletely \nfleshed out with distinct mechanical parts hinged into flesh and bone. Almost as \naccurate as a photograph.\nSAM \n(cont'd)\nThat thing we \nhit on the road. It wasn't a dog. It wasn't some primeval force, either.\n(then)\nIt was a \nmonster.\nJulia picks up \nthe drawing as Paul peers over her shoulder. The picture looks particularly \nunsettling in the flickering firelight.\nIt almost looks \nalive.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nIt's late. The \nfire is dwindling. Terry and Sam have both passed out. Julia relaxes on the \nfloor, staring at Sam's drawing while resting in Paul's lap.\nJULIA\nI can't believe \nSam drew this.\nPAUL\nI can. He's \nbeen acting like a freak.\nBeat.\nJULIA\nYou think we \ncould've been wrong?\nPAUL\nAbout what?\nJULIA\nAbout the dog. \nMaybe the next day when Sam and I went back to the road ... maybe we found the \nwrong body.\nPAUL\nCan we drop \nthis? Please?\nJULIA\nI just want to \nknow ...\nPAUL\n(clipped)\nStop.\nJULIA\nI just want to \nknow what's going on.\nPAUL\nNothing's going \non. Here, give me the drawing.\nJULIA\nI'm not done \nyet.\nPAUL\nYour hands are \nshaking. Come on, Julia. Give yourself a break.\nShe hands the \ndrawing pad to him. Paul puts it on the couch.\nJULIA\nWe need to talk \nabout this.\nPAUL\nTomorrow. Just \nrelax.\nPaul begins \nstroking her hair. Gently and repeatedly.\nJULIA\nJust for a \nminute.\nJulia looks \nreally tired. She closes her eyes for a moment as Paul's steady breathing fills \nthe room. The she opens them, turns her head and gazes at ...\nTHE BLOND \nSTUDENT ...\nSitting in a \nchair. Smoking a cigarette. Smiling down at her.\nShe cranks her \nhead and looks deeply into her boyfriend's eyes. He smirks and gently strokes \nher hair.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nNice.\nPAUL\n(soft)\nYou're tired. \nGo to sleep.\nHer breathing \nbecomes more steady.\nIn the \ndistance, a SOUND begins to permeate the cabin ...\nTHE SOUND OF \nMACHINES ...\nGrinding and \ndrumming like the churning of a large factory.\u00a0 A calming and soothing noise, drifting \nover ...\nDREAM \nSEQUENCE - A SERIES OF SHOTS\nQuick FLASHES \nOF IMAGES which are strung together:\n(a) A turbine \ndriven by a cloud of pumping steam.\n(b) The \nSuperman tattoo on the Blond Student's shoulder.\n(c) A Doberman \nrunning across a road.\n(d) A man \nlimping along wearing leg braces and using steel crutches.\n(e) A woman's \nhands slipping over a young man's bare chest.\n(f) A back \nbrace being locked into place.\nINT. FAST FOOD \nRESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.)\nThe stall door \nat the far end of the bathroom eases open.\nINT. ASYLUM - SNAKE PIT - NIGHT (DREAM \nSEQ.)\nTHERE IS NO \nSOUND except for the HUMMING OF MACHINES.\nJulia stumbles \nthrough the snake pit. MENTAL PATIENTS stagger around her. Many of them are \ndressed like homeless people. Staring into space. Bodies twitching and gnawing \non their fingers. Lying in their own urine.\nJulia looks \nskyward towards a SCREEN that doubles for a ceiling. Dark figures are standing \non the screen, looking down at them.\nA pair of \nORDERLIES gently take Julia's arm and lead her out of the snake pit.\nJulia looks at \nthe wall as she walks.\nJULIA'S POV - \nshadows move across the wall. Almost like ripples in water.\nBut the shadows gradually become the GROTESQUE \nsilhouettes of HUMAN BODY PARTS -- arms, legs, heads, feet -- hanging and \nrocking gently from hooks\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - DAY (DREAM SEQ.)\nBlood trickles \ndown over the Superman tattoo.\nINT. FAST FOOD \nRESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.)\nClawed fingers \nslide around the open stall door.\nINT. ASYLUM - \nCORRIDOR - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.)\nA HOMELESS \nPERSON is having a seizure. Propped against the wall. Shaking horribly. His head \nand body are entirely covered with braces that form a metal exoskeleton.\nINT. DOCTOR'S \nOFFICE - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.)\nA gynecology \nexam. A woman's legs are held open by stirrups. A pair of hands protected by \nrubber gloves cruelly insert a large alien-looking METAL OBJECT -- which is \nnothing but sharp tentacles and angles -- between the legs. \nINTERCUT - A \nSCREAMING FACE\nA woman \nshrieking through rotting teeth and blood. \nINT. ASYLUM - \nSURGICAL ROOM - NIGHT (DREAM SEQ.)\nJulia steps \ninto the surgical room.\nThe LITTLE GIRL \nfrom Sam's party is resting on a gurney. Her small body is clamped down with \nmetal bands. Her blonde curls draped over the edge. Her eyes open and staring at \nnothing.\u00a0 \nSOMETHING ELSE LURCHES INTO the room. MOVING \nIN THE SHADOWS. A SURGEON ENCLOSED IN METAL BRACES AND HOLDING a pair of \nALIEN-LOOKING shears in HIS HANDS. \nTHE SURGEON OPENS THE SHEARS OVER THE GIRL'S \nFOREHEAD.\nJulia tries to \nscream. No sound comes out. The shears close.\nSeveral drops \nof BLOOD ... then a BLONDE CURL ... hit the tile floor.\nThe SOUND of the MACHINES is interrupted by \nGLASS BREAKING.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOm - NIGHT\nJulia lurches \nawake.\nPaul and Terry \nare lying immobile on the floor. Hundreds of candles have been placed throughout \nthe room, bathing the cabin in a dull amber glow.\nThere is NO \nSOUND.\nJulia starts to \nrise to her feet. Her fingers graze something sharp. She winces and snatches her \nfingers away from ...\nA BROKEN WINE \nGLASS ...\nJulia discovers \na small ribbon of blood trickling from her index finger. She sucks on it, and \nnotices --\nSAM ...\nSitting behind \nthe couch. His eyes are intense as he erases something from his drawing pad. \nJulia walks around him until she can see the sketch.\nTHE DRAWING IS \nJULIA'S PORTRAIT.\nSam erases the \npicture, working from the shoulders up.\nThere is still \nNO SOUND.\nJulia is \ndumbfounded. She hears a slight noise coming from somewhere in the cabin. A \nsmall HISSING sound. Soft and unobtrusive.\nJulia looks \naround. The sound seemed to come from behind her. But there's nothing in the \nroom. Her friends are still asleep. Sam is concentrating on his drawing.\nMore HISSING. \nUnmistakable this time. A diminutive SCRAPING, almost like fingernails raking on \nicy glass, slithering out from a darkened hallway.\nShe moves \ntowards the sound.\nINT. CABIN - \nHALLWAY - NIGHT\nJulia creeps \ninto the hallway until she can barely see the rows of bedroom doors. All of them \nare closed shut.\nThe SCRAPING \nsound rises up again. Much closer. Behind one of the bedroom doors. \nBeckoning.\nJulia reaches \nout for the doorknob.\nINT. CABIN - \nBEDROOM - NIGHT\nThe door opens. \nJulia's stomach rises into her throat. Terror floods her face.\nResting on the bed is a BODY BAG. So smeared \nwith blood that the corpse inside isn't visible except for its massive \nbulk.\nSomething SCRATCHES on the BODY BAG from \nINSIDE.\nJulia's body \ngoes rigid. She can't force herself to move.\nThe body bag is slowly unzipped from the \ninside. Stretching down the length of the plastic until the bag is wide open. \nThe corpse inside is still hidden. \nAs if drawn by \nsome alien force, Julia moves to the bed. Her entire body is shaking.\nShe reaches out \nand carefully peels back the plastic.\nResting within \nthe body bag is THE LITTLE GIRL. Eyes puffed shut. Hair slicked with blood. Her \nskin is livid. Her face is ghostly white and smeared with crimson gore.\nJulia is frozen \nin place. Heart pounding. Terrified.\nTHE GIRL'S EYES \nBLINK OPEN AS SHE SHRIEKS BLOODY MURDER.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - MORNING\nJulia is \nstartled awake and groggily looks around the room. Paul and Terry are still in \nthe process of getting up.\nPAUL\nLook who's \nup.\n(smiles)\nYou sleep \nwell?\nJulia STARES \nback. She looks pretty freaked.\nPAUL (cont'd)\nUh-oh.\nTERRY\nI didn't sleep \nwell either. I dreamt that all these cockroaches were eating my legs.\nPAUL\nYou want to \ntrade? Right before I woke up, my head exploded and all these snakes came \nout.\nTERRY\nWhere's \nSam?\nPAUL\nProbably went \nto bed.\nTerry nods as \nshe rises to her feet.\nTERRY\nI need a hairbrush. And a \nfacial.\nShe stumbles \ninto the hallway. Paul turns to Julia.\nPAUL\nYou had \nnightmares too?\nJULIA\nWorst ones I've \nhad in a long time. I thought I was hallucinating.\nPaul winces and \nrubs his temples.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nWhat's \nwrong?\nPAUL\nHeadache. I'll \nbe fine.\nTerry briskly \nwalks out the hallway. She looks alarmed.\nTERRY\nYou guys. \nSomething's wrong.\nINT. CABIN - \nHALLWAY - DAY\nThe group walks \ntowards one of the bedroom doors.\nTERRY\nIt's Sam. I \ncan't get the door open.\nPaul tries the \ndoorknob. The door won't budge. Paul KNOCKS.\nPAUL\nSam, open \nup.\nNo answer. He \nPOUNDS harder.\nPAUL (cont'd)\nSam?\nTERRY\nHe won't \nanswer.\nJULIA\nMaybe he can't \nanswer.\nPaul shoves \nhard against the door. But it still won't give.\nPAUL\nWhat about the \nbathroom door? It connects to your room.\nTERRY\nI tried it. \nIt's locked.\nPaul turns the \ndoorknob and throws all his weight against the door, trying his best to bust it \ndown. No such luck.\nPAUL\n(voice \nrising)\nSam?\nHe tries again \nand again. WHOOMPH! .... WHOOMPH! ....\nWHOOMPH! The \ndoor inches open. Just a crack.\nPAUL \n(cont'd)\nHelp me out \nwith this.\nPaul and Julia \npush on the door, forcing it wider.\nINT. CABIN - \nGUEST BEDROOM - DAY\nPaul struggles \nthrough the aperture, slipping underneath a mattress that's been placed against \nthe door, and stumbles into the room.\nThe bedroom is a disaster area.\nClothes and \nsmashed glass cover the floor. Mirrors have been shattered. Most of the \nfurniture and portions of the bed have been piled in front of the door, creating \nan almost impassible barricade. The window is wide open, the curtains billowing \nin the breeze.\nJulia and Terry \nmake their way into the room. Stupefied.\nPAUL\nCareful of the \nglass. Don't step on it.\nTotal silence. \nThe group stares at the room. Taking it in. Trying to comprehend it.\nJULIA\nWhat \nhappened?\nPAUL\n(frozen)\nYou got me.\nEXT. WOODS - \nWALKING TRAIL - DAY\nPaul and Terry \nare walking along the trail. Searching.\nTERRY\n(calling)\nSam?\nNo reply. Her \nwords sound hollow in the empty forest as they keep moving, passing behind huge \npine trees that obscure them from view.\nA soft breeze \nrises up and HISSES through the trees.\nINT. CABIN - \nGUEST BEDROOM - DAY\nJulia is \ncleaning the mess in the room. She's just finished tossing a few shards of \nbroken glass into a garbage bag when she FLINCHES and draws her index finger \nback.\nThe finger has \na scab on it. Exactly where she cut it in the dream. Dried blood marks the \nwound.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - DAY\nTerry looks \nbeside herself. Paul and Julia are seated.\nJULIA\nHe must have \ngotten out through the window. That's the only thing I can figure.\nTERRY\nWe have to call \nthe police.\nJULIA\nYou looked \neverywhere?\nPAUL\nEverywhere near \nthe cabin. But we can't cover every square inch of forest out there.\nTERRY\nHe might be \nsick. He might need help.\nJULIA\nI can't \nunderstand why he'd do something like this.\nPAUL\nHe was acting \nnuts. Really nuts.\nTERRY\n(impatient)\nI need a \nphone.\nPAUL\nWait. I've got \nmy cell.\nPaul fishes the \ncell phone out of his pocket. He hands it to her.\nAND THE PHONE \nRINGS.\nAlmost on cue. \nTerry glances over at her friends, then clicks the receiver.\nTERRY\nHello?\n(beat)\nSam? \n...\nJulia and Paul \nsit up in their seats.\nTERRY (cont'd)\nWhere are you? \n... No, where are you? ...\n(beat)\nHow did you get \nthere? ...\nTerry hurriedly \ngrabs a pen. She starts writing on a pad.\nTERRY (cont'd)\nJust a minute. \nI'm writing it down. Market Street. The Ramada. I think I know where it is.\n(beat)\nSam, what's \ngoing on? What happened? ...\n(then)\nSam? ... SAM? \n...\nShe hangs up \nthe phone.\nPAUL\nWhere is \nhe?\nTERRY\nSan \nFrancisco.\nJULIA\nWhat?\nTERRY\nI don't know. \nHe wants me to meet him. My brother has an apartment up there. He's out of town, \nbut I have a spare key. I guess I could stay there.\nBeat.\nJULIA\nYou still want \nto call the police?\nSilence. Terry \ndoesn't respond to this.\nOutside an open \nwindow, the WIND HISSES through the trees.\nEXT. BUS DEPOT \n- NIGHT\nAn empty bus \nstation consisting of a single room with a CLERK sitting behind the front desk. \nJulia and Paul are sitting on a pair of chairs, waiting patiently.\nTerry is using \na phone booth outside. She hangs up and walks into the depot.\nJULIA\nDid you get his \nparents?\nTERRY\nIt was the \nwrong number.\nJULIA\nDidn't Sam give \nyou that number?\nTERRY\nMaybe I wrote \nit down wrong.\nTerry winces a \nbit. She massages her legs.\nPAUL\nAre you \nokay?\nTERRY\nMy legs are \nkilling me.\nJULIA\nYou sure you \ndon't want us to drive you?\nTERRY\nNah. You have \nto stick around for the movers. I'll be fine.\nThe bus arrives \nin front of the depot.\nTERRY (cont'd)\nThere's my \nride.\nTerry grabs her \nsuitcase. Julia hands her a slip of paper.\nJULIA\nThis is Paul's \ncell number. You call us. Let us know what happens.\nTERRY\nI just need to \ntalk to him. Don't call the police or anything until I've had a chance to do \nthat.\nJULIA\nOkay.\nTERRY\nThanks.\nTerry hugs \nJulia. Paul gives her a quick kiss on the cheek.\nPAUL\nRemember. Call \nus.\nTERRY\nI will.\nCarrying her \nsuitcase, Terry backs toward the door, smiling sadly at Julia and Paul as she \nopens it.\nTERRY (cont'd)\nIt'll be okay. \nEverything's okay.\nHer voice \nresonates with desperate hope rather than confidence. She leaves the depot.\nPaul places his \narms around Julia as they watch the bus leave the station, trailing smoke.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - DAY\nJulia is \ncleaning up. She kneels down and picks up some of the melted candles and beer \nbottles.\nPaul walks into \nroom holding a broken picture frame.\nPAUL\nI talked to the \nmovers.\nJULIA\nWhy didn't they \nshow up?\nPAUL\nThe company has \nno record of the order.\nBeat.\nJULIA\nWhat?\nPAUL\nI know. It's \ncrazy.\nJULIA\nAre they coming \nnow?\nPAUL\nIt'll take them \na while to work us into the schedule -- get a van out here to pick up \neverything.\nJULIA\nHow long?\nPAUL\nThree days.\nJULIA\n(exhausted)\nShit.\nPaul holds out \nthe mangled frame.\nPAUL\nI also found \nthis in the guest bedroom. Sam knocked one of the packing boxes over. This was \ninside.\nJulia takes a \nlook at the frame. It's the same picture from her room of herself with her \nmother. The broken glass has torn the photograph.\nPAUL (cont'd)\nI wasn't sure \nif you wanted to keep it.\nJULIA\nNo. I've got \none.\nBeat.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nYou know this \nis the only picture I have of my mother?\n(beat)\nShe was always \ntaking pictures of us, but we never got any of her.\n(emotional)\nIf I didn't \nhave this, I couldn't prove that I had a mother.\nPAUL\nThat's not \ntrue.\nAnother \nbeat.\nJULIA\nI'm so worried \nabout Sam.\nJulia drowns in \nher thoughts. Paul touches her cheek.\nPAUL\nLet's get outta \nhere.\nJULIA\n(smiles)\nGood idea.\nPAUL\nI'll get my \nkeys.\nPaul walks out. \nJulia places the frame on the coffee table.\nShe notices \nsomething on the floor. Julia squints. It's a small object resting in the corner \n... almost hidden from view. Julia reaches into the shadows and picks up ...\nANOTHER PIECE OF METAL with STRANGE markings. \nEXACTLY LIKE THE ONE FROM THE CLOSET.\nJulia stares at \nthe object in her palm. Surprised.\nJULIA\n(to \nherself)\nWhere are these \ncoming from?\nEXT. SANTA MIRA \n- PARK - DAY\nA warm summer \nafternoon. The entire town has congragated in a park with a breathtaking view of \nthe ocean. MUSIC and NOISE. A huge banner draped over the street reads ...\nSANTA MIRA \nCELEBRATES THE 45TH ANNUAL FOUNDER'S DAY FESTIVAL\nJulia navigates \nher way past the booths and thrill rides that have been erected on the lawn. She \nwatches some passersby.\nJULIA'S POV ... \nas A MOTHER talks on a cell phone while her six year-old DAUGHTER tugs at her \nsleeve. Trying to get her attention. The mother keeps pushing the child away as \nshe talks.\nJulia observes \nthis scene until she hears ...\nWOMAN'S VOICE \n(O.S.)\nI'm your \nmother.\nJulia steps out \nof the crowd. Searches for the voice.\nA HOMELESS \nWOMAN is shadowing a COLLEGE-AGE GIRL walking with her boyfriend. They're trying \nto ignore her.\nHOMELESS \nWOMAN\nI'm your mother \n... I'm your mother ... I'm your mother ...\nThe couple \nwalks faster. The Homeless Woman is left behind.\nHOMELESS \nWOMAN (cont'd)\n(futile)\nI'm your mother \n...\nJulia stares \nhelplessly.\nEXT. PARK - \nCAROUSEL - DAY\nSpinning \nmerrily in the center of the park. Bright lights. Loud CALLIOPE MUSIC. Young \nkids and teenagers occupy the horses and benches.\nJulia slowly \nwalks towards the carousel, snapping pictures of the children and whirling \nlights. Behind her, the sound of a SCREAMING CHILD rises above the music and \nlaughter. She turns and finds a two year old BABY sitting on her father's \nshoulders, crying and pointing at --\nTHE YOUNG BLOND \nBOY ...\nWearing his \nblue Superman shirt. He's sitting on a swing set by himself. Sad and alone.\nHe makes eye \ncontact with Julia. Waves timidly. She smiles at him and waves back.\nCLOSE ON: THE \nCAROUSEL\nGears turning. \nThe poles spearing the horses rising and falling into the floor. The platform \nrotating near the grass.\nThe CALLIOPE \nMUSIC becomes the HUMMING of MACHINES.\nEXT. SANTA MIRA \n- PARK - NIGHT\nJulia is \nwandering through a maze of shooting galleries. She searches through the crowds \nof teenagers and children at the booths.

PALM \nREADER'S BOOTH - NIGHT\nPaul approaches \nthe booth.\nAn \nAfrican-American woman in her mid-forties, TESS, sits behind the counter. Loose \nand upbeat. Wearing more colors in her clothing than even a rainbow could \nprovide.\nPAUL\nCan you read my \npalm?\nShe grins.\nTESS\nYou got five \nbucks?\nEXT. PSYCHIC \nBOOTH - NIGHT\nJulia walks to \nthe front counter of the booth.\nA pair of women \nare sitting behind the counter, but the one who sticks out is ROSEMARY, sixty, \npsychic and clairvoyant. She wears a purple kaftan which barely hides her \nweakness for ice cream and cookies.\nROSEMARY\nCan we help \nyou, honey?\nJULIA\nYou can tell me \nthings just by holding something of mine. Right?\nROSEMARY\nAbsolutely. I \nhave a perfect track record. I found two missing children in the spring of '74, \nand helped the state police catch a murderer in '81.\nJULIA\nWow. That's \namazing.\nROSEMARY\n(sourly)\nMy \ngrandchildren aren't quite as impressed.\n(a \nlittle brighter)\nWhat did you \nwant me to look at?\nJulia reaches \ninto her pocket and gently places something on the counter in front of \nRosemary.\nTHE METAL \nOBJECTS FROM THE CLOSET AND THE LIVING ROOM.\nEXT. PALM \nREADER'S BOOTH - NIGHT\nTess takes \nPaul's hand.\nTESS\nSo what do you \nwant to know?\nPAUL\nIt's kinda \nstupid. But I sorta wanted to know about my Dad.

I got into a fight with him. Said some stuff.\nHe bows his \nhead a little. A tough subject for him.\nTESS\nLet's take a \nlook ...\nTess cocks her \nhead a little to the side. She looks confused.\nTESS (cont'd)\n(soft)\nI'll be \ndamned.\nPAUL\nWhat's \nwrong?\nTESS\nWell kid, you \nmight be the first person to make me hang up my fortune telling degree. Usually \nthe palm makes sense, and this one doesn't.\nPAUL\nHow do you \nmean?\nTESS\nAccording to \nthis, you don't exist.\nOFF Paul, his \nface turning white.\nEXT. PSYCHIC \nBOOTH - NIGHT\nRosemary \nhandles one of the metal objects, turning it over in her palm. Julia watches her \nas she goes through this ritual.\nROSEMARY\nThis is \ninteresting.\nJULIA\nLet me guess. \nThey came from a vacuum cleaner, right?\nBeat.\nROSEMARY\nMachines.\nJULIA\nExcuse me?\nROSEMARY\nThis came from \na machine. But not a household appliance.\nJULIA\nWhere did it \ncome from?\nRosemary turns \nthe object over in her palm. Over and over.\nROSEMARY\nSomething that \nwas alive.\nJulia leans \nforward in her seat.\nJULIA\nBut you just \nsaid it came from a machine.\nROSEMARY\nI know.\nJULIA\nSo how can a \nmachine be alive?\nROSEMARY\nI don't make \nthe news. I just report it.\nJULIA\nI found the \nlarger one inside of a closet. Do you know how it got there?\nRosemary \ncontinues meditating. Turning the object over between her fingers. Staring at \nit.\nGradually, she \nfalls into a trance. Her breathing slows.\nROSEMARY\nWe shed our \nparts.\nJULIA\nWhat?\nROSEMARY\nAnd our \nskin.\nJULIA\nI'm sorry. What \nare you talking about?\nRosemary is \noblivious to anything around her.\nROSEMARY\nBut they need \nto be replaced. Some of the parts we can find.\n(beat)\nOthers need to \nbe harvested.\nThe other \nPSYCHIC seated next to Rosemary throws her a curious glance as she counts up \nsome money.\nROSEMARY (cont'd)\nWe'll wait on \nthe side of the road. Until one of the machines come.\n(beat)\nOne of us will \nbe sacrificed. That will stop the machine. Then we can take whatever skins are \ninside.\n(softer)\nWe can use \ntheir parts.\nPaul walks \nup.\nPAUL\nJulia?\nShe motions for \nhim to be quiet.\nROSEMARY\nWe stopped the \nmachine. But there are more of the skins than we thought ...\nPAUL\nJulia. Let's \ntake off.\nJULIA\nHold on.\nROSEMARY\nWe must wait. \nMore of us are needed to capture them.\nPAUL\nWhat's she \ntalking about?\nJULIA\nWait just a \nminute. Please.\nBeat.\nThe objects \ncontinue turning in her hand ... and turning ... and turning ... and turning \n...\nROSEMARY\nThere are more \nof us now. We've surrounded them.

LIGHTS START GOING OUT IN SECTIONS UNTIL THE ENTIRE FAIR IS \nPITCH BLACK.\nThe sound of \nmumbling and confusion seethes from the crowd. Julia rises out of her chair. \nPaul takes her into her arms as CHILDREN can be heard CRYING throughout the \npark.\nAbove them, the \nwind HISSES through the trees.\nEXT. CABIN - \nDRIVEWAY - NIGHT\nJulia sits on \nthe porch. Paul is stretched out on the grass looking up at the stars.\nPAUL\nSo the power \nwent out. That doesn't mean anything.\nJULIA\nDid you hear \nwhat she said?\nPAUL\nNo.\nJULIA\nShe was talking \nabout the accident. The night you hit that thing on the road. She knew about \nthat.\nPAUL\nJulia, a \npsychic tells you some random shit and then lets YOU make sense out of it.\nJULIA\nShe said it was \nwaiting for us.\nPAUL\nOh sure. An \nanimal was waiting for us to come along and run it down. What was the \nexplanation? Rotten home life? Was it taking Prozac?\nJULIA\nIt wanted to \nstop the car.\nPAUL\nWhy?\nJULIA\nSomething about \nneeding parts.\nPAUL\nIf it needed \nparts, it shouldn't have committed suicide. \nJULIA\nShe said there \nwere more of them.\nPAUL\nWho cares what \nshe said? It doesn't mean anything.\nJULIA\nBut it's not \njust that.\nJulia's voice \nbecomes soft. As if she were telling a secret.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nI've also had \nthis feeling. Ever since Sam disappeared. I can't shake it.\nPAUL\nWhat is it?\nJULIA\nI feel like \nsomething's missing.\nPAUL\nSomething?\nJULIA\nI don't know. \nIt's on the tip of my tongue. I just feel like ever since we woke up that \nmorning, something's not right. Like ... there's someone who should be here \n...\nPAUL\nRight. Sam.\nJULIA\nIt's not \nSam.\n(then)\nDid that palm \nreader say anything strange to you. Anything at all?\nPaul hesitates. \nHe looks back at the night sky.\nPAUL\nNo.\nBeat.\nJULIA\nCan I use your \nphone?\nINT. LEVIN \nHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nA traditional \nhome.

DARKROOM - \nDAY\nA piece of \ndeveloping paper is slipped into the tray basin.\nJulia gently \nrocks the basin back and forth. A picture starts to manifest on the paper.\nINT.

DARKROOM - \nDAY\nJulia leans \nforward to get a better view of the developing picture. An image is slowly \nforming -- carousel horses, the vague outlines of poles and children.\nINT. CABIN - \nBEDROOM - DAY\nPaul is \nshirtless and doing one-armed push-ups. His muscles churn. His body rises and \nfalls like a piston.\nINT. DARKROOM - \nDAY\nThe picture has \ncome into view. The carousel. The children laughing as they ride the horses.\nAnd something \nelse ...\nAn \nirregularity. A dark form in the center of the carousel.\nINT.

DARKROOM - \nDAY\nJulia takes the \npicture out of the developing basin.\nWE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO - There's a dark SHAPE \nstanding in the middle of the carousel. Blurred and indistinct. ALMOST LIKE A \nSILHOUETTE OR A SHADOW.\nEXCEPT THAT it's waving at the \ncamera.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - DAY\nPaul is sitting \non the couch, wearing a UCLA cross country tank top and tying his shoes. Julia \nenters from the basement. She's carrying a stack of developed pictures.\nJULIA\nPaul, you have \nto see this. The picture came out, but there's something really strange in the \nmiddle of it. Just like the other one of the shed.\nHe looks at the \npicture.\nPAUL\nLooks like \nsomeone on the carousel.\nJULIA\nBut there's no \nfeatures. It's like a shadow.\nPAUL\nSo there wasn't \nenough light.\nPaul rubs his \nforehead. Julia is genuinely concerned.\nJULIA\nWhat's the \nmatter?\nPAUL\nMy head feels \nworse.\nJULIA\nMaybe you \nshould lie down.\nPAUL\nI have to go \nrunning.\nJULIA\nNo you \ndon't.\nPAUL\nOf course I do. \nYour body's like a machine. It needs upkeep.\nJULIA\nNot when you're \nphysically ill.\nPAUL\nI'll be \nokay.\nJULIA\nPaul ...\nPAUL\nI'll be \nokay.\n(about \nthe picture)\nIs that it?\nJULIA\nNot \nexactly.\n(beat)\nWhen I saw this \npicture, I decided to look at the other one. Just for comparison's sake.\nPAUL\nSo?\nJulia takes out \nanother photograph.\nJULIA\nI pulled this \none by mistake. The picture of that little girl from the party.\nShe hands him \nthe picture.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nLook.\nPaul's face \ncollapses into slack disbelief.\nTHE LITTLE GIRL HAS DISAPPEARED from the \nphoto. Vanished.\nPaul turns to \nJulia as she looks into his eyes with a mixture of fear and apprehension.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nWhat's going \non?\nThis time, he \ndoesn't have an answer.\nEXT. WOODS - \nWALKING TRAIL - DAY\nMurky and \nstill. A few shafts of sunlight permeate the gloom.\nPaul is jogging \nalong the trail, keeping a steady pace, the sounds of the forest all around \nhim.\nEXT. CREEK \nBRIDGE - DAY\nThe trail \nsnakes towards a wooden bridge that spans over a trickling creek. Paul runs \nacross, the soles of his sneakers SLAPPING on creaking wood.\nHe moves deeper \ninto the woods.\nEXT. WOODS - \nTRAIL - DAY\nA lonely part \nof the woods where almost all the daylight is blocked out by the trees.\nPaul jogs along \nthe trail when he slows to a halt, sweaty and out of breath. His skin is pale. \nHis limbs are shivering. Paul cradles his head, shutting his eyes, suffering \nfrom obvious pain.\nPAUL\n(very \nsoft)\nOh God .... \nmake it stop ...\nHe starts \nwalking forward again. Very slowly.\nA slight \nTINKLING sound as he kicks something at his feet. His eyes blink open as he \nlooks down ...\nThere are several pieces of metal littering \nthe trail. Almost like nuts and bolts, but alien in their design.\nPaul reaches \ndown and picks one of the bolts up. Studies it. He keeps walking, following more \npieces of metal that lead off the footpath.\nEXT. FOREST - \nDAY\nA darker spot \nenclosed by pine trees. A few birds are singing overhead.\nPaul enters the \nforest, pushing back branches, following the trail of discarded metal until he \nfreezes ... his eyes staring directly ahead at ...\nCLUMPS OF BLACK \nSKIN ...\nHanging from \nbranches. Scattered on the ground. Like the skin of a snake which has been \nshed.\nPaul is \ncompletely unsettled. He kneels down, picking up a flap of skin from the ground, \npeeling it away from a steel ROD dripping with oozing slime. Holds it up. It's \nstill black in color but almost transparent in the murky light.\nThe wind HISSES \nthrough the trees, mussing Paul's hair.\nPaul drops the \npiece of skin on the ground.\nThe birds \nabruptly stop singing in unison. The WIND CEASES.\nPaul looks \naround the forest. The sudden quiet has got him spooked. His arms and legs \nstiffen. Paul can't even bring himself to move or breathe ...\nUNTIL SOMETHING \nDROPS ON HIS SHOULDER ...\nPaul freaks and \nwhirls around, grabbing his shoulder to find\nA PIECE OF SKIN \n...\nClinging to \nhim. He rips it off and sprints for the footpath.\nEXT. WOODS - \nFOOTPATH - DAY\nPaul sprints \nout of the forest, running with blinding speed and adrenaline. He doesn't look \nback.\nBehind him, the \nwind HISSES through the trees again.\nINT. CABIN - \nLIVING ROOM - DAY\nJulia comes up \nfrom the basement. She hears COUGHING coming from the bathroom.\nINT. BATHROOM - \nNIGHT\nJulia enters \nthe bathroom. Paul is retching and coughing into the toilet. Hair plastered to \nhis forehead. Pale as death. Shaking badly.\nJULIA\nPaul? What's \nwrong?\nPAUL\n(feeble)\nSick.\nShe goes to \nhim. Rubs his shoulders as he COUGHS again.\nJULIA\nOh baby ...\nJulia brushes \nthe hair from his forehead. She freezes.\nJust above his \ntemple is a SCAB. No bigger than the head of an eraser. Identical to the one on \nJulia's finger.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nPaul? Where did \nthis come from?\nPAUL\nWhat?\nJULIA\nThis scab.\nJulia runs her \nfinger over the scab. Paul immediately reels from her touch, pain shooting \nthrough his head, furious.\nPAUL\nJesus! Fuck!\nJulia is \nshocked by the severity of his reaction.\nJULIA\nI'm sorry.\nPaul holds his \nhead tight. Almost near tears. Fighting pain.\nPAUL\nJust don't \ntouch it.\nJULIA\nHow long has it \nbeen there?\nPAUL\nEver since my \nhead started to hurt.\n(then)\nI think I'm \nhallucinating.\nJULIA\nWhat did you \nsee?\nPAUL\nSkin ... like \nit was shed ... and all of these metal pieces ...\nJulia is \nterribly concerned now. His description frightens her, but she maintains a \nvisage of calm.\nJULIA\nDo you want to \nsee a doctor? I know there's one in Santa Mira.\nPAUL\nI can see a \ndoctor in Los Angeles.\n(then)\nLook, I want to \nget out of here, okay? Let's go home.\nBeat.\nJULIA\nOkay.\nShe squeezes \nhis shoulder and walks into --\nINT. CABIN - \nBEDROOM - DAY\nJulia pulls out \ntheir duffle bags and suitcases.\nPaul's cell \nphone RINGS on the table. Julia snatches up the phone and answers.\nJULIA\nHello? ... Yes? \n...\n(then)\nWait a minute \n... slow down, I can't understand what you're saying ...\nComplete \nastonishment storms Julia's face. Paul wanders in.\nPAUL\nWho is it?\nJULIA\nIt's Terry. \nSomething went wrong.\nEXT. SAN \nFRANCISCO - ESTABLISHING - DAY\nGloomy and \novercast. Storm clouds are brewing.\nEXT. SAN \nFRANCISCO - STREET - DAY\nThe Range Rover \npulls down a crowded street.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - DAY\nJulia is \nsitting behind the wheel. Navigating traffic.\nPaul sits on \nthe passenger side, leaning against the window, his face pressed against the \nglass. Somber and weak.\nTHROUGH THE \nWINDSHIELD\nThe twisted \nremains of a car accident has brought everything to a near standstill. Police \nare everywhere. An ambulance is parked along the curb, lights flashing.\nJulia leans \nforward to get a better look.\nJULIA'S POV\nA TEEN ACCIDENT \nVICTIM presses a white towel against his thigh. Blood gushes from it. A huge \nmetal ROD sticks out of his leg.\nEXT. SAN \nFRANCISCO - STREET - DAY\nThe Range Rover \nmoves past the shredded cars involved in the accident. Twisted metal covers the \nstreet.\nEXT. PACIFIC \nHEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON\nSummer rain is \nfalling. THUNDER ROLLS overhead.\nThe Rover pulls \nup to the sidewalk, directly in front of an extremely opulent upper-class \nhouse.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - LATE AFTERNOON\nJulia turns to \nPaul who sits silently in the passenger seat. He doesn't move.\nJULIA\nSure you don't \nwant to come with me?\nPAUL\nI'm too sick. I \nneed to stay someplace.\nJULIA\nI'm worried \nabout leaving you here.\nPAUL\n(shrugs)\nIt's not like \nhe'll disown me.\nJULIA\nI know.\nPAUL\nAnd I really \nneed him right now.\nMore THUNDER. \nJulia kisses his cheek.\nJULIA\nI'm taking the \ncell phone. You call me.\nPAUL\nPromise.\nJULIA\nSee a \ndoctor.\nPAUL\nI will.\nPaul opens the \npassenger door and steps out into the rain. Julia watches him approach the \nhouse.

LOOMIS. A severe presence with a soured \nand weathered face. He stares at Paul without any sign of emotion.\nPaul notices \nthe slight. He presses onward. A bit haltingly.

LOOMIS\nI don't have a \nson.\n(then)\nI don't know \nyou.\nHe slowly \ncloses the door. Paul begins weeping openly.\nPAUL\nDad ...\nThe door is \nshut in his face. Nothing can be heard except for the rain falling outside.\nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MARKET - LATE \nAFTERNOON\nJulia is standing near the entrance. Waiting \npatiently.\nA figure across the street catches Julia's \nattention -- a HOMELESS MAN stumbling down the sidewalk, talking to himself, \nshaking a rattle.\nVOICE \n(O.S.)\nJulia?\nJulia turns \naround, searching, not immediately recognizing the figure that briskly \napproaches her --\nIt's Terry. But \nher once perfect appearance has become harsh and drawn. Her blonde hair has been \ncolored dark brown. There are sagging circles under her eyes. Her skin is \ncolorless. She moves quickly. Nervously.\nJulia is \nshocked.\nJULIA\nTerry?\nTerry's hands \ntremble.\nTERRY\nI'm glad you \ncame. You don't have any idea how scared I've been.\nJULIA\nWhy did you \nchange your hair?\nTerry is about \nto answer when a BABY starts crying in the market. Fear takes control of her \nface.\nTERRY\nWe can't stay \nhere.\nJULIA\nWhy?\nTERRY\nWhere are you \nparked?\nJULIA\nOn the \nstreet.\nTERRY\nGood.

She keeps looking back over her shoulder as Julia tries to keep \nup. Rain drenches them.\nJULIA\nWhat the hell \nis going on? Where's Sam?\nTERRY\nHe's dead.\nThis almost \nsends Julia reeling. Her mouth falls open.\nJULIA\nWhat?\nTERRY\nThere's three \nthings you should remember. Three things.\nJULIA\nWhat happened \nto Sam?\nTERRY\nFirst, whenever \nyou see a baby or a kid crying, keep moving. Children can sense them. That's \nyour warning.\nJULIA\nWarning against \nwho?\nTERRY\nSecond, they \ncan control anything electrical or mechanical. Lamps. Cars. Phones. \nJULIA\nTerry, you're \nnot making any sense.\nTERRY\nThird -- they \ncan change things. They can make you disappear. \nJULIA\nTell me what \nhappened to Sam.\nTERRY\nI am telling \nyou.\n(terrified)\nThey took him. \nThey made him disappear.\nJulia stops \nwalking. Speechless.\nEXT. SAN \nFRANCISCO - COFFEE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\nA young COLLEGE \nSTUDENT is typing on his powerbook, oblivious to the TRANSIENT sitting on the \nsidewalk, head buried in his knees, a sign at his feet reading \"HELP ME.\"\nCLOSE ON THE \nPOWERBOOK. A soft whirring noise \nseeping from the computer as the student types.\nThe WHIRRING \nbecomes the HUMMING OF MACHINES.\nThe Range Rover \nappears on the street and moves past.\nTERRY \n(V.O.)\nThey take away \nyour identity. People stop remembering you. Your place in society vanishes.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - SAN FRANCISCO - MOVING\nJulia is behind \nthe wheel. Terry is devouring a cigarette.\nTERRY\nThat's how they \nget you. By making people not even care about you anymore.\nJULIA\nDid you try \nSam's parents? Did you get the right number this time?\nTERRY\nThe number I \ncalled at the bus station was his parents.\n(cryptic)\nWe didn't hit a \ndog on the road.\nJULIA\nBut I saw \nit.\nTERRY\nThey switched \nbodies.\nJULIA\nWho are \"they?\" \nA cult? Killers?\nTerry starts \nlaughing to herself. Tears welling in her eyes. Hopeless. Terrified.\nTERRY\nYou have no \nidea. No idea what you're dealing with.\n(then)\nThey don't even \nbelong here. They're like ... like machines. That's what Sam said. Like \nmachines with all this skin and moving parts.\nJULIA\nThey're \nmachines?\nTERRY\nMonsters. \nThey're monsters, Julia.\nJulia stops at \na light.\nA YOUNG GUY \ncrosses the street in front of them. He's just a yuppie with a cell phone. But \nTerry stiffens in her seat, watching him suspiciously.\nThen, almost as \nan aside, he winks at her.\nTERRY (cont'd)\nDrive.\nJULIA\nI can't. \nThere's a red.\nTERRY\nThen make a \nright. Just keep driving.\nJulia is \ngrowing frightened by Terry's paranoia.\nEXT. SAN \nFRANCISCO - STREET - LATE AFTERNOON\nThe Rover makes \na right turn and cruises down another block.\nINT. RANGE \nROVER - LATE AFTERNOON\nTerry keeps her \neyes riveted on the PEOPLE on the sidewalk. She's practically in tears.\nTERRY\nRemember when \nwe hit that thing with the car? \n(hushed)\nIt wasn't an \naccident. It was a set-up. They planned it all along.\nJULIA\nHow do you know \nthis?\nTERRY\nSam told me. He \nfigured everything out.\nJULIA\nWhy are they \ncoming after us? What do they want with us?\nTERRY\nThey have flesh \nand metal parts in their bodies. Sometimes they shed what they don't need. But \nother parts keep getting worn out or lost. So they take people constantly to get \nnew parts.\nJULIA\n(soft)\nThat's not \npossible.\nTERRY\nThey wear the \nskin. That's why you don't notice them. Half of the time they're wearing \npeople's skin. Or they're hiding in dark places. Alleys. Closets.\nJulia is \nhorrified.\nJULIA\nTerry ... \nplease stop.\nTERRY\nThey take other \nparts too. Whatever they need. They're scavengers. No sense of compassion. No \nremorse.\nJULIA\nI don't believe \nthis.\nTERRY\nThat's why they \ncame after us. They got Joey first. At the cabin.\nJulia is \ndumbfounded. \nJULIA\nJoey?\nTERRY\nThat's what Sam \nsaw. That's why he left. He woke up and got a look at them -- at what they were \ndoing to Joey ...\nJULIA\nTerry ...\nTERRY\nStripping him \n... taking his skin off ...\nJulia pulls \nover to the curb and stops.\nJULIA\nWho is Joey? \nWhat are you talking about?\nTERRY\n(amazed)\nYou don't \nremember?\nJULIA\nNo.\nTERRY\nThere were five \nof us. He came up in his own car. He was Paul's best friend -- they always wore \nthe same thing for Christ sakes.\nJULIA\nThere were only \nfour of us. You. Me. Paul. Sam.\nTerry is \nshaking now. Complete fright.\nTERRY\nThey got to \nyou. They got to you.\nJULIA\nNobody got to \nme.\nTerry starts \ncollecting her things.\nTERRY\nLook, could you \ndrop me off at my brother's apartment? I need to pick up some things before I go \nto the airport.\nJULIA\nWhere are you \ngoing?\nTERRY\nTo see my \nparents.\nJULIA\nYou can't just \nleave.\nTerry starts \nweeping. Grabbing her legs and squeezing them.\nTERRY\nThey put things \nin my legs so they can track me. It hurts.\nJULIA\n(very \nconcerned)\nTerry? What can \nI do to help you?\nTerry takes her \nhand. Her eyes pleading.\nTERRY\nRemember me. \nPlease remember me.\nFrom the street \noutside the car, the sound of a TODDLER CRYING can be heard. Terry's head snaps \naround.

Finally, she spots Terry \nboarding the BART train.\nJULIA\nTerry! \nWait!\nJulia rushes \nforward, squirming through the crowd, until she reaches the doors just as they \nSLAM CLOSED. She looks through the windows, trying to find Terry amongst the \ncrowd inside.\nThe train \nstarts to move.\nStanding at one \nof the train's passenger windows, his face and palms pressed against the glass, \nis --\nTHE BLOND BOY \nIN THE SUPERMAN SHIRT.\nStaring \ndirectly at her. Dark circles around his eyes.\nHe smiles at \nJulia.\nHis teeth are made of metal.\nJulia stands \nthunderstruck. The BOY in the window moves past.\nThe train \nshoots into the awaiting tunnel. Julia is left standing frozen and immobile on \nthe platform.\nNear the subway \nentrance, a HOMELESS MAN with HOOKS FOR HANDS is convulsing as he sits against \nthe wall. Eyes wide open. Shaking horribly and staring at nothing.\nINT. APARTMENT \nBUILDING - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT\nQuiet and dimly \nlit. Several of the lights are burnt out, leaving the hallway drowning in \nshadows.\nThe elevator \ndoors open. Terry exits and moves quickly down the hallway. Her face is \nterrified. Sick.\nShe arrives at \nan apartment. Terry fumbles with her keys.\nA soft THUMPING in the hallway. Deep and \nhollow. Terry spins around, the keys JINGLING in her hand.\nNothing there. \nThe hall appears to be empty and dark. One of the lights overhead is flickering \nand buzzing softly, providing \nscant illumination.\nShe takes a \nstep back ...\nA soft TINKLING \nsound at her feet. Terry looks down to find a few pieces of METAL littering the \nfloor. Nuts and bolts. Rods. Alien in design.\nTerry's \nparanoia rises to a fever pitch. She turns the key in the lock. Opens the front \ndoor.\nINT. APARTMENT \n- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nTerry shuts the door. Locks it. Switches on the \nlights.

She spins around to face the living room. Nobody's there. \nNothing.\nSOMETHING BANGS \nAT THE FRONT DOOR. A STEADY POUNDING. THE BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND \nTHEN STOPS DEAD.\nTerry's \nbreathing quickens. She puts the suitcase down.\nA crack of \nTHUNDER reverberates outside.\nMoving with the \ncautious steps of a small child, she walks towards the front door. Foot by foot. \nThe only sound is her FRIGHTENED BREATHING. She arrives at the peephole and \nlooks out into the empty hall.\nSOMETHING \nSTARES BACK AT HER THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE.\nMoving right in \nfront of the door. One of its yellow eyes piercing through ... surrounded by \nmidnight skin pierced with metal bolts and rods.\nTERRY SCREAMS \nHER LUNGS OUT.\nThe DOOR \nRATTLES like it's going to break off its hinges. Something SLAMS REPEATEDLY \nagainst the wood.\nTerry tears \nthrough the apartment, feet POUNDING. She rushes into the bedroom.\nThe front door \nin the living room BREAKS OPEN.\nINT. APARTMENT \n- BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\nTerry SLAMS the \nbedroom door and locks it. Backs away towards the bed, when ...\nA HAND REACHES \nOUT FROM UNDER IT ...\nGrabbing hold \nof her ankle. Fused together from rotting flesh, human parts, and metal pieces. \nTerry pitches forward, SCREAMING, falling to her hands and knees.\nThe hand starts \ndragging her under the bed.\nTerry kicks and \nclaws on the floor. Somehow manages to free herself from the hand's grip. She \ngoes for the window and pulls it open. Steps outside.\nThe entire bed \nis OVERTURNED and tossed aside.\nEXT.

The door within her bedroom can be heard \nCRASHING OPEN, followed by a ROARING unlike anything on this earth.\nTerry rushes \ndown the fire escape, FEET BANGING on the metal steps. But she stops dead in her \ntracks when she notices --\nSEVERAL FIGURES \n...\nStanding in the \nalley far below. Looking up at her. Waiting.\nA sound rises \nup behind her. THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS BANGING DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE IN \nPURSUIT.\nTERRY\n(horrified)\nOh God ...\nTerry \ndesperately goes to a window. She pulls it open, stepping inside, THE BANGING \nFOOTSTEPS RIGHT BEHIND HER. \nINT. APARTMENT \nBUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT\nThe apartment \nfloor is being renovated. Plastic tarps cover the doors and windows. Terry races \nthrough the hallway, SCREAMING WILDLY as she POUNDS on the doors.\nTERRY\nHELP ME! PLEASE \nHELP!!!\nTerry rockets \naround the corner. She presses the elevator door button frantically.\nThe sound of \nCROAKING and HISSING fills the hallway.\nThe elevator \ndoors slide open.\nTerry lunges \ninto the elevator, hits for the lobby, then starts BEATING FRENZIEDLY on the \ndoor close button.\nSeveral shadows \nappear in the hallway. Getting closer.\nTerry SCREAMS \nWILDLY and keeps pounding the button.\nThe bizarre \nHISSING becomes a FRIGHTFUL ROAR just as ...\nThe elevator \ndoors pull shut. Closing on the unseen things in the hallway.\nINT. ELEVATOR - \nNIGHT\nThe car starts going down. Floor lights blink above \nthe door.\n8 ... 7 ... 6 ...\nTerry punches out 9-1-1 on the\u00a0 cell phone's keypad. Nothing comes \nthrough the receiver. Only static.\nTERRY\nCome on ... \ncome on ...\nShe dials \nagain.\n4 ... 3 ... 2 \n...\nMore static \nover the cell phone. Terry has started crying in anguish when the elevator comes \nto an abrupt halt.\nThe doors stay \nclosed.\nTerry looks \nabove the elevator doors. The floor light reads --\n\"B\" \n(Basement)\nTerry starts \npressing for the lobby. The elevator won't move. She presses the \"door open\" \nbutton, the alarm button, anything at all. Nothing responds.\nTERRY (cont'd)\nHELP! SOMEBODY! \nHELP ME!!!\nNothing. Futile \nsilence. She's about to try dialing on the cell phone again, when ...\nWHUMP. A heavy \nthudding sound above the elevator car roof. The light overhead flickers like a \ncandle. Terry gazes at the failing light, then tracks her eyes towards the trap \ndoor in the roof.\nA few more hollow THUMPS.\nTerry is \npetrified. She takes a step backward. The light flashes off and on again ... \ncreating a strobe light effect.\nBehind her, the \nelevator doors silently pull open.\nTerry's gaze is \nstill focussed on the ceiling trap door. Behind her, the basement is pitch \nblack. She continues moving backwards towards the open elevator doors, step \nafter step, completely unaware ...\nUNTIL SOMETHING \nLEAPS OUT OF THE DARK AND GRABS HER.\nIn the moment \nit takes to draw a breath and scream, it's already over.\nThe light goes \nout.\nINT.

She FLINCHES and nearly drops the phone. Julia checks her pricked \nfinger.\nThe WOUND HAS \nGROWN. An infected red spot with a open hole in the center.

Large flaps. Chunks. Moving \nrapidly and ferociously.\nJulia spots Sam \nSCREAMING across the room.\nSAM\n(shrieking)\nJOEY!\nJulia turns her \nhead in the direction of the ripping and tearing sounds.

COFFEE \nSHOP - NIGHT\nA plate SMASHES \non the floor.\nJulia is jolted \nout of her thought, looks over to find a WAITER picking up the pieces. The \nlights flicker in the shop.

Stops cold.\nEveryone in the \ncoffee shop is staring at her. The customers. The waiters.\nThe lights are \ndimming. A lack of power.\nJulia forces \nherself to move. She goes to her table, picks up the photographs, and suddenly \nnotices that in the graduation pictures --\nSAM AND TERRY \nHAVE DISAPPEARED. ALMOST AS IF THEY NEVER WERE A PART OF THE PHOTOS. PAUL AND \nJULIA ARE TOGETHER IN EVERY PICTURE -- ALONE.\nJulia grabs the \nphotographs and turns around.\nThe customers \nin the coffee shop are standing now. Their eyes are dark shadows. Something \nabout the way they stand is completely unnatural. All wrong.\nPanic begins to \nsettle in. Julia quickly walks to the door.\nWAITER\nJulia?\nShe turns. The \nwaiter stands behind her. Eyes burning.\nWAITER (cont'd)\n(menacing)\nWhy'd you take \nit out?\nThat's enough. \nJulia gets the hell out of there.\nEXT.

He had blond hair. He had a Superman tattoo on his \nshoulder.\nPAUL\nI don't know \nanyone named Joey.\nJULIA\nThat's because \nthey erased your memory.

Watching her. Dark \ncircles around their eyes.\nJulia keeps \ngoing. The PURSUING CUSTOMERS from the coffee shop are marooned on the opposite \ncorner by traffic. They stand motionless. Watching her escape.\nEXT. SUBWAY \nSTATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT\nA long flight \nof stone stairs leads down to the BART and MUNI stations below. Paul sits down \non the steps. Looking. Waiting.\nEXT. SAN \nFRANCISCO - MARKET STREET - NIGHT\nJulia charges \ndown the sidewalk. Weaving past bystanders.\nAs she runs, \nJulia brushes past THE LITTLE GIRL from Sam's graduation party.

SUBWAY \nSTATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT\nPaul is nowhere \nto be found. The stairs are empty.\nJULIA\nPaul?!\nJulia looks \naround desperately. She can't find him in the crowds on the sidewalks. She turns \nand looks down the stairs towards the open entryway to the subway system.\nPaul is walking \nthrough the entryway. A friend with him is patting him on the shoulder. Just \nafter Paul has disappeared through the entryway, the friend turns around.\nIT'S SAM.\nHis lips are \nparched, pitch black eyes bulging, his features somehow more twisted and \nunfamiliar. His face twitches as he stares coldly at Julia, and he runs.\nSmall pieces of metal drop from Sam's pants \nlegs as he disappears through the entryway.\nJULIA \n(cont'd)\nPAUL!\nShe frantically \nrushes down the stairs.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nTHAT'S NOT \nSAM!!! PAUL!!!\nShe rushes \nthrough the entryway.\nINT. SUBWAY \nSTATION - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS\nThe upper level \nis almost completely empty save a few kids and late-night commuters. Julia is \nhysterical now. The first time we've seen her lose control.\nShe looks \naround frantically. Spots Paul and Sam going down the escalator together.\nJULIA\nPaul!\nJulia rushes \ntowards the turnstiles. Jumps them. A GUARD steps out of his booth.\nGUARD\nHey! You need a \nticket! Hey!!!\nShe keeps \ngoing.\nINT. SUBWAY \nSTATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT\nPaul and Sam \nreach the bottom of the escalators. They move towards the platform. The lights \nstart twinkling.

SUBWAY \nSTATION - ESCALATOR - CONTINUOUS\nJulia bolts \ndown the escalator.\nINT.

Julia moves to the opposite side and looks.\nResting on the \ntracks, leading into the tunnel, are a trail of metal pieces. Exactly like the \nones from the cabin.\nJulia looks \nback. The GUARD is coming down the escalator.\nWithout \nhesitation, she jumps down to the tracks. Moving quickly and bending down to \navoid being seen, she rushes into the awaiting subway tunnel.\nINT. SUBWAY \nTUNNEL - NIGHT\nDrowned in \nshadows. An unnatural silence fills the tunnel.\nJulia moves \ncautiously amongst the tracks. Eyes scanning the darkness. Following the trail \nof discarded metal.\nA SHARP \nHISSING.\nJulia spins \naround. A few more HISSING SOUNDS rise from electrical sparks on the tracks. \nBlue light flashes within the tunnel. Then, it ceases.\nShe turns back \nto continue her search, wind sifting through her hair, when she finds --\nA LARGE \nHOLE\nAt the base of \nthe subway wall. Julia reaches down and palms a few metal pieces at the base of \nthe hole.\nShe peers \ninside. A dull flickering light flashes within.\nJulia takes a \ncalming breath. She moves into the hole.\nINT. CRAWL \nSPACE - CONTINUOUS\nA narrow and \nclaustrophobic space. Julia squirms through the confined space, pulling herself \ntowards the flashing light.\nINT. CORRIDOR - \nCONTINUOUS\nJulia pulls \nherself through another opening and finds herself standing in the threshold of a \ncorridor. Both the walls and floor are constructed of crude metal grates and \nlong pipes. Anything could be hiding within. Waiting.\nShe moves \nslowly into the corridor, a STROBE LIGHT flickering around her. She gropes \ntowards another opening.\nThe sound of \nher TERRIFIED BREATHING is slowly replaced by the RHYTHMIC HUMMING OF \nMACHINES.\nINT. STAIRWELL \n- CONTINUOUS\nSteam rises \nfrom the pipes. Bathing the stairwell in mist.\nThe fluorescent \nlights above are glimmering in the darkness. Julia stands at the top of the \nstairwell. She can't even see the bottom of the steps.\nCarefully, she \nstarts moving down. Her hand gripping the metal railing.\nThe HUMMING OF \nMACHINES grows louder ...\nHer foot \naccidentally kicks a few pieces of metal on the steps. A light CLINKING as the \nmetal scatters down ahead of her.\nThe HUMMING OF \nMACHINES is closer now. Just beyond the sheathing clouds of blue and white \nmist.\nThe metal \nrailing is suddenly replaced by HUMAN BONES.\nJulia pulls her \nhand away from the railing. Looks skyward and discovers more BONES are being \nused to brace the ceiling along with metal beams.\nShe stops. \nShutting her eyes in fear. Starts to lose control.\nFrom somewhere \nwithin, she manages to steady herself. Keeps going through the awaiting steam \ncurtain at the bottom.\nINT. MAIN \nHALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS\nThe steam parts \nto reveal a dark space. Cold and damp.\nJulia moves \ninto the main hallway, stumbling through a hallway that can best be described as \na living nightmare. Mammoth pipes and human skin has been fashioned together \ninto a wall, pulsating with the HEARTBEAT OF MACHINES that saturates the entire \nhallway.\nSteam jets into \nthe hallway intermittently from the pipes. Creating great clouds.\nJulia is beyond \nhorrified. Her face registers a numbness. Complete and total astonishment.\nHuman bones and \nbody parts have been so expertly fashioned into the corridor that it's \nimpossible to distinguish where the organic ends and the mechanical begins.\nShe enters \nanother corridor. Her face is struck by a JET OF HISSING STEAM.\nShe presses \nonward. Slipping past the skulls and littered metal on the floor.\nAnother BLAST \nOF STEAM.\nSomething leaps \nout of the middle of it.\nJulia whirls \nback around a corner, pressing flat against the wall as a BLACK SHAPE moves \nthrough the steam. Unidentifiable features. Movements that suggest nothing by \nchaos and madness.\nThe SHAPE \nHISSES and CROAKS in the hallway.\nJulia waits. \nShe doesn't even breathe. The HISSING stops.\nShe gradually \nturns to peek back into the hallway where the thing once stood.\nCLOSE ON \nJULIA'S EYES\nas she looks \naround the corner. The shape has disappeared.\nCarefully she \nkeeps going forward. Drenched in water and sweat. Slipping through the steam \nclouds that mask another entrance.\nINT. LAIR - \nNIGHT\nA massive room \nwhere empty human skins are dangling from hooks, complete and preserved from \nhead to toe. The skins sway and rock gently in the draft. Thousands of them.\nJulia moves \ntowards the center of the room.\nA large \nOPERATING TABLE awaits. But the surface of the table is sunken like a water \nbasin. Next to the table is a pedestal littered with BLOODY INSTRUMENTS. Cutting \ntools. Knives. Curved hooks.\nJulia notices \nthat Paul's torn clothes are resting at the foot of the table. Shirt shredded to \na rag. Sneakers orphaned nearby. Jeans spattered with blood.\nHer breathing \nquickens. Her heart POUNDING.\nShe reaches the \nfoot of the table. Paul is lying within the basin, completely naked and \npartially covered with LITTERED BODY PARTS. Organs and entrails. \nThe basin is \nfilled with water and blood. An immobile form is resting next to him.\nJulia moves \nquickly. She tries to wake him up.\nJULIA\nPaul. Paul, \nwake up.\nHe stirs. His \nnose crinkles slightly.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nWake up.\nShe grabs him \nand lifts him up. He starts COUGHING.\nJULIA (cont'd)\nYou've gotta \nhurry.\n(then)\nHere ...\nJulia grabs his \njeans. She helps him slide down from the basin and he pulls them on.\nA skinned HAND \ngrabs hers. Julia yelps a SCREAM.\nThe other form \n-- a thing in the basin -- rises \nand turns. Slicked with blood. Empty sockets where the eyes should be. Mouth \nfalling open. A horror that shouldn't be alive.\nJulia SCREAMS \nagain.\nHer free hand \ngrabs a HOOK from the pedestal and swings the blade into the thing's neck. Blood \nfountains up.\nThe thing \nbegins SHRIEKING.\nWith Paul \nleaning on her for support, Julia rapidly heads for the door.\nINT. MAIN \nHALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS\nJulia navigates \nher way through the hallways. Moving blindly through sudden JETS OF STEAM, the \nsound of MACHINES around them. Paul leans on her, his eyes remaining closed, \nCOUGHING and stumbling.\nJULIA'S POV\nRacing through \nthe halls. The steam clouds suddenly EXPLODING into her view. \nINT. STAIRWELL \n- CONTINUOUS\nJulia reaches \nthe stairwell and helps Paul climb the steps. She looks back over her shoulder. \nNothing behind them.\nINT. CORRIDOR - \nCONTINUOUS\nJulia stops at \nthe corridor opening. The strobe light FLASHES within. Clicking.\nThe corridor \nlooks empty. Nothing but pipes and shadows.\nJULIA\nWe're almost \nthere.\nJulia turns to \nPaul and finds a face with glaring yellow eyes and metal teeth. He stares back \nat her.\nA moment of \nsheer horror. Julia reels back into the corridor. Pressed flat against the wall. \nSliding towards the crawl space opening.\nPaul starts \nadvancing into the corridor. Grinning with teeth that flash with every click of \nthe strobe light.\nShe keeps \nsliding away ...\nHe grabs his \nchest and RIPS IT OPEN, tearing the covering skin apart as he would a shirt. A \nmenagerie of human bones and metal are revealed behind it.\nJulia tries to \nscream. Eyes wide. She can't make a sound.\nPaul tears the \nskin covering his chest wider. Pulling it away. Stripping himself clean.\nJulia reaches \nthe crawl space. Sliding down.\nThe last pieces \nPaul's skin are torn off. The thing that had been pretending to be Paul stands \nin his place.\nOnly brief \nglimpses are allowed by the strobe light. An abysm of immemorial lunacy \nconsisting of fashioned human parts and twisted metal. A human heart beating \nwithin exposed ribs. Bones combined with pulleys and rods. The face of a skull. \nA contradiction of all matter and cosmic order.\nJulia slips \nback into the crawl space. Still trying to scream.\nINT. CRAWL \nSPACE - NIGHT\nJulia drags \nherself through the crawl space. Moving quickly. Panicked.\nINT. SUBWAY \nTUNNEL - NIGHT\nJulia squeezes \nherself through the exposed hole.

The lights alongside of her start \nflickering and go out, one by one, as she advances.\nTHE HISSING AND \nSCREAMING CONTINUES TO RISE.\nShe reaches the \nopposite tunnel and grabs hold of the platform, pulling herself up. The platform \ngoes dark.\nAppearing out \nof the far tunnel are a DOZEN DARK SHAPES, scampering along the walls and \nrunning on all fours across the tracks. Their characteristics barely \nvisible.\nJulia kicks \nback as the shrieking things bear down on her, yellow eyes flaring in the dark, \nmetal teeth flashing.\nJulia tries to \nrun for the escalator, but the things cover the walls behind the tracks. Ready \nto spring.\nFinally, one of \nthe monsters does leap towards her ...\nAND IS SMASHED \nTO BITS BY AN APPROACHING BART TRAIN.\nReducing the \nmonster to a few vestiges of scattered metal. The other creatures on the tracks \nare also run down.\nJulia watches \nas the train RUMBLES past. And then, silence.\nNothing is left \nexcept for a few swirling newspapers. The lights flicker and come back to \nlife.\nRising up to \nher feet, rescued from death by chance, Julia starts backing towards the \nescalator. Her eyes locked upon the darkened tunnel before she turns and races \nup.\nEXT. SUBWAY \nSTATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT\nRain has \nstarted falling again. Pelting the stairs.\nJulia dashes up \nthe stairwell and sprints into the street. She doesn't look back.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT. SAN \nFRANCISCO - STREET - NIGHT\nThe rain falls \nso heavily that it creates a dense, blue FOG which shrouds the entire \nstreet.\nJulia appears \nthrough the storm, running towards a telephone booth on the street corner.

Can you hear me?\n(beat)\n... Dad?\nGUY\n(over \nphone)\nI can't hear \nyou. Hello?\nBeat.\nJULIA\nDaddy, help me \n... help me, please ...\nINT. LEVIN \nRESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nMore STATIC \nresounds over the phone. Guy hesitates a moment, then returns the portable to \nthe cradle.\nINT. PHONE \nBOOTH - NIGHT\nCLICK. The line \nis abruptly cut off.\nJulia begins to \ncry. She covers her face with her hands. The tears roll through her fingers.\nINT. LEVIN \nRESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nGuy stares at \nthe phone for a moment.\u00a0 A strange \nfeeling. Something isn't right. He thinks a moment.

This is \nJulia. Her skin is pale. Her hair is stringy and knotted.\nJULIA\nI've been \nlooking for you.\nCONNOR\nWhat?\nBARRY\n(hushed)\nGreat.\nMIKE\nJust ignore \nher.\nJULIA\nThey tried to \nget me.
