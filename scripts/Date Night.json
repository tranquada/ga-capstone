Suddenly, we hear the piles of\r\n          pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground.

PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an\r\n          ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.\r\n\r\n                          E\r\n\r\n          OLLIE (O.S.)\r\n          Mo-om!\r\n          It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan\r\n          in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER\r\n          while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a\r\n          T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each\r\n          side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite\r\n          directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the\r\n          hall and Phil to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n          OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Mom! Mom! Mom!\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          I'm coming, Ollie!\r\n\r\n          INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER\r\n\r\n          As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's\r\n          bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil\r\n          showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the\r\n          doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack\r\n          of PAPERS in his hand.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          Uh Phil?\r\n\r\n                         0\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Yep?\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          I need to switch. I've got an open\r\n          house.\r\n          Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but\r\n          contains it.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Really?\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          Yeah. Really.\r\n          As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands\r\n          together.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          OK, so I say today we go for the slacker\r\n          look - cool yet approachable.\r\n\r\n                         OLLIE\r\n          Yeah, well Mom says that.\r\n          Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Oh. Well... that's cool too!\r\n\r\n          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME\r\n\r\n          The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly\r\n          through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin\r\n          SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.\r\n          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then\r\n          stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing\r\n          a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.\r\n          As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as\r\n          well.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          Ech. Mine.\r\n          She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts\r\n          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of\r\n          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.\r\n          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to\r\n          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and\r\n          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         5\r\n          Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the\r\n          holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.\r\n          As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad\r\n\r\n          NT. KITCHEN\r\n          Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as\r\n          Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits\r\n          at the table. Phil finally notices.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         OLLIE\r\n          Breakfast?\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n\r\n                         (HOPPING UP)\r\n          Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob\r\n          today. What's it gonna be?\r\n          Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign\r\n          of his tom.\r\n\r\n                         OLLIE\r\n          How about... some Captain Crunch?\r\n          Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n\r\n                         (DISTRACTED)\r\n\r\n                         OL\r\n          Captain Crunch?The cereal?\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Uh... yeah.

Your mouthy was still ail milky.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Sorry for the milky mouth.\r\n          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd1\r\n          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,\r\n          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk\r\n          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her\r\n          head, she tosses the carton in the trash.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport\r\n          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks\r\n          a newspaper off his lawn.\r\n\r\n          CHAZ (O.S.)\r\n          Well, well! We're up bright and early,\r\n          aren't we!\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Yes we are!\r\n          (under his breath)\r\n          ike you say to me every morning.\r\n          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and\r\n          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'\r\n          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few\r\n          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING\r\n          STUCK halfway.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         8\r\n\r\n                         PHIL (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n          OW! OW! OW!\r\n          Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and\r\n          peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.\r\n          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger\r\n          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the\r\n          front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear\r\n          and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's\r\n          seat.\r\n\r\n          HONKING.\r\n\r\n          EXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER\r\n\r\n          The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD\r\n          CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of\r\n          it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his\r\n          window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in\r\n          slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR\r\n\r\n          DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR\r\n          HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his\r\n          watch.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET\r\n\r\n\r\n                         E\r\n          Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her\r\n          30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW\r\n          SIGNS on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          His name's Juan and he's some kind of\r\n          Spanish, I think. He knows all these\r\n          exclusive, underground places downtown.\r\n          It's so exciting.

OPEN HOUSE\r\n\r\n          Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each\r\n          move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,\r\n          cleaning and inspecting.\r\n          The divorce was the best thing that ever\r\n          happened to me. Seriously. You know\r\n          that great nervous feeling in your\r\n          stomach?

She reaches into her large purse and pulls out\r\n          a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a\r\n          SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she\r\n          passes.\r\n\r\n          JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n          With Larry, I lost that. Everything had\r\n          just become routine, you know? Boring.\r\n          Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through\r\n          the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a\r\n          weird, loud buzzing noise.\r\n\r\n                         JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          Good for you, Jane.\r\n          Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki\r\n          the side and silencing it.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA (CONT'D)\r\n          Good for you.\r\n\r\n          T.

CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE\r\n\r\n          Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes\r\n          through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile\r\n          Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS\r\n          scream out their orders.\r\n\r\n          INT. MR.

A bit flustered, she opens her vents again.\r\n          Phil looks over at her.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL (CONIT'B)\r\n          I thought you were cold.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          I was, but then you turned it down and I\r\n          got hot.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          But I turned it down because... you see\r\n          when you open and close your vents it\r\n          makes my... never mind.\r\n          Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping\r\n          his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up,\r\n          suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding\r\n          toward the exit.\r\n\r\n                         CL AAA\r\n          What are you doing?\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          I'm just gonna take a shortcut.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          Phil, please don't.

Frustrated,\r\n          Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST\r\n          OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just\r\n          leaves it blowing on him as they drive.\r\n\r\n          INT.

But don't you guys have, like, some\r\n          kind of grace period or something?\r\n\r\n                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS\r\n          have an eight minute grace period.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          You have an eight minute grace period?\r\n          How did you come up with an eight minute\r\n          grace period?\r\n\r\n                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS\r\n\r\n                         (SHRUGS)\r\n          I just work here,\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          So what if someone's 9 minutes late?\r\n\r\n                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS\r\n          We're allowed to give a two minute grace\r\n          on the grace.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          23.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          OK. Which adds up to ten minutes! We're\r\n          11 minutes late. That's just one minute\r\n          later than the grace on the grace.\r\n\r\n                         SUPERMODEL HOSTESS\r\n          I'm sorry sir, but management\r\n          specifically said no grace on the grace\r\n          on the grace. After ten minutes, we send\r\n          a host around calling your name and if\r\n          there's no answer, we give the table\r\n          away.

As she turns to the\r\n          next page...\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Oh boy.\r\n\r\n          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Even the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago. As\r\n          Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a NERVOUS\r\n          YOUNG WOMAN washing her face over and over.\r\n          A knock and a SLICK LOOKING MAN quickly peeks his head in\r\n          the Women's room.\r\n\r\n          SLICK LOOKING MAN\r\n          We've gotta leave now.\r\n\r\n                         (SPOTTING CLARA)\r\n          Whoops.

Clara looks after them a second, then washes her\r\n          hands.\r\n\r\n          INT.

If they call\r\n          your name at the bar and you don't\r\n          answer, they give your table away. So\r\n          how about a nut?\r\n          A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar.\r\n\r\n                         YOUNG HOST\r\n\r\n          GALE PARTY?\r\n          Clara sighs, frustrated.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          I mean, did you try something like\r\n          telling her it was our anniversary, or my\r\n          birthday, or slipping her some money-\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the\r\n          answer!\r\n          Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST\r\n          searching for the party and starts focusing on him\r\n          instead of Phil as she thinks.\r\n\r\n                         YOUNG HOST\r\n\r\n          GALE PARTY?\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          I'm sure if you had been there instead of\r\n          peeing again you would have done it\r\n          better.\r\n\r\n                         YOUNG HOST\r\n\r\n          GALE PARTY?\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n\r\n                         (WATCHING HOST)\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          You're not even listening to me, are you?\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          (repeats, still watching)\r\n          Yeah I am.

She rummages\r\n          inside...\r\n          and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing\r\n          Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back\r\n          grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a\r\n          dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her,\r\n          she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground,\r\n          whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at\r\n          Harry.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA (CONT'D)\r\n          Drop the gun and the keys.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          oa! Clara!

As\r\n          they hurry on, the Greeter's TV goes to a PROMO TEASER\r\n          for the local late night news: a SNAPSHOT of Phil and\r\n          Clara from the boat with a caption that reads: BONNIE AND\r\n\r\n          CLOD?!?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          65.\r\n\r\n                         1\u00cf\u00bf\u00bd1\r\n          - In the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil pulls at the COMBINATION\r\n          LOCKS, searching for an open locker. Unable to find one,\r\n          he picks up a bench to throw it at them when TWO JOCKS in\r\n          workout clothes walk in and look at him strangely as he\r\n          holds the bench. Phil moves the bench back and forth,\r\n          pretending it's part of his EXERCISE ROUTINE.\r\n          - In the WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Clara, wrapped in a towel,\r\n          blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN\r\n          WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile\r\n          at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN\r\n          disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD\r\n          DASH for the lockers.\r\n          - Back in the MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, Phil lingers as a MAN IN\r\n          A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the\r\n          man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him,\r\n          excitedly telling him something and pointing outside.\r\n          The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly\r\n          undressing.\r\n          - The Attractive Thin Woman comes back to her locker and\r\n          opens it. Her face drops. Inside hang CL A\"S DRIPPING\r\n\r\n          CLOTHES.\r\n          - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt\r\n          and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then\r\n          stops, stunned. Clara, waiting for him with her hair\r\n          blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\r\n          RED HEELS, looks AMAZING. From her expression, she feels\r\n          the same about Phil.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ALLEY - LATER\r\n\r\n          Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a\r\n          dark, derelict alley.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Down here?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          It's what she said.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          And if you die, does Jane get your\r\n          commissic-l on the open house?\r\n          Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a\r\n          bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby.\r\n          Nervously, Clara approaches.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          Excuse me?\r\n          Men shoot her a fierce look.\r\n\r\n                         E\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          66.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA (CONT'D)\r\n          Um... do you know which is the way back\r\n          to Kansas?\r\n          They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them\r\n          LUNGES, and Phil jumps back...\r\n          but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a\r\n          RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.\r\n\r\n                         SHADY GUY #1\r\n          Welcome to the Rainbow.\r\n\r\n          INT. THE RAINBOW - LATER\r\n\r\n          Reaching the bottom of the stairway, Phil and Clara,\r\n          amazed, take in THE RAINBOW.\r\n          It's a CAVERNOUS ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION that's been\r\n          converted into a GLAMOROUS CLUB. The place is PACKED\r\n          with an elite looking CROWD. Everything in the room -\r\n          the carpet, the tapestries, the clothes of the waitstaff -\r\n          is EMERALD GREEN.\r\n          Phil and Clara nod at each other then separate,\r\n          disappearing into the mix.\r\n\r\n          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW - SAME\r\n\r\n          Phil looks around, amazed as he wanders between BLACKJACK\r\n          and BACCARAT tables, where well-to-do OLDER guests gamble\r\n          large sums of money, fast looking WOMEN cheering them on.\r\n\r\n          VOICE (O.S.)\r\n          If you wanner be pissed at anyone about\r\n          it, be pissed at Stockton...\r\n          Hearing the name, Phil spots a BALDING MAN talking to 2\r\n          other MEN at one of the tables. He lingers closer.\r\n\r\n                         BALDING MAN\r\n          You know, rumor is he's behind the whole\r\n          mess. Raking it in on both ends.\r\n          What do you mean?\r\n\r\n                         BALDING MAN\r\n          Hush hush shell companies he owns. One\r\n          of them hires all the construction\r\n          inspectors. Another he's got rents all\r\n          the construction equipment. The more one\r\n          slows things down with violations,\r\n          more the other takes to the bank.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          67.\r\n          The Balding Man leans in and speaks more quietly, causing\r\n          Phil to lean in even more.\r\n\r\n          BALDING MAN (CONT'D)\r\n          My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor\r\n          Diggs' reelection. Imagine what someone\r\n          like him could do if he got someone less\r\n          \"squeaky clean\" in the Mansion.\r\n          The Balding Man suddenly notices Phil listening. Phil\r\n          pastes on an excited face.\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          you! Gale, right?\r\n\r\n                         BALDING MAN\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         PHIL\r\n          Sorry. From the side... confused you\r\n          with somebody else.\r\n          Phil quickly moves on.\r\n\r\n          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW -\r\n\r\n          Clara talks to a BUSY BARTENDER at the bar as he\r\n          scrambles to fill drink orders.\r\n\r\n          BA --Y_-_.\r\n          really get s,-.y names.\r\n\r\n                         CLARA\r\n          Thanks any-way.\r\n          With a sigh, Clara starts away from the bar, when she\r\n\r\n          FREEZES.\r\n          ough the crowd, FRANK and HARRY walk right toward her -\r\n          but they haven't seen her yet. Clara spots the KITCHEN\r\n          DOORS nearby and rushes through.\r\n          INT. KITCHEN - C vUOUS\r\n          Clara peeks out through the double door windows. Frank\r\n          and Harry continue through the crowd, unaware.\r\n\r\n          VOICE (O.S.)\r\n          Watch it!\r\n          Clara quickly hugs a large bulletin board covered with\r\n          pictures and time schedules as a WAITER carries a large\r\n          tray of food past her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          68.\r\n          As she moves off the wall, some papers drop. Clara pins\r\n          them back on, when something else on the bulletin board\r\n          catches her eye...\r\n          .Among all the snapshots of staff scattered on the\r\n          bulletin board is a picture of a backyard party with a\r\n          whole group of laughing young people, and the middle of\r\n          the picture, smiling at the camera...\r\n          . is THE NERVOUS WOMAN FROM THE SIGNATURE ROOM\r\n\r\n          BATHROOM.\r\n          Clara pulls the picture off the wall.

They're\r\n          face to face - nose to nose - with another broken\r\n          windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA\r\n          h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\r\n          stares at them in shock.\r\n\r\n                         BLACK DUDE\r\n          No no no.

BUT DO IT!\r\n          Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to\r\n          reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on\r\n          the gas.\r\n          The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS\r\n          as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY\r\n          SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The\r\n          Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield\r\n          into the passenger's seat next to Phil.\r\n\r\n                         BLACK DUDE\r\n\r\n          JESUS CHRIST!

CUT THE JESUS!\r\n          Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps\r\n          on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels\r\n          smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race\r\n          past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in\r\n          pursuit.\r\n          Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their\r\n          conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and\r\n          Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly\r\n          back and forth. They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK\r\n          DOWN a whole row of mail boxes until Phil spins h--'-s v;:-reel,\r\n          getting them back into the street.\r\n\r\n                         BLACK DUDE\r\n          Just let me out, OK?

Up bright and early, aren\r\n          Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in\r\n          his jogging suit.
