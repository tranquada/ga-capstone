The single light bulb on the low\nceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body.\nA nasty piece of machinery.\n\nLong, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt\nbeard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are\ndeep, reptilian.  Intense.\n\nHis position, though not overtly threatening, suggests a\nwillingness to strike without warning which gives the\nM.P.'s pause.\n\nTrautman steps forward between the MPs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTRAUTMAN\n</b>\t\tAt ease, Rambo.\n\n<b>MED.

The truck veers into a ditch, slews,\nhurling up a sheet of water and flops ignominiously on its\nside.\n\nRambo lands clear.

There is a clear trail of\nblood smeared on the grass, indicating a serious wound.\n\nVARIOUS CLOSEUPS of the regulars as they advance, each man\nrealizing how utterly isolated he really is, in his own\nisland of space in the green sea.  It is hot.  Some of the\nsoldiers have their fatigues unbuttoned, sleeves rolled\nup.  Sweat pours off them.\n\nPOV, HANDHELD, following the trail of blood.

They trample over each other to\nrun as the trail of fire reaches the can.\n\n<b>VOOM!\n</b>\nTay sees a tremendous fireball erupt ahead.  Hears\nSCREAMING.

Obviously a\nrecent conscript, the soldier is probably only 18 years\nold, and like all Vietnamese, looks even younger.  He is\nterrified.\n\nHe stumbles over the body of another trooper.  As he\nrises, a shape slashes through the grass right in front of\nhim.\nHe has never seen an American, but it looks as monstrous\nas the descriptions.\n\nHe raises his AK but Rambo is quicker, kicking it out of\nhis hands.  The kid flops on his butt and finds himself\nstaring up Rambo's rifle barrel.  He closes his eyes and\npops into his mouth his BUDDHIST PRAYER MEDALLION, hanging\nfrom a chain around his neck.  He bites down and waits for\noblivion.\n\nWhen he opens his eyes there is nothing in front of him\nbut grass.\n\nNearby, Vinh leads the retreat as his men fall back, dim\nshapes rushing blindly through the murk.\nHe staggers, coughing, out of the stand of grass to see\nTay, sitting dazed nearby.  Tay gives him an evil smirk.\n\nBarking orders like a maniac, Vinh calls for MORTARS to be\nset up.  Five mortars are positioned.  Elevation set.\nMortar bombs poised above the launch tubes.  The\nhelicopters clear off.\n\nWhen the last wounded man is dragged clear, Vinh signals\nfor a sighting round.\nIt EXPLODES beyond the wall of flame.  The mortars open\nfire.\n\nThe field explodes seconds later with the first salvo.\nEarth and shredded grass are hurled skyward.  A second\nsalvo lands.  A third.

HUEY\n</b>\nAs he approaches the black Sikorsky Rambo sees Trautman\nwith a rifle to Doyle's head.\nHe nods as they pass.\n\n\n<b>INT./ EXT.  SIKORSKY\n</b>\nRambo's Huey passes by them, crossing into Thailand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTRAUTMAN\n</b>\t\tEscort them on in.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MOTC\n</b>\nRambo's Huey, followed by the Sikorsky, descends toward\nthe landing field.  As the techs and other camp personnel\nstand watching, Kirkhill raises a pair of powerful field\nglasses.\n\n<b>KIRKHILL'S POV - TELEPHOTO\n</b>\nThe image of the Huey seems to waver insubstantially\nthrough the long lens.  It looks like a death ship, the\nFlying Dutchman with a crew of corpses and a demon at the\nhelm, coming in out of the dusk sky.\n\nHe slowly lowers the glasses.\nFace ashen, Kirkhill backs into the command center and\ncloses the door.\n\nThe Huey sheers sideways across the staging area.\nIts skids clip the top of the MOTC, shearing off\ncommunications gear.\nIt hits the ground.  Bounces.\nSlews around, scraping hideously.\n\nAnd stops.\nThe Sikorsky settles behind it.\n\nThe two choppers whine-down.  Standing beside the cockpit,\nTrautman gets on the Sikorsky's loudspeaker.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTRAUTMAN\n</b>\t\tAll base personnel.  Prepare medical\n\t\tfacilities to receive American POWs.\n\nA cheer is raised among the ground contingent as they\nsurge forward.\n\n<b>ON RAMBO\n</b>\nsliding painfully out of the flight seat.  Brewer gawks at\nthe pool of blood collected in the hollow of Rambo's seat.\n\nRambo goes to the gun door.  Takes De Fravio's AK-47.\n\nDOLLYING WITH RAMBO as he limps toward the MOTC with\nrelentless determination.  The well-wishing ground\npersonnel fall back, letting him pass.\n\nTrautman, B.G., sees him and strides forward to intercept.\n\n<b>OVER RAMBO'S SHOULDER\n</b>\nDOLLYING, as he approaches the command center.\nKirkhill's aide, in dark glasses, moves forward to\nrestrain him.\n\nRambo motions him aside with the AK.\nGoes to the door.  It is locked.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MOTC\n</b>\nThe lock is shattered by a LONG BLAST from Rambo's AK.\nThe door is kicked open.  Rambo stands silhouetted.\n\nHe looks like what we never saw in \"The Monkey's Paw.\"\nHe moves into the humming command center, among the\nmission control electronics, reeking of the jungle, blood\nand death.\n\n<b>LOW ANGLE\n</b>\nas Rambo walks to Kirkhill, looming.  Stopping.\n\nKirkhill quails as Rambo grasps him by the collar and\nflings him backward into a chair.\nHe raises the AK.  Muzzle to Kirkhill's forehead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRAMBO\n</b>\t\tMission accomplished.\n\nPulls the trigger.\nThe weapon CLICKS, EMPTY.\n\nHOLD ON KIRKHILL, trembling.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MOTC\n</b>\nRambo steps unsteadily out into the waning light.\nHe takes a deep, slow breath.  Starts to walk.  He salutes\nas he passes Trautman but says nothing.\n\nIn the B.G. they are carrying the POWs in stretchers or\npushing them in wheelchairs toward the MEDICAL TRAILER.\nRambo watches Brewer posing with his arms around Jensen\nand another POW for the grunt we saw earlier.  His pocket\nInstamatic is clicking away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBREWER\n</b>\t\t\t(expansively)\n\t\tCover of Time Magazine, baby!\n\nRambo walks away... alone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDE FRAVIO (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tHey, Rambo!\n\nRambo turns.  De Fravio, propped up on one elbow on his\nstretcher as he is carried past, gives him a broad,\nappreciative grin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDE FRAVIO\n</b>\t\tYou did good, buddy.  Real good!\n\nRambo stands blinking for a second.  He raises his hand in\na big \"thumbs up\" and allows himself to grin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO BLACK\n</b>\n<b>END CREDITS\n</b>\n\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Rambo: First Blood II: The Mission</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=James Cameron\" title=\"Scripts by James Cameron\">James Cameron</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Rambo: First Blood II: The Mission Script.html#comments\" title=\"Rambo: First Blood II: The Mission comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:14:10.076647"}
