No sooner is the door shut than \n\tthey're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at \n\tflesh, mouths locked together. \n\n\tHe gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over \n\tinstead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like \n\tgetting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She \n\tarches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against \n\tthe wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. \n\n\tHe enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the \n\twall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not \n\tcaring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with \n\tthe sensations running through her. He carries her across the \n\troom with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. \n\n\tCAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling \n\tsmoothly outside... \n\n2\tEXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2\n\n\t...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the \n\tlovers' cries spilling into the night... \n\n\t...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting \n\tpassion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of \n\tcrickets and hoot owls... \n\n\t...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and\n\tincongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... \n\n\t...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing. \n\n3\tINT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3\n\n\tANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. \n\tUnder normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly\n\tdangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far \n\tfrom normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A \n\tcigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are \n\triveted to the bungalow up the path. \n\n\tHe can hear them fucking from here. \n\n\tHe raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio \n\tplays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: \n\n\t\tYou stepped out of a dream... \n\t\tYou are too wonderful... \n\t\tTo be what you seem... \n\n\tHe opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped\n\tin a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --\n\n\t-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. \n\n\tHe grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over \n\tthe seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, \n\tloading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. \n\tSix in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. \n\n\tHe shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant \n\tlovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then \n\topens the door and steps from the car. \n\n4\tEXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4\n\n\tHis wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to \n\tthe ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. \n\n\tHe starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he \n\tgets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more \n\tfrenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of \n\tpassion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. \n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN (O.S.) \n\t\tOh god...oh god...oh god... \n\n\tAndy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in \n\torgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He \n\tshuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. \n\n\tIt finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left \n\tis the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear \n\tlanguorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. \n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN (O.S.) \n\t\tOh god...that's sooo good...you're \n\t\tthe best...the best I ever had... \n\n\tAndy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like \n\tmuch of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt \n\tpath in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun \n\theld loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really. \n\n\tFADE TO BLACK: 1ST TITLE UP \n\n5\tINT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5\n\n\tTHE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, \n\tpale-faced and stupefied. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. (O.S.) \n\t\tMr. Dufresne, describe the \n\t\tconfrontation you had with your \n\t\twife the night she was murdered. \n\n\tANDY DUFRESNE \n\n\tis on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, \n\thair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tIt was very bitter. She said she \n\t\twas glad I knew, that she hated all \n\t\tthe sneaking around. She said she \n\t\twanted a divorce in Reno. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tWhat was your response? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI told her I would not grant one. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\t\t(refers to his notes) \n\t\tI'll see you in Hell before I see\n\t\tyou in Reno. Those were the words \n\t\tyou used, Mr. Dufresne, according \n\t\tto the testimony of your neighbors. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tIf they say so. I really don't \n\t\tremember. I was upset. \n\n\tFADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tWhat happened after you and your \n\t\twife argued? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tShe packed a bag and went to stay \n\t\twith Mr. Quentin. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tGlenn Quentin. The golf pro at the \n\t\tFalmouth Hills Country Club. The \n\t\tman you had recently discovered was \n\t\ther lover. \n\t\t\t(Andy nods) \n\t\tDid you follow her? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI went to a few bars first. Later, \n\t\tI decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's \n\t\thome and confront them. They \n\t\tweren't there...so I parked my car \n\t\tin the turnout...and waited. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tWith what intention? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. \n\t\tI think mostly I wanted to scare them. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tYou had a gun with you? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tYes. I did. \n\n\tFADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tWhen they arrived, you went up \n\t\tto the house and murdered them? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tNo. I was sobering up. I realized \n\t\tshe wasn't worth it. I decided to \n\t\tlet her have her quickie divorce. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tQuickie divorce indeed. A .38 \n\t\tcaliber divorce, wrapped in a \n\t\thandtowel to muffle the shots, \n\t\tisn't that what you mean? And then \n\t\tyou shot her lover! \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI did not. I got back in the car \n\t\tand drove home to sleep it off. \n\t\tAlong the way, I stopped and threw \n\t\tmy gun into the Royal River. I feel \n\t\tI've been very clear on this point. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tYes, you have. Where I get hazy, \n\t\tthough, is the part where the \n\t\tcleaning woman shows up the next \n\t\tmorning and finds your wife and her \n\t\tlover in bed, riddled with .38 \n\t\tcaliber bullets. Does that strike \n\t\tyou as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. \n\t\tDufresne, or is it just me? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\t\t(softly) \n\t\tYes. It does. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tI'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't \n\t\tthink the jury heard that. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tYes. It does. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tDoes what? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tStrike me as a fantastic coincidence. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tOn that, sir, we are in accord... \n\n\tFADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tYou claim you threw your gun into \n\t\tthe Royal River before the murders \n\t\ttook place. That's rather convenient. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tIt's the truth. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tYou recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? \n\t\tHe and his men dragged that river \n\t\tfor three days and nary a gun was \n\t\tfound. So no comparison can be made \n\t\tbetween your gun and the bullets \n\t\ttaken from the bloodstained corpses \n\t\tof the victims. That's also rather \n\t\tconvenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\t\t(faint, bitter smile) \n\t\tSince I am innocent of this crime, \n\t\tsir, I find it decidedly inconvenient \n\t\tthe gun was never found. \n\n\tFADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP \n\n6\tINT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6\n\n\tThe D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:\n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tLadies and gentlemen, you've heard \n\t\tall the evidence, you know all the \n\t\tfacts. We have the accused at the \n\t\tscene of the crime. We have foot \n\t\tprints. Tire tracks. Bullets \n\t\tscattered on the ground which bear \n\t\this fingerprints. A broken bourbon \n\t\tbottle, likewise with fingerprints. \n\t\tMost of all, we have a beautiful \n\t\tyoung woman and her lover lying \n\t\tdead in each other's arms. They had \n\t\tsinned. But was their crime so \n\t\tgreat as to merit a death sentence? \n\n\tHe gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tI suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to \n\t\tthat would be yes. I further \n\t\tsuspect he carried out that \n\t\tsentence on the night of September \n\t\t21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, \n\t\tby pumping four bullets into his \n\t\twife and another four into Glenn \n\t\tQuentin. And while you think about \n\t\tthat, think about this... \n\n\tHe picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes \n\tlike a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. \n\n\t\t\t\tD.A. \n\t\tA revolver holds six bullets, not \n\t\teight. I submit to you this was not \n\t\ta hot-blooded crime of passion! \n\t\tThat could at least be understood, \n\t\tif not condoned. No, this was \n\t\trevenge of a much more brutal and \n\t\tcold-blooded nature. Consider! Four \n\t\tbullets per victim! Not six shots \n\t\tfired, but eight! That means he \n\t\tfired the gun empty...and then \n\t\tstopped to reload so he could shoot \n\t\teach of them again! An extra bullet \n\t\tper lover...right in the head. \n\t\t\t(a few JURORS shiver) \n\t\tI'm done talking. You people are \n\t\tall decent, God-fearing Christian \n\t\tfolk. You know what to do. \n\n\tFADE TO BLACK: 6TH TITLE UP \n\n7\tINT -- JURY ROOM -- DAY (1946) 7\n\n\tCAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the \n\tnext.

THE JUDGE peers down, framed by a \n\tcarved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall. \n\n\t\t\t\tJUDGE \n\t\tYou strike me as a particularly icy \n\t\tand remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. \n\t\tIt chills my blood just to look at \n\t\tyou. By the power vested in me by \n\t\tthe State of Maine, I hereby order \n\t\tyou to serve two life sentences, \n\t\tback to back, one for each of your \n\t\tvictims. So be it. \n\n\tHe raps his gavel as we \n\n\tCRASH TO BLACK: LAST TITLE UP. \n\n9 \tAN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9\n\n\tslides open with an enormous CLANG.

We are now in: \n\n\tINT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1947) \n\n\tRED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair. \n\n\t\t\t\tMAN #1 \n\t\tSit. \n\n\tRed sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable. \n\n\t\t\t\tMAN #2 \n\t\tWe see by your file you've served \n\t\ttwenty years of a life sentence. \n\n\t\t\t\tMAN #3 \n\t\tYou feel you've been rehabilitated? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tYes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned \n\t\tmy lesson. I can honestly say I'm a \n\t\tchanged man. I'm no longer a danger \n\t\tto society. That's the God's honest \n\t\ttruth. No doubt about it. \n\n\tThe men just stare at him.

Over a hundred CONS are \n\tin the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each \n\tother, making deals. Exercise period. \n\n\n\n\tRED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the \n\tactivity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing \n\tminor business. He's an important man here. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThere's a con like me in every prison \n\t\tin America, I guess. I'm the guy who \n\t\tcan get it for you. Cigarettes, a \n\t\tbag of reefer if you're partial, a \n\t\tbottle of brandy to celebrate your \n\t\tkid's high school graduation. Damn \n\t\tnear anything, within reason. \n\n\tHe slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tYes sir, I'm a regular Sears & \n\t\tRoebuck. \n\n\tTWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing \n\teverybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate \n\tswings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tSo when Andy Dufresne came to me in \n\t\t1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita \n\t\tHayworth into the prison for him, I \n\t\ttold him no problem. And it wasn't. \n\n\t\t\t\tCON \n\t\tFresh fish! Fresh fish today! \n\n\tRed is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. \n\tMost cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his \n\tgroup mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably. \n\n11\tINT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11\n\n\tAndy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tAndy came to Shawshank Prison in \n\t\tearly 1947 for murdering his wife \n\t\tand the fella she was bangin'. \n\n\tThe bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes \n\taround, swallowed by prison walls. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tOn the outside, he'd been vice- \n\t\tpresident of a large Portland bank. \n\t\tGood work for a man as young as he \n\t\twas, when you consider how \n\t\tconservative banks were back then. \n\n\t\t\t\tTOWER GUARD \n\t\tAll clear! \n\n\tGUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. \n\tThe new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking \n\tsourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in \n\tfront of him, almost drags him down. \n\n\tBYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into \n\tAndy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS \n\tand SHOUTS from the spectators. \n\n\t\t\t\tHADLEY \n\t\tOn your feet before I fuck you up \n\t\tso bad you never walk again. \n\n13 \tON THE BLEACHERS 13\n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tThere they are, boys.

Andy and the others are paraded along, \n\tforced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching \n\tunder the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are \n\tshaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their \n\tpants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look \n\tterrified. Especially Andy. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI must admit I didn't think much of \n\t\tAndy first time I laid eyes on him. \n\t\tHe might'a been important on the \n\t\toutside, but in here he was just a \n\t\tlittle turd in prison grays. Looked \n\t\tlike a stiff breeze could blow him \n\t\tover. That was my first impression \n\t\tof the man. \n\n\t\t\t\tSKEET \n\t\tWhat say, Red? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tLittle fella on the end.

The CONS in their cells greet them \n\twith TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are \n\tshown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThe first night's the toughest, no \n\t\tdoubt about it. They march you in \n\t\tnaked as the day you're born, fresh \n\t\tfrom a Bible reading, skin burning \n\t\tand half-blind from that delousing \n\t\tshit they throw on you... \n\n\tRed watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, \n\tcigarette dangling from his fingers. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\t...and when they put you in that \n\t\tcell, when those bars slam home, \n\t\tthat's when you know it's for real. \n\t\tOld life blown away in the blink of \n\t\tan eye...a long cold season in hell \n\t\tstretching out ahead...nothing \n\t\tleft but all the time in the world \n\t\tto think about it. \n\n\tRed listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few \n\tothers being brought up to the 2nd tier. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tMost new fish come close to madness \n\t\tthe first night. Somebody always \n\t\tbreaks down crying. Happens every \n\t\ttime. The only question is, who's \n\t\tit gonna be? \n\n\tAndy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tIt's as good a thing to bet on as \n\t\tany, I guess.

Now shut the fuck up \n\t\t'fore I sing you a lullabye! \n\n\tFat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley \n\tdraws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. \n\n\tA GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts \n\tbeating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass \n\tfalls, tries to crawl. \n\n\tThe place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull\n\tTHWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley\n\tgets in a few more licks and finally stops. \n\n\t\t\t\tHADLEY \n\t\tGet this tub of shit down to the \n\t\tinfirmary. \n\t\t\t(peers around) \n\t\tIf I hear so much as a mouse fart \n\t\tin here the rest of the night, by \n\t\tGod and Sonny Jesus, you'll all \n\t\tvisit the infirmary.

Silence. \n\n30\tINT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 30\n\n\tRed stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes \n\triveted to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tHis first night in the joint, Andy \n\t\tDufresne cost me two packs of \n\t\tcigarettes.

The GUARDS holler \n\ttheir head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. \n\tRed peers at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, \n\tcollar buttoned, hair combed. \n\n32\tINT -- MESS HALL -- MORNING (1947) 32\n\n\tAndy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on\n\this tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and \n\tdiscover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go \n\tby. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, \n\tmutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. \n\n\tAndy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses\n\ta spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their \n\tstares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something\n\tin his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. \n\n\tIt's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with\n\tit. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's\n\ta senior citizen, a long-standing resident. \n\n\t\t\t\tBROOKS \n\t\tYou gonna eat that? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tHadn't planned on it. \n\n\t\t\t\tBROOKS \n\t\tYou mind? \n\n\tAndy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling\n\tit between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine \n\tcigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. \n\n\t\t\t\tBROOKS \n\t\tMmm. Nice and ripe. \n\n\tAndy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and \n\tfeeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.\n\tAndy breathes a sigh of relief. \n\n\t\t\t\tBROOKS \n\t\tJake says thanks. Fell out of his \n\t\tnest over by the plate shop. I'm \n\t\tlookin' after him till he's old \n\t\tenough to fly. \n\n\tAndy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIGGER \n\t\tOh, Christ, here he comes. \n\n\t\t\t\tHEYWOOD \n\t\tMornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. \n\t\tYou know why it's fine? \n\n\tHeywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out\n\tcigarettes and handing them down. \n\n\t\t\t\tHEYWOOD \n\t\tThat's right, send 'em all down. I \n\t\twanna see 'em lined up in a row, \n\t\tpretty as a chorus line. \n\n\tAn impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales\n\tdeeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture. \n\n\t\t\t\tFLOYD \n\t\tSmell my ass... \n\n\t\t\t\tHEYWOOD \n\t\tGee, Red. Terrible shame, your \n\t\thorse comin' in last and all. \n\t\tHell, I sure do love that horse of \n\t\tmine. I believe I owe that boy a \n\t\tbig sloppy kiss when I see him. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tGive him some'a your cigarettes \n\t\tinstead, cheap bastard. \n\n\t\t\t\tHEYWOOD \n\t\tSay Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty \n\t\tthis week?

Poor bastard lay there till \n\t\tthis morning. By then... \n\n\tHe shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence\n\tmounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly:\n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tWhat was his name? \n\n\t\t\t\tHEYWOOD \n\t\tWhat? What'd you say? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI was wondering if anyone knew his \n\t\tname. \n\n\t\t\t\tHEYWOOD \n\t\tWhat the fuck you care, new fish? \n\t\t\t(resumes eating) \n\t\tDoesn't matter what his fuckin' \n\t\tname was. He's dead. \n\n33\tINT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 33\n\n\tA DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works\n\tthe laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the\n\tcon foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done. \n\n34\tINT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34\n\n\tShower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a\n\tdozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good\n\tand hot, soothing his tortured muscles. \n\n\tBogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up\n\tand down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\n\tYou're some sweet punk. You been \n\tbroke in yet? \n\n\tAndy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing\n\tserious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\t\tHard to get. I like that. \n\n\tAndy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving\n\tthe three Sisters laughing. \n\n35\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35\n\n\tAndy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. \n\n36\tEXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36\n\n\tExercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, \n\tlazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the\n\tside. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. \n\tHeywood and Jigger pause, watching. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\t\t(offers his hand) \n\t\tHello. I'm Andy Dufresne. \n\n\tRed glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.\n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tThe wife-killin' banker. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tHow do you know that? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tI keep my ear to the ground. Why'd \n\t\tyou do it? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI didn't, since you ask. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tHell, you'll fit right in, then. \n\t\t\t(off Andy's look) \n\t\tEveryone's innocent in here, don't \n\t\tyou know that? Heywood! What are \n\t\tyou in for, boy? \n\n\t\t\t\tHEYWOOD \n\t\tDidn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! \n\n\tRed gives Andy a look. See? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tWhat else have you heard? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tPeople say you're a cold fish. They \n\t\tsay you think your shit smells \n\t\tsweeter than ordinary. That true? \n\n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tWhat do you think? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tAin't made up my mind yet. \n\n\tHeywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the\n\tball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of\n\tthe corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends\n\tthe ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood\n\tdrops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI understand you're a man who knows \n\t\thow to get things. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tI'm known to locate certain things \n\t\tfrom time to time. They seem to \n\t\tfall into my hands. Maybe it's \n\t\t'cause I'm Irish. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI wonder if you could get me a \n\t\trock-hammer? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tWhat is it and why? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tYou make your customers' motives a \n\t\tpart of your business? \n\n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tIf you wanted a toothbrush, I \n\t\twouldn't ask questions. I'd just \n\t\tquote a price. A toothbrush, see, \n\t\tis a non-lethal sort of object. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tFair enough. A rock-hammer is about \n\t\teight or nine inches long. Looks \n\t\tlike a miniature pickaxe, with a \n\t\tsmall sharp pick on one end, and a \n\t\tblunt hammerhead on the other. It's \n\t\tfor rocks. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tRocks. \n\n\tAndy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of\n\tdirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and\n\trubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.\n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tQuartz? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tQuartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. \n\t\tSilted granite. There's some graded \n\t\tlimestone, from when they cut this \n\t\tplace out of the hill. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tSo? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI'm a rockhound. At least I was, in \n\t\tmy old life.

Just wait. \n\n\tRed flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tWord gets around. The Sisters have \n\t\ttaken a real shine to you, yes they \n\t\thave. Especially Bogs. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tTell me something. Would it help if \n\t\tI explained to them I'm not \n\t\thomosexual? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tNeither are they. You have to be \n\t\thuman first. They don't qualify. \n\t\t\t(off Andy's look) \n\t\tBull queers take by force, that's \n\t\tall they want or understand. I'd \n\t\tgrow eyes in the back of my head if \n\t\tI were you. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tThanks for the advice. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tThat comes free. But you understand \n\t\tmy concern. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tIf there's trouble, I doubt a rock- \n\t\thammer will do me any good. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tThen I guess you wanna escape. \n\t\tTunnel under the wall maybe? \n\t\t\t(Andy laughs politely) \n\t\tI miss the joke. What's so funny? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\n\tYou'll know when you see the rock- \n\thammer. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tWhat's this item usually go for? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tSeven dollars in any rock and gem shop.\n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tMy standard mark-up's twenty \n\t\tpercent, but we're talkin' about a \n\t\tspecial object. Risk goes up, price \n\t\tgoes up. Call it ten bucks even. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tTen it is. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tI'll see what I can do. \n\t\t\t(rises, slapping dust) \n\t\tBut it's a waste of money. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tOh? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tFolks who run this place love \n\t\tsurprise inspections. They turn a \n\t\tblind eye to some things, but not \n\t\ta gadget like that. They'll find \n\t\tit, and you'll lose it. Mention my \n\t\tname, we'll never do business \n\t\tagain. Not for a pair of shoelaces \n\t\tor a stick of gum. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tI understand. Thank you, Mr...? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tRed. The name's Red. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tRed. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing \n\t\tbusiness with you. \n\n\tThey shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI could see why some of the boys \n\t\ttook him for snobby. He had a quiet \n\t\tway about him, a walk and a talk \n\t\tthat just wasn't normal around \n\t\there. He strolled. like a man in a \n\t\tpark without a care or worry. Like \n\t\the had on an invisible coat that \n\t\twould shield him from this place. \n\t\t\t(resumes playing catch) \n\t\tYes, I think it would be fair to \n\t\tsay I liked Andy from the start. \n\n37\tINT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37\n\n\tRed gets his breakfast and heads for a table.

But a truly \n\t\tdetermined man can get an object \n\t\tquite a ways up there. \n\n\tLeonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry \n\tbag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... \n\n4l\tINT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41\n\n\tRed deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where \n\tthe clean sheets are being handed out. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThat's how Andy joined our happy \n\t\tlittle Shawshank family with more \n\t\tthan five hundred dollars on his \n\t\tperson. Determination. \n\n\tLeonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of \n\tclean sheets. He hands it across to Red -- \n\n\tTIGHT ANGLE \n\n\t-- and more than clean laundry changes hands.

She's just a woman. \n\n\tAndy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, \n\tturns back to the movie. \n\n65\tINT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65\n\n\tAndy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark \n\tfigures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and \n\tPete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant \n\tbear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a \n\tdoor open and drag him into -- \n\n66 \tTHE PROJECTION BOOTH 66\n\n\t-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con\n\tblinking at them through thick bifocals. \n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\t\tTake a walk. \n\n\t\t\t\tPROJECTIONIST \n\t\tI have to change reels. \n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\t\tI said fuck off. \n\n\tTerrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams \n\tand locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. \n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\t\tAin't you gonna scream? \n\n\tAndy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tThey'd never hear me over that. \n\t\tLet's get this over with. \n\n\tSeemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind \n\tbench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel\n\tof 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.\n\n\t\t\t\tROOSTER \n\t\tMe first. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tOkay. \n\n\tAndy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing\n\tit into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. \n\n\t\t\t\tROOSTER \n\t\tFuck! Shit! He broke my nose! \n\n\tAndy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his\n\tknees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious \n\teight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it. \n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\t\tNow I'm gonna open my fly, and \n\t\tyou're gonna swallow what I give \n\t\tyou to swallow. And when you \n\t\td mine, you gonna swallow \n\t\tRooster's. You done broke his nose, \n\t\tso he ought to have somethin' to \n\t\tshow for it. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tAnything you put in my mouth, \n\t\tyou're going to lose. \n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\t\tYou don't understand. You do that, \n\t\tI'll put all eight inches of this \n\t\tsteel ii your ear. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tOkay. But you should know that \n\t\tsudden serious brain injury causes \n\t\tthe victim to bite down. Hard. \n\t\t\t(faint smile) \n\t\tIn fact, I understand the bite-reflex \n\t\tis so strong the victim's jaws have \n\t\tto be pried open with a crowbar. \n\n\tThe Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the \n\tprojector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white. \n\n\t\t\t\tBOGS \n\t\tYou little fuck. \n\n\tAndy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking \n\tand beating the living shit out of him with anything they can \n\tget their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING \n\tAND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tBogs didn't put anything in Andy's \n\t\tmouth, and neither did his friends. \n\t\tWhat they did do is beat him within \n\t\tan inch of his life... \n\n67\tINT -- INFIRMARY -- DAY (1949) 67\n\n\tAndy lies wrapped in bandages. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tAndy spent a month in traction. \n\n68\tINT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1949) 68\n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tBogs spent a week in the hole. \n\n\tBogs sits on bare concrete.

Not many \n\tcons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE \n\techoes dimly over the P.A. system: \n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.) \n\t\tReturn to your cellblocks for \n\t\tevening count. \n\n\tBogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light \n\tcord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six \n\tinches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind \n\tBogs. hemming him. \n\n\tBefore Bogs can even open his mouth to say \"what the fuck,\" \n\tHadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar \n\tplexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out. \n\n70 \tGROUND FLOOR 70\n\n\tErnie comes slowly around the corner, rolling a steel mop \n\tcart loaded with supplies. \n\n71 \t2ND TIER 71\n\n\tRed is darning a sock in his open cell. He pauses, frowning, \n\thearing strange THUMPING sounds. What the hell is that? \n\n72 \t3RD TIER 72\n\n\tIt's Hadley and Mert methodically and brutally pulping Bogs \n\twith their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good \n\tmeasure. He feebly tries to ward them off. \n\n73 \t2ND TIER 73\n\n\tPuzzled, Red steps from his cell, following the sound. It \n\tdawns on him that it's coming from above. He moves to the \n\trailing and leans out, craning around to look up -- \n\n74 \tRED'S POV 74\n\n\t-- just as Bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing\n\n\tdirectly toward us, eyes bugging out, SCREAMING as he falls. \n\n75 \tRED (SLOW MOTION) 75\n\n\tjumps back as Bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms \n\tswimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that \n\ttoo), SCREAMING aaaaalll the way down -- \n\n76 \tGROUND FLOOR 76\n\n\t-- and impacting on Ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous \n\teruption of solvents and cleansers. The cart is squashed flat, \n\tshooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock \n\tfloor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. \n\tErnie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogs-related \n\twreckage at his feet. \n\n77 \t2ND TIER 77\n\n\tRed is stunned. He very tentatively leans out and looks up. \n\tAbove him, Hadley and Mert lean on the 3rd tier railing. \n\tHadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head. \n\n\t\t\t\tMERT \n\t\tDamn, Byron. Look'a that. \n\n\t\t\t\tHADLEY \n\t\tPoor fella must'a tripped. \n\n\tA tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley's shoe and \n\n\tsplashes across Red's upturned cheek. He wipes it off, then \n\tlooks down at Bogs. Cons and guards are racing to the scene. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tTwo things never happened again \n\t\tafter that.

Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large \n\trolled poster. He lets it uncurl to the floor. A small scrap \n\tof paper flutters out, landing at his feet. The poster is the\n\tfamous Rita Hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes\n\thalf closed, sulky lips parted. Andy picks up the scrap of \n\tpaper. It reads: \"No charge.

They're tossin' cells. \n\n\tWord travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up\n\tand hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards \n\tpair off in all directions, making their choices at random. \n\n\t\t\t\tGUARD \n\t\tWhat kind'a contraband you hiding \n\t\tin there, boy? \n\n\tCells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, \n\tmattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets \n\ttossed out onto the cellblock floor.

The door is\n\tunlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tGood evening. \n\n\tNorton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the\n\tcell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy,\n\tlooking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the\n\tBible out of Andy's hand. \n\n\t\t\t\tNORTON \n\t\tI'm pleased to see you reading \n\t\tthis. Any favorite passages? \n\n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tWatch ye therefore, for ye know not\n\t\twhen the master of the house cometh. \n\n\t\t\t\tNORTON \n\t\t\t(smiles) \n\t\tLuke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've \n\t\talways liked that one. \n\t\t\t(strolls the cell) \n\t\tBut I prefer: \"I am the light of \n\t\tthe world.

Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a\n\tpolishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tIt's called a rock blanket. It's \n\t\tfor shaping and polishing rocks. \n\t\tLittle hobby of mine. \n\n\tHadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to\n\tNorton. \n\n\t\t\t\tHADLEY \n\t\tLooks pretty clean. Some contraband \n\t\there, nothing to get in a twist over. \n\n\tNorton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita. \n\n\t\t\t\tNORTON \n\t\tI can't say I approve of this... \n\t\t\t(turns to Andy) \n\t\t...but I suppose exceptions can \n\t\talways be made. \n\n\tNorton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and\n\tlocked. Norton pauses, turns back. \n\n\t\t\t\tNORTON \n\t\tI almost forgot. \n\n\tHe reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy. \n\n\t\t\t\tNORTON \n\t\tI'd hate to deprive you of this. \n\t\tSalvation lies within. \n\n\tNorton and his men walk away. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tTossin' cells was just an excuse. \n\t\tTruth is, Norton wanted to size \n\t\tAndy up. \n\n87\tINT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 87\n\n\tAndy is working the line.

He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, \n\tlike a man waiting for a bus. \n\n\t\t\t\tBROOKS (V.O.) \n\t\tThe parole board got me into this \n\t\thalfway house called the Brewster, \n\t\tand a job bagging groceries at the \n\t\tFoodway... \n\n114\tINT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY (1954) 114\n\n\tLoud.

Only one thing left to do. He \n\tsteps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s \n\tpocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. \n\n\tHe steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing\n\tthe beam, he carves a message into the wood: \"Brooks Hatlen\n\twas here.\" He smiles with a sort of inner peace. \n\n\t\t\t\tBROOKS (V.O.) \n\t\tI doubt they'll kick up any fuss. \n\t\tNot for an old crook like me. \n\n120 \tTIGHT ON CHAIR 120\n\n\tHis weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out \n\tfrom under him.

Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is\n\tdispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy.\n\tAndy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the \n\tconfusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a \n\tnearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The \n\tguards haven't noticed. \n\n\tJigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, \n\tquickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and \n\tpulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and \n\tvarnished. He shows it around to nods of approval. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tThat's real pretty, Red.

Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's \n\tletter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of \n\tsilence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tLord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was \n\t\tjust a crow. Neither was much to \n\t\tlook at. Both got institutionalized. \n\t\tSee what you can do for 'em. Amen. \n\n\tMuttered \"amens\" all around.

Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in \n\thand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a \n\tstarving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where \n\tto turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling \n\tout books, touching them, smelling them. \n\n\tHe rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph\n\tplayer, industrial gray and green, the words \"Portland Public\n\tSchool District\" stenciled on the side. The box also contains\n\tstacks and stacks of used record albums. \n\n\tAndy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping \n\tthrough them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. \n\tHe comes across a certain album -- Mozart's \"Le Nozze de \n\tFigaro.\" He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man \n\ttransfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail. \n\n130\tINT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 130\n\n\tWiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees. \n\n131\tINT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 131\n\n\tAndy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, \n\tsweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the \n\tmachine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. \n\n\tHe slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the \n\tplatter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The \n\tneedle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting \n\tand gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its \n\tbeauty. It is \"Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto,\" a duet sung by \n\n\tSusanna and the Contessa. \n\n132\tINT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 132\n\n\tWiley pauses reading, puzzled.

A TROOPEE\n\tfishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tAll they found of him was a muddy \n\t\tset of prison clothes, a bar of \n\t\tsoap, and an old rock-hammer damn \n\t\tnear worn down to the nub. \n\n\tTROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN \n\tto a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces: \n\n230 \tA BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230\n\n\tof the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the\n\tworn rock-hammer. PUSH IN on the hammer. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI remember thinking it would take a \n\t\tman six hundred years to tunnel \n\t\tthrough the wall with it. Andy did \n\t\tit in less than twenty. \n\n231\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 231\n\n\tOnce again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his\n\n\tname into the cement. Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement \n\tpops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it. \n\n232\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 232\n\n\tAndy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his \n\thands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tAndy loved geology. I imagine it \n\t\tappealed to his meticulous nature. \n\t\tAn ice age here, a million years of \n\t\tmountain-building there, plates of \n\t\tbedrock grinding against each other \n\t\tover a span of millennia... \n\n233\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233\n\n\tAndy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen \n\tchunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tGeology is the study of pressure \n\t\tand time. That's all it takes, \n\t\treally. Pressure and time. \n\n234\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1951) 234\n\n\tRita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThat and a big damn poster. \n\n\tTRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tLike I said. In prison, a man'll do \n\t\tmost anything to keep his mind \n\t\toccupied. \n\n\tHe hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and \n\tdives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his \n\tflashlight into the cell. \n\n235\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1953) 235\n\n\tAndy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. \n\tTILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tIt turns out Andy's favorite hobby \n\t\twas totin' his wall out into the \n\t\texercise yard a handful at a time... \n\n236\tINT -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1962) 236\n\n\tA GUARD strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the \n\tcells. He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the \n\tsleeping form huddled under the blankets. \n\n\tp37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INS1DE ANDY'S CELL) 237\n\n\tWe see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under \n\tthe blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow. The flashlight plays \n\tacross the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light. \n\n238 \tANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 238\n\n\tThe light illuminates her face through the paper. WIDEN to \n\treveal Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath. The \n\tlight clicks off. The FOOTSTEPS move on. He gets back to work. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tWhile the rest of us slept, Andy \n\t\tspent years workin' the nightshift... \n\n239\tINT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1965) 239\n\n\tBOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, r\n\tpiece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets\n\tdown the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through. The pick \n\twithdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye. \n\n240 \tA SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240\n\n\ttakes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a \n\ttea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tProbably took him most of a year \n\t\tjust to get his head through. \n\n\tAndy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's \n\tgot a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the \n\tshaft. At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic \n\tpipe runs the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of \n\tgrime and dust, the word \"SEWER\" is stenciled. \n\n241\tEXT -- LOADING DOCK ACCESS -- NIGHT (1966) 241\n\n\tANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies \n\tfacedown at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out oa \n\tthe pavement. Norton turns, strolls out of frame. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI guess after Tommy was killed, \n\t\tAndy decided he'd been here just \n\t\tabout long enough. \n\n\tAgain we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in. \n\n\t\t\t\tNORTON \n\t\tLickety-split. I wanna get home. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tJust about done, sir. \n\n\tNorton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back \n\tturned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: \n\n\tHe pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a \n\tstack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real \n\tledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his \n\tsweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, \n\tand shoves everything in. \n\n243\tINT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT (1966) 243\n\n\tNorton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on \n\tthe open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling \n\tNorton's dress shoes from their box. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tAndy did like he was told. Buffed \n\t\tthose shoes to a high mirror shine. \n\n244\tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 244\n\n\tAndy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking \n\tthe gray pinstripe. Nice. \n\n245\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 245\n\n\tThe guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThe guard simply didn't notice. \n\t\tNeither did I. I mean, seriously, \n\t\thow often do you really look at a \n\t\tman's shoes? \n\n\tTILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes. \n\n246\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 246\n\n\tThe lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up \n\tat Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. \n\tHe stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's \n\tgray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the \n\tcell, throwing wild shadows. \n\n247\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 247\n\n\tThe storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded \n\tsuit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the\n\tshoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en\n\tfiles. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel. \n\n248\tINT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT (1966) 248\n\n\tAndy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel. \n\n249\tINT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1966) 249\n\n\tAndy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist,\n\tHe reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel \n\tconduit with his fingers. \n\n\tSuddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and \n\talmost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly \n\tupside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his \n\thands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat \n\tscurries off, pissed. \n\n\tAndy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and\n\tdangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the\n\tplastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,\n\n\tHe kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3\n\this back against one wall and feet against the other, he \n\tstarts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for \n\thandholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying\n\tin the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. \n\n\tHe approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. \n\tPulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. \n\tRaises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his \n\tmight. Once, twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption \n\tof sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the \n\tMount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He \n\tturns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming. \n\n250\tINT -- SEWER PIPE -- NIGHT (1966) 250\n\n\tAndy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5,\n\tThe inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. \n\tCoated with crud. It seems to go on for miles. \n\n\tNo turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts \n\tcrawling, plastic bag dragging behind. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tAndy crawled to freedom through \n\t\tfive hundred yards of shit-smelling \n\t\tfoulness I can't even imagine. Or \n\t\tmaybe I just don't want to. \n\n251\tEXT -- FIELD -- NIGHT (1966) 251\n\n\tRain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile \n\tdistant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the \n\tmouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tFive hundred yards. The length of \n\t\tfive football fields. Just shy of \n\t\thalf a mile. \n\n\tFingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh \n\tcovering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the \n\tdarkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, \n\tpushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. He \n\tcomes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist-deep. \n\n\tHe wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets \n\this shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings \n\tthe shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, \n\tfeeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A \n\tFLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon. \n\n252\tINT -- ANDY'S TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 252\n\n\tOnce again, we see stunned faces as CAMERA PULLS BACK. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThe next morning, right about the \n\t\ttime Racquel was spilling her \n\t\tlittle secret... \n\n253\tINT -- CASCO BANK OF PORTLAND -- MORNING (1966) 253\n\n\tThe door opens. Spit-shined shoes enter. DOLLY the shoes to \n\tthe counter. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\t...a man nobody ever laid eyes on \n\t\tbefore strolled into the Casco Bank \n\t\tof Portland. Until that moment, he \n\t\tdidn't exist -- except on paper. \n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE TELLER (O.S.) \n\t\tMay I help you? \n\n\tTILT UP to Andy. Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit.\n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tMy name is Peter Stevens. I've come \n\t\tto close out some accounts. \n\n254\tINT -- BANK -- SHORTLY LATER (1966) 254\n\n\tThe teller is cutting a cashier's check while the MANAGER \n\n\tcarefully examines Mr. Stevens' various I.D.s. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tHe had all the proper I.D. Driver's \n\t\tlicense, birth certificate, social \n\t\tsecurity card. The signature was a \n\t\tspot-on match. \n\n\t\t\t\tMANAGER \n\n\tI must say I'm sorry to be losing \n\tyour business. I hope you'll enjoy \n\tliving abroad. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tThank you. I'm sure I will. \n\n\t\t\t\tTELLER \n\t\tHere's your cashier's check, sir. \n\t\tWill there be anything else? \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tPlease. Would you add this to your \n\t\toutgoing mail? \n\n\tHe hands her a package, stamped and addressed. Gives them a \n\tpleasant smile. Turns and strolls from the bank. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tMr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen \n\t\tbanks in the Portland area that \n\t\tmorning. All told, he blew town \n\t\twith better than 370 thousand \n\t\tdollars of Warden Norton's money. \n\t\tSeverance pay for nineteen years. \n\n255\tINT -- OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 255\n\n\tA MAN in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. \n\tHe finds Andy's package, rips it open. Pulls out the black \n\tledger and files. Scans a cover letter. Holy shit. He dashes \n\tto his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the \n\tglass: \"PORTLAND DAILY BUGLE -- Editor In Chief.\" \n\n\t\t\t\tMAN \n\t\tHal! Dave! Get your butts in here! \n\n256\tINT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY (1966) 256\n\n\tNorton walks slowly toward his office. Dazed. The morning \n\tpaper in his hand. He goes wordlessly past the DUTY GUARD into \n\this office. Shuts the door. Lays the paper on his desk. \n\n\tThe headline reads: \"CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK.\" \n\tBelow that, the sub-headline: \"D.A. Has Ledger.

The title page is inscribed by hand: \"Dear \n\tWarden. You were right. Salvation lay within.\" Norton flips to\n\tthe center of the book -- and finds the pages hollowed out in\n\tthe shape of a rock-hammer. \n\n259\tEXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 259\n\n\tPolice cruisers everywhere. A media circus. REPORTERS jostle\n\tfor position.

If you give up that \n\t\tright, anything you say will be \n\t\tused against you in court... \n\n\tTROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The\n\tD.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face\n\tscrunches up. He begins to cry. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI wasn't there to see it, but I hear \n\t\tByron Hadley was sobbing like a \n\t\tlittle girl when they took him away. \n\n\tHadley sobs all the way to the car.

He goes to his desk, opens a drawer.

For every\n\tkey, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the\n\tfinal bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door \n\tbursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in\n\tall directions as Norton raises the gun -- \n\n\t-- and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall\n\tgoes red. His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to\n\ta final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI like to think the last thing that \n\t\twent through his head...other than \n\t\tthat bullet...was to wonder how the \n\t\thell Andy Dufresne ever got the \n\t\tbest of him. \n\n\tPUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler\n\ttrickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson\n\tfor today: \"HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON.\" \n\n265\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 265\n\n\tMail call.

As Red watches, a brilliant \n\tround glow builds behind the poster, shining from the \n\ttunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink \n\tof an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the \n\tcell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare. \n\n\tA whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The \n\thole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, \n\tbook, toiletries, bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets \n\tsucked down the hole toward the light.

Am I sorry for what I did? \n\n\t- ----- \n\n\t\t\t\tMAN g2 \n\t\tWell...are you? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tNot a day goes by I don't feel \n\t\tregret, and not because I'm in here \n\t\tor because you think I should. I \n\t\tlook back on myself the way I \n\t\twas...stupid kid who did that \n\t\tterrible crime...wish I could talk \n\t\tsense to him. Tell him how things \n\t\tare. But I can't. That kid's long \n\t\tgone, this old man is all that's \n\t\tleft, and I have to live with that. \n\t\t\t(beat) \n\t\tRehabilitated? That's a bullshit \n\t\tword, so you just go on ahead and \n\t\tstamp that form there, sonny, and \n\t\tstop wasting my damn time. Truth \n\t\tis, I don't give a shit. \n\n\tThe parole board just stares. Red sits drumming his fingers. \n\n\tCLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM \n\n\tA big rubber stamp SLAMS down -- and lifts away to reveal the \n\tword \"APPROVED\" in red ink. \n\n275\tEXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY 275 \n\n\tTWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the main gate. It \n\tswings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, \n\tcarrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. He walks out, still \n\tlooking stunned. \n\n276\tINT -- BUS -- DAY 276 \n\n\tRed rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by \n\tterror of speed and motion. \n\n277\tEXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- LATE AFTERNOON 277 \n\n\tRed arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less \n\tto look at than it used to be. \n\n27B\tINT -- BREWSTER -- LATE DAY 278 \n\n\tA BLACK WOMAN leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor. \n\n279\tINT -- RED'S ROOM -- LATE DAY 279 \n\n\tSmall, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress\n\tStreet. Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, \n\tstaring up at the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the\n\twords: \"Brooks Hatlen was here.\" \n\n280\tINT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY 280\n\n\tLoud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging \n\tgroceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red \n\tcalls to the STORE MANAGER: \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tSir? Restroom break sir? \n\n\t\t\t\tMANAGER \n\t\t\t(motions him over) \n\t\tYou don't need to ask me every \n\t\ttime you go take a piss. Just go. \n\t\tUnderstand? \n\n28l\tINT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 281\n\n\tRed steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThirty years I've been asking \n\t\tpermission to piss. I can't squeeze \n\t\ta drop without say-so. \n\n\tA strange east Indian guitar-whine begins. The Beatles. George \n\tHarrison's \"Within You Without You...\" \n\n282\tEXT -- STREET -- DAY 282\n\n\t...which carries through as Red walks. People and traffic. He \n\tkeeps looking at the women. An alien species. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tWomen, too, that's the other thing. \n\t\tI forgot they were half the human \n\t\trace. There's women everywhere, \n\t\tevery shape and size. I find myself \n\t\tsemi-hard most of the time, cursing \n\t\tmyself for a dirty old man. \n\n\tTWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tNot a brassiere to be seen, nipples \n\t\tpoking out at the world. Jeezus, \n\t\tpleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman \n\t\tout in public like that would have \n\t\tbeen arrested and given a sanity \n\t\thearing. \n\n283\tEXT -- PARK -- DUSK 283\n\n\tRed finds the park filled with HIPPIES. Hanging out. \n\tHappening. Here's the source of the music: a radio. A HIPPIE \n\tGIRL gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThey're calling this the Summer of \n\t\tLove. Summer of Loonies, you ask me. \n\n284\tINT -- PAROLE OFFICE -- DAY 284\n\n\tRed sits across from his PAROLE OFFICER. The P.O. is filling\n\tout his report. \n\n\t\t\t\tP.O. \n\t\tYou staying out of the bars, Red? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tYes sir. That I am. \n\n\t\t\t\tP.O. \n\t\tHow you doing otherwise? Adjusting \n\t\tokay? \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tThings got different out here. \n\n\t\t\t\tP.O. \n\t\tTell me about it. Young punks \n\t\tprotesting the war. You imagine? \n\t\tEven my own kid. Oughtta bust his \n\t\tfuckin' skull. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tGuess the world moved on. \n\n285\tINT -- FOODWAY -- DAY 285\n\n\tBagging groceries. CHILDREN underfoot. One points a toy gun at\n\tRed, pumping the trigger. Red focuses on the gun, listening to\n\tit CLICKETY-CLACK. Sparky wheel grinding. \n\n\tThe kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next \n\tcustomer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE.\n\tFeeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, \n\twhipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It\n\tgets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him\n\tfrom all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of\n\tchildren deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS. \n\n\tHe's in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake\n\thimself out of it. Can't. Fumbles the final items into the\n\tbag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run. \n\n\tHe makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps\n\tinto a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks \n\tinto a trot. Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door\n\tinto the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming\n\tthrough a door marked \"Employees Only\" into -- \n\n286\tINT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 286\n\n\t-- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, \n\tshutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. \n\n\tHe goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. \n\tHe can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He \n\tglances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. \n\n\tHe enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down \n\tand sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and \n\ttouch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. \n\tHe draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. \n\n\tHe'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down. \n\n287\tEXT -- STREET -- DUSK 287\n\n\tRed is walking home. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tThere is a harsh truth to face. \n\t\tNo way I'm gonna make it on the \n\t\toutside. \n\n\tHe pauses at a pawnshop window. An array of handguns. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tAll I do anymore is think of ways \n\t\tto break my parole. \n\n\tThe SHOPKEEPER appears at the glass, locking the door and \n\tflipping the sign: CLOSED. \n\n288\tINT -- RED'S ROOM -- NIGHT 288\n\n\tRed lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tTerrible thing, to live in fear. \n\t\tBrooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all \n\t\ttoo well. All I want is to be back \n\t\twhere things make sense. Where I \n\t\twon't have to be afraid all the time. \n\n\tHe glances up at the ceiling beam. \"Brooks Hatlen was here.\" \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tOnly one thing stops me. A promise \n\t\tI made to Andy. \n\n289\tEXT -- COUNTRY ROAD -- MORNING 289\n\n\tA pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to \n\ta stop. Red hops off the back, waves his thanks. The truck \n\n\tdrives on. Red starts walking. PAN TO a roadside sign: BUXTON. \n\n290\tEXT -- MAINE COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 290\n\n\tHigh white clouds in a blazing blue sky. The trees fiery with \n\tautumn color. Red walks the fields and back-roads, cheap \n\tcompass in hand. Looking for a certain hayfield. \n\n291\tEXT -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 291\n\n\tWalking. Searching. The day turning late. Red finds himself \n\tstaring at a distant field. There's a long rock wall, like \n\tsomething out o f a Robert Frost poem. Big oak tree. Red checks \n\this compass. North end. He crosses a dirt road into the field. \n\n292\tEXT -- HAYFIELD -- DAY 292\n\n\tRed walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel \n\tscolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies\n\tthe base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of\n\trocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool's errand. Turns to go. \n\n\tSomething catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering \n\tcloser. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes \n\toff. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock \n\tout, anticipation growing. It won't come; it's too smooth. He \n\tpulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his \n\tfeet, leaving a ragged hole. \n\n\tRed leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the \n\tobject buried under the rock. Stunned. It's an envelope wrapped \n\tin plastic. Written on it is a single word: \"Red.\" \n\n\tRed pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for \n\ta while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside \n\tis a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read: \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY (V.O.) \n\t\tDear Red. If you're reading this, \n\t\tyou've gotten out. And if you've \n\t\tcome this far, maybe you're willing \n\t\tto come a little further. You \n\t\tremember the name of the town, \n\t\tdon't you? I could use a good man \n\t\tto help me get my project on \n\t\twheels. I'll keep an eye out for \n\t\tyou and the chessboard ready. \n\t\t\t(beat) \n\t\tRemember, Red. Hope is a good \n\t\tthing, maybe the best of things, \n\t\tand no good thing ever dies. I will \n\t\tbe hoping that this letter finds \n\t\tyou, and finds you well. Your \n\t\tfriend. Andy. \n\n\tBy now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks. He \n\topens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- \n\tdollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars. \n\n293\tINT -- RED'S ROOM -- DAY (1967) 293\n\n\tRed is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts \n\this hat on. His bag is by the door. He takes one last look \n\taround. Only one thing left to do. He pulls a wooden chair to \n\tthe center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tGet busy living or get busy dying. \n\t\tThat is goddamn right. \n\n\tHe steps up on the chair. It wobbles under his weight. \n\n294\tINT -- BREWSTER -- RED'S DOOR -- DAY (1967) 294\n\n\tThe door opens. Red exits with his bag and heads down the \n\tstairs, leaving the door open. CAMERA PUSHES through, BOOMING \n\tUP to the ceiling beam which reads: \"Brooks Hatlen was here.\" \n\n\tA new message has been carved alongside the old: \"So was Red.\" \n\n295\tINT -- GREYHOUND BUS STATION -- DAY (1967) 295\n\n\tTRACKING SHOT reveals a long line of people at the counter. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tFor the second time in my life, I \n\t\tam guilty of committing a crime. \n\n\tCAMERA brings us to Red, next in line, bag by his feet. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tParole violation. I doubt they'll \n\t\ttoss up any roadblocks for that. \n\t\tNot for an old crook like me. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\t\t(steps up) \n\t\tMcNary, Texas? \n\n296\tEXT -- TRAVELING SHOT -- DAY (1967) 296\n\n\tA gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by, fields and trees \n\ta blur of motion. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal a Greyhound Sceni- \n\tCruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. CAMERA \n\tTRAVELS from window to window, passing faces. We finally come \n\tto Red gazing out at the passing landscape. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI find I am so excited I can barely \n\t\tsit still or hold a thought in my \n\t\thead. I think it is the excitement \n\t\tonly a free man can feel, a free \n\t\tman at the start of a long journey \n\t\twhose conclusion is uncertain... \n\t\t297 THE BUS 297\n\n\tROARS past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED (V.O.) \n\t\tI hope I can make it across the \n\t\tborder. I hope to see my friend \n\t\tand shake his hand. I hope the \n\t\tPacific is as blue as it has been \n\t\tin my dreams. \n\t\t\t(beat) \n\t\tI hope. \n\n298\tEXT -- BEACH -- WIDE PANORAMIC SHOT -- DAY (1967) 298\n\n\tA distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck \n\tthat's been left to rot in the sun. There's someone out there. \n\n299 \tCLOSER ON BOAT 299\n\n\tA MAN is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by \n\thand, face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask. \n\n\tRed appears b.g., a distant figure walking out across the \n\tsand, wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag. \n\n\tThe man on the boat pauses. Turns slowly around. Red arrives \n\twith a smile as wide as the horizon. The other man raises his \n\tgoggles and pulls down his mask. Andy, of course. \n\n\t\t\t\tANDY \n\t\tYou look like a man who knows how \n\t\tto get things. \n\n\t\t\t\tRED \n\t\tI'm known to locate certain things \n\t\tfrom time to time. \n\n\tRed shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander.
