THE OCEAN - DUSK\r\n</b>\r\n   From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,\r\n   abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided\r\n   valleys of water.\r\n\r\n   Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the\r\n   ocean and an adjacent coastline.\r\n\r\n   In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a\r\n   small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering\r\n   darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.\r\n\r\n<b>   2. THE SHIP - DUSK\r\n</b>\r\n   [   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a\r\n   man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her\r\n   great guns projecting from every gun-port.\r\n\r\n   As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is\r\n   visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.\r\n\r\n<b>   3.

THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK\r\n</b>\r\n   CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the\r\n   table, studying charts.\r\n\r\n   His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of\r\n   indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.\r\n\r\n   JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops\r\n   below the great casement windows.\r\n\r\n   KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and\r\n   retires.\r\n<b>                    JACK\r\n</b>          (Absently) Thankee Killick\r\n\r\n<b>   4.

MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nIn the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from\r\nan early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles.\r\n\r\nPETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about\r\nwhether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth\r\nmates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to\r\nresume.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BLAKENEY\r\n</b>          In\r\n<b>                      CALAMY\r\n</b>          Out.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BLAKENEY\r\n</b>          In.

It was in I say.\r\n\r\nThe lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much\r\nolder than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a\r\nsensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing\r\nup briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes.\r\n\r\n<b>9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nBy the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few\r\nof the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog.\r\n\r\nFaster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down\r\ngreedily\r\n\r\nOne man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD\r\nDAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first\r\nlink of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist.\r\n\r\nJOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in\r\nthe middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling\r\ntheir foreheads in deference to the officer.\r\n\r\n<b>10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nBoys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of\r\n'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the\r\npowder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns\r\nduring action.\r\n\r\n<b>11.

Only PULLINGS' lamp\r\nremains, moving up the ladder to...\r\n\r\n<b>12.   WEATHER DECK - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nThe uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel\r\ngangways linking the forecastle (forward) to the quarterdeck\r\n(aft).\r\n\r\nThe lead is dropped from the bows. As PULLINGS walks aft to\r\nthe quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea\r\nline.\r\n\r\n<b>                     CREWMEN\r\n</b>           Watch there!

QUARTERDECK - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nPullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant\r\nMOWETT, a short tubular man in his early 20s.\r\n\r\nJACK climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first\r\ntime: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair\r\nclubbed at the back\r\n\r\nAt the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. The helmsman,\r\nBONDEN - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives JACK\r\ntheir current course.\r\n\r\nJACK nods, then moves to the gunwale with PULLINGS. Jack\r\nsniffs the air and speaks in a low voice.\r\n\r\n<b>                     JACK\r\n</b>           How I do hate a lee shore\r\n\r\n<b>                     PULLINGS\r\n</b>           You think we'll have long to wait?\r\n<b>                    JACK\r\n</b>              (shrugs)\r\n          Intelligence reports had her leaving\r\n          Boston on the 12th, that should put us at\r\n          least a week ahead.\r\n\r\n<b>                    PULLINGS\r\n</b>          She'll be in for a surprise, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe pun on the name of their ship was unintentional, but JACK\r\nlets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense,\r\nexpectant silence.\r\n\r\n<b>                    JACK\r\n</b>          In for a \"Surprise\". Now that's wit. \"In\r\n          for a Surprise\". 'Pon my word I shall\r\n          have to tell the Doctor.\r\n\r\nHe leaves, still laughing. Those on the quarterdeck are more\r\namused by JACK's unique sense of humour than by the feeble\r\njoke itself.\r\n\r\n<b>                    JACK (CONT'D)\r\n</b>              (calls back)\r\n          Don't put her on the reef, Tom.\r\n\r\n<b>                    PULLINGS\r\n</b>          I'll try not to, Sir.\r\n\r\n<b>13A    INT.

WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nTime passes. The fog intensifies.

Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around\r\ndangerously.

QUARTERDECK\r\n</b>\r\nSmoke clears to reveal holes in the enemy's foretopsail, a\r\nbowline hanging loose, but again many of her balls have\r\nfailed to penetrate the enemy timbers.\r\n<b>                     BONDEN\r\n</b>           By all that's holy what is that ship made\r\n           of?\r\n\r\nHis question coincides with a third full broadside from the\r\nFrenchman. The Surprise's wheel shattered. BONDEN thrown\r\naside, MR.

The quarterdeck is JACK's domain now, and\r\nSTEPHEN avoids it.\r\n\r\nThen, behind JACK, the great bird suddenly appears.\r\n\r\nIt's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing-span, and\r\nflying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the\r\ngusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning\r\nforward to get a better view.\r\n\r\nAt the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway,\r\nHOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The\r\nbird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN.\r\n\r\nAgain a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently\r\nuninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN sags to the deck.

INT. STEPHEN'S CABIN - DUSK\r\n</b>\r\nLying on his bed, in some pain, STEPHEN hears thudding feet,\r\nshouted orders.\r\n\r\nIn his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge. His\r\npitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus.\r\n\r\nThere's a knock on the door and JEMMY DUCKS appears with a\r\nmug of soup and some biscuit.\r\n<b>                    JEMMY DUCKS\r\n</b>          ...sail on the horizon, sir.

BONDEN nods, lifting his hands from\r\nthe wheel as JACK grips the curved timber decisively, taking\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\nHe feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers, looks up\r\nto the sails then back to the Acheron.

ON THE ACHERON\r\n</b>\r\nAs the Surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face\r\nwithering fire from the enemy. A dozen men go down, some of\r\nthem fatally wounded. Among them are DOUDLE, BOYLE, ALLEN and\r\nHORNER in quick succession.\r\n\r\nThe attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back\r\nat them.\r\n\r\nJACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine,\r\nTROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot.\r\n\r\nLAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to\r\ndevastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS\r\nprotecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the\r\nhip.\r\n\r\nJACK keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling,\r\nswirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other\r\nwith barely room to fall.\r\n\r\nThe Acherons are gradually forced back across their\r\nquarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship.\r\n\r\n<b>285.   WAIST OF THE ACHERON\r\n</b>\r\nJACK crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy\r\npikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through\r\nthe sleeve. BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK\r\nand killing the pikeman.\r\n\r\nTo either side, privateers are trying to reach them,\r\nshouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish.\r\n\r\nBullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and\r\nfoe alike.\r\n\r\nKILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and\r\nfrom his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.\r\n\r\nAWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat-\r\ncleaver right and left.\r\n\r\n<b>286.

A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's\r\nsurprising skill.\r\n\r\nCALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees\r\nstabbing at the legs of the attackers.\r\n\r\n<b>290.

The two boys fight as a\r\nteam as they move toward the stern.\r\n\r\n<b>292.   SIDE OF THE ACHERON\r\n</b>\r\nSome Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack.\r\nOthers are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall.\r\n\r\n<b>293.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON\r\n</b>\r\nJEMMY DUCKS turns the swivel on a group of Acherons, the\r\ngrapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale.\r\n\r\n<b>294.   IN THE WATER\r\n</b>\r\nOil burns. Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat,\r\nclinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull.\r\n\r\n<b>295.

He smashes the\r\nchain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners.\r\n\r\nEverywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's\r\nstern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers.\r\n\r\nHe makes his way through to the Great Cabin.\r\n\r\n<b>297.

BOW OF THE SURPRISE - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nWide on STEPHEN and BLAKENEY as they sit watching two\r\ndolphins surfing the bow-wave, STEPHEN pointing out various\r\nfeatures of these magnificent creatures, doing his best to\r\ntake the boy's mind off the loss of his friend.\r\n\r\n<b>307.   THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nThe two ships sail abreast - the Acheron, her shattered masts\r\njury-rigged.\r\n\r\n<b>308.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nJACK stands with LIEUTENANT MOWETT and the signals\r\nmidshipman, WILLIAMSON. They look across at the Acheron.\r\n\r\n<b>                    JACK\r\n</b>          Signal...

God-\r\n          speed, Captain Pullings.'\r\n\r\nA contented smile on Pullings face as his promotion is\r\nconfirmed. He waves across to JACK as the Acheron makes a\r\nsharp turn away from the Surprise.\r\n\r\n<b>310.   DELETED\r\n</b>\r\n<b>311.   ABOUT THE SHIP - DUSK\r\n</b>\r\nSlowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and\r\nroutines reassert themselves.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Acting First Lieutenant MOWETT walks the quarterdeck\r\ncomposing a poem in memory of the battle.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 JOE PLAICE tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to\r\na small attentive audience.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 While AWKWARD DAVIES works further on the tattoo about\r\nBECKETT's waist. The chain begun off BRAZIL now winds its way\r\naround most of his torso.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 BLAKENEY and JEMMY DUCKS are feeding the assorted creatures\r\ncollected at the Galapagos, as...\r\n\r\n\u00b7 BONDEN reads his first book, 'Diseases of Seamen' by\r\nStephen Maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently.\r\n\r\n\u00b7 While the powder-monkeys skylark in the rigging\r\n\r\n<b>313.

A great\r\n          seaman, whatever you may say of him. The\r\n          doctor said he was killed by our first\r\n          broadside. I'd have liked to talk to him,\r\n          face to face.\r\n\r\n<b>                    STEPHEN\r\n</b>          Maybe you did.\r\n\r\n<b>                      JACK\r\n</b>          What?\r\n\r\n<b>                    STEPHEN\r\n</b>          While I was tending the prisoners they\r\n          told me their doctor died of fever, two\r\n          weeks ago. There was no doctor on that\r\n          ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you\r\n          will find one there now.\r\n\r\nJACK goes very still. A silence broken only by the sound of\r\nwater flowing gently past the hull.\r\n\r\nHe looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the\r\nthought of a possible final deception flooding through him.\r\n\r\n<b>                      STEPHEN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Shall we?\r\nHe starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello\r\ncarrying through to ....\r\n\r\n<b>312.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nKILLICK, wearing an ostentatious bandage about his head, is\r\npreparing toasted cheese with BLACK BILL.\r\n\r\n<b>                     KILLICK\r\n</b>           That's the last of the cheese and like as\r\n           not they'll leave it seizing to their\r\n           plates with their tweedly tweedly\r\n           tweedly.\r\n\r\n<b>                     JACK (O.S.)\r\n</b>           Killick? KILLICK THERE!\r\n\r\n                     KILLICK (projecting)\r\n           Which it will be ready when it's ready!\r\n\r\nIn the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. Rolling,\r\nundeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through\r\nthe great ship and filling the night. Stephens mind is far\r\naway. Jack breaks off abruptly:\r\n\r\n<b>                      JACK\r\n</b>\r\n          You're still missing your cormorant...\r\n          flightless eh...well then. It will still\r\n          be there when we come back\r\n\r\nAnd he breaks into a merry jig\r\n\r\n<b>313.   SURPRISE, EXTERIOR - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nWide, to see the stern of the ship and a patch of surrounding\r\nwater lit by the great stern lantern. Through the casement\r\nwindows the two men can be seen playing.\r\n\r\nWider, to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around,\r\nwith the stern cabin, a tiny orange light, still faintly\r\nvisible in the darkness.\r\n\r\n<b>314.   FURTHER BACK\r\n</b>\r\nAnd further still. Until we see the curve of the earth, and\r\nthe planet spinning on its journey through space.\r\n<b>***\r\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Master-and-Commander.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Master and Commander</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=John Collee\" title=\"Scripts by John Collee\">John Collee</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Peter Weir\" title=\"Scripts by Peter Weir\">Peter Weir</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Master and Commander Script.html#comments\" title=\"Master and Commander comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:11:14.731162"}
