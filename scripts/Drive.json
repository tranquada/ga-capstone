It's only\r\n           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over\r\n           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.\r\n                         \r\n           DRIVER O/S\r\n           ...hundred thousand streets in this city,\r\n           you don't need to know the route.

LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2\r\n                         \r\n           A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different\r\n           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -\r\n                         \r\n           DRIVER O/S\r\n           ...One last thing.

He folds his map of LA and slips it\r\n           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly\r\n           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a\r\n           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA\r\n           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.\r\n                         \r\n          3 INT.

A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night\r\n           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his\r\n           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle\r\n                         \r\n          4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4\r\n                         \r\n           The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is\r\n           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the\r\n           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.\r\n           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives\r\n           carefully, letting other cars overtake.\r\n                         \r\n          5 EXT.

Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a\r\n           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes\r\n           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.\r\n                         \r\n          7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7\r\n                         \r\n           Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new\r\n           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,\r\n           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He\r\n           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.\r\n                         \r\n          8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8\r\n                         \r\n           Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on\r\n           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food\r\n           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage\r\n           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -\r\n           vintage cars.\r\n                         \r\n          9 INT.

Driver\r\n           follows him past rows of vintage cars.\r\n                         \r\n                          SHANNON\r\n           ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but\r\n           with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.\r\n           You get any sleep?\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           Not this week.\r\n                         \r\n           As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.\r\n                         \r\n                          SHANNON\r\n           I can offer you some Halcyon.\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           Won't work.\r\n                         \r\n           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they\r\n           arrive at a plain looking Impala.\r\n                         \r\n                          SHANNON\r\n           There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular\r\n           car in the state of California...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds\r\n           out his hand for the keys.\r\n                          3\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10\r\n                         \r\n           The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.\r\n           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows\r\n           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's\r\n           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.\r\n                         \r\n          11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11\r\n                         \r\n           A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.\r\n           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees\r\n           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,\r\n           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,\r\n           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.\r\n                         \r\n                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY\r\n           ...This is some comeback from the Clippers!\r\n           Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and\r\n           buried!...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld\r\n           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.\r\n           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball\r\n           commentary now.\r\n                         \r\n                          POLICE SCANNER\r\n           ...9 Adam 81, what is your current\r\n           location?...Repeat, what is your current\r\n           location?...\r\n                         \r\n                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY\r\n           ...Another unbelievable three pointer from\r\n           Davis and the Clippers are within five!...\r\n                         \r\n           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He\r\n           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with\r\n           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them\r\n           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and\r\n           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.\r\n           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.\r\n                         \r\n                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY\r\n           ...Time out Knicks...\r\n                         \r\n           The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the\r\n           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.\r\n                         \r\n           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's\r\n           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three\r\n           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel\r\n           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car\r\n           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          4\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         11 CONTINUED: 11\r\n                         \r\n           The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police\r\n           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.\r\n           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering\r\n           what's happened to his partner.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on\r\n           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.\r\n                         \r\n           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as\r\n           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a\r\n           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.\r\n                         \r\n          12 INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 12\r\n                         \r\n           Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle\r\n           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady\r\n           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their\r\n           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in\r\n           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as\r\n           his police scanner crackles to life.\r\n                         \r\n                          POLICE SCANNER\r\n           ...Attention all units...211...Superstore\r\n           on Traction Avenue...Suspects headed\r\n           Eastbound on 1st Street...Driving a Silver\r\n           Impala...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.\r\n           River again, heading back in the same direction he came.\r\n                         \r\n                          POLICE SCANNER\r\n           ...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle\r\n           Heights...All units standby.

Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers\r\n           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He\r\n           switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.\r\n                         \r\n          13 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ALLEYWAYS/INDUSTRIAL AREA/DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 13\r\n                         \r\n           The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and\r\n           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.\r\n           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or\r\n           probing to see if there's anyone out there.\r\n                         \r\n                          POLICE SCANNER\r\n           ...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle\r\n           Avenue...No sign of suspects...Repeat, no\r\n           sign of suspects...\r\n                         \r\n           The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car\r\n           glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.\r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          5\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         13 CONTINUED: 13\r\n                         \r\n           It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver\r\n           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays\r\n           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the\r\n           same direction as the black-and-white.\r\n                         \r\n          14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14\r\n                         \r\n           It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white\r\n           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars\r\n           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way\r\n           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being\r\n           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.\r\n                         \r\n                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY\r\n           ...And for the first time in the game the\r\n           Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69.

Up ahead, the police car\r\n           swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,\r\n           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In\r\n           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police\r\n           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching\r\n           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest.

Up ahead,\r\n           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver\r\n           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the\r\n           chopper's searchlights spot them.\r\n                         \r\n          15 INT/EXT.

As Driver watches them, the boy\r\n           turns around and notices him.

They look\r\n           like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a\r\n           basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing\r\n           gently on a cup of coffee.\r\n                         \r\n          39 INT/ EXT.

Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off\r\n           from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS\r\n           and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above\r\n           airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.\r\n                         \r\n          40 EXT.

He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit\r\n           mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out\r\n           with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly.\r\n           Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the\r\n           longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a\r\n           weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in\r\n           his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.\r\n                         \r\n          41 EXT/ INT.

The redneck slides into the seat\r\n           opposite him.\r\n                         \r\n                          BEARDED REDNECK\r\n           You're Shannon's buddy, right?

The\r\n           Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a\r\n           moment, then decides against it, standing up.\r\n                         \r\n                          BEARDED REDNECK\r\n           Well, it's good to see you again...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver carries on eating as if the man didn't exist.\r\n                         \r\n          42 EXT.

Driver\r\n           finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the\r\n           door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver\r\n           knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds\r\n           him back. Instead he just offers his help.\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           You need a ride anywhere over the weekend\r\n           I'm not doing much...\r\n                         \r\n          50a INT.

The little boy is\r\n           clutching his mouth, making a show of being in pain. Irene\r\n           teases him gently as they walk.

Driver looks at her curiously as he drives,\r\n           no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and\r\n           changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring\r\n           out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back.\r\n           Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.\r\n                         \r\n          53 EXT.

Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching\r\n           the cartoon. From their relaxed body language it's clear some\r\n           time has passed and they know each other a little better.\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           What's happening now?\r\n                         \r\n                          BENICIO\r\n           He's telling him if he doesn't leave the\r\n           earth alone he'll fight him.\r\n                         \r\n           Irene calls out from her bedroom.\r\n                         \r\n           IRENE O/S\r\n           I'm almost ready...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver looks back at the screen.

You watching?\r\n                         \r\n           Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and\r\n           the interference stops.\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           Think you can remember that?...\r\n                         \r\n           Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears\r\n           the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her\r\n           waitress's uniform, and answers it.\r\n                         \r\n                          IRENE\r\n           Hello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens\r\n           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.\r\n           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads\r\n           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN\r\n           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.\r\n                         \r\n           YOUNG WOMAN (IRENE'S FRIEND)\r\n           Hi...\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           Hello...\r\n                         \r\n                          BENICIO\r\n           Hi Cindy...\r\n                         \r\n           Irene's friend heads past Driver and scolds Benicio\r\n           affectionately.\r\n                         \r\n                          IRENE'S FRIEND\r\n           It's 8:30.

She puts down the phone, forcing\r\n           a smile but still looking distracted.\r\n                         \r\n          55 INT/ EXT.

The voice on the\r\n           other end is accented and unfriendly.\r\n                         \r\n           MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\r\n           Can you hear me now, you cunt?\r\n                         \r\n           Standard pauses, looking concerned.\r\n                         \r\n                          STANDARD\r\n           Sure.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          30\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         58 CONTINUED: 58\r\n                         \r\n           MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\r\n           You're gonna come see me tomorrow, you\r\n           understand?...\r\n                         \r\n           Across the crowded room, Irene is looking for Standard.

She heads out into\r\n           the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the\r\n           hallway, locking the door to his own apartment.

Suddenly he notices something else in\r\n           the shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars.\r\n           A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car\r\n           now, climbing out to see what's happened.\r\n                         \r\n           The prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he\r\n           realizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he\r\n           clutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at\r\n           his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver\r\n           kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           Can you move?\r\n                         \r\n                          STANDARD\r\n           Where's Benicio?\r\n                         \r\n                          DRIVER\r\n           He's right here...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver glances at Benicio.

Driver hesitates, all his\r\n           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,\r\n           thinking of Irene.\r\n                         \r\n           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,\r\n           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          49\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         81 CONTINUED: (2) 81\r\n                         \r\n           He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the\r\n           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on\r\n           his face as he spins around.\r\n                         \r\n           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in\r\n           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The\r\n           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from\r\n           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into\r\n           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look\r\n           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots\r\n           crack behind him.\r\n                         \r\n           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly\r\n           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.\r\n                         \r\n          82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82\r\n                         \r\n           Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on\r\n           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just\r\n           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips\r\n           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.\r\n                         \r\n                          BLANCHE\r\n           ...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this\r\n           much money!...\r\n                         \r\n           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed\r\n           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,\r\n           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an\r\n           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running\r\n           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler\r\n           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.\r\n                         \r\n                          BLANCHE\r\n           Move for Chrissakes!...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the\r\n           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't\r\n           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start\r\n           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at\r\n           speed.\r\n                         \r\n           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no\r\n           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He\r\n           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between\r\n           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for\r\n           move, staying on his tail.\r\n                         \r\n           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          49A\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         82 CONTINUED: 82\r\n                         \r\n           Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a\r\n           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make\r\n           the same turn. It gets close enough to \"pit\" Driver, its nose\r\n           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. \r\n                         \r\n           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and\r\n           regains control of his car.\r\n                         \r\n           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into\r\n           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver\r\n           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the\r\n           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.\r\n                         \r\n           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,\r\n           Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang\r\n           closing fast.\r\n                         \r\n           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated\r\n           for an instant.\r\n                         \r\n           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with\r\n           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his\r\n           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,\r\n           spinning 270 degrees.\r\n                         \r\n           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the\r\n           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a\r\n           corner he can't control. \r\n                         \r\n           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a\r\n           sickening crunch of metal on metal.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver guns the motor and speeds away. \r\n                          50\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          83 EXT.

BATHROOM/ MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 87\r\n                         \r\n           Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts\r\n           through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her\r\n           head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a\r\n           big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom\r\n           window where he just shot her.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he\r\n           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The\r\n           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his\r\n           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into\r\n           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as\r\n           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls\r\n           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the\r\n           hitman and grabs his shotgun.\r\n                         \r\n          88 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 88\r\n                         \r\n           In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.\r\n           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --\r\n           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks\r\n           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag\r\n           doll.\r\n                         \r\n           The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as\r\n           it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and\r\n           his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter\r\n           all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead\r\n           man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his\r\n           pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.\r\n                         \r\n          89 INT.

Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but\r\n           Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights\r\n           on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they\r\n           reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for\r\n           him to go out first.

Driver's about to respond when\r\n           suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his\r\n           eye.\r\n                         \r\n           A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling\r\n           her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of\r\n           the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.\r\n                         \r\n           Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other\r\n           parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering\r\n           her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.\r\n                         \r\n           More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the\r\n           car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan\r\n           Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of\r\n           parked cars.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          65\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         107 CONTINUED: (2) 107\r\n                         \r\n           Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She\r\n           looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if\r\n           all her worst fears have been confirmed.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps\r\n           approaching.\r\n                         \r\n           He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and\r\n           runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.\r\n                         \r\n           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up\r\n           the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,\r\n           reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.\r\n                         \r\n           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his\r\n           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming\r\n           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.\r\n                         \r\n           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing\r\n           footsteps.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the\r\n           time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his\r\n           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a\r\n           car.\r\n                         \r\n           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs\r\n           him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.\r\n                         \r\n           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She\r\n           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the\r\n           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs\r\n           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.\r\n                         \r\n           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering\r\n           Tan Suit's skull.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the\r\n           elevator, framed against the light.\r\n                         \r\n           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The\r\n           elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.\r\n                         \r\n                         108 OMITTED 108\r\n                         \r\n          108a EXT.

They shake hands firmly, like old friends,\r\n           when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.\r\n                         \r\n           We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein\r\n           cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed,\r\n           paralysed with shock.\r\n                         \r\n           Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with\r\n           Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him\r\n           down against the boot of the stock car.\r\n                         \r\n                          BERNIE ROSE\r\n           You won't feel a thing.

Bernie\r\n           Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a\r\n           handkerchief.\r\n                          73\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          111a INT.

From next door he can hear his neighbors\r\n           arguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly\r\n           storms towards his front door.\r\n                         \r\n          111b EXT.

Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.\r\n                         \r\n          113 INT.

As he heads past the\r\n           vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock\r\n           car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently\r\n           against the trunk of the car.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for\r\n           a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and\r\n           opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of\r\n           money.\r\n                         \r\n          114 EXT.

We hold on the\r\n           curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed\r\n           WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,\r\n           also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting\r\n           ready for an event.

PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 151\r\n                         \r\n           The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in\r\n           the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the\r\n           tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards.\r\n                         \r\n          152 INT.

NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 154\r\n                         \r\n           Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He\r\n           unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.\r\n                         \r\n          155 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155\r\n                         \r\n           Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the\r\n           pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach\r\n           but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the\r\n           other passengers are dead, then heads on.\r\n                         \r\n          156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156\r\n                         \r\n           Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He\r\n           looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps\r\n           running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear\r\n           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.\r\n                         \r\n           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the\r\n           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves\r\n           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries\r\n           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          80\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         156 CONTINUED: 156\r\n                         \r\n           Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more\r\n           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any\r\n           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,\r\n           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces\r\n           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.\r\n                         \r\n           They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver\r\n           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.\r\n           Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in\r\n           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then\r\n           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino\r\n           splutters as Driver lets him up again.\r\n                         \r\n                          NINO\r\n           It was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your\r\n           friend not me...\r\n                         \r\n           Driver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there\r\n           until Nino's body finally stops thrashing.\r\n                         \r\n          157 INT.

Whatever he thinks of Nino, a\r\n           part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's\r\n           no trace of emotion in his voice.\r\n                         \r\n                          BERNIE ROSE\r\n           Looks like me, you and your girlfriend are\r\n           the only pieces left on the board...\r\n                         \r\n          158 EXT.

He starts with the left side of the\r\n           steering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn\r\n           signal.\r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          87\r\n                          9/24/10\r\n                         166 CONTINUED: 166\r\n                         \r\n           His face shows the strain, but his fingers are as steady as\r\n           ever. A master at work. Finally he breaks into the ignition\r\n           device, leaning back in the seat to take a rest.\r\n                         \r\n          167 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY. 167\r\n                         \r\n           We're gazing down at the white Camaro from above, waiting for it\r\n           to move.\r\n                         \r\n          168 INT. WHITE CAMARO/ LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY. 168\r\n                         \r\n           Driver's face is completely still now. So are his eyes. He looks\r\n           almost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans\r\n           forward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life,\r\n           we CUT TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nDrive\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Hossein Amini\u00a0\u00a0James Sallis\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:24:13.690164"}
