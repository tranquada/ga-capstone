HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT\n\n               At the reception area four JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and two WOMEN \n               quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend \n               handshakes and gifts. They bow and introduce themselves from \n               the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him \n               enthusiastically.\n\n               More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his \n               stay.\n\n               One of them presents a fax that has come for him.\n\n               INSERT -\n\n               \"TO: BOB HARRIS\n\n               FROM: LYDIA HARRIS\n\n               YOU FORGOT ADAM'S BIRTHDAY.\n\n               I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.\n\n               HAVE A GOOD TRIP, L\"\n\n               He doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his \n               pocket.\n\n               The commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him \n               up, and ask if he needs anything else.\n\n               Some JAPANESE ROCK STARS with shag haircuts and skinny leather \n               pants pass by. Each commercial person has to shake Bob's \n               hand before leaving.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

A few minutes pass as he sits in silence \n               looking around, drinking a scotch.  Chet Baker sings \"The \n               Thrill is Gone\" over the stereo.\n\n               We see Bob's POV of tables of people talking. JAPANESE WOMEN \n               SMOKING, AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN tying one on, talking about \n               software sales. A WAITER carefully setting down a coaster, \n               and pouring a beer very, very slowly. It's all very foreign.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

The \n               shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it \n               goes, and leans down to have a shower. This hotel was not \n               designed with him in mind.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. STUDIO - DAY\n\n               Whiskey commercial shoot.\n\n               The set is full of activity as the JAPANESE CREW work. Bob, \n               in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a European style bar set \n               with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. A JAPANESE GIRL quickly \n               powders his face as they adjust lights and the DIRECTOR and \n               crew speak in hurried Japanese.\n\n               The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long \n               sentences in Japanese.\n\n               TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, \n               translates but it is only a short sentence now.\n\n                                     TRANSLATOR\n                         He wants you to turn, look in camera \n                         and say the lines.\n\n               Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it \n               works from Japanese to English.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         That's all he said?\n\n                                     TRANSLATOR\n                         Yes, turn to camera.\n\n               Bob thinks let's just get it over with.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Turn left or right?\n\n               The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the \n               director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director \n               answers her in a long excited phrase.\n\n                                     TRANSLATOR\n                         Right side.

It seemed like \n                         he was saying a lot more.\n\n               The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods \n               in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.\n\n                                     TRANSLATOR\n                         Like an old friend, and into the \n                         camera.\n\n                                     DIRECTOR\n                              (to Bob))\n                         Suntory Time!\n\n               They get ready, and roll camera:\n\n               Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:\n\n                                     BOB\n                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory \n                         Time.\n\n               The Director yells something about ten sentences long.

BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Bob comes back to his room. The maids have left everything \n               perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been \n               left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups \n               in nature while sad violin music plays. It's supposed to be \n               relaxing, but it's just sad.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               Bob lies in bed. He flips through TV channels from the remote \n               control.  He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon \n               Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese. He \n               turns it off as he hears a knock at the door.\n\n               He goes to the door, and opens it part way.\n\n                                     WOMAN (O.C.)\n                              (Raspy Japanese voice)\n                         Mr. Harris?\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Yes?\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Mr. Kazuzo sent me.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Oh?\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Can I enter?\n\n               He pauses, then opens the door.\n\n               A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt \n               and stockings comes in.

This book is about finding your soul's purpose or \n               destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is \n               not clear.  The acorn theory is an example of each soul \n               beginning with an imprint....\n\n               Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling \n               like a loser listening to a self-help tape.

OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Bob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if \n               he's in the right place. It's quiet and looks like a generic \n               office building.\n\n               He goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on \n               the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never \n               thought was there.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.
