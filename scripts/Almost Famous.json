A young hand comes\n\tinto frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only\n\tthe soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written\n\tin a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and\n\tcorrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of\n\tan old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we\n\tnow hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' \"Christmas Song.\"\n\n\t2\tEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t2\n\n\tA lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky.  Behind\n\tit, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of\n\tSan Diego.  A dry, hot Southern California day.  Even the wind\n\tis lazy, and a little bored.\n\n\t3\tEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER - DAY\t\t\t\t3\n\n\tSanta Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he\n\tcollects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the\n\tSouthland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly\n\tthick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.\n\n\tTurning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.\n\tShe is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's\n\n\tHaving with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They\n\tstand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the\n\thighly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering\n\tfake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the\n\tcommercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual\n\tconversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing\n\tletters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY...\n\tnow he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always\n\tpleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tExcuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no\n\t\t\tword in The English Language -- \"Xmas.\"\n\t\t\tIt's either Merry Christmas... or Happy\n\t\t\tHolidays.\n\n\tThe Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns\n\taway.  The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs -\n\tthat's my Mom.\n\n\tTITLE: 1969\n\n\t4\tEXT.  MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX -- DAY\t\t\t\t4\n\n\tThis is the new professional-class.  It's a mini-condo\n\tcommunity.  Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with\n\tcommon walls.   Move in on one of these homes, the one without\n\tChristmas lights.  At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl.\n\tShe checks her cheek, straightens her hair.  She hides\n\tsomething under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance\n\tto enter.  Music fades.\n\n\t5\tINT. KITCHEN -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t5\n\n\tWe now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her\n\tson, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets.\n\tThe meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan.  Across the kitchen\n\twe see William.  He's a great listener, with a calm and curious\n\tface that takes everything in.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t- so Livia -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t-- killed everyone off so her son\n\t\t\tTiberius could inherit the throne.\n\t\t\t\t(thoughtful pause)\n\t\t\tJust like Nixon.\n\n\tWilliam nods, intrigued.  He has a good disposition.  The\n\tworld of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings\n\tout in his Mom.  There is a small clatter at the front door,\n\tas the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes.\n\tShe silently curses herself.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAnita, is that you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA'S VOICE\n\t\t\tHey Mom!  I already ate.\n\n\tMom moves to the living room to greet William's sister.  William\n\tpeers into the next room.\n\n\t6\tINT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t6\n\n\tShe's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches\n\ther.  We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close.  She is an alluring\n\tyoung Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tYou sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.\n\n\tThe words \"soy cutlets\" sends a small shiver through the girl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tI'm fine.  Already ate.\n\n\tWilliam stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as\n\tMom moves closer to his sister.  She sees something curious\n\tabout her daughter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tWait.  You've been kissing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\t\t(too quickly)\n\t\t\tNo I haven't.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(peering at her lips)\n\t\t\tYes... yes, you have...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tNo I haven't.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tYes you have.  I can tell.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\t\t(boldly)\n\t\t\tYou can't tell.\n\n\tMom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully.\n\tTo her, everything is a quest for knowledge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tNot only can I tell, I know who it is.\n\t\t\tIt's Darryl.\n\n\tAnita is stunned silent.  She turns slightly to look at herself\n\tin a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself\n\timmediately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAnd what have you got under your coat?\n\n\tThis is the booty Anita didn't want to give up.  Mom picks at\n\tthe corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket.\n\tShe withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\t\t(busted)\n\t\t\tIt's unfair that we can't listen to\n\t\t\tour music!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(weary of the issue)\n\t\t\tHoney, it's all about drugs and\n\t\t\tpromiscuous sex.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tSimon and Garfunkel is poetry!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tYes it's poetry.  It's the poetry of\n\t\t\tdrugs and promiscuous sex.  Look at\n\t\t\tthe picture on the cover...\n\n\tCLOSE ON BOOKENDS ALBUM COVER\n\n\tMom's fingers at the edges.  We examine the insolent faces on\n\tRichard Avedon's classic album cover.  Even Simon and Garfunkle\n\tlook guilty under her scholarly inspection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t... honey, they're on pot.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tFirst it was butter, then sugar and\n\t\t\twhite flour.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tBacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll,\n\t\t\tmotorcycles.\n\n\tNearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating\n\tconversation.  Anita glances at her brother.  He silently\n\turges her to downshift.  She can't.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tThen it was celebrating Christmas on a\n\t\t\tday in September When you knew it\n\t\t\twouldn't be \"commercialized.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tThat was an experiment.  But I\n\t\t\tunderstand -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tWhat else are you going to ban?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tHoney, you want to rebel against\n\t\t\tknowledge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI'm trying to give you the Cliff's\n\t\t\tNotes on how to live in this world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\t\t(simple and direct)\n\t\t\tWe're like nobody else I know.\n\n\tThese are the words that sting Mom most.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tI'm a teacher.  Why can't I teach my\n\t\t\town kids?\n\t\t\t\t(pats chest)\n\t\t\tUse me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tDarryl says you use knowledge to keep\n\t\t\tme down.  He says I'm a \"yes\" person\n\t\t\tand you're trying to raise us in a\n\t\t\t\"no\" environment!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(immediately, can't help\n\t\t\tit)\n\t\t\tWell, clearly, \"no\" is a word Darryl\n\t\t\tdoesn't hear much.\n\n\tAnita gasps.  Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in.  Nearby\n\tis a poster - \"No More War.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tMom --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tEverything I say is wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tI can't live here!  I hate you!  Even\n\t\t\tWilliam hates you!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI don't hate her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\t\t(to William)\n\t\t\tYou don't even know the truth!\n\n\tWilliam looks vaguely confused.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tSweetheart, don't be a drama queen.\n\n\tAnita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the\n\tstrangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for\n\tthe first time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tFeck  you!  All of you!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tHey!\n\n\tAnita runs down the hall to her room.  Elaine turns to William,\n\trelating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWell, there it is.  Your sister using\n\t\t\tthe \"f\" word.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI think she said \"feck.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(sputtering)\n\t\t\tWhat's the difference?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(encouraging)\n\t\t\tWell.  The letter \"u\"...\n\n\tShot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of\n\tThe Moody Blues' \"Nights in White Satin.\"\n\n\t7\tINT.   SCHOOL DANCE/GYMNASIUM BATHROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t7\n\n\tMusic continues.  Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking\n\tmale teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror.\n\tThere's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid\n\tproudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some\n\tHai Karate), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the\n\tface of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and\n\tthen a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down,\n\tdown to find William.  He is so much younger, without a zit in\n\tsight.  Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.\n\n\t8\tINT. DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-CRANKED\t\t\t\t 8\n\n\tSong continues as we see William's perspective of these much-\n\tolder looking kids.  Girls now are visible, and they are even\n\tmore mature than the boys we've just seen.  They flirt and\n\tglow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys.\n\tWhispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down.\n\tIt's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring\n\tworld of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n\t\t\tAre you really in our grade?\n\n\t9\tINT. JUNIOR HIGH LOCKER ROOM -- DAY\t\t\t\t  9\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t\t(louder)\n\t\t\tAre you really in our grade?\n\n\tWilliam turns to see tall, adenoidal TIM TOBIN.  The most mature\n\tlooking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud\n\ttheatrical tone.  It is a voice right out of Guys and Dolls,\n\twhich incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just\n\tstarred.  William answers in a respectful voice.  He is\n\tdesperate for acceptance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTOBIN\n\t\t\tHey guys!  Check it out!  William\n\t\t\tdoesn't have any pubes!\n\n\tOthers now begin to gather around, examining William.  He has\n\tnever been more naked.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGUY # 1\n\t\t\tHow old are you man?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTOBIN\n\t\t\tHe's not a man, he's a little baby\n\t\t\tkid.  He Doesn't even get zits yet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGUY # 2\n\t\t\tHow come you don't have any hair down\n\t\t\tthere?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTOBIN\n\t\t\t\t(in loud, funny voice)\n\t\t\tWhere are your pubes???!!\n\n\tTheir voices echo off the tiled walls.  Now everyone is watching\n\tthe hairless William.  He is confused by their meanness.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGUY # 2\n\t\t\tYeah.  Where are your pubes?\n\n\tAll eyes are on him, waiting for a response.  The kid's mental\n\twheels turn frantically.  And from somewhere comes an attitude,\n\ta swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could\n\tonly be a merciful deity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(cool, dismissive)\n\t\t\tI had 'em.  I shaved 'em off.\n\n\tIt is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy.  And it works.\n\tGuy #2 cracks up, then others.  William's new accuser is\n\tsuddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these\n\tolder boys.  Others turn away, on to other things.  Tobin stares\n\tat William, and then also turns away.\n\n\t10    INT. FAMILY CAR -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t10\n\n\tWilliam jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan\n\tstation wagon, carrying books.  (\"See ya pubes!\")  Mom continues\n\tdriving William and Anita home from school.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(cheerfully, by rote, to\n\t\t\tWilliam in back)\n\t\t\tPut on your seatbelt.   I don't want\n\t\t\tyou flying through the windshield.\n\n\tAnita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't\n\tnoticed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWe got our annuals today --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(cheerful, automatic)\n\t\t\t\"Received\" your annual.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(looking at his photo)\n\t\t\tI look so much younger than everyone\n\t\t\telse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tEnjoy it while you can.\n\n\tCamera drifts from Mom to Anita, who can take it no longer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tMom.  It's time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(pleasant, pointed)\n\t\t\tCan this wait until we get home?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tMom, pull over.  Tell him the truth.\n\t\t\tTell him how old he is.\n\n\tMom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(as in \"be quiet\")\n\t\t\tHe knows how old he is.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tThe other kids make fun of him because\n\t\t\tof How young he looks.  Nobody includes\n\t\t\thim.\n\n\tThey call him \"The Narc\" behind his back...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tThey do?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tWhat's a \"Narc?\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\t(bleeding for her brother)\n\t\t\tA Narcotics Officer!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tWell what's wrong with that?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(ever the peacemaker)\n\t\t\tCome on you guys.  It's no big deal.\n\t\t\tI'm 12.  It's okay. She skipped me a\n\t\t\tgrade, it's okay.  Big deal.   I'm a\n\t\t\tyear younger.  They're 13, I'm 12 --\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tAren't I?\n\n\tTheir silence is eloquent.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(confessing, in a rush)\n\t\t\tI also put you in first grade when you\n\t\t\twere five and never told you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(trembling)\n\t\t\tSo...  I'm... how old?\n\n\tA heavy quiet.  She and his sister ignore him, as they now\n\tdebate the subject with each other.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tYou lied to him!  You make such a big\n\t\t\tdeal about the truth and you lied!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(that one hurts)\n\t\t\tHe never asked.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tWhat -- like he's going to ask if he's\n\t\t\tas old as he thinks he is?  Don't you\n\t\t\trealize, this is going to scar him\n\t\t\tforever?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tHoney... sweetheart... don't be\n\t\t\tCleopatra.  We have to be his mother\n\t\t\tand his Dad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tYou put too much pressure on him!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(apprehensive)\n\t\t\tHow... old...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tAnd when he rebels in some strange and\n\t\t\todd way, don't blame me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t... am I?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(matter of fact)\n\t\t\tI skipped you an extra grade.

Mom now begins\n\tspeed-rapping, trying to stem the leak.  She starts the car.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tSo you skipped fifth grade.  There's\n\t\t\ttoo  much padding In the grades.  I\n\t\t\ttaught elementary school.  5th grade -\n\t\t\tunnecessary.  Nothing happens in the\n\t\t\t5th grade.

With the compassion of a\n\tsaint, she offers this:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tHoney, I know you were expecting\n\t\t\tpuberty.  You're just going to have to\n\t\t\tshine it on for a while.\n\n\tDeeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat.  Mom\n\tmonitors his face constantly.  She is raw and sincere... and\n\tyes, inspiring:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tWho needs a \"crowd?\"  You're unique.  You're\n\t\t\ttwo years ahead of everybody.

WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t11\n\n\tWilliam finishes the last of many candy bars.  A mound of\n\twrappers sit just below the mirror.  He examines his face\n\thopefully for zits.  Nothing coming.  We begin to hear Simon\n\tand Garfunkel's \"America.\"\n\n\t12    INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t12\n\n\tAnita stands in the living room.   The song continues playing\n\ton the stereo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tI want to play you a song that explains\n\t\t\twhy I'm leaving, and try to listen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tWe can't talk?  We have to listen to\n\t\t\trock music?\n\n\t13    EXT. FRONT LAWN -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t13\n\n\tWilliam watches sadly.  Anita's good-looking boyfriend DARRYL,\n\ta dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases\n\tinto a large turqouise Chevy.  The suitcases are adorned with\n\tplastic stick-on flowers.    All coolness is leaving William's\n\tlife.  Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless.   (Their house\n\tis more austere, less \"fun\" than the other front lawns.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tTake good care of her in San Francisco,\n\t\t\tman.\n\n\tDarryl gives the kid a sub-human look.  He's invisible, too\n\tyoung to converse with.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tHow can she leave such a loving family?\n\n\tAnita turns and heads towards them.  She focuses on William,\n\tplacing her hands on his young shoulders.  Her face is very\n\tclose to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the\n\tfuture.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tOne day you'll be cool.\n\n\tHe nods stoically, hopefully.  He is utterly lost.  She leans\n\tforward and whispers in his ear.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tLook under your bed.  It'll set you\n\t\t\tfree.\n\n\tAnita shakes hands with Mom, and exits.  As the car takes off:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tShe'll be back.\n\n\tIn the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tYEAHHHHH-HOOOOOOOO.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tMaybe not soon...\n\n\tWilliam watches wistfully.  He moves away from his mother.\n\tShe pulls him closer.  Shot moves in on his slightly fearful\n\tface.\n\n\t14    INT. DARRYL'S CAR - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t14\n\n\tAnita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her\n\tmother and brother.  Sister waves to brother.  She feels for\n\thim.  Music now shifts to The Who's \"Sparks.\"\n\n\t15    INT. BEDROOOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t15\n\n\tWilliam locks the door.  He reaches under his bed.  It's a\n\tblack leatherette travel bag, with tartan design.  He unzips\n\tthe bag -- it's filled with albums.  He flips through the\n\tamazing, subversive cache of music.  Cream's Wheels of Fire...\n\tthe seminal Bob Dylan bootleg Great White Wonder... the Rolling\n\tStones' Get Yer Ya Ya's Out... The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds...\n\tAbraxas by Santana... Jethro Tull's Stand Up... The Mother's of\n\tInvention's We're Only In It For The Money...  Led Zeppelin...\n\tCrosby, Stills and Nash... Miles Davis' Bitches Brew... and\n\tThe Who's Tommy... with a note taped to it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA (V.O.)\n\t\t\t\"Listen to Tommy with a candle burning\n\t\t\tand you will see your entire future...\"\n\n\tThe heady effect of all these albums registers, as we see him\n\tlighting a candle.\n\n\tTITLE:  1973\n\n\tDETAIL SHOT OF NOTEBOOK\n\n\tA blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the\n\tnames of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with\n\tcarefully drawn thunderbolts.  Also, the name LESTER BANGS.\n\n\t16    INT. JOURNALISM CLASS -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t16\n\n\tWilliam, now 15, sits in class with book, Adventures in\n\tJournalism.  His hair is shoulder-length.  A dedicated teacher,\n\tPATRICIA DEEGAN, walks the aisles.  Music continues.\n\n\t17    EXT. FOOD MACHINES - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t17\n\n\tWilliam presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from\n\ta vending container.  He still looks younger than most of the\n\tstudents... and these days, especially the girls.\n\n\t18    EXT. LUNCH COURT -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t18\n\n\tWilliam sits apart from all the others, under a tree.  He reads\n\tintently, happily, as he eats the orange.  It's a copy of Creem\n\tMagazine.  Music continues.\n\n\tCLOSE ON PHOTOS IN MAGAZINE\n\n\tCamera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and\n\tfashions of the rock heroes of the day.  Ian Anderson of Jethro\n\tTull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute.  Neil Young,\n\tenigmatic with perfectly patched Levis.  The Southern Rock Royalty\n\tof The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of\n\tmassive stacks of amps.  Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair\n\tbacklit by stage lights.  David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one-\n\tpiece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars.  Pete Townsend\n\tof the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.\n\n\tDrift down to a by-line - by Lester Bangs.\n\n\t19    EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t19\n\n\tWilliam walks through the parking lot after school.  Everybody\n\tnow congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their\n\town cars.  Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly\n\tfaces smile strangely, laughing.  He takes a few steps and\n\tlooks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing\n\tsomething from the high-school marquee.\n\n\tHIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE\n\n\twhich reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)\n\n\tAll are laughing.  He laughs with them, and turns as his face\n\tgoes slack.  He shrugs, marches on.\n\n\t20    EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RADIO STATION -- DAY\t\t\t20\n\n\tThe song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by\n\ta highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the\n\tgreatness of The Guess Who.  He is a ferocious, lumbering, music-\n\tdriven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the\n\tvery brim.  This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a\n\tthen new art-form -- Rock Journalism.  A Disc-jockey with long-\n\tlong hair watches helplessly.  William views all this through a\n\tglass window.  He stands on the corner of a downtown side\n\tstreet, halfway up a steep incline.  He is the only person on\n\tthe streets this early Saturday morning.  Reveal that he is\n\twatching a live radio show, audible to us through the small\n\tp.a. speaker overhead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDISC-JOCKEY\n\t\t\tQuite an honor to have the World's\n\t\t\tGreatest Rock Critic... and editor of\n\t\t\tCreem Magazine, back Home in San Diego\n\t\t\tfor a few days -- Lester Bangs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLESTER BANGS\n\t\t\tWhat is this hippie station?!  Where's\n\t\t\tIggy Pop?  Don't you have a copy of\n\t\t\tRaw Power?!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDISC-JOCKEY\n\t\t\tLester, isn't it a little early for\n\t\t\tthis?\n\n\tBangs searches for the album -- vinyl flying everywhere now,\n\twith no regard for album jackets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tFound it!!\n\n\t21    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t21\n\n\tWilliam watches intently.  Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy\n\tof Raw Power.   We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the\n\tStooges' \"Search and Destroy.\"   A closer shot on William now\n\twatching the whirlwind of anarchy inside.  Lester does an Iggy\n\tPop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot\n\thear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the\n\tother side of this double-glass window.\n\n\t22    EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATER\t\t\t\t22\n\n\tBangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego\n\tstreet.  It's early, the streets are silent.  Bangs is about\n\tfifteen beer pounds overweight.  His jeans are loose, his\n\tpaleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and\n\tnights spent writing.  In there somewhere is a good-looking\n\tguy.  His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he\n\ttakes big sweeping steps.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tSo you're the one who's been sending\n\t\t\tme those articles from your school\n\t\t\tnewspaper -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI've been doing some stuff for a local\n\t\t\tunderground paper, too.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tWhat are you like the star of your\n\t\t\tschool?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tThey hate me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tYou'll meet them all again on their\n\t\t\tlong journey to the middle.\n\n\tThe kid nods, they walk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWell, your writing is damn good.  It's\n\t\t\tjust a shame you missed out on rock\n\t\t\tand roll.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI did?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tOh yeah.  It's over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOver?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tOver.  You got here just in time for\n\t\t\tthe death rattle, the last gasp, the\n\t\t\tlast grope.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWell.  At least I'm here for that.\n\n\tBangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head.  It's\n\ttoo late for newcomers.  But if the kid's age is an issue, he\n\tdoesn't mention it.  Like a machine-gun:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tWhat do you type on?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSmith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tYou like the new Lou Reed?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(automatic)\n\t\t\tThe early stuff.  The new stuff, he's\n\t\t\ttrying to be Bowie, he should be\n\t\t\thimself.  I'm not a big Lou man.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tYeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and\n\t\t\tLou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing\n\t\t\tLou.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(standing his ground)\n\t\t\tIf you like Lou.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tTake drugs?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tSmart kid.  I used to do speed and\n\t\t\tsometimes Nyquil and stay up all night\n\t\t\twriting and writing, like 25 pages of\n\t\t\tdribble about, you know, the Guess\n\t\t\tWho, or Coltrane, just to write, you\n\t\t\tknow, with the music blasting...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tMe too.  The writing part...\n\n\tFor a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest\n\tthing happens.  Bangs laughs.  It's an odd and charming laugh,\n\tthe kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden.  It surprised the kid,\n\twho smiles back.  Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a\n\tpleasant but very final nod of the head.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tWell, alright.  It's been nice to meet\n\t\t\tyou.  I'll see you around.  Keep sending\n\t\t\tme your stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOkay.  See you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tI can't stand here all day talking to\n\t\t\tmy many fans.\n\n\tWIDE SHOT - SOLITUDE\n\n\tBut neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning.\n\tThey stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted\n\tstreet.  They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.\n\n\t23    INT. DINER -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23\n\n\tWilliam listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich.  His face\n\tis an open book filling with words.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\t-- so anyway, you're from San Diego\n\t\t\tand that's good.  Because once you go\n\t\t\tto L.A., you're gonna have friends\n\t\t\tlike crazy but they'll be fake friends,\n\t\t\tthey're gonna try to corrupt you.  The\n\t\t\tpublicists!  The bands!  You got an\n\t\t\thonest face, they're gonna tell you\n\t\t\teverything.  But you CANNOT make friends\n\t\t\twith the rock stars.\n\n\tThe kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures --\n\tcan I make a note?  Bangs nods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS (cont'd)\n\t\t\tCannot make friends with the rock stars.\n\t\t\t\t(savage bite)\n\t\t\tThat's what's important.  If you're a rock\n\t\t\tjournalist, a true journalist -- first you\n\t\t\twill never get paid much.  But you will\n\t\t\tget free records from the record company.\n\n\tThe kid's eyes widen.  Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal\n\twriting style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate\n\tsoftie.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAnd they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet\n\t\t\tgirls... they'll try to fly you places for\n\t\t\tfree.... offer you drugs...  I know.  It\n\t\t\tsounds great.  But they are not your\n\t\t\tfriends.   These are people who want you\n\t\t\tto write sanctimonious stories about the\n\t\t\tgenius of the rock stars and they will\n\t\t\truin rock and roll and strangle everything\n\t\t\twe love about it.\n\n\tPrivately, William thrills.  We.  Our.  It all sounds great to\n\thim.  He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of\n\tthem.  He madly scribbles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS (cont'd)\n\t\t\tThey are trying to buy respectability\n\t\t\tfor a form that is gloriously and\n\t\t\trighteously -\n\n\tThe kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS (cont'd)\n\t\t\t- dumb!  And you're smart enough to\n\t\t\tknow that.  And the day it ceases to\n\t\t\tbe dumb is the day it ceases to be\n\t\t\treal.  Right?  And then it will just\n\t\t\tBecome an Industry of Cool.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t... Industry... of... cool...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tAnd that's what they want!  And it's\n\t\t\thappening right now.  I'm telling you,\n\t\t\tyou're coming along at a very dangerous\n\t\t\ttime for rock and roll.  The war is\n\t\t\tover.  They won.  99% of what passes\n\t\t\tfor rock now... SILENCE is much more\n\t\t\tcompelling.  It's over.  I think you\n\t\t\tshould turn around and go back and\n\t\t\tbe... a lawyer or something... but I\n\t\t\tcan see from your face that you won't.\n\t\t\tI can pay you thirty-five bucks.  Gimme\n\t\t\ta thousand words on Black Sabbath.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(attempting cool)\n\t\t\tAn assignment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLESTER\n\t\t\tYeah.  And you should build your\n\t\t\treputation on being honest... and\n\t\t\tunmerciful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(writing in notebook)\n\t\t\tHonest... unmerciful...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n\t\t\tAnd if you get into a jam -- call me.\n\t\t\tI stay up late.\n\n\tBangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he\n\tscribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate\n\tnotebook.  The notebook has just become valuable.  They sit\n\ttogether, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.\n\n\t24    INT. FAMILY CAR -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t24\n\n\tMom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena.  She looks\n\tout the window at the adrenalized concert-goers.  She feels\n\tprotective not just of her son, but an entire generation.\n\tWilliam goes over his questions for Black Sabbath.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tLook at this.  An entire generation of\n\t\t\tCinderellas and there's no slipper\n\t\t\tcoming.\n\n\tWilliam looks out the window at the sign: TONIGHT - SOLD OUT -\n\tBLACK SABBATH with special guest Stillwater.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYou can drop me off here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tBlack.  Sabbath.  Just remember - you\n\t\t\twanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill\n\t\t\ta Mockingbird.\n\n\tThe kid doesn't answer.  He silently goes over his questions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAs long as I know this is just a hobby,\n\t\t\tI'll go along with it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tAll I have to do is listen.  That's\n\t\t\twhat Lester Bangs said.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(dryly)\n\t\t\tI'll be waiting right here at eleven\n\t\t\t'o clock sharp.  If you get lost, use\n\t\t\tthe family whistle.\n\n\tHe unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange\n\tcanvas shoulder-bag and exits.\n\n\tElaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert\n\tcrowd.  It's a windy night.  Everything about this image\n\ttroubles her.  She fights with herself, and then uses the family\n\twhistle immediately.  He turns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(sweetly, too loud)\n\t\t\tDon't take drugs!!\n\n\tFifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound\n\tof a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her\n\tconcern.  All around him, we hear:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAPPY CONCERT GOERS\n\t\t\tDon't take drugs!!\n\n\tHe winces, nods and moves forward.  Music echoes from the open\n\twindows of many other cars.\n\n\t25    EXT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA BACKSTAGE RAMP -- NIGHT\t\t 25\n\n\tThe kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel\n\tbackstage arena door.  He rings the buzzer.  The door wheezes\n\topen to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's\n\tbackstage list.  Famous to all those who attempt to enter,\n\tthis is SCOTTY.  He is a wiry, humorless man for whom\n\tpowerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few\n\thours he controls the list.  Scotty is only forty but everything\n\tabout him screams that he's an angry sixty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tHi.  I'm William Miller and I'm here\n\t\t\tfrom Creem Magazine to interview the\n\t\t\tband Black Sabbath.\n\n\tScotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and\n\tsnaps through three clipboard pages.  He moves back to the\n\tdoor and grabs the handle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n\t\t\tNot on the list.\n\n\tHe shuts the door with finality.  The kid stands silently for\n\ta moment.  He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering\n\tGroupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp.  They\n\tlook at him sympathetically, but he turns away.  William rings\n\tthe buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of Creem from his bag.\n\tThe door opens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSir, I'm a journalist, and here's a\n\t\t\tcopy of the magazine.\n\n\tThe magazine hangs in mid-air.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n\t\t\tYou're not on the list.   Go to the\n\t\t\ttop of the ramp with the girls!\n\n\tSlam.  William stands there for a moment.  Unsure of what to\n\tdo next, he looks back to the top of the ramp.  Rejected by\n\thim just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest.\n\tBracing himself, William rings again.  The door opens slowly\n\tthis time.  Scotty stands peering at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(in a rush)\n\t\t\tWhat-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of-\n\t\t\tthe-ramp with-the-gi -\n\n\tSlam.  Lock.\n\n\t26    EXT. TOP OF SPORTS ARENA RAMP -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t26\n\n\tWilliam inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the\n\tramp.  The wind whips.  It's just him, and two Groupies in\n\ttheir evening best.  They now pretend to barely notice the\n\tyoung journalist who has been banished to stand with them.\n\tChattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17\n\tyears, is ESTRELLA.  She sports long unruly black hair.  Her\n\tpartner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes.  Estrella turns\n\tto the kid with great disinterest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tWho are you with?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(embarrassed to be alive)\n\t\t\tMe?  I'm with myself.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tNo, who are you with?  What band?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI'm here to interview Black Sabbath.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tI'm a journalist.  I'm not a... you\n\t\t\tknow...\n\n\tEstrella stares at him.  Moving into the parking lot light,\n\tintroducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur\n\ttrimmed coat.  This is PENNY LANE.  There is an inviting warmth\n\tand real interest in the way she asks:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\t... you're not a what?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(enthralled)\n\t\t\tOh... I'm just... not a... you know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tNot a \"what\"?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(charmed)\n\t\t\tYou know.  A \"groupie.\"\n\n\tThe two girls are deeply insulted by the word.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tOhhh!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSorry, I -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tWe.  Are not.  \"Groupies.\"\n\n\tEstrella indicates Penny with great reverence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tThis is Penny Lane, man.  Show some\n\t\t\trespect.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t-- sorry.\n\n\tPenny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid.  Behind\n\ther, concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way.  She seems\n\tnot to hear them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\t\"Groupies\" sleep with rock stars because\n\t\t\tthey want to be near someone famous.\n\t\t\tWe are here because of the music.  We\n\t\t\tare Band Aids.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tShe used to run a school for Band Aids.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tWe don't have intercourse with these\n\t\t\tguys.  We support the music.  We inspire\n\t\t\tthe music.  We are here because of the\n\t\t\tmusic.\n\n\tWilliam is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window.\n\tListening.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tMarc Bolan broke her heart, man.  It's\n\t\t\tfamous.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tIt's a long story.  I'm retired now.\n\t\t\tI'm just visiting friends.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tShe was the one who changed everything.\n\t\t\tShe said \"no more sex, no more\n\t\t\texploiting our bodies and hearts... \"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tRight.  Right.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\t\"... just blow-jobs, and that's it.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOkay.  Well, see, now I get the\n\t\t\tdifference.\n\n\tShot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another\n\tbreathless girl teetering on tall shoes.  She is in the vicinity\n\tof 16.  Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just\n\tlike the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane.  She is POLEXIA, the\n\tvoluptuous one, from Riverside.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(the usual greeting)\n\t\t\tIt's all happening.  It's all happening.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tPolexia!!   Did you tell Sabbath we\n\t\t\twere going to be here?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tI talked to Dick with Stillwater, I\n\t\t\ttalked with Sabbath.  They're all dying\n\t\t\tto see us.   It's all happening.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tThis is our journalist friend.\n\t\t\tJournalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr,\n\t\t\tand Polexia Aphrodisia. And you are --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWilliam.\n\n\tSilent beat.  His name lands like a thud.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tHere comes Sabbath!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tOzzy!!!  Tony!!!  It's us!!\n\n\tA long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps\n\ttwice.  The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls\n\tinside.  And then silence again.  The girls do not discuss\n\tbeing rebuffed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI think I saw Sapphire in there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(can't hold it in any longer)\n\t\t\tOkay.  I was with Ian Hunter all night\n\t\t\tat Rodney's Last night.  Wanna see his\n\t\t\tspoo?  I saved it in a baggie.\n\n\tShe opens her purse and shows the girls something inside.\n\tWilliam edges away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\t\t(peering into purse)\n\t\t\tI'm really happy he's doing so well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(regarding what's in purse)\n\t\t\tYeah.  I know he's such a talented\n\t\t\tguy.  I mean, look at him.  Who deserves\n\t\t\tit more?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(looking in purse)\n\t\t\tNobody -- he's so sweet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\t\t(with compassion)\n\t\t\tDon't you just root for him, you know.\n\t\t\tTo go that little distance between\n\t\t\tgood and great?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tWait.  That's not his.  I would know\n\t\t\this.\n\n\tA very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet\n\tlook.  What's in that purse?\n\n\tBAM -- THE BACKSTAGE DOOR OPENS\n\n\tOut steps SAPPHIRE, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms.  Heavy\n\teye-makeup.  Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English.\n\tIn one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne.  In the other,\n\ta fistful of backstage passes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAPPHIRE\n\t\t\tDoes anybody remember laugh-tah?\n\t\t\t\t(as they turn)\n\t\t\tCome and GET 'EM!\n\n\tThe girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire.\n\tPenny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked\n\taround his.  He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the\n\tramp.  Sapphire slaps passes on the girls.  As Scotty (The\n\tKeeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William\n\tforward for a pass.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n\t\t\tOh no.  Not this one --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAPPHIRE\n\t\t\t\t(off William)\n\t\t\tWho brought Opie?\n\n\tThe kid looks over his shoulder.  Who's Opie?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tHe's with us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n\t\t\t\t(hand blocking William)\n\t\t\tHe wasn't with you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAPPHIRE\n\t\t\t\t(to Scotty)\n\t\t\tAre you going to turn this into a\n\t\t\tThing?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n\t\t\tAll of you can wait outside!  Top of\n\t\t\tthe ramp!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI don't want to cause a Thing.  I'll\n\t\t\twait.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(privately, to William)\n\t\t\tI'll go take care of this.\n\n\tSadly, they leave him behind.  The thundering arena sound of\n\tthe collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes'\n\t\"Roundabout\"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases...\n\tthe glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants\n\tto be a part of is on the other side of this door.  And then\n\tit shuts.  He stands alone.\n\n\tAt the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads.  It reads --\n\tSTILLWATER TOUR 73.  Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening\n\tband.  This is Stillwater.  Four road-weary band members, and\n\ttheir road manager.  Voices booming.\n\n\tRUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his\n\tguitar-case.  It's obvious from moment one.  This is the star\n\tof the band, the charismatic one.  He's tired.  They're late.\n\tWilliam recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches.\n\tThe buzzer goes unanswered.  The kid is invisible to him, as\n\tthe others now arrive behind Russell.\n\n\tTour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on\n\tthe steel door.  He has the flaxen-haired look of a former\n\thippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest\n\tsilver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes.\n\tHis direction is always - forward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tLet us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on\n\t\t\tthe show!!\n\n\tWilliam is surrounded by them now.  They stand together under the\n\tsingle lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover.  JEFF\n\tBEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his\n\thead.  ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging\n\tlimply at his sides.  His is a face made for the background. LARRY\n\tTURNER the compact bass-player.   Dick now kicks at the door with\n\this foot, as William produces a copy of Creem Magazine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(to Dick)\n\t\t\tHi, I'm a journalist.  I write for Creem\n\t\t\tMagazine.\n\n\tOnce again, the magazine hangs there.  He can't give it away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tThe enemy!  A rock writer!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(struggling forward)\n\t\t\tI'd like to interview you or someone\n\t\t\tfrom the band.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\t\t(busy, running behind)\n\t\t\tI'm sorry but could you please fuck\n\t\t\toff?\n\n\tWilliam blinks a little, takes it in stride.  Russell sizes\n\thim up, moving in the background.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOkay.  Okay.  I could do that.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tYou guys never listened to our records.\n\t\t\tYou're all just frustrated musicians.\n\t\t\tDo you know what your magazine SAID\n\t\t\tabout us?  What was it - \"the singer's\n\t\t\tincessant cater walling distracts From\n\t\t\tan assault with no clear purpose.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLARRY\n\t\t\t\t(in background)\n\t\t\tThat was Rolling Stone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tYeah.  Okay.  Fuck off anyway.  We\n\t\t\tplay for fans, not critics.\n\n\tStung, William shrugs.  It's been a terrible night, but at\n\tleast thrillingly so.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tRussell.  Jeff.  Ed.   Larry.\n\t\t\t\t(can't help it)\n\t\t\tI really love your band.   I think the\n\t\t\tsong \"Fever Dog\" is a big step forward\n\t\t\tfor you guys.  I think you guys\n\t\t\tproducing it yourselves, instead of\n\t\t\tGlyn Johns, was the right thing to do.\n\t\t\tAnd the guitar sound was incendiary.\n\t\t\t\t(gestures with fist)\n\t\t\tWay to go.\n\n\tHe turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp.\n\tRussell looks at the others.  That kind of love is hard to\n\tgive up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(good humored, yelling)\n\t\t\tWell don't stop there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tYeah, come back here!!  Keep going!\n\n\tThey wave him back, as the backstage door opens again.  The\n\tkid moves back down the ramp.   They herd him in with them,\n\tthrough the door.  Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares\n\toff.\n\n\tRussell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him\n\tforward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n\t\t\tNot this one.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tHe's with us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n\t\t\tHe's not with you.  He's not with them.\n\t\t\tHe's not on the list.  He's not coming\n\t\t\tin.  And this is my arena.  And\n\t\t\tfurthermore -\n\n\tRussel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to\n\tScotty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY (cont'd)\n\t\t\t- have a good time tonight.   Welcome\n\t\t\tto San Diego.\n\n\t27    INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t27\n\n\tThe band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving\n\tto keep up.  A young and grizzled red-haired roadie, RED DOG,\n\tcatches them on the way.  The band swarms around him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tRed Dog!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED DOG\n\t\t\tWe're playing here tomorrow night.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\t\t(aside, to the kid)\n\t\t\tThis is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers\n\t\t\tBand's number one roadie.\n\n\tRussel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tHow're the guys?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED DOG\n\t\t\tHavin a ball, man.  When we have a\n\t\t\tparty, we have an Allman Brothers Band\n\t\t\tparty.  Everybody boogies.  Everybody\n\t\t\tgets off.  It's family, man.  We all got\n\t\t\tThese now.\n\t\t\t\t(flashes new mushroom tattoo\n\t\t\ton forearm)\n\t\t\tWe'll see you guys in Boston, right?\n\t\t\t\t(specifically to Russell)\n\t\t\tDicky and Gregg send you their love.\n\n\tCamera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as\n\tStillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room.\n\n\t28    INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t28\n\n\tDressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply\n\tlistens.  He holds a small microphone.  His stoic look gives away\n\tlittle of the full body rush he's experiencing.  As the other\n\tband members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and\n\troll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready\n\tfor the show.  To the kid, every word is reckless gem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t... and it's okay, because rock and\n\t\t\troll is a LIFESTYLE...  and a way of\n\t\t\tthinking and it's not about money and\n\t\t\t\"popularity!\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tSome money would be nice.\n\n\tJeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into\n\this scalp - poor man's mousse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t- but it's a voice that says here I\n\t\t\tam... and FUCK YOU if you can't\n\t\t\tunderstand me.\n\n\tRussell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth\n\tfrom his guitar case.  The kid notices all these close-up\n\tdetails of rock.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAnd one of those people is gonna save the\n\t\t\tworld and that means that ROCK AND ROLL\n\t\t\tCAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together.\n\n\tThe kid's eyes dance.  He checks to make sure he's getting the\n\trecording.  He listens intently.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tAnd the chicks are great.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tBut we didn't do it for that!  We are\n\t\t\there because we needed to fuckin be\n\t\t\there, not just 'cause we needed to\n\t\t\taway from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE\n\t\t\tDID... but what it all comes down to\n\t\t\tis that thing. The Indefinable Thing,\n\t\t\twhen people catch something from your\n\t\t\tmusic, the thing you put into it.  I'm\n\t\t\ttalking about... what am I talking\n\t\t\tabout?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(elegantly)\n\t\t\tThe buzz?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tTHE BUZZ!   And the chicks, the\n\t\t\twhatever, is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ.\n\t\t\tAnd like -- you saying you liked \"Fever\n\t\t\tDog?\"   That is the fucking buzz, man.\n\t\t\tAll we get are these fucking old-ass\n\t\t\tinterviewers who don't understand,\n\t\t\tdon't LISTEN, don't appreciate why we\n\t\t\tare here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ.\n\n\tWilliam nods, holds his microphone steady.  Russell tunes his\n\tguitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks.\n\tJeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tThe next album will be even better.\n\t\t\tMore texture.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tBut... it's not what you put in, is\n\t\t\tit?  It's what you leave out.  Listen\n\t\t\tto... listen to Marvin Gaye...\n\n\tRussell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of\n\tmusic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tA song like \"What's Going On.\"  That\n\t\t\tsingle \"woo\" at the end of the second\n\t\t\tverse - you know that woo - that single\n\t\t\t\"woo.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(proudly)\n\t\t\tI know that, \"woo.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(he does it)\n\t\t\tThat's what you remember.  The silly\n\t\t\tthings, the little things... there's\n\t\t\tonly one, and it makes the song.  It's\n\t\t\twhat you leave out.  That's rock and\n\t\t\troll.\n\n\tWilliam nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed.\n\tActivity surrounds him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\t\t(impressed)\n\t\t\tWe used to talk more about this stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tOkay.  See, this is maybe the most\n\t\t\thonest we've ever been in an interview\n\t\t\tbecause you know our music.  You're\n\t\t\tthe first press guy we've made friends\n\t\t\twith.  We don't normally talk like\n\t\t\tthis to them.  And you're supposed to\n\t\t\tbe The Enemy!  What are you - 18?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThere you go.  Still young enough to\n\t\t\tbe honest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\t\t(walkie talkie crackling)\n\t\t\tTen minutes 'till showtime, anyone who\n\t\t\tisn't in the band -- out!\n\n\tRussell takes a last swig of beer.  A roadie whisks his guitar\n\taway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAll this luggage is going to L.A.!\n\n\tWilliam is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual,\n\tpast the pile of luggage by the door.  It's a colorful heap of\n\tsuitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a\n\tnumber.\n\n\t29    INT. BACKSTAGE STEPS -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER\t\t\t29\n\n\tWilliam sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his\n\tnotebook.  Behind him, two steps higher, Penny Lane scoots\n\tinto place.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tI found you a pass.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(amped, distracted)\n\t\t\tThanks.  I got in with Stillwater.\n\t\t\t\t(as he writes)\n\t\t\tThe guitarist, Russel Hammond, he\n\t\t\tjust thoroughly opened up.  He is by\n\t\t\tfar the best and most honest interview\n\t\t\tI've ever done.\n\t\t\t\t(she nods)\n\t\t\tI've only done two, but you know.\n\t\t\tHe's number one.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tYou're learning.  They're much more\n\t\t\tfun on the way up.\n\n\tWilliam nods, still scribbling.  She eases down into place on\n\tthe step next to him.  Her proximity cause him to look at\n\ther, his eyebrows rising.  She smooths them down with two single\n\tfingers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tHow old are you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tEighteen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tMe too.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tHow old are we really?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSeventeen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tMe too.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tActually I'm 16.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tMe too.  Isn't it funny?  The truth\n\t\t\tjust sounds Different.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(confesses)\n\t\t\tI'm 15.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tYou want to know how old I really am?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(immediately)\n\t\t\tNo.\n\n\tShe looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning\n\tup.  Music is her religion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM (cont'd)\n\t\t\tHow did you get started in all this?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tIt's a long story.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(quick study)\n\t\t\tRight.  Right.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tWe live in the same city.  We should\n\t\t\tbe friends.\n\n\tShe takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his\n\tthigh - the cooler location.  Nearby, the dressing room door\n\topens, and the Stillwater exits.   Excitement level rises as\n\tthey mass in the hallway with instruments.  We hear the amped\n\tvoice of Russell growing nearer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThe Enemy!\n\n\tHe approaches, as William stands.  Penny watches, hanging out\n\tof Russell's eyesight.\n\n\tStanding in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to\n\tintroduce his new friends.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tRussell, this is Penny Lane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\t\t(stepping into view)\n\t\t\tPleasure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tPenny Lane?  Like the song, right?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tHave we met?\n\n\tTHEY SHAKE\n\n\tAnd do not let go, for too long.  There is history in their\n\tshake.  Their eyes tell all.  Shot takes us to William, who\n\tputs two and two together.  It isn't hard.  They clearly know\n\teach other. Well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWell, I guess you've... you've met.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tPenny Lane!  God's gift to rock and\n\t\t\troll!!  You're back!\n\t\t\t\t(privately)\n\t\t\tMarc Bolan.  Please.\n\n\tOther band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time,\n\twaiting in the hallway... and now singing the Beatles song\n\t\"Penny Lane.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tCome on, let's go.\n\t\t\t\t(noting kid's shyness)\n\t\t\tBoth of you.\n\n\t30    INT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t30\n\n\tHouse lights go down.  Cheers rise.  Dick's flashlight dances\n\ton the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the\n\tdark to the stage steps.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t- get in the huddle.\n\n\tRussell pulls William into the band's huddle.\n\n\tSHOT LOOKING UP AT THEM\n\n\tTheir band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's\n\tshoulders in a circle.  They sing a dew lines of the classic\n\t\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" (or \"Go See Cal\" from the Cal Worthington\n\tad) They all touch feet, and then break, heading for the stage.\n\tRussell directs Penny to his side of the stage.  The kid follows.\n\tPlugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord --\n\tthwack.  He steps on effects pedal.  Applause.  (Adlib onstage\n\tprivate patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff\n\tno audience ever hears)  Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to\n\taddress the crowd from the darkened stage.  It is his favorite\n\tmoment of the evening, the highlight of his job.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tFrom Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome --\n\t\t\t\t(importantly)\n\t\t\tStillwater.\n\n\tLight hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening\n\tsong, \"If You Say Nothing.\"  Audience response is strong.\n\tShot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most\n\tundeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty\n\tseconds.\n\n\tJeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some\n\tvocal pyrotechnics.  Russell looks over to Penny and William,\n\tat stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an\n\telegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he\n\tbelongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first\n\tguitar lead of the night.  The kid looks over to see Penny\n\twatching Russell.\n\n\t31    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT -- LATER\t\t\t\t\t31\n\n\tCases are shut and rolled toward the trucks.  Stillwater heads\n\tfor their bus.  Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr,\n\tlike a sailor leaving port.   Russell lingers behind, saying\n\tgoodbye to William, loading his own equipment.  Black Sabbath\n\tpasses with entourage, heading to the stage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(privately)\n\t\t\tSo.  You want to come up to L.A., we'll\n\t\t\tbe at the \"Riot House\" all week.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\"The Riot House?\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThe Continental Hyatt House!

Right.\n\n\tAll the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the\n\tbackstage crowd of hangers-on.

No problem.  Long story.\n\t\t\tAlright!  I gotta go.\n\n\tElsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing \"Sweet\n\tLeaf.\"  The kid could care less.  He has bonded with Stillwater.\n\tHe heads for the door.  Penny walks with him.  He's loving it.\n\tThey pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they\n\texit out into the ramp area.\n\n\t32    EXT. SPORTS ARENA -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t32\n\n\tPenny takes out an eyeliner pencil, writes her number on the\n\tback of his green notebook.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tCall me if you need a rescue.  We live\n\t\t\tin the same city.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI think I live in a different world.\n\n\tThey stand in the night air.  The parking lot is largely silent\n\tnow, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath.  In\n\tthe distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tSpeaking of the world.  I've made a\n\t\t\tdecision.\n\t\t\t\t(a very serious secret)\n\t\t\tI'm going to live in Morocco for one\n\t\t\tyear. I need a new crowd.\n\n\tHe nods.  He is a rapt audience for this flashy girl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY (cont'd)\n\t\t\tDo you want to come?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYes.\n\n\tIn the distance, we hear the family whistle growing louder.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tIt's a plan.  You've got to call me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOkay.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tIt's all happening.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tIt's all happening.\n\n\tHe nods cooly.

We\n\thear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview,\n\tfull of overlapping and barely discernible voices.\n\tMeticulously, he untangles the voices, especially Russell's,\n\tas he transcribes.\n\n\tINT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n\tThe work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona\n\tGalaxis.  There is a knock at the window, and William scoots\n\tback in his chair to see a familiar face.  It is Darryl, his\n\tsister's old boyfriend.  William opens the window.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tHey Darryl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDARRYL\n\t\t\tHey.\n\n\tDarryl climbs in the window, looks around the room that was\n\tonce the site of his previous glory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDARRYL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tSo she's a stewardess now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYeah.  She and Mom are still sorta...\n\t\t\tI'd say \"not speaking,\" but I don't\n\t\t\tknow if they ever did.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDARRYL\n\t\t\tYour sister.

Alright.\n\n\tWilliam nods and continues his work, self-consciously, as Darryl\n\tsits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room.  A long\n\tmoment passes.  Darryl pats his thighs, and rises.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDARRYL\n\t\t\tOkay, man.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOkay, man.\n\n\t34    INT. LIVING ROOM -- EVENING\t\t\t\t\t34\n\n\tWilliam slips on corduroy jacket, over a tie-dyed shirt.  Well,\n\tit's definitely a look.  Mom appears more nervous than her\n\tson.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tI worry about the drunk drivers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tMom.  I'm 15.\n\t\t\t\t(beat, vague panic)\n\t\t\tRight?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tYes, you're 15. \"And here's that money\n\t\t\tI owed you.\"\n\n\tShe reaches in a small box near the door, gives him twenty\n\tbucks.  It's their routine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tYour dad's favorite joke.  I don't do\n\t\t\tit as well.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI thought it was pretty good.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tKeep the small bills on the outside.\n\t\t\tAnd call me if anyone gets drunk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI will call you if anyone\n\t\t\tanywhere gets drunk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tGood.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(anticipating her, like a\n\t\t\tparent)\n\t\t\tAnd don't take drugs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(stoic)\n\t\t\tHa ha.  Very funny.  See -- sense of\n\t\t\thumor.  Have fun at the dance.  I'm\n\t\t\tglad you're making friends.\n\n\tThey move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind\n\ther she's not going.  He opens the door.  She's a wreck, and\n\tshe knows it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tMom?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tYeah -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(loving but firm, as if to\n\t\t\ta dog.)\n\t\t\tStay.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tOh... okay.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI-love-you-bye.\n\n\tHe opens the door.  Neil Young.  \"Sugar Mountain.\"  Watching\n\thim leave is always a killer.  She's not getting any better at\n\tit either.  She folds her arms tightly across her chest.\n\n\t35    EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t35\n\n\tPenny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different\n\tmore elegant look.  She cups her hands and yells up to him.\n\tHe hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost\n\tfalling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin.\n\n\t36    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- LATER NIGHT\t\t\t\t36\n\n\tMiss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset\n\tBoulevard.  She sings along to the obscure words of Led\n\tZeppelin's \"Dancing Days.\"  William takes it all in from the\n\tpassenger seat.  Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or\n\tbeer, but albums.  It's a wondrous piece of geography for any\n\trock fan.  Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it all in.\n\tHe moves his head outside the window to see fully.  Her\n\twindshield is cracked along the side.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tThe Continental Hyatt House.  Also known\n\t\t\tas The Riot House.\n\t\t\t\t(does tour guide voice)\n\t\t\tEvery band stays here, all the ones\n\t\t\tthat matter.  The Who.  Zeppelin.\n\t\t\tAlice.  Bowie.  English bands.  American\n\t\t\tbands.  We all know each other.  Twenty-\n\t\t\tfour hour room service.  Like us, they\n\t\t\twere outsiders.  They were so outside,\n\t\t\tthey're inside, and insiders never\n\t\t\teven knew it, because they're outsiders\n\t\t\tand they are inside a place outsiders\n\t\t\twill never be.  And why are we even\n\t\t\ttalking about it?  If you're really an\n\t\t\tinsider, you're never gonna say it.\n\t\t\tYou know what I mean?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(beat, working it out)\n\t\t\tYeah.  Yes.\n\n\tShe makes a swift turn into a secret parking spot near the\n\thotel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tAnd we're not gonna hang out with\n\t\t\tRussell.  You can, but not me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWhat is it with you and Russell?\n\n\t37    EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t37\n\n\tNeil Young and Crazy Horse's \"Cinnamon Girl\" ricochets across\n\tthe Strip.  It's blasting from cars tuned into KMET.  Penny\n\tnow wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat.  She grabs William's\n\thand, steadying her hat at the same time.  They dart across\n\tthe busy street.  She stumbles a little on her platforms.  He\n\tsteadies his taller date.  They are a good team as they pass\n\tone of several humming tour busses parked out front.\n\n\t38    INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t38\n\n\tPenny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her\n\tarm.  The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive\n\tthan most clubs.  It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying\n\tHalliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling\n\tRockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and\n\ttaller-platforms than Penny Lane.  The feeling is communal,\n\tillicit, intoxicating.  The secret community of rock.  Penny\n\tattracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tIt's all happening.\n\t\t\t\t(grabbing him like a shield)\n\t\t\tAnd I'm about to use you as protection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tROADIE # 1\n\t\t\tPenny Lane!!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\t\t(aside)\n\t\t\tThese guys are with Alice Cooper.

I'm going to go\n\t\t\ttraveling in India.  Then I'm going to\n\t\t\tlearn how to play the violin.  Then\n\t\t\tI'm going to go to college for one\n\t\t\tyear.\n\n\tWilliam looks at her, perplexed and a little hurt.

I throw the little ones back.\n\n\tLusty laughs circle William.  Overlapping this dialogue is the\n\tappearance of our friend Polexia.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(in tears, in pieces,\n\t\t\temotional)\n\t\t\tIan Hunter is a fucking asshole!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tPolexia!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tOpie!!!\n\n\tShe hugs him like a long-lost friend, knocking the air out of\n\thim.  And now overlapping this action, appears Superfan RIC\n\tNUNEZ, 14.  His eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal\n\tand never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes.  Tonight he\n\twears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters.\n\tIt features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: \"TO\n\tBE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL.\"  A felt-tip pen is still in his\n\tquivering hand.  Nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRIC\n\t\t\tIt's all happening.   I just saw them\n\t\t\ton the seventh floor!  Mr. Jimmy Page...\n\t\t\tMr. John Paul Jones...\n\t\t\t\t(displays squiggle on shirt)\n\t\t\tMr. Robert Plant signed my shirt in\n\t\t\tthe elevator!!  Five minutes ago, he\n\t\t\ttouched this pen.

HYATT HOUSE LOBBY PHONE -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER\t\t39\n\n\tPenny nearby as William picks up the house phone.  He shouts\n\tover the din.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tHarry Houdini, please.\n\n\tAs he waits, he discreetly pockets the matches, hotel pad and\n\tpencil next to the housephone.\n\n\t40    INT. HALLWAY/RUSSELL'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t40\n\n\tWilliam, Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway,\n\tlooking for the room.  William looks in the passing open doors,\n\teach one a different window into another world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE\n\t\t\tOkay.  Time to put on the lampshade.\n\n\tUp ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open.\n\tInside, a band party in full swing.  A clunky early-model boom\n\tbox segues from James Brown's \"Make It Funky\" to Led Zeppelin's\n\t\"Gallows Pole.\"   Russell Hammond is the center of this party,\n\tjabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar.  Much singing\n\techoes all around.  It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all\n\tmembers of the band are present.  Penny Lane takes a breath\n\tand enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite\n\tdirections.  She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with\n\tproper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY LANE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\"Ladies and Gentlemen.

William watches her with\n\twonder, as she turns his way and winks.  Jeff approaches the\n\talluring Polexia, and goes to get her a beer.  Meanwhile,\n\tPolexia sidles up to William.  She sees him watching Penny at\n\tthe other side of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(privately)\n\t\t\tAct One, in which she pretends she\n\t\t\tdoesn't care about him.\n\n\tPOV shot travels to Russell, strumming the guitar that is always\n\ta part of his body.

The kid's eyebrows rise.  Polexia\n\tregards the kid with affection, adjusting his collar and peeling\n\ta hair off his jacket.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tI just worry about people using her.\n\t\t\tYou know?

ICE ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t41\n\n\tThe ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise.  Penny\n\tputs ice in her glass.  Behind her, Russell moves into frame,\n\thands delicately riding the sides of her body.  A motorcycle\n\troars by, just outside the door, as Penny moves away from\n\tRussell's exploring hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(with real indignation)\n\t\t\tHow does it end?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tYou know - the story about the girl\n\t\t\twho dumps the guy who has an ex-ex\n\t\t\twife -- the one we don't talk about --\n\t\t\tand gets a hundred... okay, five letters\n\t\t\tfrom him, and then doesn't even leave\n\t\t\ta pass in San Diego.

He moves to the ice machine, with\n\ta glass of his own.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tMiss Penny Lane.  Let me tell you what\n\t\t\trock and Roll will miss the day you\n\t\t\ttruly retire.\n\n\tHe tosses cubes in his glass, one by one.  After the first cube:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tThe way you turn a hotel room into a\n\t\t\thome.\n\t\t\t\t(cube)\n\t\t\tThe way you pick up strays wherever\n\t\t\tyou go.

HALLWAY -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t42\n\n\tThe hallways are crowded, as William looks at the closed door\n\tof the ice room.  He leans against the wall, alone now.  Trying\n\tto look like he belongs.  Behind him, most of the band has\n\tdisappeared into other rooms, leaving only hangers-on in their\n\tplaces.\n\n\t43    INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY\t\t\t\t43\n\n\tMusic.  We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor.\n\tThese are the San Francisco-based main offices of Rolling Stone\n\tMagazine.  We have arrived for the waning days that this\n\tmagazine could still be called, with a straight-face, an\n\t\"underground\" publication.  Their mounting success crowds the\n\tedges of every frame.  Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz\n\tportraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon, Jagger, Rod Stewart,\n\tJames Taylor.\n\n\tWe find editor BEN FONG-TORRES, 29,  in his cramped cubicle.\n\tSitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff\n\twriter, DAVID FELTON, 32, who smokes his cigarettes with a long\n\tholder.  Felton reads one of William's articles, chuckling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEN FONG-TORRES\n\t\t\tWilliam Miller?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t INTERCUT:\n\n\tINT.

DEEGAN (cont'd)\n\t\t\tNow you are rather famously not a fan\n\t\t\tof rock music, but such are the ironies\n\t\t\tof life, that happens to be the very\n\t\t\ttopic of William's assignment -\n\t\t\t\t(cheerfully)\n\t\t\t- rock music.

William nods to Darryl, who reverentially\n\tdrops the needle with a thud.  Mom is trapped, as we listen to\n\tsilent static... and then... the opening notes of Led Zeppelin's\n\t\"Stairway to Heaven.\"  William gives his Mother the album\n\tcover's inner-sleeve with lyrics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWe ask you only to listen.\n\n\tCamera passes across their serious and expectant faces.

STILLWATER TOUR BUS -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t54\n\n\tAn empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle,\n\ttaking us to William.  William picks up the bottle and places\n\tit in the seat back pocket in front of him.  He has joined the\n\tcircus, and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and\n\tforbidding than he expected.  The bus struggles to make it up\n\tthe hill, back rows shuddering loudly, as music continues.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tC'mon, Doris!  Darling Bus.  You can\n\t\t\tmake it!\n\n\t55    EXT.

Music\n\tcontinues.\n\n\t56    INT. BUS - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 56\n\n\tWilliam strains for a look at Russell five rows up.  He plays\n\tslide guitar, working out a part.   Next to Russell is Penny\n\tLane.  Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash\n\t- takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tGotcha.\n\n\tJeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover.  Penny stuffs the\n\tshot in her pocket.  William watches, his private heart pounds.\n\tPolexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tDo you have any pot?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tNo.  I'm a journalist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tWell, go do your job then.  You're on\n\t\t\tthe road, man.  It's all happening!  Get\n\t\t\tin there.  Go talk to 'em!\n\n\tChallenged, William rises and approaches Russell.  He fixes\n\tthe charismatic guitarist in his sights. Shot takes him down\n\tthe aisle to the jamming star guitarist.  He crouches in the\n\taisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody.  His\n\tmood is in the air.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(very professional)\n\t\t\tRussell.   Do you think we might be\n\t\t\table to find some time to talk when we\n\t\t\tget to Phoenix?  I want to interview\n\t\t\teveryone separately... and I felt we'd\n\t\t\tstart with you and me.\n\n\tNearby, Jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tAbsolutely.\n\n\tRussell turns away.  The kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle,\n\tbabbling on.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tBecause I've got a thing in a couple\n\t\t\tdays.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWhat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(self-conscious)\n\t\t\tIt's a... thing where... uhm... you go\n\t\t\tthere to graduate.

It's a\n\tgood line.  William makes a quick jot in his notebook.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tNo no no.  Don't put that in Rolling\n\t\t\tStone.  My bio says I graduated.  We'll\n\t\t\tcome up with something better later.\n\t\t\tJust enjoy the ride.\n\n\tRussell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away.\n\tPenny notices William's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while\n\tgrabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLARRY\n\t\t\tHow did you know I was thirsty?\n\n\tHe didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is.  He nods\n\tthanks to Penny, the perfect road companion for all.  And then\n\tPenny gives the other Coke, her Coke, to William.  He accepts\n\tit too, and starts back to his seat.  He's been blown off, and\n\the knows it, but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and\n\twhispers in his ear:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tI may need to stay in your room tonight.\n\t\t\tRussell's in a bad mood.  He's very\n\t\t\tBob Dylan in Don't Look Back today.\n\t\t\tHe's trying to write.\n\n\tWilliam nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his\n\tseat.  A large joint passes in front of him, across him, to\n\tPolexia, as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another\n\thill.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(inhaling deeply)\n\t\t\tWant some?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tNo thanks.\n\n\tA wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face.  It\n\tsurrounds him like a cloud.   The bus shudders, as Russell\n\tcontinues playing slide up ahead.\n\n\t57    INT.

She feels\n\ther own loneliness, and his too, as she dials a phone number.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tHas William Miller arrived yet?  He\n\t\t\thasn't.  Could you give him a message\n\t\t\tas soon as you see him? -\n\n\t58    INT. BUS -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t58\n\n\tSeveral hours later on this ride.  Outside, night and desert.\n\tInside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness\n\tof the bus.  The end of the Led Zeppelin classic \"Whole Lotta\n\tLove\" plays from the bus stereo, full blast.  Everybody is\n\tfree and anonymous in the dark.  They sing at full-volume.\n\tWilliam looks out the window in wonder.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZEPPELIN/ALL\n\t\t\t\"Way down inside... (woman)\n\t\t\twoman...  you need... \"\n\n\tThe ten-ton guitar chord of Jimmy Page.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZEPPELIN/ALL (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\"Loooooooooooooooooooooooovvve... \"\n\n\tJohn Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still\n\tsinging as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix.  William\n\twatches the living documentary around him.  He writes furiously\n\tin the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady\n\this writing on the bumpy bus.  Behind him, someone is beating\n\talong to the song on his seat.  He never want to leave this world.\n\n\t59    INT. ARIZONA RAMADA INN LOBBY -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t59\n\n\tAll enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack.  The hotel chairs\n\tare spotted with curious hangers-on, decked out and lounging.\n\tDick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk.   The\n\tsad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick.  He\n\tis forever teaching others their jobs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tJeff, Tony... Keys... keys... keys...\n\t\t\troom list...\n\t\t\t\t(re: luggage, to hotel\n\t\t\tbellman)\n\t\t\tIf it doesn't have a number on it, it\n\t\t\tain't ours!\n\n\tHe gives key and a stack of messages to Russell, and turns to\n\tWilliam who he makes feel more important.  Penny is nearby with\n\ther suitcase and tackle box purse.  William watches Russell's\n\tguitars whisked away - they are luggage-numbered 1, 3, and 4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tThe Enemy!  Here you go, here's the key to\n\t\t\tyour palatial suite, room list, plus let me\n\t\t\tgive you a luggage tag.  You're Number 42.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t\tIs this Mr. Miller?  You have a message\n\t\t\tfrom Elaine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tThanks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t\t\t(confidentially)\n\t\t\tShe's a handful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI know.\n\n\tWilliam cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it,\n\tand tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen.\n\tJeff exchanges a look with Russell.  Nearby, the walking\n\tcommotion arrives, clacking through the lobby.  It's Sapphire.\n\tLast night's clothes are now today's.  She holds a travel case,\n\tand hanger with some odd blouses.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAPPHIRE\n\t\t\tFinally, you're here!!  They kicked me\n\t\t\tout of my room!  Fuck Ozzy!\n\n\tShe hugs Penny Lane.  Estrella appears, happy to have help\n\twith Sapphire.\n\n\tON RUSSELL\n\n\twho approaches William.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tCome by in a few minutes.  We'll do\n\t\t\tthe interview.\n\n\tThe kid exits and goes to join Penny, who is still comforting\n\tSapphire.  Russell looks through his messages.  The guitar,\n\tnow in a case, never leaves his hand.  Jeff Bebe approaches,\n\tregarding William standing with Penny and the girls.  Intrigue\n\tis swirling in the lobby.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tI'm worried, man.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tNaw, we can trust him.  He's a fan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tBut it's Rolling Stone.  He looks\n\t\t\tharmless, but he does represent the\n\t\t\tmagazine that trashed Eric Clapton,\n\t\t\tbroke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin,\n\t\t\tand wrote that lame story about the\n\t\t\tAllman Brothers Band that bummed Duane\n\t\t\tout before he died.  Don't forget the\n\t\t\tRules.  This little shit is the Enemy.\n\t\t\tHe writes what he sees.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tBut it would be cool to be on the cover.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tLeave it to me.  We'll get a good story.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tPlus our girlfriends read this magazine\n\t\t\tand -\n\t\t\t\t(looking at Band-aids)\n\t\t\t-- you know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tYou made your point.  I'll take to\n\t\t\thim.\n\n\tON WILLIAM BY ELEVATOR\n\n\tPenny speaks confidentially to him.  If she is slightly bossy,\n\tit is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and\n\totherwise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tCan Sapphire stay in your room tonight?\n\t\t\tShe had a big fight with Ozzy, and\n\t\t\tPolexia's not working out with Jeff\n\t\t\tBebe.\n\t\t\t\t(to Sapphire and Polexia)\n\t\t\tYou just have to remember... these\n\t\t\tguys are jealous, insecure, talented,\n\t\t\tegocentric, and manipulative geniuses...\n\t\t\tthey're lead-singers.   They can say\n\t\t\t\"I love you\" to 20,000 people... but\n\t\t\tany fewer is a real problem.\n\t\t\t\t(girls nod, comforted, she\n\t\t\tcontinues to the kid)\n\t\t\tJeff Bebe has so much jealousy over\n\t\t\tRussell that he can't express.  Plus,\n\t\t\the never slept last night.   You keep\n\t\t\tSapphire and I'll stay with Russell.\n\n\tWilliam covers his disappointment over losing Penny as a\n\troommate.  Cooly:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSure.  I'll take her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tMe too?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSure.\n\n\tEstrella arrives with travel bag, equally homeless, looking\n\thopeful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM (cont'd)\n\t\t\tIf there's room -\n\n\tPenny squeezes him.  He feels cool... but the girl he really\n\twanted to stay in his room now joins Russell, disappearing\n\tinto the elevator.  He looks down at the message in his hand,\n\tand opens it.\n\n\tIt reads: DON'T TAKE DRUGS!  He snaps it closed quickly, before\n\tanyone can see.\n\n\t59A   IN. RUSSELL's ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t59A\n\n\tRussell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap.\n\tTrying to write.  It's coming slowly.  Shot moves off him,\n\tpast a flickering television, onto Penny who silently and\n\tintently watches Russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird.\n\tHe looks over at her - she turns away quickly.  He goes back\n\tto work.  Tries to catch her watching him again.  She turns\n\taway just in time.\n\n\t60    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t60\n\n\tStillwater's \"Fever Dog\" plays from the t.v. radio.   William\n\ton the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap.  His hotel\n\troom.  He watches self-consciously as the girls go about the\n\tritual of inhabiting a room on the road.  Sapphire flutters a\n\tpaisley scarf over the room lamp.  Polexia puts a towel along\n\tthe crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too-\n\tmany sticks of incense, and moves to the phone.  Estrella has\n\tjoined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes.\n\tInstantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this,\n\tthe smallest room in the hotel.   William thumbs through the\n\tphone book with fascination.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tAll these people.\n\t\t\t\t(wondrous, off phone book)\n\t\t\tAnd they all live in Phoenix.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(on phone)\n\t\t\tHi Dad!!

Simon Kirke of Bad Company\n\t\t\tis by the pool.\n\n\tThe girls mobilize by the window.  William is increasingly\n\taware that he is an outsider in his own tiny room.  He tries\n\tto organize his stuff in the corner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\tI GOTTA GO!

PENNY AND RUSSELL'S ROOM - SAME TIME\t\t\t\t60A\n\n\tRussell puts down his guitar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tYou know.  We should talk about what\n\t\t\twe don't talk about.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tWe don't have to.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tNo, I - I went to Catholic school.

No\n\t\t\tboundaries.  Just the music.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tI'm just saying, it's okay to talk\n\t\t\tabout it.\n\n\tPenny stands and turns.  She speaks the word.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tLeslie.\n\n\tRussell nods.  The name is out in the open.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY (cont'd)\n\t\t\tLeslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.\n\t\t\tLeslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(somehow satisfied)\n\t\t\tAlright - now we're talking.\n\n\tBut she continues, saying the name in a multitude of different\n\tways, in different accents, and with different degrees of\n\tindifference and passion and lust and play-acting and mock-\n\tdrama.\n\n\tPUSH IN ON HIS FACE\n\n\tAs he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning.\n\tIs she mocking him?   In love with him?  Taunting him?  Seducing\n\thim?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tLeslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Lesssssslie.\n\t\t\tLeslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.\n\t\t\tLeslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.

Put down the\n\t\t\tphone, Polexia.\n\t\t\t\t(she does, sadly)\n\t\t\tFirst, this is my room...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAPPHIRE\n\t\t\tCome on, you're a fan like us.  You're\n\t\t\ton our side of the line.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSecond.  I'm not Opie.  Alright?  Opie\n\t\t\tis a little boy.  I'm here to do a\n\t\t\tjob.

In\n\t\t\ta minute, I have to go interview\n\t\t\tRussell.  Do not answer this phone if it\n\t\t\trings.  I have family members with\n\t\t\tsevere anxiety Problems.  She will not\n\t\t\tunderstand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPOLEXIA\n\t\t\t\t(wounded)\n\t\t\tBut what if Ozzy calls Sapphire?   And\n\t\t\tI gave Jimmy Page this number.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tOr a guy who looked like Jimmy Page.\n\n\tWilliam looks at their troubled faces, full of too much-longing\n\tand too much make-up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOkay.   I have a solution.  Answer the\n\t\t\tphone.  But if anyone without an English\n\t\t\taccent is on the phone...\n\t\t\t\t(winging it)\n\t\t\tJust hang up.  Or say it's the wrong\n\t\t\troom.\n\n\tThey nod.  It's a good plan.\n\n\t61    EXT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t 61\n\n\tThe hanging sign on the door reads: DO NOT DISTURB. William\n\tknocks on Russell's door. A maid pushes up against him with\n\ther cart, which now blocks the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSHOULD I COME BY LATER?\n\n\tA group of golf conventioneers are now trapped behind the maid\n\tcart.  They ease past William as he negotiates with Russell\n\tthrough the door.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (O.S.)\n\t\t\t YES, I'M IN TOO TRUTHFUL A MOOD!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tMAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING!!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (O.S.)\n\t\t\tI'LL SEE YOU AT THE RADIO INTERVIEW\n\t\t\tLATER!!  TEN-THIRTY IN THE LOBBY.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOKAY!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tGO AWAY!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOKAY!\n\n\tWe hear Penny's giggle.  Then the door opens, and it's Penny\n\tlooking ravishing.  In the background, Russell sits shirtless\n\tat the table.  He playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up\n\twads of hotel stationery.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tDon't worry.  Some to the radio\n\t\t\tinterview.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tNo, I'm fine.  I'll just interview\n\t\t\tJeff Bebe some more.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(as in \"you're on of us\")\n\t\t\tGO AWAY!\n\n\tShe shuts the door quickly.  It hurts a little.  He picks up\n\tthe wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket.  He\n\tleaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and\n\tmatches from the nearby maid's cart.  Then he returns to\n\tRussell's door.  He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds\n\tof laughter, just for a moment, escalating.  He flips the sign\n\tover: HOUSEKEEPING PLEASE ENTER - CLEAN ROOM.\n\n\t62    INT. OUTER RADIO STATION - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t62\n\n\tHumble Pie.  \"Thirty Days in the Hole.\"  Russell and band enter\n\tthe radio station, passing through the now-empty front office.\n\tAs always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good.\n\tStillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles,\n\tas they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold\n\trecords  and head down the small hallway to the control room\n\tinterview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her\n\tgreen coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a\n\tlittle stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will\n\thave none of it.  She privately shares every great passing\n\tmoment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms.\n\tIt's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own \"Fever Dog.\"\n\n\t63    INT. RADIO CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t63\n\n\tStillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone\n\tin this room.  Russell takes a seat near the open mike.  Jeff\n\tBebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be\n\tjust as close to the microphone as Russell.  William watches\n\tall as he sits at the dark back of this control booth.\n\tStillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE\n\tALLEN, 25.\n\n\tQuince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it.\n\tThe entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and\n\tready for the interview.   William can't avoid looking at Penny\n\tLane, who looks great tonight.  She catches him, and he barely\n\tlooks away in time.  Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff,\n\tnotices.  The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the\n\tmicrophone, as the finale of \"Fever Dog\" is just ending.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUINCE ALLEN\n\t\t\tThe guitar of Russell Hammond.   \"Fever\n\t\t\tDog\"...  The band is Stillwater.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tWatch with your mind as they\n\t\t\tmaterialize.\n\n\tBand members gets closer to the microphone, preparing to speak.\n\tQuince lowers his head, shutting his eyes and getting into the\n\tmusic as the song plays out.\n\n\t64    INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t64\n\n\tThe phone rings.  Estrella answers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tWilliam's room.\n\n\tINT. ROLLING STONE OFFICE -- NIGHT\n\n\tBen Fong-Torres is calling from Rolling Stone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\tCan I please speak to him?  This is\n\t\t\tBen Fong-Torres at Rolling Stone.\n\n\tEstrella panics,  hangs up quickly, as if the phone has just\n\tcaught fire.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tI think I just messed up!\n\n\t65    INT. RADIO STATION -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME\t\t\t\t65\n\n\tQuince raises his head and continues on-the-air.  The same\n\tsong is still ending.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUINCE\n\t\t\tLook at the dogs, wearing the funny\n\t\t\thats.  Juggling just for you.  Freaks\n\t\t\tand family...\n\n\tPenny shoots William a look.   Do you believe this guy?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUINCE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tIt's Quince, with Stillwater.  Here.\n\t\t\tLive.  It's the Night Circus.\n\n\tThe band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk.  Quince\n\tcontinues, looking meaningfully at the band.  They are\n\twaiting... eager for a chance to speak.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUINCE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tEvery minute a baby is born somewhere..\n\t\t\tLife.  Death.  Hermetically sealed\n\t\t\tbags of human emotion.  Bags of love...\n\t\t\tbags of kindness?\n\t\t\t\t(suddenly, turns)\n\t\t\tHow'd you get together?\n\n\tAs Jeff eagerly speaks, Quince lowers his head and listens...\n\tfeels... the words of his guests.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tWell... not to get into a \"me\" thing...\n\t\t\tthis is Jeff talking... but I did start\n\t\t\tthe band, some time, actually, ago.\n\t\t\tThis is back when we were the Jeff\n\t\t\tBebe band, and I placed an ad in a\n\t\t\tmagazine called Peaches looking for a\n\t\t\tguitarist and Russell Hammond answered.\n\n\tQuince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUINCE\n\t\t\t\t(with deep understanding)\n\t\t\tPeaches.\n\n\tJeff watches Quince's head lower.  It's hard to know when to\n\ttalk with Quince.  The depth of his mellowness is tough to get\n\tin rhythm with.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tI think he was a gift from God,\n\t\t\tactually.  Nobody plays like Russell\n\t\t\tHammond.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(sorta moved)\n\t\t\tWell, shit.  Thank you.\n\n\tHe instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tOoops.  Better hit the delay button.\n\n\tAll eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to\n\tsome inner beat.  He says nothing.  The band looks at each\n\tother.  We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be\n\tasleep.  Long silence.  William shares an amazed look with\n\tPenny.  Quince is definitely asleep.  Russell leans forward\n\tand continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tOkay - we're talking now, right?  Why\n\t\t\tthe fuck do you wait until and interview\n\t\t\tin Arizona to say something nice about\n\t\t\tme.  Why don't you say it to my fucking\n\t\t\tface sometime?  Because I tell you\n\t\t\tevery time I think you nailed something.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tEverybody pays you compliments.  It's\n\t\t\tnot my fucking job to kiss your fucking\n\t\t\tass all the time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWell then who's fucking job is it?\n\t\t\tBecause my ass is dying for a kiss.\n\t\t\tAnd I know yours is too.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tIt's my fucking job.  You're all\n\t\t\tgeniuses.  And let me just add this\n\t\t\tthought - smegma.\n\n\tPenny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to William.\n\tHe offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room.\n\tWilliam shares a look.  Quince is still deeply asleep, as the\n\tusually quiet tony leans forward to speak.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTONY\n\t\t\tFeces.\n\n\tHe cracks himself up, silently.

It's Quince, with\n\t\t\tStillwater.\n\n\t\"Love Thing\" takes over, as Quince swivels in the chair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tQUINCE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI thought that went well.\n\n\t66    INT. RENTAL CAR -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t 66\n\n\tAdrenalized laughter.  The whole band is crammed into a medium-\n\tsized rental car.  Penny half on William's lap, half on\n\tRussell's.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(to William)\n\t\t\tSee, this is what nobody writes about!\n\t\t\tThe in-between times!   This!  Us!\n\t\t\tRight now!!\n\n\t67    INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM\t\t\t\t\t\t67\n\n\tThe phone is ringing.  Estrella emerges from the bathroom with\n\tno make-up and a t-shirt.  She picks up the phone.  Across the\n\troom, Sapphire signs for room service.  Now she is far too\n\tmade-up.  The t.v. radio plays Free's \"Fire and Water\" in the\n\tb.g.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\t\t(suspiciously)\n\t\t\tHello?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t INTERCUT:\n\n\tINT.

I think he's in the\n\t\t\tbar with the Band.  They just got back\n\t\t\tfrom the radio station.  Is this Maryann\n\t\t\twith the pot?\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tHello?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tNo this isn't Maryann with the pot.\n\t\t\tThis is Elaine... his Mother.\n\n\tEstrella physically recoils.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\t\t(cringing)\n\t\t\tI thought you were English.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tCould you please give him a message?\n\t\t\tCould you tell him to call home\n\t\t\timmediately?  And could you also tell\n\t\t\thim -\n\t\t\t\t(at full power)\n\t\t\tI know what's going on.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tAlright.  Okay.  But I'm just going to\n\t\t\tsay this, and I'm going to stand by\n\t\t\tit.\n\t\t\t\t(can't help herself)\n\t\t\tYou should be really proud of him.\n\t\t\t'Cause I know guys... and I'll bet you\n\t\t\tdo too.  And he respects women, and he\n\t\t\tlikes women, and let's just pause and\n\t\t\tappreciate a man like that.   You\n\t\t\tcreated him out of thin air, and you\n\t\t\traised him right, and we're all looking\n\t\t\tout for him.  And that's more than\n\t\t\tI've ever said to my own parents, so\n\t\t\tthere you go.\n\t\t\t\t(silence)\n\t\t\tThis is the maid speaking, by the way.\n\n\t68    INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t68\n\n\tRussell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in\n\tthe hotel lobby.  William shuffles through many pages of\n\tquestions written in small script.  His tape recorder microphone\n\tsits balanced on the chair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(very professional)\n\t\t\tNow that you're starting to be\n\t\t\tsuccessful, you had twenty-six years\n\t\t\tto write your first Album... and you'll\n\t\t\thave maybe four months for the second.\n\t\t\tDo you worry that the pressure of the\n\t\t\tbusiness will get in the way of the\n\t\t\toriginal joy of making your music?  Or\n\t\t\t-\n\n\tRussell blinks.  The all-consuming issues of his life are right\n\tin front of him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWhoa!\n\t\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\t\tI need three more beers and my guitar\n\t\t\tbefore I can answer that question.\n\t\t\tLet's take a walk.\n\n\t69    EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t69\n\n\tRussell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William.\n\tWilliam follows him through the sliding glass door to his room,\n\tfacing the pool.  Russell grabs his guitar.  They stand for a\n\tmoment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait\n\ttwenty yards in front of them.  The off-limits after-hours\n\tpool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members.\n\tJeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby.  Dick laughs at a joke.\n\tAlways the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels\n\tfrom a maid cart.  And she is the first to slip into the pool\n\tfor some after-hours, against-the-rules swimming.  Effortlessly,\n\tshe turns a collection of people into a party.  They regard\n\ther, well out of earshot of the others.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tFor a minute I thought you were actually\n\t\t\ta real journalist... which is... you\n\t\t\tknow, it's great.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tShut that thing off, and I'll tell you\n\t\t\tthe truth.\n\n\tWilliam shuts his tape recorder off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tIt's off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tLook.  I trust you.  I'm going to lay\n\t\t\tthis right on you.  Just make us look\n\t\t\tcool.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI will quote you warmly and accurately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThat's what I'm worried about.  See -\n\t\t\tsome of us have girlfriends back home.\n\t\t\tSome of us have wives.  And... some of\n\t\t\tthe people you meet on the road are\n\t\t\treally amazing people...\n\n\tThey both watch Penny Lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool.\n\tShe places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting\n\tall, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tLike you.  And some of the things that\n\t\t\thappen are good for just a few people\n\t\t\tto know about - as opposed to, say, a\n\t\t\tmillion people.\n\n\tDawn is breaking for William.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOhhhh.  Oh.  Yeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tYou know what I mean?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tRight.  Yeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tSee, you're dangerous.  Most people\n\t\t\tare just waiting to talk, but you\n\t\t\tlisten.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tRight.  Right.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tSo your question you asked me.  I think\n\t\t\tabout It every fucking night.  The\n\t\t\t\"business.\"  I hate it!\n\t\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\t\tI grew up with these guys, okay?  I\n\t\t\tcan't play all that I can play, I'm\n\t\t\tpast these musicians, do you understand?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI do.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThe more popular we get, the more I\n\t\t\tcan't walk on them, the bigger their\n\t\t\thouses get, the more pressure... you\n\t\t\tforget, man.  You forget what it was\n\t\t\tlike to be real, to be a fan.  You can\n\t\t\thear it in a lot of bands who've been\n\t\t\tsuccessful - it doesn't sound like\n\t\t\tmusic anymore.  It sounds like...\n\t\t\tlike lifestyle maintenance.\n\t\t\t\t(suddenly confessional)\n\t\t\tI used to be able to hear the sounds\n\t\t\tof the world.  Everything, to me, used\n\t\t\tto sound like music.  Everything.  Now\n\t\t\tI don't hear it.   You know what I'm\n\t\t\ttrying to say?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(ruefully)\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tMan, it feels good to say this stuff\n\t\t\tout loud.  But what am I doing?  I'm\n\t\t\ttelling secrets to the one guy you\n\t\t\tdon't tell secrets to.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(feeling included)\n\t\t\tNo, that's okay.  We'll do the interview\n\t\t\ttomorrow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThis is good.  So there's the \"friend\"\n\t\t\tand then there's the \"interview guy.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tSo tonight it's \"friend\".... and when\n\t\t\twe wake up tomorrow - \"interview guy.\"\n\t\t\tWe'll figure it out as we go, buddy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tHey - for whatever it's worth - you\n\t\t\tguys are really good.\n\n\tRussell laughs at the kid's easy naivete.  He hands his guitar\n\tto the kid, and joins the party.  William watches, part of the\n\tcrowd... somehow feeling a little compromised.  He doesn't\n\tcare.  Penny gestures for him to join them.\n\n\t70    EXT. SUN STADIUM - AFTERNOON\t\t\t\t\t70\n\n\tWilliam interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena.  On\n\tstage, Ed soundchecks his drums.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tHow would you describe your role in\n\t\t\tStillwater?  What is the chemical that\n\t\t\tyou add to the chemistry?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLARRY\n\t\t\tI'm the bass-player.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(pressing for some poetry)\n\t\t\tRight.  And when you take that away...\n\t\t\twhat would be missing?  Stylistically?\n\t\t\tWhat chemical?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLARRY\n\t\t\t\t(not getting it)\n\t\t\tThe bass?\n\n\tLarry doesn't give him much.\n\n\t71    EXT. SUN STADIUM - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t 71\n\n\tIt's raining.  The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part\n\tof them.  Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look.  She takes the scarf\n\tfrom around his neck and ties it around his leg.  He looks\n\tinstantly better.  William watches in the darkness as Dick\n\ttakes the microphone.  The best part of his day has arrived.\n\tIn his important voice:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tGood evening Phoenix.\n\t\t\t\t(applause)\n\t\t\tFrom Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome,\n\t\t\tStillwater.\n\n\tLights come up, as the band launches into \"Fever Dog.\"   Jeff\n\tbegins singing.  Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for\n\ta back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected.\n\n\tA sharp electrical shock.\n\n\tIt's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a\n\tmoment something is clearly wrong.  Russell holds onto the\n\tmicrophone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage\n\tfor two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal.  His\n\tface is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage,\n\tcollapsing a couple steps later.\n\n\t72    EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t72\n\n\tDick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has\n\tbeen pulled up into the backstage area.   He guides a sagging\n\tRussell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tGet in, get in!!\n\n\tWilliam boards the bus, as the extremely agitated PROMOTER\n\tarrives to confront Dick.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t\tAre you the manager of this band?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tThat, and more.  Get in!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t\tYou didn't even play a full set!\n\n\tDick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing\n\twith the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tYour shoddy stage set-up almost killed\n\t\t\tour guitarist!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t\tYou trashed the dressing room - you\n\t\t\tdidn't play your thirty-five minutes.\n\t\t\tYou didn't fulfill your contract -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tEverybody in!  Get in the bus!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t\tI'll report you to every promoter in\n\t\t\tthe country!  I'm gonna talk to Frank\n\t\t\tBarcelona!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tYOU DON'T FUCK WITH MY BAND'S SAFETY!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t\tI hope you have a good lawyer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tI AM A LAWYER!\n\n\tHe swings into the bus, as the bus revs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t\tLOCK THE GATE ON 'EM!\n\n\t73    INT. BUS -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t73\n\n\tRussell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus.  He\n\texamines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the\n\tpositivity of her words.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tDon't worry.  It's happened to all the\n\t\t\tgreats.  Thank God you didn't hold the\n\t\t\tmike stand with both hands, you'd still\n\t\t\tbe holding it.  This is a good thing.\n\t\t\tIt's a good, good, good thing.\n\n\tWilliam sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye-\n\tsight of others.  The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes\n\tto see that he's writing in his notebook.\n\n\tDick swings into the seat across from Russell.  The bus door\n\tshuts, as the promoter is still yelling.\n\n\tDoris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running\n\talongside.  She knocks on the window next to William.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tESTRELLA\n\t\t\tI forgot to tell you!  Your mom says\n\t\t\tto call home immediately.  She says\n\t\t\tshe knows what's going on!\n\t\t\t\t(receding)\n\t\t\tSee you guys in Topeka!  I'll catch a\n\t\t\tride with Sabbath!\n\n\tWilliam nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races\n\ttoward the now closing gate.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\t\t(casually, to Russell)\n\t\t\tWanna buy a gate?\n\n\tBefore Russell can answer - BASH.  Doris barrels through the\n\tsteel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside\n\tthis bus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tYou just bought a gate.\n\t\t\t\t(to the bus)\n\t\t\tC'mon Doris!!  Get us out of town!!\n\n\tThe bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for\n\tDoris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a\n\tthoroughfare.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWhat did it feel like to be\n\t\t\telectrocuted?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tIt burns.  It feels like a dose of\n\t\t\tlead shooting through your body... and\n\t\t\tthen you see God, and he says, \"How\n\t\t\tbad do you want to be legendary?\" And\n\t\t\tgod damnit.  I let go.\n\t\t\t\t(shaky grin as all laugh\n\t\t\twarmly)\n\t\t\tRock and roll.\n\n\tJeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy.  The kid\n\tscribbles in his notebook.  We hear Led Zeppelin's \"That's the\n\tWay.\"\n\n\t74    INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING\t\t\t\t\t\t74\n\n\tSong continues.  Almost everybody is asleep.  William takes\n\tthe camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny.  She wakes\n\tup.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tGive that to me.\n\n\tShe grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight.  He grabs some\n\tother Polaroids from her pocket.  He hustles to the back of\n\tthe bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the\n\tpassing landscapes.  She chases him down the aisle.  Music\n\tcontinues as she sits down next to him.  Out the window, a\n\tlong-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus\n\tfor a bit.  They wave.  Penny watches them over sunglasses,\n\twaves briefly to the real world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(breathing heavy, owning\n\t\t\tthe world)\n\t\t\tWhen we go to Morocco, I think we should\n\t\t\twear completely different clothes, and\n\t\t\tbe completely different people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWhat will our names be?\n\n\tShe snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets\n\tthe Polaroid.  She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping.\n\tHer attention has already wandered from Morocco.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tWhat do you think of Russell?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI like him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tYou're coming to Cleveland, right?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tCleveland, Ohio?  Oh no no no.  I gotta\n\t\t\tget my interview with Russell before\n\t\t\tGreenville.  And you've got to help\n\t\t\tme.  Okay?  Friends... remember?\n\n\tPenny is still watching Russell.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tYou should give him a break.  There\n\t\t\tare real problems in the band.   Off\n\t\t\tthe record.\n\n\tGravely noting the word \"problems\", the kid joins Penny in\n\twatching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping\n\trestlessly up ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWhat problems?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tOkay.  I got it.  I think your name\n\t\t\tshould be Spencer, and mine will be\n\t\t\tJane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI can't keep up with you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tNo one can.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWhat's your real name?\n\n\tShe looks at him briefly.  She puts her arm around him.  It's\n\tintoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act.  With her\n\tfree hand, she gestures with a hanger.  As they regard Russell\n\tsleeping nearby:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tHere's the thing about Russell.  He's\n\t\t\tmy last project.  I only do this for a\n\t\t\tvery few people.  And I think we should\n\t\t\tdo it together - he is almost great.\n\t\t\tWe've got to take him there.  You and\n\t\t\tme - we can do it.  Deal?  Because the\n\t\t\tother guys are good - but he could be\n\t\t\tgreat.  He's my last project.\n\n\tHe looks at her.  She imitates his face back to him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY (cont'd)\n\t\t\tIt's all happening.\n\n\t75    INT. TOPEKA ARENA BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t75\n\n\tWilliam sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWhat do you love about music?\n\n\tEd looks at him thoughtfully.  It is an eloquent moment.  He\n\tthinks.  He shrugs.  The kid tumbles with more questions.\n\tThese interviews are not going well.\n\n\t76    INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t76\n\n\tWilliam, looking concerned over the state of his interviews,\n\twalks into the backstage bathroom.  He makes a few surreptitious\n\tnotes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing\n\tthere, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered\n\tby a Local Hanger-On.  Seeing the kid, he immediately hides\n\tthe coke spoon.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tHey.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tHey.\n\n\tWilliam pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal,\n\tand shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little\n\tworried.\n\n\t77    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t77\n\n\tWilliam is on the pay phone with his Mother.  The show booms\n\tin the background.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI know.  I know.

Then Greenville.\n\t\t\tThen home.\n\n\tHe winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a\n\tmoment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI'm sorry I didn't call yesterday!\n\t\t\tIt's not like you can just carry a\n\t\t\tphone around with you.\n\n\t80    INT. ELAINE'S SCHOOL OFFICE -- AFTERNOON\t\t\t\t80\n\n\tMom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home\n\t- a fortress in which she is surrounded by books.  The sun is\n\tgoing down.  She can't resist a sentimental moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tI guess I just miss you, and I don't\n\t\t\tunderstand why I've driven both my\n\t\t\tkids so far away from me.  By all\n\t\t\tpractical rules don't I get you for\n\t\t\tthree more years?\n\n\tHe is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever,\n\tas music continues in b.g.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWas I not fun?\n\n\t81    INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t81\n\n\tWilliam has his finger in his ear.  The din if Stillwater's\n\tset now blots out all other noise.  It is not the time to answer\n\tthis question.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI missed the last thing you said.\n\n\tMom takes a pause.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tI LOVE YOU.\n\n\tPenny now enters, watching.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWHAT?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\t\t(angry, louder)\n\t\t\tI MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU!\n\n\tWilliam now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad\n\tfrom a paper dish.  Looking at her, he lets loose with what he\n\tbelieves is a private confession.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI LOVE YOU!!\n\n\tPenny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another\n\tbackstage pass, and turns away.  Camera stays on William.  He\n\tis suddenly and deeply embarrassed.  He's just told her that\n\the loves her and she knows it.  He hangs up, traumatized.\n\n\t82    INT. TOPEKA DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t82\n\n\tRussell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished.\n\tHe is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders.   Luggage\n\tfor the next city is stacked by the door.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tFire away.  I'm ready.  I'm on the\n\t\t\t\"You\" Train.  Take me there.\n\n\tThe kid plugs in his microphone.  Russell listens as he springs\n\this first question.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tDo you have to be depressed to write a\n\t\t\tsad song?  Do you have to be in love\n\t\t\tto write a love song?  Is a song better\n\t\t\tif it really happened to you?  Like,\n\t\t\t\"If You Say Nothing\"... where did you\n\t\t\twrite that and how did it come about?\n\n\tRussell admires the many questions.  Says nothing.  He looks\n\tat his hand, thinks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWhen did you get so professional?\n\n\tIn the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt.\n\tGrinning, she cuffs his shoulder.  To the shirtless silent\n\tdrummer, waiting for his shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tI'm almost done with my shirt.\n\n\tEd watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber\n\tpad.  Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap.  In\n\tthe corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being\n\tunderappreciated.  And now Dick enters with a large cardboard\n\tbox.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tRussell, your dad showed up again.\n\t\t\tAnd on a lighter note.\n\t\t\t\t(importantly)\n\t\t\tGentlemen.  Your first t-shirts have\n\t\t\tarrived.\n\n\tThere is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the\n\tbox filled with new white t-shirts.  He untangles the first fresh\n\tshirt, and displays it proudly.  A silent beat as all examine it -\n\ttheir first t-shirt.  Faces fall.  Ed stops drumming.  There has\n\tbeen a mistake.  It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name\n\temblazoned below.  Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored-\n\tin and emphasized on the shirt.  He turns away, making a noise.\n\tJeff stares at the t-shirt.  He's just about in tears.  There is\n\ta long silence and then... Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tIt's the record company's mistake.\n\t\t\tAnd they will pay.  Shirts gone, band\n\t\t\thappy.\n\n\tHe drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were\n\tcontaminated, and exits with the box.  William watches as the\n\ttwo men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room.\n\tRussell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff.  The vibe is thick.\n\tRussel turns to see Jeff staring at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tCan we just skip the vibe and go\n\t\t\tstraight to us laughing about this?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\t\t(bitterly)\n\t\t\tYeah.  Okay.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(trying for a joke)\n\t\t\tBecause I can see by your face - you\n\t\t\twant to get into this -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tHow can you tell?  I'm just one of the\n\t\t\tout-of-focus guys.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tHere we go.\n\n\tWilliam watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tHere.  Take it.  You LOVE this shirt -\n\t\t\tit lets you say everything you want to\n\t\t\tsay.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tWell, it speaks pretty loudly to me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tIt's a t-shirt.\n\n\tRussell turns away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tI'm always gonna tell you the truth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tAre you doing coke again?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tOh yeah.  All the time.\n\n\tThe kid looks down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF (cont'd)\n\t\t\tThis is big stuff, man.  From the very\n\t\t\tbeginning -- we said -- I'm the front\n\t\t\tman and you're the guitarist with\n\t\t\tmystique.  That's the dynamic we agreed\n\t\t\ton -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith.  But\n\t\t\tsomehow it's all turning around.  We\n\t\t\thave got to control what's happening\n\t\t\tto us.  There's a responsibility here -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tExcuse me, but didn't we all get into\n\t\t\tthis to avoid responsibility?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tForgive me.\n\t\t\t\t(continuing, on shirt)\n\t\t\tBut this is the slow-moving train of\n\t\t\tcompromise that will kill us.\n\n\tRussell makes a disgusted noise.  Penny Lane exits discreetly,\n\tlooking back at William.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI can't say anymore with a writer here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tYou can trust him,  you can say whatever\n\t\t\tyou want.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\t\t(eyes suddenly moist)\n\t\t\tI works as hard or harder than anybody\n\t\t\ton that stage.  You know what I do - I\n\t\t\tconnect.  I get people off.  I look\n\t\t\tfor the guy who isn't getting off, and\n\t\t\tI make him get off.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tActually, that you can print.\n\t\t\t\t(continues to Russell)\n\t\t\tAnd yet, why do I always end up feeling\n\t\t\tlike I'm a joke to you?  I feel nothing\n\t\t\tbut love for you.  We're a family.\n\n\tHe looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry.  Embarrassed, he\n\tgrows angrier.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF (cont'd)\n\t\t\tYou want to pretend this isn't going\n\t\t\tto be a very big band.  Well it is.  You\n\t\t\tcall yourself a leader of this band, but\n\t\t\tyour direction allowed the t-shirt, when\n\t\t\tyou allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause\n\t\t\the's your friend... don't you see?  The\n\t\t\tt-shirt is everything.  It's everything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tIs it my turn?  Because I think we\n\t\t\tshould, for once, say what we really\n\t\t\tmean.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tOh, this is the part where you quit -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(stiffening)\n\t\t\tRight.  I'm so predictable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tNo  I gotta tell the truth -- I want\n\t\t\tyou to like me.  But sometimes I feel\n\t\t\tlike you collect people who love you\n\t\t\tand then very skillfully... you make\n\t\t\tthem feel bad that they're not good\n\t\t\tenough for you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tStick to singing, brother, 'cause you\n\t\t\tain't gonna make it as a shrink.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tDeal with it!  And let me just say\n\t\t\twhat nobody Else wants to say to you -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tYour looks have become a problem.\n\n\t82A   EXT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t 82A\n\n\tRussell walks swiftly past a happy silver-haired man, who holds\n\tcourt with beer in hand.  He dresses too young for his age,\n\tlate fifties.

The two men walk in long silent strides in the cold night\n\tair, beyond the backstage area.  Fans begin to recognize and\n\tfollow at a discreet distance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYou okay?  You alright?\n\n\tRussell doesn't answer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(resolute, wound up)\n\t\t\tFrom here on out, I'm only interested\n\t\t\tin what's real.\n\n\tThe kid nods.

Really\n\t\t\tgood.\n\n\tRussel now sees some hero worship in the kid's face, and it\n\tmakes him nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM (cont'd)\n\t\t\tHey, man, maybe we should go back.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tIf they want me, they can find me.\n\n\tWilliam turns and sees nobody following but fans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSo listen.  I have to go home tomorrow.\n\t\t\tI know this is a bad time to finish\n\t\t\tour interview.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tHey, man, you know what?  Write whatever\n\t\t\tyou want.

The kid behind the wheel unknowingly says the magic\n\twords.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCONCERT-GOER (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWe're just real Topeka people, man.\n\n\tHe has said the magic word.\n\n\tA84   EXT.

A joint goes\n\tby, headed for Russell.  William intercepts it and passes it\n\ton.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAaron?  Where's your bathroom?  I want\n\t\t\tto live here.

William stands guard.  With a\n\tfinger outstretched from each hand, he lectures the fans massing\n\tin the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tPlease don't give him any more acid.\n\n\t86    INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER\t\t\t86\n\n\tWilliam watches as a wobbly Russell Hammond, in sunglasses\n\tnow, goes through Aaron's record collection.

He's your Guardian Angel.\n\n\tRussell turns away.  William shrugs with style, but his\n\tlingering look is filled with hurt.  Dick guides Russell to\n\tthe door, grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as\n\tthey move.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tDon't worry.

You saved the tour.   That's\n\t\t\tgood enough for now.\n\n\tFrustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of\n\tRussell's wet clothes. William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes\n\tand smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the\n\tpartygoer who also wears his belt.  They move to the door in a\n\tpack.  We hear the beginning of Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer.\"\n\tDick faces the crowd and addresses them in his \"important\"\n\tstage voice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tLadies and Gentlemen, the evening is\n\t\t\tover!

Russell sits up\n\tfront, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent.   The others\n\thave given him a wide berth.  He feels silly, and they know\n\tit, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel\n\tfoolish.  He sits silently.  William watches him from four\n\trows back, next to Penny.  She kisses the top of his forehead,\n\ta hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins.  There is\n\tonly more silence.  Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or\n\ttwo, fighting the quiet and singing along.  Then others...\n\twaking up... joining in.  Then Jeff.  Russell hears them and\n\tstarts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around.\n\tIt's a voice everyone wants to hear.  Like it or not, this is\n\this family.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\tFADE IN:\n\n\t93    EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t93\n\n\tPassing signs announce Greenville, North Carolina.\n\n\t94    INT.

The orange bag\n\tstrapped over his shoulder, he lugs a huge bag of laundry.  He\n\tconsults room list.  A variety of noises and smells drift from\n\tthe band rooms.  He sees Room Service arrive at Dick's door,\n\tand it's Estrella who opens the door.  (Dick in the\n\tbackground.)  She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning --\n\tas the door shuts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tHoudini... Houdini...\n\n\tHe arrives at Russell's door.  Two exclamation points have\n\tbeen Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign\n\tis gaffer-taped to his door.  He looks through the crack, at\n\tthe bottom of the door.  Carefully and politely, he knocks.\n\tInstantly:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (O.S.)\n\t\t\tGO AWAY!\n\n\tPissed, the kid flips off the door.  He sits down on a chair\n\tdirectly across from the room.  Push in on William, who is\n\tmore pent-up than ever.  He tries hard not to cry, taking\n\tgulps of air as a maid cart swishes past, revealing... he's\n\tfailed.  He cries.\n\n\tFADE UP FROM DARKNESS\n\n\tA super-energized Russell Hammond looks into William's sleepy\n\tface.  William's eyes open.  His own sleepy face is evident in\n\tRussell's sunglasses.

He moves down the aisle... to the seats near the\n\tfront.  A sleeping Russell sits upright, hugging his guitar.\n\tPenny asleep next to him, Polaroid in her hand of... Russell\n\tsleeping.

Here, in\n\tthe middle of the midwest, is an explosive rock mecca, just as\n\tpromised.   The feeling of belonging invades all those in this\n\tlobby.

Russell turns to William before taking the stage:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tYour Mom kind of freaked me out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tShe means well.\n\n\tStill rattled, he takes the stage.  We see the unbridled\n\tenthusiasm of the faces on the front row.  A wave of cigarette\n\tlighters stretch out before them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\t\t(importantly)\n\t\t\tFrom Troy, Michigan...\n\n\tRussell thwacks a couple chords.  Audience thunders.  He turns\n\tto other members, feeling chills.  It's in these moments that\n\teverything else disappears.  They bow and wave, still in\n\tdarkness... each member seems to have his own fans.  Dick lets\n\tall this play out before finally adding...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWould you please welcome to Cleveland...\n\n\tMore applause.  This is very very very very fun.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tStillwater.\n\n\tLights come up.  A full blast of audience love hits them right\n\tin the face, as they begin \"Fever Dog.\"  The band charges\n\theadlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out\n\tof the crowd and onto the stage.\n\n\tHANDHELD ON RUSSELL\n\n\tWho is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his\n\tguitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back\n\tinto the crowd.  He slips back under the strap, laughing.\n\tMore stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and\n\tRussell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over\n\tto Russell to lean on him.  Russell turns to share the moment\n\twith Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the\n\tstage.\n\n\t112   INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t112\n\n\tWilliam in the dressing room, eyes red with exhaustion, finally\n\tinterviewing Russell.  He holds the mike stoically.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tSo when you play a great show like\n\t\t\ttonight...\n\n\tDick enters with great urgency.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tOkay.  I need everybody's attention.\n\n\tThe kid shuts his eyes.  He knew this would happen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAlright, well, the rumors are true.\n\t\t\tThe record company has sent a big-time\n\t\t\tmanager here to try and talk you into\n\t\t\treplacing me.  His name is Dennis Hope.\n\t\t\tI know you've all heard of him.  He's\n\t\t\tgot all the big bands.  He's right\n\t\t\toutside.  He wants five minutes with\n\t\t\tyou right now.  I think we gotta do\n\t\t\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(pissed)\n\t\t\tThen bring him in.\n\n\tWilliam shuts off his tape recorder.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\t\t(arrogant)\n\t\t\tBring him in!  We'll send him out on a\n\t\t\trail!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(to William)\n\t\t\tWe'll finish on the way to Boston.\n\t\t\tYou can fly home from Boston.\n\n\tWilliam nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door.  In walks a\n\tsmall general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed\n\tbeard and bowl cut.  He holds the super-new Halliburton\n\tbriefcase.  He is DENNIS HOPE, 25.  A man from the midwest,\n\twith a vision of the future of rock and roll.  Already in his\n\thead are all the things that will come to pass.  Higher ticket\n\tprices.  Merchandising deals.  Greater distribution and\n\taccounting of album sales.  He shrugs hello to the band.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\t\t(completely unthreatening)\n\t\t\tHi.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWe already have a manager.  He's been\n\t\t\twith us from the beginning.\n\n\tHope appreciates the lack of small talk.  He strides the room\n\twith the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort.\n\tRussell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\tRespectfully.  We all have our roots.\n\t\t\tI believe in bands holding onto their\n\t\t\troots.  But those roots need to be\n\t\t\taugmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth\n\t\t\t- I may enrage some and enthrall others.\n\t\t\tI don't really give a fuck.   Your\n\t\t\tmanager here needs a manager.  Example.\n\t\t\tIf you hadn't run out on the contract in\n\t\t\tPhoenix, you could have sued over\n\t\t\tRussell's hand... but you left, negating\n\t\t\tthe contract, forfeiting the deposit,\n\t\t\tand you effectively traveled a long\n\t\t\tway to pay that promoter... to\n\t\t\telectrocute you.\n\n\tRussell looks at his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWe can all work together.  Your damages\n\t\t\thave put you way into the hole for\n\t\t\tthis tour.  Right now you owe the record\n\t\t\tcompany more than you've got.  But\n\t\t\tyour record's selling, there's money\n\t\t\tto be made.  So I've brought a plane\n\t\t\tin, we can add more shows to make-up\n\t\t\tthe difference.   Respectfully.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(immediately)\n\t\t\tWe travel by bus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tDoris is the soul of this band!  That\n\t\t\tbus has been our home since we were\n\t\t\tthe Jeff Bebe Band.\n\n\tDick watches his loyal band with admiration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS\n\t\t\tHey man -- it's travel on a pogo stick\n\t\t\tif I thought we'd make more money.\n\t\t\tYou can play more dates with a plane...\n\n\t112A  INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT - SAME TIME\t\t\t\t112A\n\n\tPenny Lane stands on stage facing the empty arena.  The roadies\n\thave packed up and moved on. She is alone in the poetic and\n\ttrash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with\n\tpeople.  (Behavior to come)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t INTERCUT WITH:\n\n\t112B  INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t112B\n\n\tThe band meeting continues.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\t\t(passionate)\n\t\t\tHey man, it's not about the money!  It's\n\t\t\tabout Playing music, and turning people\n\t\t\ton!\n\n\tThe band agrees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\t\t(delicately)\n\t\t\tYes, of course.  Clearly.\n\t\t\tRespectfully.   But on the distasteful\n\t\t\tsubject of money.  Just know.  You're\n\t\t\tmaking it -- right now -- and it's all --\n\n\tHe gestures to infinity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t-- out there.  I'm just talking about\n\t\t\tbringing it --\n\n\tBringing his hand together in a fist, he returns it, close to\n\this heart.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t-- back here.\n\n\tThe band looks at Dick, who manages not to be speechless.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tBut why should we pay you for something\n\t\t\twe can do ourselves?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\t\t(immediately)\n\t\t\tDo you know how to keep from getting\n\t\t\tcharged for the ice below the\n\t\t\tfloorboards of Chicago Stadium?\n\t\t\tDo you know how to do a headlining\n\t\t\ttour, do you Claire Rothman at the\n\t\t\tL.A. Forum?  Do you know Bobbi Cowan,\n\t\t\tLisa Robinson, Jim Ladd, Frank\n\t\t\tBarcelona?\n\t\t\t\t(look around, amazed)\n\t\t\tThis is Cleveland. Where's Kid Leo??\n\t\t\t\t(basics)\n\t\t\tDo you know how you get a record not\n\t\t\tpressed but played?  Do you know?  I\n\t\t\tdidn't invent the rainy day, man.  I\n\t\t\tjust own the best umbrella.\n\n\tHe laughs.  It's fun.  Band members are now listening, curiously\n\tspellbound.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tBecause as much as you may believe that\n\t\t\tit will last forever, it does not last\n\t\t\tforever... your biggest fan right now\n\t\t\tsoon they're going to go to college,\n\t\t\tgonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money\n\t\t\tsome other way, and you know what?\n\t\t\t\t(the final insult)\n\t\t\tThey'll tape your record from a friend's\n\t\t\tcopy.\n\n\tRussell stops fingering his guitar.  Shot moves across the\n\tfaces of the band members.  Pain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tYou've got to take what you can, when you\n\t\t\tcan, while you can.  And you've got to do\n\t\t\tit now.  That's what the big boys do.\n\n\tThe band squirms, but listens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tBecause if you think Mick Jagger will\n\t\t\tstill be out there trying to be a rock\n\t\t\tstar at age fifty, you're sadly sadly\n\t\t\tmistaken.\n\n\tNow he's reaching them.  Their slackened roar-weary faces stare\n\tback at the young dynamo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\t\t(flustered)\n\t\t\tYeah, well... we'll think about what\n\t\t\tyou said.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\t\t(casually)\n\t\t\tNo no.  You don't understand.  I'll\n\t\t\tthink about it.  I'm not auditioning.\n\t\t\tI came here to decide whether I want\n\t\t\tto represent you.  So I'll stand outside\n\t\t\tfor a moment, and think about whether\n\t\t\tI want to stay.\n\n\tHe leaves the room with a pleasant shrug.  Stunned silence.\n\tWilliam watches their body language.  No one wants to talk\n\tfirst.  Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can\n\twe talk him into staying?\n\n\t113   INT. PLANE -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t\t113\n\n\tWilliam watches as the band stands inside the new plane.  Dennis\n\tHope looks on.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThis is not us.   This is too much.\n\n\tHe looks around for support.  Grim nodding faces.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(impressed at seat)\n\t\t\tThis is too much.\n\n\tWilliam watches as Russell reclines.  Russell grabs Penny, and\n\tshe falls into the seat next to him.   We hear the loud oncoming\n\tsound of the plane in flight, as Dennis cooly asks for Penny's\n\tseat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\tDo you mind?\n\n\t114   EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t114\n\n\tDoris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near\n\ta field.  The new plane lifts off in the background, as the\n\tbus sits alone, as if crying steel tears.  Bus Banner reads\n\tsimply: CLEVELAND.  Reprise ending of Whole Lotta Love.\n\n\t115   INT. PLANE  NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t115\n\n\tThe girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane,\n\twith William.\n\n\t116   INT. BOSTON HOTEL ROOM HALLWAY -- DAY\t\t\t\t116\n\n\tWilliam trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook,\n\ttrolling for Russell.   He passes Boston travelogue posters on\n\tthe walls.  A few room doors are open, he looks for any sign\n\tof the guitarist.   William veers into Dick's room, where a\n\tpoker game full of Roadies is in progress.  The room is thick\n\twith exotic smoke.   They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs,\n\tsmoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening\n\tnot to rock and roll... but Sarah Vaughn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tAnyone seen Russell?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tThe Enemy!\n\n\tDoor widens to reveal Russell.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tHey!  Welcome to the Road Crew Poker\n\t\t\tParty.  This game's been going of for\n\t\t\ttwo years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tThat's Mick - he's with The Who.  That's\n\t\t\tJohn - with J. Geils.  And that's\n\t\t\tRichard with the Eagles... and you know\n\t\t\tThe Wheel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTHE WHEEL\n\t\t\tHey.\n\n\tGrumbling roadies continue playing.  Like an old pro, the kid\n\tturns down a Cola-can hash-pipe.  This hand is down to Dick,\n\tand a roadie named REG from Humble Pie.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tSide proposition.  For fifty dollars\n\t\t\tand a case of Heineken, I will put\n\t\t\tinto the pot... three Lovely Ladies,\n\t\t\tIncluding the famous Penny Lane... the\n\t\t\tBand-Aids, who need to exit our tour\n\t\t\tbefore New York...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tREG\n\t\t\tIt's a deal.  Show 'em.\n\n\tDick lays down three tens.  Reg lays down three Kings.  Dick\n\tloses.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tThree Lovely Ladies... now in the\n\t\t\tcustody of Humble Pie.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tREG\n\t\t\tAlright, so we owe you fifty dollars\n\t\t\tand a case of Heineken.\n\n\tEmbarrassed, Russell notices the kids face.  He leans over,\n\tand speaks confidentially to him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tLook.  Nobody's feelings are getting\n\t\t\thurt here.  She already knows Leslie's\n\t\t\tcoming To New York tomorrow.  They all\n\t\t\tunderstand.  This is the Circus.\n\t\t\tEverybody's trying not to go home.\n\t\t\tNobody's saying goodbye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tNo, I got it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tThese are the Rules that come with\n\t\t\tevery electric Guitar and every\n\t\t\tamplifier.  They're not just written\n\t\t\tanywhere.  Rock and roll, brother.  No\n\t\t\tattachments.  No boundaries.\n\n\tBut the kid feels bad, and Russell knows it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tQuit looking at me like that.\n\n\t116A  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON\t\t\t\t\t\t116A\n\n\tThe kid is still stuck on the road.  He is in hell now.\n\tWearily, with deep circles under his eyes, he shuts his eyes\n\tfor a moment.  Another band is moving through.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSABBATH ROADIE\n\t\t\tKeep this hallway clear!\n\n\t117   INT. BACKSTAGE TRAILER/DRESSING ROOM -- AFTERNOON\t\t\t117\n\n\tWilliam and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room\n\tbench.  It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies,\n\tguitars and men in stages of half-dress.  Piles of luggage\n\theaded for New York sit by the door.  The door suddenly opens\n\tand Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a\n\tsparkler.  It is placed in Penny's lap. It reads: Unforgettable\n\tPenny... Age Unknown.  Boston, 1973.   They gather now as the\n\tcake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tHappy Birthday from us.\n\n\tWilliam watches her face as she reads the message on the cake.\n\tIt hasn't sunk in yet.\n\n\tRussell produces a piece of hotel stationery.  He reads a poem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tSo Penny our friend has gained another year.\n\t\t\tBut long ago, she threw it in gear.\n\t\t\tShe rocked the south\n\t\t\tThe East and West.\n\t\t\tCould you please get off this endless tour\n\t\t\tWhere we're Black Sabbath's fucking\n\t\t\t special guest?\n\n\tLaughter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tShe says she's retired\n\t\t\tThough we've heard that before.\n\t\t\tShe chose us...\n\t\t\tAnd in Penny Lane we trust\n\t\t\tShe is a fan of this band.\n\t\t\tMuch more so than us.\n\n\tWilliam watches her face.  Still enchanted, she hands out slices\n\tof the cake.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\t\t(to the point)\n\t\t\tSorry the plane isn't bigger.\n\n\tIt hits her.  She looks at William for a clue.  His truthful\n\tface does not look away.  Now she knows.  She turns to the\n\tothers -- the plane isn't bigger?  Shot moves in on Penny as\n\tshe blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging\n\tfor everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy\n\tlaughter.  Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to\n\tconnect with band members.  Each of them look away, nobody\n\tmaintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't\n\tlook at.  William.  She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn\n\tMonroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers.\n\tRussell watches, as we push in on Penny.  She notices all the\n\tluggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.\n\n\t118   EXT. CONCORD PAVILLION BACKSTAGE -- EARLY MORNING\t\t\t118\n\n\tWilliam exits a backstage Portosan.  Penny catches him by the\n\tgrilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event.\n\tTheir laminated passes swing from around their necks.  Thuding\n\tin the distance, Stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd.\n\tThe sound of summer insects in the air.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tSo it wasn't a birthday party, it was\n\t\t\ta farewell.\n\n\tWilliam doesn't answer.  He looks at her, blowing some hair\n\tout of her face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY (cont'd)\n\t\t\tYou think you can fool me.  I read\n\t\t\tyou.  I know what you're thinking.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tWhat's that?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(touched)\n\t\t\tYou're worried about me and Russell.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tYeah.  I gotta work on that.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tYou're so sweet.  God -- if there was\n\t\t\tmore of you in him...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tDon't tell me this stuff.  I want to\n\t\t\tlike him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(concerned for him)\n\t\t\tDid you miss your test or something?\n\n\tHe shakes his head.  It's so beyond a test.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI know I'm not on the plane, and I'm\n\t\t\tnot going on some other band's bus.  I\n\t\t\tmean, I could go with the Sabbath road\n\t\t\tcrew, but that would be pathetic.  The\n\t\t\tgirls are all going with Humble Pie.\n\t\t\tIf you could find out from Russell --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\t\tPenny -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(a decision)\n\t\t\tForget it.  I'm flying to New York\n\t\t\tmyself.  I have a bunch of partial\n\t\t\ttickets.  I know his ex-wife, current\n\t\t\tgirlfriend's going to be there -\n\n\tWilliam's eyebrows rise.  She examines his face for clues.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t-- I'm not sure that's a good idea.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(overlapping)\n\t\t\tWhat?  What are you saying?  What do\n\t\t\tyou know?  Did Russell say something?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tI don't know anything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tI know he wants me there.  He gave me\n\t\t\ta cake.  He wrote me that sweet poem.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(loud)\n\t\t\tWake up!  Don't go to New York!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tWhat are you telling me?\n\n\tShe looks so achingly beautiful to him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tBecause you're not who you said you\n\t\t\twere!  I thought you were retired!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tYou're right.  I'm not who I said I\n\t\t\twas.  I'm just like you. I love music,\n\t\t\tso this is my family.  Some people\n\t\t\tlike tractors, and they hang out with\n\t\t\ttractor people.  What's the worst that\n\t\t\tcould happen if I go to New York?\n\t\t\t\t(little girl)\n\t\t\t\"I get my little heart broken?\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tOh no.  Never you!  You eat people\n\t\t\talive!\n\n\tShe tears some leaves off a tree.  He looks at her, unable to\n\tformulate a response.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(accusatory)\n\t\t\tI'm sorry I told you so much.   You\n\t\t\thave some way of making everybody tell\n\t\t\tyou all their secrets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\tThat's a good one.  Tell me too much\n\t\t\tand make it my fault.\n\n\tHe continues walking, she follows.  They have ventured outside\n\tthe backstage area, onto adjoining Boston farmland.  The show\n\tbooms in the background.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\tCome on.  You've seen what's happened.\n\t\t\tRussell and I fell in love.  How much,\n\t\t\tI don't know... but this is the first\n\t\t\ttime I've fallen for someone, really\n\t\t\tfallen... since Iggy, and I'm not happy\n\t\t\tabout it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tYou slept with Iggy Pop!?\n\n\tShe says nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(sputtering)\n\t\t\tWhy don't you just tell me now, who\n\t\t\telse -- so when I go to the record\n\t\t\tstore, I know who to be jealous of.\n\t\t\tBecause right now, it's looking like\n\t\t\tthe whole store!\n\n\tHe's upset.   She stares at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPENNY\n\t\t\t\t(teasing, defiant)\n\t\t\tYou'll remember me forever.  I was\n\t\t\tthere when you lost your virginity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\t(upset at the memory)\n\t\t\tSo was Steely Dan!  It was a crowded\n\t\t\troom.\n\n\tShe laughs, can't help it.

Now that I have your attention.\n\t\t\tAnd you may not remember this later, I\n\t\t\tjust want to make it clear that... Hey!\n\t\t\t\t(she blinks, barely awake\n\t\t\tagain)\n\t\t\tI know you've heard this before.  And\n\t\t\tI have never said this to anybody, not\n\t\t\treally - well, nobody who didn't legally\n\t\t\thave to say it back to me, but -\n\t\t\t\t(tries to be casual)\n\t\t\tI love you.

AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER -- MORNING\t\t\t\t142\n\n\tSong continues.  William and Penny drag themselves through the\n\tairport.  He guides her to the ticket counter.  Penny wears\n\ther green coat, large sunglasses.  He sorts through her many\n\tpartial tickets.  They are both so tired.  She shakes off her\n\tcoat -- she's suddenly very hot -- and he grabs it and loops\n\tit through her bags.  She's irritable, and ready to go home.\n\n\t143   INT.

William wears\n\tthe same clothes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tWhy didn't you come back to the party?\n\t\t\tBob Dylan showed up.  He was sitting\n\t\t\tat our table for... had to be an hour,\n\t\t\tright?  Just  Rapping.  Bob Dylan!  I\n\t\t\tkept looking for you.

William looks up, increasingly\n\tnervous, stares straight ahead.  The plane suddenly drops and\n\tstabilizes.  Everyone is silent but Russell.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWooooooo Baby!\n\n\tA moment later, an ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges, balancing\n\thimself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCO-PILOT\n\t\t\tWe're gonna try to land in Tupelo.\n\t\t\tWe're going to have to cut the inside\n\t\t\tlighting for the next several minutes.\n\t\t\tWe found a field to land in.\n\n\tThe kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\tA field?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tI can't breathe.\n\n\tPush in on Russell. We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical\n\tsounds.  The plane screwballs through the sky.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCO-PILOT\n\t\t\tIt might be a rough set-down.  We should\n\t\t\tbe fine.\n\t\t\t\t(cracking at the edges)\n\t\t\tBut what we do say in a situation like\n\t\t\tthis is - We would pass but before the\n\t\t\tplane ... disassembled.

But just hang in there.\n\t\t\tWe'll get you out of this.\n\n\tHe returns to the cockpit.  The weather worsens, as the hail\n\tsuddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard.  Inside lights\n\tshut off.   William stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door\n\tswings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n\t\t\tAnd everyone thinks it's so glamorous\n\t\t\tout here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLARRY\n\t\t\t\t(oddly detached)\n\t\t\tHe just told us we're gonna die.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\t\t(insecurities running wild)\n\t\t\tWe're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tShut up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\t-- we can't even die in an original\n\t\t\tcity!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tC'mon Dennis, get us a better city.\n\n\tNervous laughter.

Now lightening strikes very close.  A\n\tflashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and\n\tevaporates with a burning smell still in the air.  In the\n\tdarkness:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDENNIS HOPE\n\t\t\tI once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\t\t\tA hit-and-run.  I hit him and kept on\n\t\t\tgoing.

William finds his mouth saying\n\temotional words he cannot control.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n\t\t\t\"That groupie?\"  She was a Band-Aid.\n\t\t\tAll she did was love your band.

You're always talking\n\t\t\tabout the fans, the fans, the fans.\n\t\t\tShe was your biggest fan and you threw\n\t\t\ther away.  And if you can't see that,\n\t\t\tthat's your biggest problem.\n\n\tRussell and Jeff stare at each other.   The plane is rocking\n\tvery very hard.  Leslie is crying.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tI'm gay.\n\n\tThey all turn to the silent drummer.  (It's his first spoken\n\tdialogue of the movie.)\n\n\tThen.\n\n\tThe plane pops out from below the clouds.  Sunshine spikes\n\tthrough the embattled windows of the plane, as they float\n\tdownwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi.  A very very\n\tuneasy silence fills the plane.  No one can look at each other.\n\tOut bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCO-PILOT\n\t\t\tThank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!!   WE'RE\n\t\t\tALIVE!!

TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAY\t\t\t\t148\n\n\tMusic continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long\n\tand very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid.  Everything is\n\tdifferent now.  The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster.\n\tWe continue with the band, unhappily moving forward.  William\n\thustles back to catch up.  They ignore him.  There are much\n\tbigger thoughts in play.  No one wants to speak.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFF\n\t\t\tWell, I think we can build on this new\n\t\t\thonesty.\n\n\tBoom.  Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart.  The\n\tband continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport\n\tterminals.  William stops.  This is where he must part company.\n\tHe stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band\n\tcontinues, unaware he's split off.   He watches their backs,\n\tthey've forgotten him.\n\n\tThen Russell turns, sensing something missing.  William.  All\n\tnow stop and turn.  Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre-\n\toccupied but heartfelt goodbye.  William waves.

Am I right?\n\n\tHe looks at their faces.  They cannot disagree.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI'm learning the game.\n\t\t\t\t(beat, shrug)\n\t\t\tWe fucked up.  We made friends with him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t\tNext time we'll all be more\n\t\t\tprofessional.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tMaybe so.\n\t\t\t\t(beat, an odd thought)\n\t\t\tBut God forbid, the day comes when\n\t\t\tselling yourself is as important as\n\t\t\tthe music you make.\n\t\t\t\t(rueful, to Hendrix on the\n\t\t\twall)\n\t\t\tYou might have died at the right time,\n\t\t\tmy friend.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJANN\n\t\t\tThank you for visiting.  Good luck.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n\t\t\tDo what you want, but the story is\n\t\t\ttrue.\n\n\tLONG SHOT RUSSELL\n\n\tat the entrance.  Raises his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tGood evening!\n\n\t162A  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t162A\n\n\tRussell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go.\n\tOddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to\n\tspeak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a\n\tmusic of its own.  It's a beautiful and compelling \"silence.\"\n\tHe thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath\n\tof life.  His head filling again with the music of the world,\n\the begins to walk down the street.  Very naturally, and quite\n\trandomly, he is noticed by young passersby.  They can't help\n\tit.  He looks like a star.  They can't quite figure out who it\n\tis, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the\n\tstreet.   Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought,\n\ta small crowd begins to form... following him.\n\n\t163   INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY\t\t\t\t\t163\n\n\tA quiet kitchen.  Anita has been cooking.  A substantial\n\tbreakfast has been placed on the table.  Sausage, orange\n\tjuice... and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with\n\tsyrup and butter, in front of her mother.  William watches his\n\tmother facing an old enemy - white sugar.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n\t\t\tThey're called pancakes.  Who knows\n\t\t\twhen we'll be together again.  Splurge.\n\t\t\tIt's what most people call breakfast.\n\n\tMom looks at her children, and takes a breath.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n\t\t\tI went through your records.  And I\n\t\t\tfound a song to play for you.\n\n\tShe goes to the stereo and puts on a record.  The two children\n\teye each other - what's coming next?  (Song to be chosen)\n\tThe two kids eye each other again.  Self-consciously avoiding\n\ttheir gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast.  It's a song\n\tshe clearly wants them to hear.  It's a song from the heart.\n\tThey look at her, amazed.  Elaine looks up, regards her family.\n\tSomehow they're back at this table.  They continue eating\n\tbreakfast.\n\n\t164   ON SIDEWALK\t\t\t\t\t\t\t164\n\n\tBam.  A bundle of bound Rolling Stone Magazines lands on the\n\tnewsstand pavement with a thud.  Someone reaches in to cut the\n\tcord, as the magazines puff up into view.  It's the new issue,\n\twith Russell Hammond on the cover.  The title: Stillwater Runs\n\tDeep.  Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in\n\tthe racks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\tMusic segues to Led Zeppelin's \"Four Sticks.\"  Penny Lane's\n\tsleeping Polaroid shots of our characters, featuring a few\n\tself-portraits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost Famous\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Cameron Crowe\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:04.388422"}
