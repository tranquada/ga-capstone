A young hand comes\n\tinto frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only\n\tthe soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written\n\tin a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and\n\tcorrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of\n\tan old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we\n\tnow hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' \"Christmas Song.\"\n\n<b>\t2\tEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t2\n</b>\n\tA lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky.  Behind\n\tit, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of\n\tSan Diego.  A dry, hot Southern California day.  Even the wind\n\tis lazy, and a little bored.\n\n<b>\t3\tEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER - DAY\t\t\t\t3\n</b>\n\tSanta Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he\n\tcollects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the\n\tSouthland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly\n\tthick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.\n\n\tTurning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.\n\tShe is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's\n\n\tHaving with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They\n\tstand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the\n\thighly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering\n\tfake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the\n\tcommercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual\n\tconversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing\n\tletters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY...\n\tnow he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always\n\tpleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n</b>\t\t\tExcuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no\n\t\t\tword in The English Language -- \"Xmas.\"\n\t\t\tIt's either <i>Merry Christmas...</i> or <i>Happy\n\t\t\tHolidays.</i>\n\n\tThe Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns\n\taway.  The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs -\n\tthat's my Mom.\n\n<b>\tTITLE: 1969\n</b>\n<b>\t4\tEXT.  MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX -- DAY\t\t\t\t4\n</b>\n\tThis is the new professional-class.  It's a mini-condo\n\tcommunity.  Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with\n\tcommon walls.   Move in on one of these homes, the one without\n\tChristmas lights.  At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl.\n\tShe checks her cheek, straightens her hair.  She hides\n\tsomething under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance\n\tto enter.  Music fades.\n\n<b>\t5\tINT. KITCHEN -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t5\n</b>\n\tWe now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her\n\tson, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets.\n\tThe meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan.  Across the kitchen\n\twe see William.  He's a great listener, with a calm and curious\n\tface that takes everything in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n</b>\t\t\t- so Livia -\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n</b>\t\t\t-- killed everyone off so her son\n\t\t\tTiberius could inherit the throne.\n\t\t\t\t(thoughtful pause)\n\t\t\tJust like Nixon.\n\n\tWilliam nods, intrigued.  He has a good disposition.  The\n\tworld of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings\n\tout in his Mom.  There is a small clatter at the front door,\n\tas the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes.\n\tShe silently curses herself.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAnita, is that you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tANITA'S VOICE\n</b>\t\t\tHey Mom!

LIVING ROOM -- DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t6\n</b>\n\tShe's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches\n\ther.  We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close.  She is an alluring\n\tyoung Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n</b>\t\t\tYou sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.\n\n\tThe words \"soy cutlets\" sends a small shiver through the girl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n</b>\t\t\tI'm fine.  Already ate.\n\n\tWilliam stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as\n\tMom moves closer to his sister.

She turns slightly to look at herself\n\tin a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself\n\timmediately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAnd what have you got under your coat?\n\n\tThis is the booty Anita didn't want to give up.  Mom picks at\n\tthe corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket.\n\tShe withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's <i>Bookends.</i>\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n</b>\t\t\t\t(busted)\n\t\t\tIt's unfair that we can't listen to\n\t\t\tour music!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n</b>\t\t\t\t(weary of the issue)\n\t\t\tHoney, it's all about drugs and\n\t\t\tpromiscuous sex.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n</b>\t\t\tSimon and Garfunkel is poetry!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n</b>\t\t\tYes it's poetry.

We examine the insolent faces on\n\tRichard Avedon's classic album cover.  Even Simon and Garfunkle\n\tlook guilty under her scholarly inspection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELAINE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t... honey, they're on <i>pot.</i>\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tANITA\n</b>\t\t\tFirst it was butter, then sugar and\n\t\t\twhite flour.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tBacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll,\n\t\t\tmotorcycles.\n\n\tNearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating\n\tconversation.  Anita glances at her brother.  He silently\n\turges her to downshift.  She can't.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANITA (cont'd)\n\t\t\t<i>Then</i> it was celebrating Christmas on a\n\t\t\tday in September When you knew it\n\t\t\twouldn't be \"commercialized.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n</b>\t\t\tThat was an experiment.

All of you!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tELAINE\n</b>\t\t\tHey!\n\n\tAnita runs down the hall to her room.

SCHOOL DANCE/GYMNASIUM BATHROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t7\n</b>\n\tMusic continues.  Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking\n\tmale teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror.\n\tThere's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid\n\tproudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some\n\t<i>Hai Karate</i>), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the\n\tface of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and\n\tthen a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down,\n\tdown to find William.  He is so much younger, without a zit in\n\tsight.  Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.\n\n<b>\t8\tINT. DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-CRANKED\t\t\t\t 8\n</b>\n\tSong continues as we see William's perspective of these much-\n\tolder looking kids.  Girls now are visible, and they are even\n\tmore mature than the boys we've just seen.  They flirt and\n\tglow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys.\n\tWhispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down.\n\tIt's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring\n\tworld of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\t\tAre you <i>really</i> in our grade?\n\n<b>\t9\tINT.

The most mature\n\tlooking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud\n\ttheatrical tone.  It is a voice right out of <i>Guys and Dolls,</i>\n\twhich incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just\n\tstarred.  William answers in a respectful voice.  He is\n\tdesperate for acceptance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n</b>\t\t\tYeah.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTOBIN\n</b>\t\t\tHey guys!  Check it out!

Where are your <i>pubes?</i>\n\n\tAll eyes are on him, waiting for a response.  The kid's mental\n\twheels turn frantically.  And from somewhere comes an attitude,\n\ta swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could\n\tonly be a merciful deity.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n</b>\t\t\t\t(cool, dismissive)\n\t\t\tI had 'em.  <i>I shaved 'em off.</i>\n\n\tIt is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy.  And it works.\n\tGuy #2 cracks up, then others.  William's new accuser is\n\tsuddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these\n\tolder boys.  Others turn away, on to other things.  Tobin stares\n\tat William, and then also turns away.\n\n<b>\t10    INT.

Music continues.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE ON PHOTOS IN MAGAZINE\n</b>\n\tCamera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and\n\tfashions of the rock heroes of the day.  Ian Anderson of Jethro\n\tTull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute.  Neil Young,\n\tenigmatic with perfectly patched Levis.  The Southern Rock Royalty\n\tof The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of\n\tmassive stacks of amps.  Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair\n\tbacklit by stage lights.  David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one-\n\tpiece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars.  Pete Townsend\n\tof the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.\n\n\tDrift down to a by-line - <i>by Lester Bangs.</i>\n\n<b>\t19    EXT.

Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly\n\tfaces smile strangely, laughing.  He takes a few steps and\n\tlooks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing\n\tsomething from the high-school marquee.\n\n<b>\tHIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE\n</b>\n\twhich reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)\n\n\tAll are laughing.  He laughs with them, and turns as his face\n\tgoes slack.  He shrugs, marches on.\n\n<b>\t20    EXT.

He is a ferocious, lumbering, music-\n\tdriven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the\n\tvery brim.  This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a\n\tthen new art-form -- Rock Journalism.  A Disc-jockey with long-\n\tlong hair watches helplessly.  William views all this through a\n\tglass window.  He stands on the corner of a downtown side\n\tstreet, halfway up a steep incline.  He is the only person on\n\tthe streets this early Saturday morning.

Bangs is about\n\tfifteen beer pounds overweight.  His jeans are loose, his\n\tpaleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and\n\tnights spent writing.  In there somewhere is a good-looking\n\tguy.  His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he\n\ttakes big sweeping steps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n</b>\t\t\tSo you're the one who's been sending\n\t\t\tme those articles from your school\n\t\t\tnewspaper -\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n</b>\t\t\tI've been doing some stuff for a local\n\t\t\tunderground paper, too.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n</b>\t\t\tWhat are you like the star of your\n\t\t\tschool?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n</b>\t\t\tThey hate me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBANGS\n</b>\t\t\tYou'll meet them all again on their\n\t\t\tlong journey to the middle.\n\n\tThe kid nods, they walk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBANGS (cont'd)\n\t\t\tWell, your writing is damn good.

Heavy\n\teye-makeup.  Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English.\n\tIn one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne.  In the other,\n\ta fistful of backstage passes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSAPPHIRE\n</b>\t\t\t<i>Does anybody remember laugh-tah?</i>\n\t\t\t\t(as they turn)\n\t\t\t<i>Come and GET 'EM!</i>\n\n\tThe girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire.\n\tPenny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked\n\taround his.  He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the\n\tramp.  Sapphire slaps passes on the girls.  As Scotty (The\n\tKeeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William\n\tforward for a pass.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n</b>\t\t\tOh no.

The thundering arena sound of\n\tthe collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes'\n\t\"Roundabout\"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases...\n\tthe glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants\n\tto be a part of is on the other side of this door.  And then\n\tit shuts.  He stands alone.\n\n\tAt the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads.  It reads --\n\tSTILLWATER TOUR 73.  Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening\n\tband.  This is Stillwater.  Four road-weary band members, and\n\ttheir road manager.  Voices booming.\n\n\tRUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his\n\tguitar-case.  It's obvious from moment one.  This is the star\n\tof the band, the charismatic one.  He's tired.  They're late.\n\tWilliam recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches.\n\tThe buzzer goes unanswered.  The kid is invisible to him, as\n\tthe others now arrive behind Russell.\n\n\tTour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on\n\tthe steel door.  He has the flaxen-haired look of a former\n\thippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest\n\tsilver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes.\n\tHis direction is always - forward.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tDICK\n</b>\t\t\tLet us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on\n\t\t\tthe show!!\n\n\tWilliam is surrounded by them now.  They stand together under the\n\tsingle lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover.  JEFF\n\tBEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his\n\thead.  ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging\n\tlimply at his sides.  His is a face made for the background. LARRY\n\tTURNER the compact bass-player.   Dick now kicks at the door with\n\this foot, as William produces a copy of <i>Creem</i> Magazine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWILLIAM\n</b>\t\t\t\t(to Dick)\n\t\t\tHi, I'm a journalist.

Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares\n\toff.\n\n\tRussell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him\n\tforward.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n</b>\t\t\tNot this one.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL\n</b>\t\t\tHe's with us.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSCOTTY\n</b>\t\t\t<i>He's not with you.</i>  He's not with <i>them.</i>\n\t\t\tHe's not on the <i>list.</i>  <i>He's not coming\n\t\t\tin.</i>  And this is my arena.

DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t28\n</b>\n\tDressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply\n\tlistens.  He holds a small microphone.  His stoic look gives away\n\tlittle of the full body rush he's experiencing.  As the other\n\tband members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and\n\troll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready\n\tfor the show.

Russell looks over to Penny and William,\n\tat stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an\n\telegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he\n\tbelongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first\n\tguitar lead of the night.

Then he returns to\n\tRussell's door.  He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds\n\tof laughter, just for a moment, escalating.  He flips the sign\n\tover: HOUSEKEEPING PLEASE ENTER - CLEAN ROOM.\n\n<b>\t62    INT. OUTER RADIO STATION - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t62\n</b>\n\tHumble Pie.  \"Thirty Days in the Hole.\"  Russell and band enter\n\tthe radio station, passing through the now-empty front office.\n\tAs always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good.\n\tStillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles,\n\tas they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold\n\trecords  and head down the small hallway to the control room\n\tinterview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her\n\tgreen coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a\n\tlittle stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will\n\thave none of it.  She privately shares every great passing\n\tmoment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms.\n\tIt's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own \"Fever Dog.\"\n\n<b>\t63    INT. RADIO CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT\t\t\t\t\t63\n</b>\n\tStillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone\n\tin this room.  Russell takes a seat near the open mike.  Jeff\n\tBebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be\n\tjust as close to the microphone as Russell.  William watches\n\tall as he sits at the dark back of this control booth.\n\tStillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE\n<b>\tALLEN, 25.\n</b>\n\tQuince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it.\n\tThe entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and\n\tready for the interview.   William can't avoid looking at Penny\n\tLane, who looks great tonight.  She catches him, and he barely\n\tlooks away in time.  Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff,\n\tnotices.  The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the\n\tmicrophone, as the finale of \"Fever Dog\" is just ending.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tQUINCE ALLEN\n</b>\t\t\tThe guitar of Russell Hammond.   \"Fever\n\t\t\tDog\"...

Better hit the delay button.\n\n\tAll eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to\n\tsome inner beat.  He says nothing.  The band looks at each\n\tother.  We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be\n\tasleep.  Long silence.  William shares an amazed look with\n\tPenny.  Quince is definitely asleep.  Russell leans forward\n\tand continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRUSSELL (cont'd)\n\t\t\tOkay - we're talking now, right?

Russell grabs his guitar.  They stand for a\n\tmoment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait\n\ttwenty yards in front of them.  The off-limits after-hours\n\tpool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members.\n\tJeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby.  Dick laughs at a joke.\n\tAlways the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels\n\tfrom a maid cart.
