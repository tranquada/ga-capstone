C3 could blow a vial\n              right out a person's hand.\n\n     Sara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents\n     of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she\n     drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in\n     smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat.\n     Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The\n     class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's\n     sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick.\n\n<b>                                MR.

There's a\n     party on the floor. FAVOR Sara and Patrick, facing each\n     other. He's moving already. She starts to dance,\n     stiffly, tentatively. Patrick smiles at her. Shakes his\n     head. He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the\n     music.\n\n<b>                             PATRICK\n</b>               Now move your hips.

Sara watches him\n     intensely, her body follows his stiffly. Patrick's a\n     good teacher. He leads without leaving her. Whenever\n     she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into\n     another less-complicated one.\n<b>                                                (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             44.\n</b>\n<b>80   CONTINUED:                                                    80\n</b>\n     Sara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm.

She's ready.\n\n      ANGLE WIDENS to reveal him coming forward. Rushing for\n      the stage. He pauses at the apron of it. Looks up at\n      Sara. She peers down at him, astounded. Shaken. He\n      smiles at her. She smiles back. Patrick's eyes softly\n      take her in.\n\n<b>                                  PATRICK\n</b>                   You can do it.\n                          (because)\n                   Ain't nobody watchin' you but me.\n\n      Sara's eyes focus on him.       She nods.     Turns to the\n      judges.\n\n<b>                                   SARA\n</b>                   I'm ready.\n\n      As her MUSIC cues up, Patrick slowly backs away from the\n      stage.\n\n      Sara begins to dance.\n\n      She starts out strong and gets stronger. Every emotion\n      she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a\n      way that we've never seen before, not even when she was\n      practicing with Patrick. Her body has finally found a\n      way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its\n      meaning and transform her dance.\n\n      The MUSIC ENDS.     The lights go up.\n\n      Sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless,\n      sweating. She lifts her head slowly and the ANGLE WIDENS\n      to reveal --\n\n<b>                                                          (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                 117.\n</b>\n<b>176   CONTINUED:                                                        176\n</b>\n      Patrick letting out a giant whoop...\n\n      The judges react and the audience gasps...\n\n      ... as he bounds onto the stage and...\n\n      Roy jumps to his feet.      Proudly and loudly clapping.\n      Just like Glynn.\n\n<b>      ANGLE - SARA\n</b>\n      overwhelmed beyond belief. Patrick's coming toward her.\n      She flies into his arms, free and happy, overjoyed. But\n      the triumph of her performance and the sheer bliss of the\n      moment are transcended by something deeper and clearer,\n      which is her love for Patrick.\n\n\n<b>      JUDGES\n</b>\n      struggling to maintain their and the proceeding's\n      decorum, since the audience, caught up in the throes of\n      this excitement, has begun to loudly, enthusiastically\n      react.\n\n<b>                                 STERN JUDGE\n</b>                   Ladies and gentlemen, please!\n                          (to Patrick)\n                   Young man!

Walks alone to the edge of the\n      stage, composed and professional again. She regards the\n      judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerina's curtsy,\n      then simply says:\n\n<b>                                  SARA\n</b>                   Thank you.

WIDER as she walks slowly, deliberately back to\n      Patrick. Stops. Looks at him. Just looks. And then\n      she throws her arms around his neck, kissing and hugging\n      him. Emotional. Patrick swings her into the air, twirls\n      her around and around, as we:\n\n<b>                                                   DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>177   INT.

The ceiling's ablaze with tiny, star-like\n      lights; under them large poufs of cotton clouds hang.\n      Glittering, mirrored balls dangle over the main floor.\n\n      Seniors dance in traditional and cutting edge tuxes and\n      mouth-watering, eye-popping versions of dresses and\n      gowns. CAMERA PANS the floor, PICKING UP:\n\n      A surprisingly dashing Snookie and the fly girl.
