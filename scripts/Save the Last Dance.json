She shakes her head, clears her\n    backpack and magazines from the seat beside her. The\n    Woman drops down, settles in. A long silence. The Woman\n    glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap.\n    Tries to make conversation.\n\n                             WOMAN\n               I love ballet.

CAMERA PANS TO the audience. A\n    woman in an Irish clover necklace springs to her feet\n    clapping loudly. The little girl's eyes catch the glint\n    of the necklace's gold. Mommy.

Gliding past the envious stares of\n    classmates, she scans the hall for a glint of gold.\n    Finds it in the back of the room where her mother, Glynn,\n    stands watching her. Their eyes connect with mutual\n    smiles and those smiles CARRY us TO:\n\n\n7   INT. SARA'S EXETER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  7\n\n    A pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood\n    floor. PAN UP and PULL BACK to reveal Sara at 17,\n    dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and\n    rolled up rugs. As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the\n    routine with a pirouette. She spins out of it with a\n    preoccupied frown on her face.\n\n                            GLYNN\n               What's the matter?

I bet they notice\n             that. That it doesn't do\n             anything.

Not that\n                 you'll need it. You dance like an\n                 angel.\n\n    The necklace is Glynn's talisman. Sara knows what it\n    means to her. She throws her arms around Glynn, holds\n    onto her tightly.\n\n                               SARA\n                 I love the necklace but you're\n                 still the best luck I'll ever\n                 have.\n\n    Glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up.

Sara,\n     embarrassed, aligns her head with Lindsay's.      She's\n     praying nobody sees them.\n\n                                LINDSAY\n                  'Awesome, Father, S.J. auditions\n                  today.

She taps her\n     toes, checks her watch. A phalanx of parents and dancers\n     are clustered around a sign posted on the door:\n     JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE AUDITIONS. Sara stares at it.\n     Re-checks her watch. An official with a clipboard walks\n     toward her. Where's her mother?\n\n\n15   INT. UNIV.

MOZART'S \"Elvira\n     Madigan\" (Andante) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical.\n     She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful\n     performance.

A motif... a theme?\n\n     Sara's stomach drops to her feet.

Sara tries to elevate her\n     body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her\n     feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium\n     for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm.\n     Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's\n     dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling,\n     recovering, and finally finishing with those damned\n     knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones,\n     perfunctorily nod.

A state trooper in a\n     rain slicker offers Sara a chair. She sits. The trooper\n     talks. As he does, dread and disbelief spread over\n     Sara's face.

SHOOTING THROUGH the driver's side window, we can\n     see Glynn's face, intense and determined, squinting\n     through the downpour.\n\n\n22   TRAIN'S WHEELS                                              22\n\n     GRINDING.\n\n\n23   VAN'S WHEELS                                                23\n\n     Hydro-planing, slip-sliding.\n\n\n24   TRAIN                                                       24\n\n     It's SQUEAL OF BRAKES as it maneuvers into the station.\n\n\n25   VAN                                                         25\n\n     The SQUEAL of its BRAKES as Glynn loses control and\n     smashes into the back of the eighteen wheeler in front of\n     her.\n\n\n26   TRAIN                                                       26\n\n     across space and time, the SOUND OF SQUEALING BRAKES\n     commingle as the Amtrak Commuter pulls into Penn Station.\n\n\n27   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT                                   27\n\n     Sara. Holding her breath, clenching her fists. Waiting\n     for the sound to stop, oblivious to the stare of the\n     Woman beside her.\n\n                                                            9.\n\n28   EXT. PENN STATION (BALTIMORE) - PLATFORM - NIGHT            28\n\n     ROY JOHNSON, 37, a handsome, laconic man of uncertain\n     style, takes a last drag from his cigarette, drops and\n     stomps it. Passengers disembark from the train. Roy\n     searches their faces. They all look like strangers.\n\n\n29   EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - SAME TIME                               29\n\n     A conductor helps Sara to the platform. Steam from the\n     train's engine is sucked into the fog. She walks through\n     it. Sees him. They see each other. Roy weakly waves.\n     Walks toward her. Sara watches his bow legs stiffly\n     advance. She wants to run. Can't.\n\n                                 ROY\n                Hi.\n\n                                 SARA\n                Hi.\n\n                              ROY\n                Have a good ride?\n\n     Sara self-consciously tucks her hair behind an ear.\n\n                              SARA\n                Slept through most of it.\n\n     A beat.   Roy looks at her.\n\n                              ROY\n                Guess you got stuff.    Baggage.\n\n                                 SARA\n                Two suitcases.     One big one.\n\n                              ROY\n                Looks like they're unloading.\n                -- You hungry? We can stop\n                somewhere if you want.\n\n                              SARA\n                I'm kinda tired.\n\n     Roy takes her backpack.     They walk.\n\n\n30   INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP/STREET - SARA AND ROY - NIGHT        30\n\n     A heavy silence. Roy starts to turn on the radio, stops\n     himself. He lights a cigarette, cracks the window.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           10.\n\n30   CONTINUED:                                                  30\n\n                                ROY\n                  I didn't like leavin' you so soon\n                  after the funeral. I wouldn't\n                  have if you hadn't asked me to go.\n                  I mean, I could've hung around.\n                  Helped you say good-bye. That's\n                  what you were doin', wasn't it?\n\n                                  SARA\n                  Uh-huh.\n\n     Roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself.\n\n                                ROY\n                  That's what I figured you were\n                  doin'.\n\n     Sara peers out    the windshield. Baltimore City. The\n     neighborhoods    are changing. The streets are getting\n     progressively    gritty and dirty. It surprises her. It\n     worries her.     Roy worries her.\n\n                                ROY\n                  Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I\n                  mean, we both got hit by the same\n                  bolt of lightning. You don't have\n                  to pretend this is easy.\n                         (off nothing)\n                  Everything's upside down right now\n                  but don't worry. We'll work this\n                  bachelor-father thing out. Hell,\n                  it ain't like we're movin' in with\n                  strangers. We got a pretty good\n                  idea about each other, right?\n\n     Sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating\n     otherwise. A moment. Roy's too new at this to hold up\n     both ends of the conversation. The silence deepens. Roy\n     switches on the radio.\n\n\n31   EXT. BOND STREET (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                  31\n\n     Roy's truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses\n     with pristine white marble steps. He and Sara each lug a\n     suitcase from the truck. Her eyes wander up and down the\n     street. They're on the fringes of a ghetto. A few\n     people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners. All\n     of them have black faces.\n\n                                SARA\n                  Thought you were moving to Fells\n                  Point.\n\n                                  ROY\n                  Fell through.\n\n                                                             11.\n\n32   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  32\n\n     The second floor of a two-story house has been turned\n     into a one-bedroom studio. A partition separates the\n     living area from the bedroom. Sara walks past a\n     collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of\n     herself. Aside from the saxophones and the pictures,\n     there's hardly any furniture. Roy lights a cigarette.\n\n                             ROY\n               Not much of what you're used to.\n               But the water's hot and the fridge\n               is full. And I made room in the\n               closets for you. Girl's gotta\n               have closets, right? You even get\n               your own bed. I'll crash on the\n               couch.\n\n                             SARA\n               You bought a bed?\n\n                             ROY\n                      (slight bow)\n               Pardon me. Your own futon.     Check\n               it out. On the other side.\n\n     Suitcase in hand, Sara walks around the partition. Her\n     \"room\" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers. She\n     stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do.\n     She removes framed photos of Glynn from her backpack,\n     places them around the room.\n\n\n33   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - MINUTES LATER            33\n\n     Sara walks in.   Doesn't see Roy.   Calls out.\n\n                             SARA\n               Do you have a phone?\n\n     Roy emerges from the bathroom drying his hands, walks\n     past her.\n\n                             ROY\n               Of course I have a phone.\n\n                             SARA\n               You didn't at the last place.    The\n               last place I saw anyway.\n\n                             ROY\n               Things change. You've changed.\n               You grew up on me. Overnight.\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              12.\n\n33   CONTINUED:                                                     33\n\n                                SARA\n                  Over the summer. You blew me off\n                  for some gig on the road,\n                  remember?\n                         (before he can\n                          respond)\n                  Can I call Lindsay? Let her know\n                  I got here alright.\n\n                            ROY\n              Are you alright, Sara?\n                     (off the scowl\n                      in her eyes)\n              I just wanna know how you feel.\n\n                               SARA\n              I feel fine.     I feel like calling\n              Lindsay.\n\n     She's a wall. A brick wall. Roy's head aches from\n     knocking into it. He goes to the couch. Drops down.\n     Mutters at her.\n\n                                ROY\n                  Phone's in the kitchen.   Knock\n                  yourself out.\n\n\n34   INT. SARA'S ROOM/BATHROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT                    34\n\n     Sara lying in bed... wide awake... her stiff upper lip\n     quivering. She slips out of bed, creeps on tiptoes into\n     the bathroom. Closes the door oh-so-quietly behind her.\n     She flips on the light, crosses to the sink, turns on\n     both faucets. As the water flows and the PIPES RATTLE,\n     the brick wall shatters. Sara crumbles to the floor.\n     Buries her head in her arms. Cries like a baby.\n\n\n35   INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP (SOUTH BALTIMORE) -                     35\n     NEXT MORNING\n\n     Roy and Sara. Barreling through the south end, tongues\n     stuck in gear. A Pop-Tart grows cold on Sara's lap.\n     Then, finally.\n\n                                SARA\n                  I can take the school bus.\n                  Tomorrow.\n\n                               ROY\n                  School bus? That's the other Oz,\n                  Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the\n                  city Metro. Or walk.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             13.\n\n35   CONTINUED:                                                     35\n\n                                SARA\n                  Well, I know how to do both.\n\n                                ROY\n                  Not around here you don't. Not\n                  until you get the hang of things.\n\n     Sara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto. It's\n     all to obvious, the hang of things. Roy glances over at\n     her.\n\n                                ROY\n                  I called about your transcripts.\n                  You're all set. Patterson's got a\n                  pretty good Humanities program.\n                  No ballet, but we can find a\n                  studio someplace close for after\n                  school --\n\n                             SARA\n               -- I don't think I'll have time.\n               I have to study, I'll be busy.\n\n     Roy can hear the lie behind her words.      The pain too. He\n     lights a cigarette, cracks the window.      He wants to say\n     the right thing.\n\n                             ROY\n               Good idea. Take a break. Not too\n               long a break though. You're a\n               dancer. You should dance. Stay\n               on top of your art.\n\n                             SARA\n               Like you stay on top of yours?\n\n                             ROY\n               Maybe I ain't playin' no grand\n               ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals,\n               but I'm playing.\n\n                             SARA\n                      (unconvincingly)\n               I didn't mean it like that.\n\n                                ROY\n                  S'alright. Hell, I wish I had\n                  half the time I wasted gettin'\n                  wasted. But those days are over.\n                  You'll see.

PATTERSON HIGH SCHOOL (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - MORNING       36\n\n     Formidably large and surprisingly well-kept, Patterson\n     serves the nearby, predominantly black O'Donnell Heights\n     Projects. Kids malinger outside on the front steps and\n     lawn.\n\n\n37   FROM ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT                             37\n\n     Roy's pickup pulls in. Roy CUTS the ENGINE. Sara looks\n     at him. Or through him. She won't let his eyes connect.\n\n                             SARA\n               You don't have to go in with me.\n               Since I'm all set. I mean, I have\n               done this before. Gone to school.\n               I'll be fine. I am fine. Really.\n\n     Roy regards her with weary resignation.   Sara climbs out.\n     He calls after her.\n\n                             ROY\n               -- Pick you up. Three-thirty.\n\n                              SARA\n                       (over a shoulder)\n               Yeah.   Sure. Whatever.\n\n\n38   EXT./INT. PATTERSON HIGH - MORNING                           38\n\n     Sara moving TOWARD us PAST a floating mosaic of black\n     faces. This is a near out-of-body experience for her.\n     She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff\n     straight line to the school's entrance. It's clogged\n     with students. Inside the doorway, two security guards\n     flank a metal detector. When it's Sara's turn to pass\n     through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and\n     wordlessly begins searching it. He hands it back to her\n     on the other side of the detector where Sara stands\n     obtusely and mutely amazed.\n\n\n39   INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING                       39\n\n     THROUGH a window, Sara seated across from an\n     ADMINISTRATOR.

MRS. GWYNN, the Guidance\n     Counselor, steps in. The Administrator introduces her to\n     Sara. Sara regards Mrs. Gwynn with polite petulance.\n\n                                   MRS.

But the brick wall\n     doesn't move an inch. Sara feels too safe behind it.\n\n\n40   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                            40\n\n     Clutching new textbooks, Sara starts down the hallway.\n     She's hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic\n     in her heart. She's surrounded. Alone. Every inch of\n     her feels afraid.\n\n\n     SARA'S POV\n\n     as she MOVES FORWARD. A crush of KIDS -- mostly black\n     with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in.\n     Kids like her. Only they don't dress like her. They\n     dress like commercials for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin\n     Klein. And they definitely don't sound like her...\n\n                                TEENAGER #1\n                  Yo, man, check it, the\n                  muthafuckers wasn't playin', they\n                  was jackin'.

Stall\n                  that shit!\n\n     Sara walks on, taking this netherworld in, eavesdropping\n     on other conversations. It's not just the words. It's\n     how they say them: Loud. Matter-of-fact. Cool. A\n     cooler cool. Like they breathe static electricity.\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               16.\n\n40   CONTINUED:                                                      40\n\n     That's it! The entire student body is energized. Sara's\n     thoughts are jolted by two black girls squeezing by. One\n     clips Sara's elbow as she passes, knocking it against a\n     locker. They keep going as if they don't see her. No\n     one seems to see her. Welcome to mass avoidance at\n     Patterson High.\n\n\n41   AT SARA'S LOCKER       - LATER                                  41\n\n     Sara's back is to a black girl striding purposefully\n     toward her. CHENILLE -- tall, pretty, with about a\n     million braids in her hair -- swoops Sara's backpack from\n     the floor. Thrusts it at her.\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  That's how easy it is to give to\n                  charity around here.

One friend. But\n     Chenille's gone.\n\n\n42   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                42\n\n     Sara memorizes the schedule of classes in her hand. She\n     passes a clutch of students who surround a kid in the\n     middle like a horseshoe. Sara gets a fleeting glimpse of\n     him.\n\n\n     SARA'S POV - PATRICK REYNOLDS\n\n     Eye candy: Tall. Dark. Heartbreakingly handsome. If\n     Patterson were a monarchy, Patrick would be king. He\n     sure holds court like one, turning on his dazzling smile\n     and abundant charm for the crowd. One gets the sense\n     that the All-American Home Boy is almost as enraptured\n     with himself as the sycophants around him.\n\n\n43   INT.

Enjoys a\n     laugh.\n\n\n     ANGLE SHIFTS TO PATRICK\n\n     as Nikki approaches him. Sexy, standoffish and\n     conceited, she's the stuff of wet dreams and futile\n     longing.

A CAR HORN starts to blare.\n     Both of them ignore it. But it goes on like a musical\n     number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a\n     stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at\n     the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he\n     HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille\n     looks at Sara. Then at Roy.\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  That's your old man?

Roy's in front of the open\n     freezer door. Grinning from ear to ear. He motions her\n     over. Sara crosses to the freezer. Looks inside.\n\n\n     INSERT - INSIDE FREEZER\n\n     It's full of frozen dinners.

She opens\n     the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche\n     of falling food. A box of Sugar Puffs cereal lands at\n     her feet. Something else out of place. She picks it up,\n     jams everything back into the freezer. Slams the door\n     shut.\n\n                                                SHOCK CUT TO:\n\n\n60   SARA                                                         60\n\n     in a whirlwind, cleaning the apartment. Wall to wall.\n     Scrubbing away what's churned up inside. The dervish\n     ends in her \"room,\" where she finishes unpacking.\n     Several layers into a suitcase, she comes to her ballet\n     shoes. The sight hits her like a slap in the face. Sara\n     stares at the shoes until her eyes blur. Then she\n     snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet.\n\n\n61   EXT.

He hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them.\n     They continue on like this, the ruins of their world in\n     the b.g. behind them.\n\n\n62   INT./EXT CITY BUS/BALTIMORE STREETS - MORNING                  62\n\n     The bus is crammed with kids. Sara, seated by a window,\n     doesn't bother looking out. Inside's more interesting.\n     The kids cut up. Singing, rapping, and jousting with\n     each other. Some even manage to read.

Be\n               sure they dance into my office\n               next week.\n\n     She moseys on.   Snookie regards Patrick's smile, shakes\n     his head.\n\n\n65   INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - LATER THAT MORNING                       65\n\n     The class has donned lab coats and is ready   to begin when\n     Sarah rushes in. She tries to slink into a    seat. The\n     teacher, MR. HILL, gives her a disapproving   look, points\n     at one of several formulas (C2,H6,O2) on the   blackboard.\n     Sara just looks at him\n\n                             MR. HILL\n               We're cooking today, Ms. Johnson.\n               This is your first lab. You'll\n               need a partner. Mr. Reynolds --\n               Patrick -- will show you the\n               ropes.\n\n     Patrick bounces a smile off unsettled Sara.     This should\n     be fun.\n\n\n66   INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - MINUTES LATER                            66\n\n     The class, in safety goggles and gloves, has partnered\n     up.\n\n\n     ANGLE ON SARA AND PATRICK\n\n     He's holding two vials. Sara picks up a beaker. Stares\n     at the blackboard. She has no idea -- and no intention\n     of admitting it.\n\n                             PATRICK\n                      (very casually)\n               That's too big.\n\n     She glints at him, grits through her teeth.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                30.\n\n66   CONTINUED:                                                       66\n\n                                SARA\n                  I know it's too big.\n\n     She puts the beaker down. Picks up a vial. Flips\n     through her textbook. Her eyes shift from it to the\n     blackboard, trying to make a connection. She settles on\n     one. Picks up a vial of powder. Patrick grabs her hand,\n     leans over and whispers.\n\n                            PATRICK\n              I wouldn't do that if I were you.\n\n                            SARA\n                     (yanks her hand back)\n              Who died and made you teacher?\n\n     Patrick pulls back, looks at her. He can't believe she\n     dissed him. A small smile forms on his face. Sara turns\n     away from it, goes back to her vials. Patrick slides to\n     the farthest end of the table. Watches her consternation\n     with bemusement.\n\n                            PATRICK\n              Know the difference between ethyl\n              glycol and methyl acetate? Both\n              got three elements, two parts the\n              same. It's that first part, C2\n              versus C3. C3 could blow a vial\n              right out a person's hand.\n\n     Sara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents\n     of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she\n     drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in\n     smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat.\n     Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The\n     class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's\n     sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick.\n\n                                MR. HILL\n              What happened?      Everybody back in\n              your seats!\n\n     Patrick stares at Sara.     Her face is red.     She's biting\n     her lip.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                  I misread the component.\n\n                                MR. HILL\n                         (even more angry now)\n                  You? You misread a component.\n                  Don't give me that, Patrick. You\n                  were screwin' around!\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                31.\n\n66   CONTINUED:                                                       66\n\n     Hill's tone is searing. He turns to     Sara. She's trying\n     to say something but the words won't    come out. Hill\n     regards her wearily, then walks off    pushing the curious\n     class back to their stations. Sara     looks at Patrick,\n     weakly mouths \"thanks.\"\n\n\n67   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                           67\n\n     Over the sound of GRUNTING... OPEN CLOSE ON a girl's\n     plump ass. Squirming in too-tight gym shorts that hug\n     the cheeks. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a stout white girl on\n     a balance beam. Trying to get her legs to stand up on\n     it. Hanging on for dear life. From somewhere around\n     her, a WHISTLE BLOWS.\n\n                                TEACHER (O.S.)\n                  Alright, Ms. Diggs. Time!\n\n     WIDEN to see the teacher and her class (FAVOR Sara,\n     Chenille, and Nikki). Amid snickers, the stout girl\n     (\"DIGGY\") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher\n     with her head demurely cast down. Clearing the teacher,\n     Diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air.\n     Gives up the double bird with much attitude. The class\n     loves it. Cheers it. Until the teacher swerves around.\n\n\n67   SERIES OF CLOSE CUTS                                             67\n\n     Chenille on balance beam.    competent but average.\n\n     Nikki on balance beam.    Agile.   Self-assured.   Good.\n\n     ... And then TIGHTER STILL on Sara. Tentatively\n     approaching the balance beam. Mindful of all the eyes on\n     her, all the bated breaths. All waiting to see the new\n     girl fall on her ass. Sara swings herself onto the beam\n     with aplomb. Her legs and body are strong, supple,\n     pliable rubber bands. She flounces across it on her\n     tiptoes. Does a flawless split. Hops off. Looks out.\n\n\n     SARA'S POV - TEACHER AND CLASS\n\n     Reacting with shock and surprise. Awed. Except for\n     Nikki. She stands there with her arms folded.\n     Simmering. Envious.\n\n\n68   PATTERSON HIGH - END OF SCHOOL THAT DAY                          68\n\n     Sara. Heading down the steps with other students.\n     Chenille and Diggy break through the logjam, catch up to\n     her.\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 32.\n\n68   CONTINUED:                                                        68\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  Girl, how you get your legs to\n                  twist like that?\n\n                                DIGGY\n                         (wildly gesticulating)\n                  Yeah. What was all that double-\n                  jointed cheerleader shit?\n\n                                   CHENILLE\n                  This is Diggy.

What's up with that?\n\n                                SARA\n                         (awkwardly)\n                  Nothing's up with it. I used to\n                  kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly.\n\n     Chenille makes an impressed face.          Regards Sara\n     curiously.\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  You should hit Feetz with us\n                  tomorrow night.

He's going to say something, crack some\n     joke about her nearly blowing him up. But Patrick just\n     stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. A nice\n     twinkle. Sara's not entirely immune to it. Chenille\n     breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside. She grabs\n     Snookie's arm, indicates Sara.\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               33.\n\n68   CONTINUED:                                                      68\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  She needs to get hooked up for\n                  Feetz.

I got my rep to watch. I\n                  can't just be gettin' any green\n                  in.\n\n     Sara glares.

And if I still look\n                  green, I think maybe you should\n                  wipe the crust from your eyes.\n\n     Snookie's jaw drops. Patrick cracks up. Diggy too.\n     Chenille's stays on point. She's about solving the\n     problem.\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  You gonna pay the man or what?\n\n                                SNOOKIE\n                  She ain't got it.

Snookie\n     snatches it.\n\n                                SARA\n                  I don't even know where it is.\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  So we'll hook up at my house. Go\n                  together. I will have your I.D.\n\n     Snookie shrugs affirmatively. Patrick looks directly at\n     Sara.

ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                   69\n\n     Roy walks in to see Sara on the futon in her pajamas\n     reading a book. She's got a head full of rollers.\n\n                              ROY\n               I'm splittin'.\n                      (as she barely looks up)\n               Whatcha readin'?\n\n                              SARA\n               Chemistry.\n\n                             ROY\n               You're takin' chemistry?\n\n                             SARA\n               Right now it's taking me.\n\n                             ROY\n               Give yourself some time. Well.\n               See ya in the mornin'. Maybe I'll\n               call between sets.\n\n     Sara really looks up.   Gives him an angelic, sluggish\n     shrug.\n\n                             SARA\n               I'll be asleep.\n\n     He leaves. As soon as Sara hears the front DOOR CLOSE,\n     she jumps up, strips down to bra and panties, races to\n     the closet. One hand rips the rollers from her hair, the\n     other rips through outfits. She's frantic and unsure\n     about choosing the right one.\n\n\n70   EXT. \"BLACK\" STREET (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                70\n\n     Sara. In a skin-tight miniskirt and a bolero jacket.\n     Looking more eighties than nineties, more cute than cool.\n     She walks with tentative, jittery purpose down this\n     poverty stricken street. Doesn't meet anyone's eye. But\n     can feel the eyes on her. She keeps going. She's walked\n     too far to turn back.\n\n\n71   EXT. O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PROJECTS - SARA - NIGHT               71\n\n     Approaching the malignant edifices as the Heights begin\n     to come to life... or death, depending how luck's\n     running. Sara walks into this world of shadows and\n     despite a trepidation, finds something fascinating about\n     the possibility of real danger.\n\n                                                           35.\n\n72   EXT./INT. REYNOLDS APARTMENT/HALLWAY - NIGHT                72\n\n     Chenille triple unlocks the door, lets Sara in. Sara's\n     surprised -- the apartment is surprisingly quaint and\n     extremely neat. It looks a helluva lot better than Roy's\n     place. Chenille is dressed in hugely baggy military-\n     style pants and a tube top with a form-fitting, short-cut\n     leather coat over it. Sara takes it in.\n\n                              SARA\n               Cool outfit.\n\n                              CHENILLE\n               Slammin'.

Decides to lie.\n\n                             CHENILLE\n               Yeah.  You look okay.\n                      (then)\n               Moma Dean. I'm leavin'.\n\n\n     FROM ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n     GRANDMOMMA DEAN enters with a toddler (\"CHRISTOPHER\") in\n     her arms. She sports snow white, waist-length dreads and\n     she's wearing a dashiki lounger. Despite her white\n     locks, she doesn't look old enough to be a grandmother.\n     She hands Christopher to Chenille. Inspects Sara. Her\n     eyes are open, kind.\n\n                             CHENILLE\n                      (fussing over\n                       Christopher)\n               Grandmom, Sara.

Sara looks tentatively at Chenille.\n\n                             SARA\n               Is that... is he... yours?\n\n                             CHENILLE\n               He sure ain't Momma Dean's.\n\n                                                           36.\n\n73   INT./EXT.

Kenny --\n               Christopher's father -- he's the\n               worst. Triflin'. Okay?\n\n\n74   EXT. 6TH AND BROADWAY (EAST BALTIMORE) - NIGHT              74\n\n     A curbed cab. Sara and Chenille get out. Chenille digs\n     into her pocketbook, hands Sara her I.D. PUSH IN ON\n     photo of obese white girl with an untamed trailer trash\n     perm. Sara's eyes go wide.\n\n                              SARA\n               Chenille.   She's ugly.   She's fat!\n\n                            CHENILLE\n              She's twenty-one too. I ain't got\n              all night. Let's hop.\n\n                            SARA\n              Wait. I have to ask you\n              something.\n                     (hard for her)\n              Do I really look alright?\n\n     An unspoken thing passes between them. Chenille suddenly\n     whips off her coat. Gestures at Sara with her head.\n\n                             CHENILLE\n               Gimme that '89 Madonna shit.    Your\n               jacket. Give it here.\n\n     Sara takes off the bolero. Chenille ties it around her\n     own neck, then yanks Sara's miniskirt down around her\n     hips. Sara's torso is clad in a long-sleeved cotton tee.\n     Chenille frowns at it.\n\n                             SARA\n               It's from the GAP.\n\n                             CHENILLE\n               It's country. You look country in\n               it. Take it off.\n\n                             SARA\n               I'm not walking in there in my\n               bra.\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           37.\n\n74   CONTINUED:                                                  74\n\n     Chenille thrusts her leather coat at her. Sara can't\n     believe what she's doing, getting (un)dressed on a public\n     street! She pulls off the tee, slips on Chenille's coat.\n     Buttons it as far as the buttons go. Looks down. Half\n     her chest is exposed.\n\n\n75   EXT. ALLEY (EAST BALTIMORE) - SARA AND CHENILLE - NIGHT     75\n\n     Gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse.\n     Chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to\n     get inside.\n\n                                 CHENILLE\n                  Rope dopes.   C'mon.\n\n     She leads Sara to the door of FEETZ. The Sumo-sized MAN\n     guarding it knows Chenille, digs her. His grin exposes\n     gold-capped teeth.\n\n                               DOORMAN\n               Chenille.    Lookin' fine.   As\n               always.\n\n                             CHENILLE\n               Too fine to stand in line?\n\n     The Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- \"in\" being\n     just inside the front door. A BOUNCER there collects the\n     $10.00 cover charge. Checks their I.D. He hands Sara's\n     back with a smirk.\n\n                             BOUNCER\n               Changed your hair.\n\n     He waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet\n     another bouncer who escorts Sara and Chenille through yet\n     another door.\n\n\n76   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               76\n\n     They march a short distance to an old elevator where a\n     group of kids wait. Bouncer #2 engages the elevator.\n     Everyone piles in.\n\n\n77   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION                           77\n\n     Sara holds onto her stomach as the CREAKY ELEVATOR\n     descends and the MUSIC below rises. The elevator's\n     vibrating with music.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              38.\n\n77   CONTINUED:                                                     77\n\n                                SARA\n                         (an inside to Chenille)\n                  Can't get much more underground\n                  than this.\n\n\n78   INT. FEETZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            78\n\n     A smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids.\n     Mostly black kids with a few whites and Latinos melting\n     in. They share a common goal: To clog the dance floor,\n     flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the\n     masters: Tupac Shakur, NAS, Lauryn Hill, Puff Daddy,\n     etc. Here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed,\n     from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious.\n\n\n     ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n     Sara and Chenille. Sara's excited. She loves that she\n     has to shout to be head over the music.\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  Let's get our table 'fore it gets\n                  crashed and I hafta hurt somebody.\n\n     Sara's bewildered. She doesn't see any tables. She\n     follows Chenille to the back of FEETZ. Sees six or seven\n     tables. All of them have reserved signs. Most of them\n     are filled.\n\n                                SARA\n                  What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?\n\n     Chenille indicates the deejay booth.     Snookie's in it.\n\n                             CHENILLE\n               Snook hooks me up whenever he\n               dees.\n\n     They walk past a SLACKER in lycra pants and a big Army\n     shirt. He licks his tongue at Chenille, grabs at her\n     protruding butt. She swirls around, grabs his crotch\n     hard enough to get his attention. The Slacker is\n     squirming in her clutch.\n\n                             SLACKER\n               Aw'right, aw'right. You got it.\n\n                               CHENILLE\n               Got what?\n                               (MORE)\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                39.\n\n78   CONTINUED:                                                       78\n\n                                CHENILLE (CONT'D)\n                         (as he can't think of\n                          anything but the\n                          squeeze on his balls)\n                  The right to walk past your\n                  greasy, tickle dick self without\n                  your paws on my ass? 'S'that how\n                  I got it?\n\n     Chenille bobs her head right in his face. Sara can't\n     believe it. A few people have stopped and are looking.\n     The Slacker nods hastily. Chenille releases him, gently\n     smoothes out his shirt.\n\n                                 CHENILLE\n                  That's how I thought I had it.\n                          (a fly wave)\n                  See ya.\n\n     She and Sara continue on to back-of-the-club tables.\n     Stop at a reserved one. An adjacent table sports Nikki,\n     her three girl crew... and Diggy. All nurse drinks.\n     Nikki snake-eyes Sara.\n\n                            NIKKI\n              What is up with this place? Seems\n              like they're lettin' anybody in.\n\n                                 CHENILLE\n                  Yeah.   And they started with you.\n\n     The three girls and Diggy snicker. Nikki gives Chenille\n     a look. Turns back to Sara with a snide smirk. Points\n     out her crew.\n\n                               NIKKI\n                  I'm Nikki. Alyssa.

I ain't walkin' on\n                  eggshells just 'cause you brought\n                  the Brady Bunch to the Negro Club.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               40.\n\n78   CONTINUED:                                                       78\n\n                                SARA\n                         (kiss-my-ass polite)\n                  Maybe you came to the wrong spot,\n                  Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one\n                  doesn't have any Negroes.\n\n     Chenille cracks up mainly to back Sara up.       Nikki glowers\n     at her.\n\n                                NIKKI\n                  I'm pretty sure you came with one.\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  Oh, no. Uh-uh, wench. You did\n                  not just call me a Negro.\n\n     As Chenille bucks, Diggy springs up from her seat, runs\n     her arm in the space between Chenille and Nikki like a\n     referee.\n\n                             DIGGY\n               Alright, y'all. Chill.\n\n                                NIKKI\n                  Tell her to chill. She always got\n                  somethin' to say.\n\n                            CHENILLE\n              I can say a lot more. Keep\n              runnin' your mouth, Nikki. I'll\n              lay all your shit bare.\n\n     Whatever shit it is, Nikki's not taking any       chances. She\n     ejects herself from the table, walks off.        The three\n     girls scoot loyally after her. Diggy gets        up. Sits down\n     at Sara's and Chenille's table. Diggy goes        with the\n     flow. That's why she always fits in.\n\n                                DIGGY\n                  Why you burn her like that?\n\n                                CHENILLE\n                  'Cause I can't stand her ass and\n                  the way she played my brother. I\n                  need a drink, Sara. Let's walk.\n\n\n79   INT. FEETZ - ENTRANCE - SAME TIME                                79\n\n     Patrick and Malakai enter with two high school dropouts\n     we will learn are ARVEL and LIP. Females flock to flirt\n     with Patrick and Malakai, who both swell like sponges,\n     soaking up the attention.\n\n                                                                   41.\n\n80   INT. FEETZ - BAR - SAME TIME                                        80\n\n     Chenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging Sara along.\n     A tall, angular twenty-something MAN on the far side of\n     the bar sees her. She sees him. Sucks her teeth, nudges\n     Sara.\n\n                                  CHENILLE\n              That's him.        Comin' over.   Kenny?\n              Don't look.\n\n     So of course Sara does. She makes a silly face at\n     Chenille as Kenny sidles up to her. Chenille rolls her\n     eyes half-heartedly.\n\n                                  KENNY (MAN)\n              What's up?\n\n                            CHENILLE\n              Where's my money, Kenny?\n\n                                KENNY\n                  I'm a little short this week.\n                  Don't jump off.

No. You lyin'.\n\n                                KENNY\n                  Lemme rap to you about the\n                  situation on the dance floor.\n\n     She shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell. She's\n     in love with him. Enough to let him whisper in her ear,\n     sweet-talk her away from the bar. Before she's swallowed\n     up by the crowd, Chenille turns back to Sara, shouts:\n\n                                  CHENILLE\n                  Rum and Coke.    No ice.

Not to\n                  me.\n\n     He walks off. CAMERA TRACKS him going deep inside the\n     club. He wants a drink. He's almost at the bar when he\n     sees Chenille on the dance floor with Kenny. She shrugs\n     a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. Toward\n     Sara. The look is like, help me out. Don't let me leave\n     her hangin'. Patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at\n     Sara, before he really sees her. She looks fly. Hugely\n     fly. He ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's\n     ear.\n\n                                SARA\n                  Rum and Coke, straight up. And a\n                  beer. I don't care.

Let's do it then.    C'mon.\n\n     He coaxes her onto the dance floor. PARLIAMENT'S funk\n     classic \"Flashlight\" is playing. The dance crowd is\n     robustly singing the refrain to the song. There's a\n     party on the floor. FAVOR Sara and Patrick, facing each\n     other. He's moving already. She starts to dance,\n     stiffly, tentatively. Patrick smiles at her. Shakes his\n     head. He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the\n     music.\n\n                             PATRICK\n               Now move your hips.

Everybody got a little\n               light under the sun.'\n\n     The music's beginning to feel good to Sara. Patrick lets\n     go of her hands. Starts to dance. Sara watches him\n     intensely, her body follows his stiffly. Patrick's a\n     good teacher. He leads without leaving her. Whenever\n     she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into\n     another less-complicated one.\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             44.\n\n80   CONTINUED:                                                    80\n\n     Sara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm. Her eyes\n     never wander from his. And then she starts to feel\n     something else. They both do. A rising beat. A\n     quickening heart. And not from the dancing. She smiles\n     bashfully at him. Patrick suddenly grabs her around the\n     waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. All Sara\n     can do is try to keep up and hang on.\n\n\n     FROM ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n     Nikki avidly watching Sara and Patrick with Jasmin and\n     Tiff'ny.\n\n                                JASMIN\n                  She's all up in your nut, Nikki...\n                  Oh, that's right.

They're talking to an\n     Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk. One slips Mohawk\n     a packet of coke, the other takes his money. WIDER as\n     Malakai reaches the dealers. He doesn't explain, doesn't\n     complain. He just starts swinging.\n\n\n     SARA AND PATRICK\n\n     The MUSIC changes and their dance ends. They stand there\n     for a moment, a little caught up in each other. A little\n     unsure of the moment. And then there's a scream!\n     Several of them actually. Patrick reacts to it\n     instinctively. Looking around.

Only then\n     does he look over at Malakai who, eyes engorged with\n     rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping\n     him with no signs of letting up. Patrick can see\n     Malakai's too far gone for talk. He rushes him from\n     behind, nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him\n     away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor.\n\n\n82   EXT.

The\n      back side of it is engraved with the words, \"PATRICK\n      REYNOLDS, M.D.\" Patrick locks eyes with Sara, lifts her\n      hand to his lips. Kisses it softly.

Patrick's arm is around Sara's\n      shoulder. He whispers something in Sara's ear. She\n      laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at\n      them with a muted but obvious repugnance. Watching the\n      woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms\n      around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. Patrick's\n      eyes widen. Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds\n      one of her legs between his and whispers:\n\n                                 SARA\n                   We have an audience.

The white woman, thoroughly disgusted,\n      gets up and moves   to the back of the bus. Patrick and\n      Sara look at each   other, burst out laughing.\n\n\n119   EXT.

Men and women are donned\n      in formal attire. Parking valets hover on the sidewalks\n      waiting for cars. Into this, Sara and Patrick walk. She\n      looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner --\n      \"Boston Ballet, A Command Performance.\" Sara's heart\n      stops. Her feet freeze. Patrick looks at her. She\n      looks positively catatonic.\n\n                                 PATRICK\n                   Surprise...

They're both enraptured. But\n      while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara,\n      her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance. She is\n      utterly, totally engaged and amazed. The yearning that\n      never really left her returns to tug at her heart and\n      project her soul onto the stage.\n\n                                                              73.\n\n121   EXT.

He can't decipher\n      her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it.\n\n                              PATRICK\n                I thought you would like it.\n\n                              SARA\n                I did.\n\n                              PATRICK\n                You ain't actin' like you did.\n\n      She looks over at him, tries to smile.\n\n                              SARA\n                I'm sorry.\n\n      They come to a small, secluded bridge.     Sara sits down on\n      the edge of it. Patrick follows suit.      A long moment.\n\n                              SARA\n                I don't want you to think I didn't\n                have a good time tonight, Patrick.\n                I did.

She's boxed in.\n      Malakai indicates Nikki and Patrick with slick\n      satisfaction, whispers derisively:\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                81.\n\n134   CONTINUED:                                                      134\n\n                                  MALAKAI\n                   You ain't never gonna look as good\n                   as she does with him.

Sara stands there.\n\n\n      PATRICK AND NIKKI\n\n      as a SLOW DANCE BEGINS. Nikki starts to press herself\n      against Patrick. Patrick holds her off with both arms.\n      Walks away.\n\n\n      WIDER ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR - FAVOR PATRICK\n\n      moving toward Sara.\n\n      A stark, apologetic expression on his face. He takes her\n      hand. Sara fiercely jerks away. Patrick grabs her hand\n      again, more emphatically this time. But Sara won't budge\n      from the spot where she's standing. So Patrick slides\n      his arms around her, holds her without moving. They\n      remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly\n      begin to dance. We PUSH IN ON them in this little space.\n      Patrick's lips brush Sara's ear.\n\n                                 PATRICK\n                   Sara...?\n\n                                 SARA\n                   What?\n\n                                 PATRICK\n                I'm sorry.\n\n\n      ANGLE PAST THEM ON MALAKAI\n\n      slow dancing with his flavor of the night. Eyes on Sara\n      and Patrick. Both underwhelmed and resentful of what he\n      sees.\n\n\n135   INT. ROY'S ROWHOUSE - HALLWAY/FRONT DOOR - THAT NIGHT           135\n\n      Sara unlocks the door.

He gets up, follows Sara\n      behind the partition into her \"room.\" They stand there\n      for a moment. He cups her face with his hands. Kisses\n      her. They begin to take off each other's clothes,\n      alternately sure and fumbling; a bit awkward, a bit\n      urgent. Sara unzips Patrick's pants, catches something\n      other than his clothes. Patrick winces in pain. She\n      looks at him with an embarrassed grimace. Says this very\n      low.\n\n                                 SARA\n                   Sorry...\n\n      They kiss again, stumble backward to her futon.

Sara responds to him. They are too engrossed\n      in this intimacy to hear the FRONT DOOR OPENING, to see\n      Roy until he walks in and sees them. Sara leaps up,\n      closes her robe. Patrick doesn't know what to do. He's\n      caught. Straight up. Red-handed. Roy's eyes dart\n      between them, settle on and slice into Patrick.\n\n                                 ROY\n                   Patrick -- it is Patrick, isn't\n                   it?\n                          (a small awkward nod)\n                   Well, I think you were just\n                   leavin'.\n\n      Patrick stands up.

Your call, Sara.\n\n      Patrick jerks his arm free from Sara, grabs his jacket\n      off the back of his chair. He back-talks Roy as he\n      passes him.\n\n                                 PATRICK\n                   Chill, man. I'm goin'.

Sara sharply flinches\n      away. But Roy persists and after a moment, she lets him\n      minister to her.\n\n\n152   INT.

Chenille's cooking with a sound-asleep\n      Christopher slung over her shoulder.

They are piled up like cars on a\n      freeway, waiting to be seen. The noise level is at a\n      peak when Chenille and Sara walk in. Chenille's carrying\n      a fussy Christopher, his diaper bag and her backpack.\n      Sara, wanting to be helpful, reaches for Christopher.\n\n                                 SARA\n                   Want me to take him?\n\n      Chenille shakes her head. Walks to reception to sign\n      herself in. Sara takes in the faces of girls younger\n      than herself, the grime and gloom of the room. It's\n      incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children\n      are brought to get well. Chenille finishes at the desk.\n      Returns to Sara.

Chenille's finally got control of Christopher\n      but he's still crying. Chenille slips off his dirty\n      diaper.

PATTERSON HIGH - SARA'S LOCKER/HALLWAY -                    161\n      LATER THAT DAY\n\n      Sara's at her locker. Patrick walks up to her. She\n      looks at him, tries to smile past the dour expression on\n      his face.\n\n                                    SARA\n                   Hi.\n\n      Patrick doesn't say anything at first.       But then:\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            106.\n\n161   CONTINUED:                                                    161\n\n                                 PATRICK\n                   Thought you might need this on\n                   Saturday. I ain't gonna be able\n                   to make it.\n\n      He hands her an audio cassette of her free form music.\n      Sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this\n      means. She won't let him see how it shatters her. He\n      hesitates, as if he wants to say something else. But\n      Sara turns her back on him and Patrick walks away.\n\n\n      ANOTHER ANGLE - TONI\n\n      approaching Sara's locker. Having seen the encounter\n      between Patrick and Sara, she's as smug and overbearing\n      as ever.\n\n                                 TONI\n                   Lovers' quarrel? You're better\n                   off. That menace to society\n                   would've broken your heart and\n                   spent all your money in a news\n                   flash. Trust me on that, Sara.\n\n      Sara stares at her, uncomprehending at first. She\n      resists the urge to slap the smile off Toni's face.   She\n      gets in it instead.\n\n                                 SARA\n                   Toni, listen carefully. You're a\n                   simple bitch and you don't have\n                   any friends, black or white,\n                   because nobody likes a fucking\n                   asshole.\n\n      She storms off leaving Toni, for once, speechless.\n\n\n162   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY/CAFETERIA - DAY                 162\n\n      Sara. Caught up in a throng of kids and    somehow very\n      separate from them. The walls have been    transformed into\n      veritable billboards for the senior prom   -- decorations\n      are everywhere. Sara continues down the    hallway almost\n      aimlessly into the...\n\n\n163   INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            163\n\n      Sara. Carrying a food tray, eyes searching for a place\n      to sit. She picks up Chenille and her girls at one\n      table... Nikki and her crew at another... Patrick and\n      Snookie... and, finally, Toni. Sara dumps her food into\n      a trash can, walks out.\n\n                                                             107.\n\n164   INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY                                       164\n\n      Sara. Alone. She pushes the tape from Patrick into an\n      ancient recorder. The MUSIC COMES ON. She takes to the\n      floor. Her face is like a pinched nerve. She wants to\n      cry. She tries to dance.\n\n\n165   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      165\n\n      Sara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album.\n      Pictures of her and Glynn. Roy knocks on the partition.\n      Waits a beat before he comes in. He looks at Sara. She\n      keeps flipping.\n\n                              ROY\n                I was wondering... how long you\n                plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an\n                optimist but I hope there's some\n                kind of timetable.\n                       (this raises a\n                        small smile)\n                Well, I don't wanna bug you. I\n                just came in to say good luck.\n\n      Sara regards him quizzically. Roy goes to her dresser,\n      picks up an envelope from Juilliard.\n\n                              ROY\n                I saw the return address. Got\n                curious. It was open. I read it.\n                I know I shouldn't have but at\n                least now I have an excuse to tell\n                you how proud I am of you, Sara.\n\n                              SARA\n                       (quietly miserable)\n                I was gonna tell you about the\n                audition, Roy. I meant to.\n\n      She's clutching the photo album.    Roy sits down next to\n      her.\n\n                              ROY\n                Tomorrow's the big day?\n\n                               SARA\n                Uh-huh.   The big day.\n\n                               ROY\n                You bummed out about it?\n                        (as she shakes\n                         her head)\n                You're a worse liar than I am\n                father.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                   108.\n\n165   CONTINUED:                                                          165\n\n                                 SARA\n                   You're not so bad.\n                          (close to a\n                           confession)\n                   I didn't give you much to work\n                   with.

I screwed up.\n                Did everything in a hurry and\n                still thought I had all the time\n                in the world. To be in love with\n                your mother. Be a father to you.\n                But time flies. You look up one\n                day and all you got to show for\n                yourself is a pretty little girl\n                who hates your guts and won't talk\n                to you because too much time went\n                by.\n\n      Sara's eyes well up.    Before she can stop herself,        she's\n      crying.\n\n                              SARA\n                I don't hate you. I miss her.

Patrick's pissed at me. I'm\n                pissed at him. He's not coming\n                tomorrow and I want him there and\n                I don't know what to do.\n\n      Sara draws back from Roy, wipes her tears.       Collects\n      herself.\n\n                              ROY\n                You want him there. I understand\n                that. But whatever he brings to\n                the table, Patrick can't dance for\n                you, Sara. You're the bottom line\n                out there. This is your chance to\n                be the dancer Juilliard came to\n                see.\n\n                              SARA\n                I wanted somebody there who loves\n                me.\n\n      Roy regards her softly, significantly, the irony\n      implicit.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              109.\n\n165   CONTINUED:                                                     165\n\n                                 ROY\n                   I love you.\n\n      Sara looks up.    For the first time in her life, she\n      believes him.\n\n\n166   INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. WAITING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING         166\n\n      Patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to Arvel's\n      parents, who are clearly stricken. Arvel's father,\n      stoic, holds his wife's hand. Arvel's mother kneads a\n      Kleenex, her face etched with tears. Patrick hugs her.\n      Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off\n      by the palpable grief. Patrick crosses over to him.\n      They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for\n      Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation.\n\n                                 MALAKAI\n                   Why his mom's cryin' like that?\n                   Arvel's gonna make it, right?\n                   That what's his nurse said. She\n                   told me herself, 'Your friend's\n                   gonna make it.' Did that bitch\n                   lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick!\n                   Is he gone?\n\n      Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs\n      him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds\n      him there.\n\n                                 PATRICK\n                   They just got bad news, man. They\n                   don't need to hear it again.\n                          (trying to be\n                           strong; faltering)\n                   Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull\n                   through. Thing is, when he does,\n                   they don't think... he ain't...\n                   shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk\n                   again.\n\n      In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul\n      crumbles. He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief\n      and then a building anger. A stronger man would probably\n      cry.\n\n      Patrick eases his grip. Malakai straightens his body,\n      cocks his head slightly. Studies Patrick in this\n      crooked, derisive way.\n\n                                 MALAKAI\n                   I got a good reason now, man?\n                                 (MORE)\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               110.\n\n166   CONTINUED:                                                      166\n\n                                 MALAKAI (CONT'D)\n                          (off Patrick's silence)\n                   Aw'ight, college boy.

The gleeful squeal of them is everywhere.\n      Patrick guides Christopher down a slide; Chenille catches\n      him at the bottom. Christopher can't get enough of this\n      ride and Patrick and Chenille repeat the routine\n      throughout their conversation.\n\n                                 CHENILLE\n                   Why you so quiet?\n                          (off Patrick's\n                           brooding look)\n                   Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin'\n                   to say?

Malakai has a \"40\" between his legs.\n      He sips from it, passes it to Patrick. Patrick takes a\n      short swig, passes it back to Lip.

Every emotion\n      she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a\n      way that we've never seen before, not even when she was\n      practicing with Patrick. Her body has finally found a\n      way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its\n      meaning and transform her dance.\n\n      The MUSIC ENDS.
