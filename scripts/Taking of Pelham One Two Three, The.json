NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY\r\n\r\n          The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the\r\n          middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks;\r\n          shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the\r\n          screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:\r\n\r\n                         \"1:52\"\r\n          Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual\r\n          face is visible because of his thick white hair, large\r\n          bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The\r\n          rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He\r\n          wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered\r\n          package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing\r\n           it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker --\r\n          \"Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St.\" -- and appears\r\n          quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than\r\n          he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,\r\n          CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:\r\n\r\n          \"SUBWAY.\"\r\n\r\n          INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY\r\n\r\n          A level above the locals, two above the express trains.\r\n          Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens.\r\n          Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives\r\n          his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes\r\n          through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending\r\n          stairways.

DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY\r\n\r\n          Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a\r\n          placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing\r\n          the number \"10\", black on a white ground, indicating the\r\n          point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the\r\n          sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green\r\n          turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the\r\n          track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the\r\n          far end of the platform.\r\n\r\n          SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV\r\n          as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white\r\n          sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train\r\n          roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with\r\n          the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair\r\n          of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now\r\n          MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the\r\n          still-open door, focuses on the T.A.

STATION - BUD'S POV\r\n           SHOOTING THROUGH the conductor's window as the train\r\n           enters the station. We flash by the \"rear-enders\" (those\r\n          I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we\r\n          stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man\r\n          (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different\r\n          from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals\r\n          -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses,\r\n          slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc-\r\n          tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away.\r\n\r\n          PLATFORM - GREY\r\n          RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down-\r\n          track.

FOURTH CAR\r\n\r\n          Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding\r\n          them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts\r\n          with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes\r\n          up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and\r\n          placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He\r\n          surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes.\r\n\r\n          INT. FIRST CAR\r\n\r\n          Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the\r\n          motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between\r\n          his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten\r\n          and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm\r\n          door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before\r\n          them, playing.: at driving the train.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Now he picks up his\r\n          valise, turns and.looks through the door, across the\r\n          platform between the cars, into the fifth car, and catches\r\n          sight of Brown who nods, almost imperceptively.\r\n          Grey makes no sign of recognition at all.

Prescott looks at the four men\r\n          for a moment, uncertainly, then goes after the Secretary\r\n          and speaks to her in low tones.\r\n\r\n                         PRESCOTT\r\n\r\n                         THEY SP\r\n          eak English, don't they?\r\n\r\n                         SECRETARY\r\n          We're not sure.\r\n\r\n                         PRESCOTT\r\n          You're not.\r\n\r\n          SECRETARY .\r\n          We've been proceeding on the\r\n          assumption that they do.\r\n\r\n                         PRESCOTT\r\n          You have.\r\n          The elevator door opens and-she steps in, smiling sweetly.\r\n\r\n                         SECRETARY\r\n          Sayonara.\r\n          The door closes. Prescott shrugs, then turns and smiles\r\n          at the visitors. They smile back. He takes a deep\r\n          breath, then begins.\r\n\r\n                         PRESCOTT\r\n          The New York City Subway System\r\n          is the largest'in the world, with\r\n          237 miles of track and seven\r\n          thousand cars that carry over a\r\n          billion and a third passengers\r\n          every year, making it also the\r\n          busiest railroad in,the world.\r\n          I can see that this last fact\r\n          surprises you.\r\n          The Japanese look anything but surprised.

SHOT - HIPPIE\r\n          He returns his attention to the business of locating his\r\n          gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme\r\n          discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and\r\n          does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise\r\n          of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now,\r\n          lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in\r\n          both hands and starts to take aim.\r\n\r\n          HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV\r\n          with the gun in the foreground, its sight being shifted as\r\n          the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency\r\n          exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment,\r\n          and when it clears, Green has already disappeared through\r\n          the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers\r\n          on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires.
