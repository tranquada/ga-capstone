HOUSE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large\n               homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in\n               a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits\n               nervously.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>               INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's,\n               tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the\n               flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places\n               the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the\n               wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut\n               the canvas from the frame.\n               Daniel rolls up the canvas.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>                                                                          2.\n</b>\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>                                          DANIEL\n</b>                          Let's go.\n\n               Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.\n\n<b>                                       DANIEL\n</b>                          Be careful it's...\n\n               Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans\n               he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner\n               of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.\n\n<b>                                          DANIEL\n</b>                          ... hot!\n\n               Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins\n               beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief.\n               Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He\n               turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the\n               fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat.\n               Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at\n               him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

The entire room fills\n               with light.

He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a\n               very long, double-barrel shotgun.\n               Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man\n               slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down\n               the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom.\n               Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the\n               floor, motionless.\n\n<b>                                          JULIEN\n</b>                          Is he dead?\n\n<b>                                          DANIEL\n</b>                          I don't know.

He grabs his shotgun.\n               Daniel and Julien run to the door.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Start the car!\n\n               Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street\n               and get in the back seat.\n               Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between\n               the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck\n               between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>               INT.

They all slide\n               down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the\n               car shatter.\n\n<b>                                       DANIEL\n</b>                          Raymond, get us out of here!\n\n               Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man\n               opens the breach of the shotgun to reload..\n               Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The\n               engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake.\n               The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes\n               and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take\n               aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>               INT.

Moving through the crowd is\n               SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,\n               dressed in jeans and a \"I Love Paris\" tee-shirt. He passes a\n               MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.\n               Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a\n               vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the\n               cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.\n               Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She\n               zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper\n               catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the\n               cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries\n               to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.\n               The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag\n               away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the\n               bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely\n               in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and\n               BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.\n               He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when\n               he sees...\n\n               HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving\n               towards him .\n               He knows he has no more time.

His eyes are flat and there is an\n               intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to\n               Daniel.

Another gust of wind turns\n               the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's \"Vase with\n               twelve sunflowers\".\n\n               Daniel's jaw drops.
