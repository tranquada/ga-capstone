He\nwearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALVY         \n</b>\t\tThere's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly \n\t\twomen are at a Catskills mountain \n\t\tresort, and one of 'em says: \"Boy, the \n\t\tfood at this place is really terrible.\" \n\t\tThe other one says, \"Yeah, I know, and \n\t\tsuch ... small portions.\" Well, that's \n\t\tessentially how I feel about life.  Full \n\t\tof loneliness and misery and suffering \n\t\tand unhappiness, and it's all over much \n\t\ttoo quickly.  The-the other important \n\t\tjoke for me is one that's, uh, usually \n\t\tattributed to Groucho Marx, but I think \n\t\tit appears originally in Freud's wit and \n\t\tits relation to the unconscious.  And it \n\t\tgoes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... \n\t\t\"I would never wanna belong to any club \n\t\tthat would have someone like me for a \n\t\tmember.\" That's the key joke of my adult \n\t\tlife in terms of my relationships with \n\t\twomen.  Tsch, you know, lately the \n\t\tstrangest things have been going \n\t\tthrough my mind, 'cause I turned forty, \n\t\ttsch, and I guess I'm going through a \n\t\tlife crisis or something, I don't know. \n\t\tI, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.  \n\t\tI'm not one o' those characters, you know. \n\t\tAlthough I'm balding slightly on top, that's \n\t\tabout the worst you can say about me.  I, \n\t\tuh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get \n\t\tolder, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the-\n\t\tthe balding virile type, you know, as \n\t\topposed to say the, uh, distinguished \n\t\tgray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm \n\t\tneither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' \n\t\tthose guys with saliva dribbling out of \n\t\this mouth who wanders into a cafeteria \n\t\twith a shopping bag screaming about \n\t\tsocialism. \n\t\t\t(Sighing) \n\t\tAnnie and I broke up and I-I still can't \n\t\tget my mind around that.  You know, I-I \n\t\tkeep sifting the pieces of the relationship \n\t\tthrough my mind and-and examining my life \n\t\tand tryin' to figure out where did the \n\t\tscrew-up come, you know, and a year ago we \n\t\twere... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and \n\t\t... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a \n\t\tmorose type.  I'm not a depressive character.  \n\t\tI-I-I, uh, \n\t\t\t(Laughing) \n\t\tyou know, I was a reasonably happy kid, \n\t\tI guess.

As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in \nthe distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, \nas Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation.

You know, you can tell \n\t\tright off the bat that I don't look like \n\t\ta funny guy when I come-you know, like some \n\t\to' the guys that come out.

I was ... \n\t\tin analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a \n\t\tmatter of fact, uh, I would have killed \n\t\tmyself but I was in analysis with a strict \n\t\tFreudian and if you kill yourself ... they \n\t\tmake you pay for the sessions you miss.\n\n<b>INT.

I realized what a \n\t\tterrific person she was and-and how much \n\t\tfun it was just knowing her and I-I \n\t\tthought of that old joke, you know, this-\n\t\tthis-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and \n\t\tsays, \"Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He \n\t\tthinks he's a chicken.\" And, uh, the \n\t\tdoctor says, \"Well, why don't you turn \n\t\thim in?\" And the guy says, \"I would, but \n\t\tI need the eggs.\" Well, I guess that's \n\t\tpretty much how how I feet about \n\t\trelationships.  You know, they're totally \n\t\tirrational and crazy and absurd and ... \n\t\tbut, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it \n\t\tbecause, uh, most of us need the eggs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE END\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVES INTO:\n</b>\n<b>BLACK BACKGROUND; \n</b>\ncredits popping on and off in white.\n\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Annie Hall</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Woody Allen\" title=\"Scripts by Woody Allen\">Woody Allen</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Marshall Brickman\" title=\"Scripts by Marshall Brickman\">Marshall Brickman</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Annie Hall Script.html#comments\" title=\"Annie Hall comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:58:48.444448"}
