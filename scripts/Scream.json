She tries her\ndamndest to hang tough.\n\n                CASEY\n        Look, enough is enough.

If\n        you get it right-Steve lives.\n\nThree curtainless windows line one wall.  Casey crouches down\nbehind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening\nthe room.

Exploding glass sprays\neverywhere.\n\nThis incites Casey like fire.  She springs to her feet...bolting\nout of the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered\ndoorframe.\n\nANGLE ON CASEY\n\nSomewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to\nFEET ON CRACKING GLASS.  She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly\nsliding it up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the\nfront door.\n\nCasey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.  She\nholds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other.\n\nCasey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in\nthe house.  She starts to reach for it.  Fuck it, she takes off...\n\nEXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE\n\nCasey it at the back corner of the house.\n\n                MAN\n        I can hear you. I know you're here.\n\nCasey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side\nof the house...going for the front yard.  She must pass the three\ncurtainless windows.  She gets to the first one and peeks in...\n\nThe FIGURE has pulled open the foyer closet, searching for her.\n\nCasey creeps along, to the next window, she looks in...the FIGURE\nis completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall\nthat leads to other parts of the house.\n\nShe moves further along the house...squeezing by hedges...to the\nthird window...she peeks in to the FIGURE...\n\nSTARING BACK AT HER...\n\nHis face covered with a ghostly white mask, inches from her...his\neyes piercing through...soulless...Casey SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as\na hand...\n\nCRASHES through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck...she\nbeats at him trying to free herself...her nails dig into his\narm...she wrenches from side to side...finally breaking free as\nthe hands disappear inside the house...\n\nEXT.  CORNER OF HOUSE\n\nCasey sails around the corner of the house, eyeing the front door.\nIt remains closed.  Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when\nsuddenly....\n\nHEADLIGHTS APPEAR\n\nin the distance, coming down the road towards the house...she\nrecognizes them instantly.  Mom...Dad...she tears off across the\nyard toward them...moving like lightning...\n\nThe car turns into the driveway...Casey SCREAMS, waving madly,\nrushing by a tree as...\n\nTHE GHOST MASKED FIGURE APPEARS\n\nCasey stumbles back, catching her balance...the FIGURE moves on\nher, arm poised high...a flash of silver...and Casey is struck,\nacross the chest.  She looks down to see her shirt blossoming\nred...a look of bewilderment as she drops to one knee.\n\nThe knife rises again...Casey throws her hand forward...the blade\ncomes down...but it's blocked by the portable phone still in her\nhand.  She turns staggering to...\n\nEXT.  DRIVEWAY\n\nA MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE emerge from the parked car.  They move to the\nfront door completely unaware of what's happening to their\ndaughter, only feet from them.\n\nEXT.  FRONT YARD\n\nCasey stumbles forward...her parents ten feet away...she opens her\nmouth to scream but no sound resonates...she is beyond\nwords...staggering, swaying...the FIGURE moving behind her.\n\nEXT.  FRONT DOOR\n\nHer parents approach the door\n\n                FATHER\n        That fish smelled strong.\n\n                MOTHER\n        I told you to send it back.\n\nThe father discovers the front door ajar.  A puzzled look.  Casey\nis right behind them with one arm outstretched.  If they'd only\nturn around...\n\nThey enter the house and close the door as....\n\nCasey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest...the\nFIGURE upon her.\n\nINT.  FOYER\n\nThe father sees straight back into the kitchen...the shattered\npatio door.\n\n                FATHER\n        Jesus...\n\n                MOTHER\n        What is it?

The mother is hysterical.\n\nEXT.  FRONT YARD\n\nCLOSE ON Casey...she's dragged by her feet through damp soil...the\nlife going fast from her body...her hand still clutching the\nphone.\n\nINT.

She jiggles the base.\n\n                FATHER\n            (searching)\n        Casey? Where are you honey? Call the\n        police, goddammit.\n\n                MOTHER\n        The phone's dead.\n\nThe...the softest...faintest voice is heard...\n\n                CASEY\n            (from phone)\n        ..help me...\n\n                MOTHER\n        She's here, God, I can hear her.\n        Where's my baby?\n\nThe husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the\nphone.\n\n                FATHER\n        Where is she?\n\n                MOTHER\n        I can hear her.

That of his\nwife.  He tears off for the front door.\n\nEXT.  FRONT DOOR\n\nThe father rushes out the door to find his wife, on her knees,\nbent over, retching.  His eyes move beyond to a tree in the front\nyard...his stomach fails him...his dinner rises...as he bares\nwitness to the single, most horrifying sight he'll ever see.\n\nThat of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak\ntree...strung up...very much dead...her stomach ripped open.\n\nBLACKOUT!\n\nBEGIN MAIN TITLES\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT\n\nA teenage girl's room.  Neat and pinkish.  On the bed, amongst age-\nold stuffed animals lie opened school books. The CAMERA PANS to a\ndesk against the wall where...\n\nSIDNEY PRESCOTT\n\na young girl of 17, sits, her face glued to the computer monitor\nin front of her.  CLOSE ON her face.  Sharp and clever with deep,\nlonely eyes.  She's comfortable in a plain, flannel nightgown.\n\nHer hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly...\n\nCRASH-BOOM\n\nA noise behind her.  She turns abruptly, eyeing an open window\nacross the room. A SCRATCHING sound.  She stands and moves toward\nit.\n\nEXT.  WINDOW\n\nSidney sticks her head out the window.  The late night wind hits\nher face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand\nreaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her...\n\nINT.  BEDROOM\n\nSid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure...breaking free,\nfalling back onto the floor.\n\n                VOICE\n            (o.c.)\n        Hey...it's just me.\n\nSid looks up to see...\n\nBILLY LOOMIS\n\nA young, strapping boy of seventeen.

The doorknob catches on the open\ncloset door behind it jamming it, holding it in place.\n\n                VOICE\n            (from behind door)\n        What's going on in there?\n\nBilly quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed.  Sidney unjams\nthe door to reveal...\n\nMR. PRESCOTT, late 40's, a severe presence.  A distracted man,\nnervous and pre-occupied.\n\n                MR.

My\n        flight leaves first thing in the morning.\n        Now the expo runs all weekend so I\n        won't be back til Sunday.

All the good\n        stuff was cut out and I started thinking\n        about us and how two years ago, we started\n        off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid \"R\"\n        rating on our way to an NC17. And how\n        things have changed and, lately, we're just\n        sot of...edited for television.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        So you thought you could sneak in my\n        window and we would  have little bump-\n        bump.\n\n                BILLY\n        No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your\n        underwear rule. I just thought we might do\n        some on top of the clothes stuff.\n\nShe snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips.\nPassionate and gentle.  He, however, reacts like a shark, moving\non top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into\nher...Sidney breaks away.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Time to go, stud bucket.\n\nBilly sits up.  His heart isn't racing...it's POUNDING.\n\n                BILLY\n        See what you do to me.\n\nSweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        You know what my dad will do to you?\n\n                BILLY\n        I'm going...I'm going.\n\nHe moves to the window.  She follows, motioning to his wound.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I appreciate the romantic gesture.\n\nShe gives him a kiss goodnight.  Sweet and simple.\n\n                BILLY\n            (whisper)\n        Hey..about the sex stuff. I'm not trying\n        to rush you. I was only half serious.\n\nShe kisses him again as he eases through the window.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Would you settle for a PG-13\n        relationship?\n\n                BILLY\n        What's that?\n\nShe pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her\nleft breast.  His mouth drops open...surprise, shock.  Their eyes\nmeet.  They share a smile.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Get outa here.\n\nINT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\nCLOSE on Sidney snuggling her pillow, sleeping peacefully when...\n\nTHE RADIO ALARM BLASTS from the night table loud enough to wake\nthe dead.

Sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly.\nA car trunk SLAMS shut outside.\n\nSidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in\ntime to see her Dad jumping in his car.  She half waves down at\nhim but he doesn't see her.  He's as good as gone, pulling out of\nthe driveway and disappearing down the road.\n\nA moment as Sidney stands at the window, staring out after him.\n\nEXT.  SCHOOL - MORNING\n\nCLOSE ON A SIGN\n\n\"BAYBORO HIGH SCHOOL.  HOME OF THE FIGHTING BULLDOGS\"\n\nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a picture perfect small town\nschool.  Old and charming.

SIDEWALK\n\nSidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.  Four different\nREPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four\ndifferent news reports.\n\nShe moves passed a policeman standing guard.  Her interest peaked,\nshe stops at the first reporter who is...\n\nGALE WEATHERS\n\nThirties.  He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a\nmassive mane of chemically enhanced hair.\n\n                GALE\n            (for the camera)\n        The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina\n        was devastated last night when two young\n        teenagers were found brutally butchered.\n        Authorities have yet to issue a statement\n        but our sources tell us that no arrest\n        has been made and the murderer could\n        strike again...\n\nON SIDNEY.

She sits next to me in\n        English.\n\n                TATUM\n        Not anymore. Her parents found her\n        hanging from a tree. Her insides on the\n        outside.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Do they know who did it?\n\n                TATUM\n        Fucking clueless-they're interrogating\n        the entire school.

A tragic look upon her face.\n\n                MRS. TATE\n        ..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable\n        loss. It's days like today we need\n        prayer in school...\n\nSidney sits near the rear of the room.  The desk in front of her\nsits vacant.  Sidney can't take her eyes of it.\n\nThe door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.  He hand\ns it to Mrs. Tate.\n\n                MRS. TATE\n        Sidney.

Crowded at one table\nis the \"gang\".  This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum.\n\nNext to Tatum, sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped\nacross her back.  He's a Billy wannabe.  Almost the jock, almost\nhandsome, almost cool.  He tries way to hard.\n\nAcross the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY.  A tall and gangly kid\nwith no such Billy-like aspirations.  A witty jokester who\nelevates geek to coolness.\n\n                TATUM\n        Hunt? Why would they ask if you like\n        to hunt?\n\n                STU\n        I don't know, they just did.\n\n                RANDY\n        Because their bodies were gutted.\n\nSidney flinches.\n\n                BILLY\n        Thanks Randy.\n\n                TATUM\n        They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.\n\n                STU\n        Because there's no way a girl could have\n        killed them.\n\n                TATUM\n        That is so sexist. The killer could\n        easily be female-BASIC INSTINCT.\n\n                RANDY\n        That was an ice pick-not exactly the\n        same.\n\n                STU\n        Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely\n        hollowed out.

SIDNEY'S HOUSE - LATER\n\nA huge two story country home with a spacious lawn.\n\nA yellow school bus stops in front of the house and Sidney steps\noff.\n\nThe house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the\nfront door.\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - LATER\n\nSidney is on the telephone.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (into phone)\n        You sure I can stay over?

She sits in front of it staring at the blue screen...her own\nreflection staring back.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\nSidney comes down the stairs, her arms carrying a change of\nclothes, toothbrush, make-up...\n\nShe opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the\ntop shelf.  Moving into the living room she loads it up, plopping\ndown on the sofa, hitting the TV remote.\n\nCLOSE ON THE SCREEN\n\nA news reporter fades in.\n\n                REPORTER #1\n            (on TV)\n        The entire nation was shocked today by\n        the teen murders in North Carolina...\n\nSidney switches channels.\n\n                REPORTER #2\n        The State Bureau of Investigation has\n        joined forces with local authorities to\n        help catch what the Governor has called\n        the most heinous...\n\nThe channel switches again.  Gale weathers appears, standing in\nfront of the school.  Her white teeth gleaming.\n\n                GALE\n        This is not the first time the small town\n        of Bayboro has endured such tragedy. Only\n        a year ago, Maureen Prescott, wife and\n        mother, was found raped and murdered...\n\nAn old black and white snapshot fills the screen-a woman,\nbeautiful and familiar.\n\nCLOSE ON SIDNEY\n\neyes frozen, mesmerized by the image.  Suddenly she CLICKS the TV\noff.  Her eyes go to the clock on the end table.  5:45 PM.  Her\neyes then move to the framed photo next to it...the same black and\nwhite photo stares at her...a healthy, vibrant woman.  An older\nversion of Sidney.\n\nSidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight...\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\nThe clock on the end table reads 7:15 PM.  Sidney is fast asleep\non the couch.  The phone RINGS.  Sidney leaps up grabbing the\nportable phone.\n\n                TATUM\n            (from phone)\n        Practice ran late. I'm on my way.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (eyes clock)\n        It's past seven.\n\n                TATUM\n        Don't worry.

I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in\n        ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you\n        pause it just right you can see his penis.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Whatever. Just hurry.\n\n                TATUM\n        Bye.\n\nShe hangs up the phone.  It immediately RINGS again.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (into phone)\n        Tatum?\n\n                MAN'S VOICE\n            (from phone)\n        Hello, Sidney.\n\nIT'S HIM.  THE VOICE FROM BEFORE.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Hi. Who is this?\n\n                MAN\n        You tell me.\n\nSidney thinks, trying to place his voice.  It sounds a little\ndistorted.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I have no idea.\n\n                MAN\n        Scary night, isn't it? With the murders\n        and all, it's like right out of a horror\n        movie or something.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are\n        you calling from work? Tatum's on her\n        way over.\n\n                MAN\n        Do you like scary movies, Sidney?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I like that thing you're doing with your\n        voice, Randy. It's sexy.\n\n                MAN\n        What's your favorite scary movie?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Don't start. You know I don't watch that\n        shit.\n\n                MAN\n        And why is that?\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (playing along)\n        Because they're all the same. It's\n        always some stupid killer stalking some\n        big breasted girl-who can't act-who\n        always runs up the stairs when she should\n        be going out the front door. They're\n        ridiculous.\n\nA brief silence.\n\n                MAN\n        Are you alone in the house?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me,\n        Randy.\n\n                MAN\n        Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        So who are you?\n\n                MAN\n        The question is not who am I. The\n        question is where am I?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        So where are you?\n\n                MAN\n        Your front porch.\n\nThis gives her pause.  She moves to the window and pulls aside the\ndrapes.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Why would you call me from my\n        front porch?\n\n                MAN\n        That's the original part.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDOW.  She can't quite see all of the porch.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Oh yeah? Well I call your bluff.\n\nSidney goes to the front door.  She unlocks the bolt, unsnags the\nchain, and pulls the door open...revealing the front porch...\n\nCOMPLETELY EMPTY.\n\nShe steps out onto it, phone still in hand.  A single light shines\noverhead illuminating the porch, but little beyond.  Darkness is\nall around.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        So where are you?\n\n                MAN\n        Right here.\n\nSidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on\neither side of the porch.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Can you see me right now?\n\n                MAN\n        Uh-huh.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        What am I doing?\n\nShe sticks her finger up her nose, pretending to pick.  Silence.\nNo answer.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry.\n        Bye now.\n\n                MAN\n        If you hang up, you'll die just like your\n        mother.\n\nSidney stops dead in her tracks, speechless.\n\n                MAN\n            (deadly)\n        Do you want to die, Sidney? Your mother\n        didn't.\n\nHis seriousness unnerves her.  Sid flies off the handle.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        FUCK YOU! YOU CRETIN!\n\nShe hangs up on him.  Moves back inside the house.  Locks, chains,\nand bolts the door when...\n\nA FIGURE COMES LEAPING OUT OF THE HALL CLOSET\n\nrushing her, ramming into her side..the phone flies..the FIGURE is\non top of her as she goes down...SCREAMING...\n\nShe looks up to see the FIGURE, darkly dressed with a pale,\ndistorted face, white and ghostly...a mask.\n\nHer instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the\ncontact with his leg...he topples over...coming right at her, his\nhand finding her neck.  Suddenly, along, silver blade appears\nabove her.\n\nSidney pulls, jerks, twists...finally she lifts her torso forward\nknocking the FIGURE off her...sending him reeling into the living\nroom.  Wasting no time, Sidney leaps to her feet.\n\nShe moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it\ncatches on the chain.  Shit!  She pushes it closed again looking\nbehind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand.\nSidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and...\n\nRUNS UP THE STAIRS.  The FIGURE right behind her.\n\nINT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING\n\nThe FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs\nmadly at the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet\ncountry home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the\nwall swinging it behind her...\n\nIt catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending\nhim backwards, tumbling down the stairs.  Sidney races to her\nbedroom...\n\nINT.  BEDROOM\n\nShe locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing\nthe edge right at the door knob just as...\n\nTHE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR...\n\nramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a\ncrazy vice-like hold.\n\nSidney grabs the desk phone.  It's dead...off the hook downstairs.\n\nThe figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but\nwon't give.\n\nSidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly.\n\nCLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR.\n\n        FAX MODEM\n\n        9-1-1 SEND\n\nThe knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly.\n\nON SCREEN AGAIN\n\n        HELP KILLER\n\n        34 ELM ST\n\nSidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.  The\nFIGURE is gone.  A fearful silence.  She looks around...the only\nsound her own rapid, terrified BREATHING.\n\nON THE SCREEN\n\n        \"Stay calm.  Police enroute.\"\n\nSuddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see...\n\nBILLY\n\nher boyfriend, staring at her, surprised.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Oh Billy...Please...God...\n\n                BILLY\n        I heard screaming. The door was locked.\n        Are you okay...\n\n                SIDNEY\n        He's here. He's trying to kill me...\n\nBilly pulls himself through the window.  As he does, a small black\nobject falls from his dark jeans.  It hits the floor as Sidney\neyes it...a sleek, compact cellular phone.\n\nSidney stops in her tracks.  Their eyes meet...an eternity.  A\nSIREN is heard in the distance.  Sidney bolts...\n\n                BILLY\n        Hey...wait...what's goin..\n\nBilly reaches for her.  Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears\nout of the room.\n\nINT.  LANDING\n\nSidney nearly falls down the stairs...\n\nINT.  FOYER\n\nShe rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to\nface with a white, ghostly mask.\nA massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as...\n\nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK\n\nto find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.  Red lights flash, sirens\nBLAST vas car after car surrounds the house.\n\nSidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms.\n\nEXT.  FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER\n\nThe yard is a whirlwind of activity.  An ambulance, squad cars,\ncops everywhere...\n\nCLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE\n\nas it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.  His hands are\nbeing cuffed, his rights being read.\n\n                BILLY\n            (screaming)\n        I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid?\n        Ask her, she'll tell ya...\n\nDewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out.\n\n                DEWEY\n        We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        Hank Loomis' kid?

Tatum gets out, freaked beyond belief.\n\nBack to the Sheriff and Dewey as they storm across the yard.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I was first to respond.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        What were you doing out here?\n\n                DEWEY\n        Drive by patrol.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        How is she?\n\n                DEWEY\n        She's tough.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        Have to be. The shit she's gone through.\n\nAcross the yard sits Sidney, in the back of an ambulance as\nPARAMEDICS check her out.\n\nSheriff Burke and Riley approach.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        We're seeing a lot of you today.\n\nShe tries to smile but fails.\n\n                DEWEY\n        You gonna be able to come down to the\n        station and talk to us a bit?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        ..yeah...\n\nTATUM appears, barreling past an OFFICER.\n\n                TATUM\n        What happened?

POLICE STATION\n\nA small town station.  The bull pen is a little square room with\nfour desks and tonight--it's hopping.  Cops everywhere.\n\nINT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE\n\nSidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.  She wears the\nSheriff's jacket over her shoulders.

School officials have yet\n        to comment but this is the same type of\n        mask worn by the killer...\n\nINT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER\n\nJust before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students\nheading to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.\n\n                TATUM\n        I want you to meet me here right after\n        class, okay?\n\nBilly appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots\nhim first.\n\n                TATUM\n        Shit, what is he doing here?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I bet he's pissed.\n\n                TATUM\n        Just ignore him. You had good reason to\n        think what you did.\n\nBilly and Stu approach.  Billy's face is solemn.\n\n                BILLY\n        Hi, Sid. Can we talk a sec?\n\nSidney says nothing.  She can barely look at him.  Tatum\nintervenes.\n\n                TATUM\n        You know if I were accused of carving up\n        two people, I'd take the opportunity to\n        skip school.\n\n                STU\n        Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.\n\n                BILLY\n        Talk to me, Sid.\n\nSuddenly, a SCREAM erupts.  All eyes go to a GHOST MASKED STUDENT\nrunning down the hall, screaming wildly, running amuck.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Why are they doing this?\n\n                STU\n        Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.\n\nBilly punches Stu in the side.\n\n                STU\n        Owwww...\n\n                BILLY\n        You open your mouth and stupidity pours\n        out.\n\n                STU\n        Sorry.\n\nSidney, clearly upset, takes off down the hall.  Billy races off\nafter her.\n\n                TATUM\n            (yelling)\n        Stay away from her, Billy.\n\nTatum SLAMS her locker door shut as the bell RINGS.\n\nINT.  CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER\n\nWith first period underway, the halls have cleared.  One or two\nstruggling students can be seen rushing to class.\n\nSidney moves quickly down the hall, rounding a corner, running\nsmack into...\n\nBILLY\n\nThey collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out\nof her.  She falls backwards, but Billy catches her fall.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Jesus, SHIT!\n\n                BILLY\n        Hey, hey, it's just me.\n\nSidney pulls away from him quickly.  Billy feels the slight.\n\n                BILLY\n        What? You don't still think it's me?\n\nSidney catches her breath.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        No...I don't...it's just...Oh God, Billy,\n        someone was there, someone tried to\n        kill me.\n\n                BILLY\n        The police say I scared him off. It\n        wasn't me, Sid.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I know. He called again last night at\n        Tatum's house.\n\n                BILLY\n        See, it couldn't have been me. I was in\n        jail, remember?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I'm so sorry...please understand.\n\n                BILLY\n        Understand what? That I got a girlfriend\n        who would rather accuse me of being a\n        psychopathic killer than touch me.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        You know that's not true.\n\n                BILLY\n        Then what is it? Is there somebody else?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        No...\n\n                BILLY\n        Is it the sex thing? Am I being too\n        pushy?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm\n        still adjusting to my mom.\n\n                BILLY\n        It's been a year since she died.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (correcting him)\n        Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.\n\n                BILLY\n        When are you gonna let that go, Sid?\n        When my mom left my dad--I just accepted\n        it. This is the way it is. She's not coming\n        back.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (sharply)\n        Your parents split up. It's not the same\n        thing. Your mom left town, she's not in\n        a coffin somewhere.\n\n                BILLY\n        You have to move on, Sid.\n\nSidney starts to walk away but turns back, angry.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I'm glad to know you're coping so well\n        with life, Billy. But some of us aren't so\n        perfect. Some of us are just trying to\n        hold on.\n\nSidney disappears through a door marked GIRL'S BATHROOM, leaving\nBilly alone in the hallway.  He SMACKS his forehead, pissed at\nhimself.\n\nINT.  GIRL'S BATHROOM\n\nLarge and spacious.  Closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a\nrow of sinks and a huge mirror.  Sidney enters as TWO GIRLS tinkle\nand talk--each from their respective stalls.\n\n                GIRL #1\n        She was never attacked. I think she made\n        it all up.\n\n                GIRL #2\n        Why would she lie about it?\n\n                GIRL #1\n        For attention. The girl has some serious\n        issues.\n\nSidney listens intently.\n\nA toilet FLUSHES.  Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just\nas GIRL #1 appears from a stall.  She looks like that voice--a\nsnotty little twit.\n\n                GIRL #1\n        What if she did it? What if Sidney\n        killed Casey and Steve?\n\n                GIRL #2\n        And why would she do that?\n\n                GIRL #1\n        Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed\n        them both in a jealous rage.\n\nAnother toilet FLUSHES.\n\n                GIRL #2\n        Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?\n        She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.\n\n                GIRL #1\n        Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.\n\nINSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.  Her face weakening.\n\n                GIRL #2\n        You're evil.\n\n                GIRL #1\n        Please, it's common knowledge. Her\n        mother was a trollop.\n\nGIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.  They both stand in\nfront of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.\n\n                GIRL #2\n        Cut some slack. She watched her mom get\n        butchered.\n\n                GIRL #1\n        And it fucked her up royally. Think\n        about it. It makes perfect sense. Her\n        mom's death leaves her distraught and\n        hostile at a cruel and inhumane world,\n        she's disillusioned, where's God, etc.\n        Completely suicidal. And one day she\n        snaps. She wants to kill herself but\n        realizes teen suicide is out this year.\n        And homicide is a much healthier\n        therapeutic expression.\n\nFrom the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.\n\n                GIRL #2\n        Where do you get this shit?\n\n                GIRL #1\n        Ricki Lake.\n\nThe two girls exit.  Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her\nreflection in the mirror.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Pathetic.\n\nWater DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from\nthe cracked transom above the bathroom door.  It sound almost like\na whisper,   \"Siddneey...\"\n\nSidney spins around.  What the...  She checks out the bathroom.\nThe doors to the stalls are all closed.  She bends down and scans\nbeneath them, looking for feet.  No one.  Nothing.\n\nSidney turns back to the mirror.  Suddenly...\n\n                MAN\n            (o.c. whisper)\n        Siddneey...\n\nUnmistakable this time.  The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail\nthrough the eye.  It comes from one of the stalls.  She stands\nthunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Is someone there?\n\nA long, morose silence.  And then:\n\n                MAN\n            (softly, simply)\n        It's me, Sidney.\n\nSidney spins around.  Fuck no!  HE'S HERE.  Terror floods her\nface.  She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must\npass to get to it.\n\nShe checks under the stalls again.  Nothing...where the fuck is\nhe?  She takes a step forward when...\n\nTWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall.\nSidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open.\nShe bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet\nfloor...her feet flying out from under...\n\nSidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from\nfalling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her.\nA hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit\ndoor...narrowly escaping.\n\nINT.  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS\n\nSidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the\nhallway, not looking back.  A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer\nout from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not\nstopping...running madly.\n\nINT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\nCLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot\nact.\n\nMR. HIMBRY\nI'm sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing,\nthieving, whoring generation disgusts me.\n\nThe CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS\nstanding at attention.  Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the\nstudent's heads.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n        Two students have been savagely murdered.\n        And this is how we express our compassion\n        and sensivity?\n\nHe rips the mask off the other student.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n        We throw on a mask and dance around\n        campus just hoping someone else gets\n        butchered before we get bored again.\n        You're both expelled.\n\nThe GHOSTS doth protest...\n\n                GHOST #1\n        Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a\n        joke.\n\n                GHOST #2\n        Yeah, that's not fair.\n\nA deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry's face.  Neither\nstudent budges, scared to even breathe.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n        No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to\n        rip your insides out and hang you from\n        a tree so you can be exposed for the\n        desensitized, heartless little shits that\n        you are.\n\nSuddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears, hysterical.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (crying)\n        He's here...I saw him...he's here...\n\nMr. Himbry rushes to her, arms outstretched.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n        Easy child.\n\nSidney collapses in his arms.\n\nEXT.  SCHOOL STREET - MINUTES LATER\n\nDewey's patrol jeep is parked in front of the school.  He stands\nin the open driver's door talking on the radio.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n            (from radio)\n        She's okay. Looks like some boys were\n        teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the\n        school though. I want you to take look\n        around.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Yes, sir, sheriff.\n\nDewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when Gale Weathers\nappears, her fake face aglow.\n\n                GALE\n        Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent,\n        INSIDE STORY.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I know who you are, ma'am. How's the\n        eye?\n\n                GALE\n        Productive. So they're closing down the\n        school?\n\n                DEWEY\n        Well..uh...yes ma'am. For the time being.\n\nDewey heads for the school building. Gale scurries along side him\nflirtatiously.\n\n                GALE\n        And why is that? Has something happened?\n\n                DEWEY\n        You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.\n\n                GALE\n        I know, I should be in New York covering\n        the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew?\n        Please, call me Gale. You look awfully\n        young to be a police officer.\n\nDewey's eyes wander down to Gale's long legs, the way her hips\nmove as she walks...he's clearly distracted.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.\n\n                GALE\n        Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study\n        I proved to be most popular amongst\n        males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course,\n        you don't look a day over twelve, except\n        in the upper torso area. Does the force\n        require that you work out?\n\nDewey looks away, blushing a bit.\n\n                DEWEY\n        No, ma'am. Because of my boyish good\n        looks, muscle mass has increased my\n        acceptance as a serious police officer.\n\nThey approach the school's front entrance.  Suddenly, Mr. Himbry's\nVOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA\nsystem.  They stop to listen.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n            (via PA)\n        \"Your attention please. Due to the\n        recent events that have occurred and\n        until it comes to a resolve--effective\n        immediately--all classes are suspended\n        til further notice. The Bayboro Police\n        Dept. has also asked me to announce a\n        city wide curfew beginning at 6 o'clock\n        PM. I repeat...\"\n\nGale speaks over Mr. Himbry's voice.\n\n                GALE\n        Boy, you people sure do make fuss over\n        a serial killer.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Serial killer is not really accurate,\n        ma'am. The killer has yet to strike\n        twice.\n\n                GALE\n        Well, we can hope, can't we? We\n        certainly don't have any leads. A ghost\n        mask, a cellular phone--not much there.\n\n                DEWEY\n        We're tracking the cellular phone bill.\n\n                GALE\n        Really? You small town guys are good.\n        And have you located Sidney's father?\n\n                DEWEY\n        No, not yet.\n\n                GALE\n        He's not a suspect, is he?\n\n                DEWEY\n        We haven't ruled out that possibil...\n\nDewey, realizing he's said too much, clams up.\n\n                DEWEY\n        If you'll excuse me, ma'am.\n\n                GALE\n        Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.\n\n                DEWEY\n        That's quite alright. If I may say so,\n        ma'am, you're much prettier in person.\n\nDewey starts up the school's front steps as the bell RINGS.\n\n                GALE\n        So you do watch the show?\n\nHe turns to her earnestly as STUDENTS come pouring out the front\ndoors.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole\n        year.\n\n                GALE\n        You are precious. Please, call me Gale.\n\nShe smiles deliciously, gives him a wink, then struts off as\nDewey, like a nervous little school boy watches her go.\n\nINT.  SCHOOL CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER\n\nSchool is clearing out.  The halls have begun to empty as Tatum\nescorts Sidney down the hallway.\n\n                TATUM\n        It was just some sick fuck having a\n        laugh.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        It was him, Tatum. I know it.\n\nTatum wants to believe her but...\n\n                TATUM\n        You are not to be alone again. Is that\n        clear? If you pee--I pee.\n\nStu appears.\n\n                STU\n        Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid,\n        what happened?\n\n                TATUM\n        For once, Stu, drop it.\n\n                STU\n        Okay, but whatever you did--the entire\n        student body thanks you.\n\nStu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss.\n\n                STU\n        And to celebrate this impromptu fall\n        break, I propose we have a party.\n        Tonight, my house.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Are you serious?\n\n                STU\n        My parents are out of town. It'll be\n        like my hurricane bash last year.\n        Nothing extreme. Just a few of us,\n        hangin'.\n\nTatum warms to the idea.\n\n                TATUM\n        This could be good. What do you think,\n        Sid?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I don't know...\n\n                TATUM\n        Come on. Pathos has it's perks.\n\nSidney considers trying hard to be good spirited.\n\n                STU\n        Remember, there's safety in numbers.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (giving in)\n        Yeah, okay...whatever.\n\n                STU\n        Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.\n\nStu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway.\n\nINT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER\n\nMr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before\nhim.  He picks one of them up, snickering.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n        Damn...\n\nHe stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.  He\npulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.  He tries\nthe mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror\nwhen...\n\nA KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.  He rips the mask off his head,\nturns to his office door and opens it to reveal...\n\nAN EMPTY DOORWAY.  He pokes his head into the outer office area\nand looks around.  But no one's there.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n        Yes? Hello?\n\nThe place is empty.  A little suspicious he closes the door,\ncatching his reflection in the closet mirror.  He looks at the\nmask in his hands.  Jesus, even he's jumpy.  Two seconds later...\n\nANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Himbry grabs the door quickly, this\ntime throwing it open.  Again no one's there.  He steps out into\nthe outer office determined to catch a prankster.\n\nINT.  OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\nCompletely empty.  Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and\ninto the school corridor.  The overhead lights have been turned\noff and the corridor is now dark and deserted.  He looks up and\ndown the hall.  Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a\nbroom.\n\n                MR. HIMBRY\n        Little shits.\n\nMr. Himbry returns to his office.\n\nINT.  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\nHimbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the\ncloset door NOW CLOSED SHUT.\n\nThis gives him a pause-he had left it open.  Hadn't he?  Suddenly,\nhe can't remember.  He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob,\npulling the door open to reveal...\n\nAN EMPTY CLOSET.  He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing\nsomeone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door.\nNervously, he pushes it shut to reveal...\n\nNOTHING.  Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked\nhimself.  He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut\nwhen...\n\nA GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand.\nQuick and easy.  Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes\ndown.  The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him.\n\nEXT.  TATUM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER\n\nThe late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing.\n\nTatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the\nsmall town neighborhood.  Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the\ndriveway.\n\nDespite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet\nmoment.\n\n                TATUM\n        Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.\n        Maybe he was having an affair with your\n        mom.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        So you think my mom was a slut too?\n\n                TATUM\n        I didn't say that, Sid. But you know\n        there were rumors. Your dad was\n        always out of town on business.\n        Maybe your mom was a very unhappy\n        woman.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        If they were having an affair how come\n        that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?\n\n                TATUM\n        You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's\n        a rumor.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Created by that little tabloid twit Gale\n        Weathers.\n\n                TATUM\n            (delicately)\n        It goes further back, Sid. There's been\n        talk about other men.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        And you believe it?\n\n                TATUM\n        Well...you can only hear that Richard\n        Gere-gerbil story so many times before\nyou have to start believing it.\n\nA long silence as Sidney agonizes over all of this.  She stands up\nand moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the\nneighborhood.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still\n        out there.\n\n                TATUM\n        Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to\n        sound like some Wes Carpenter flick.\n        Don't freak yourself out--we've got a\n        long night ahead of us.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore\n        me.\n\n                TATUM\n        Come on, let's rock.\n\nSid follows Tatum inside the house never seeing the GHOST MASKED\nFIGURE that stands across the street, under a tree.  His presence\nso subtle and unobtrusive you'd have to see this movie a second\ntime to know he was there all along.\n\nEXT.  MAIN STREET - LATER\n\nStu is moving along main street when Billy comes barreling up next\nto him.\n\n                BILLY\n        How'd you do?\n\n                STU\n        Piece of cake. She'll be there.\n\n                BILLY\n        Thanks, butt wart. You did good.\n\n                STU\n        So you gonna try and make up with Sid?\n\n                BILLY\n        Duh...that's quick.\n\n                STU\n        I was just asking. Why are you always at\n        me?\n\n                BILLY\n        Because I'm trying to build your self-\n        esteem. You're far too sensitive.\n\n                STU\n        Oh....\n\nBilly thumbs Stu's forehead.\n\n                BILLY\n        You ready to party hard tonight?\n\n                STU\n        You know it.\n\nThey come to a building centrally located in the heart of Main\nStreet.  A huge, blue monstrosity that's bigger than the local\nbank and post office combined. The sign in front reads\nBLOCKBUSTER.\n\nINT.  BLOCKBUSTER - CONTINUOUS\n\nYou typical Blockbuster--huge and crowded.  Randy, in his\nBlockbuster get up, is busy reshelving returns when Stu appears--\nknocking the videos out of his hand.\n\n                STU\n        Jesus, this place is packed.\n\n                RANDY\n            (picking up videos)\n        We had a run in the mass murder section.\n\n                STU\n        You coming tonight?\n\n                RANDY\n        Yeah, I'm off early--curfew you know.\n            (looking off)\n        Now that's poor taste.\n\n                STU\n        What?\n\nRandy refers to Billy who stands down the aisle talking to TWO\nGIRLS.  (The twits from the bathroom perhaps.)\n\n                RANDY\n        If you were the only suspect in a\n        senseless bloodbath would you be standing\n        in the horror section?\n\n                STU\n        It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't\n        do anything.\n\n                RANDY\n        You're such a little lap dog. He's got\n        killer printed all over his forehead.\n\n                STU\n        The why'd the police let him go?\n\n                RANDY\n        Because, obviously they don't watch\n        enough movies. This is standard horror\n        movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.\n\nRandy moves down the aisle, reshelving videos.\n\n                STU\n        Why would he want to kill his own\n        girlfriend?\n\n                RANDY\n        There's always some stupid bullshit\n        reason to kill your girlfriend. That's\n        the beauty of it all. Simplicity.\n        Besides, if it's too complicated you lose\n        your target audience.\n\n                STU\n        So what's his reason?\n\n                RANDY\n        Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.\n\n                STU\n        She's saving herself for you.\n\n                RANDY\n        Could be. Now that Billy's tried to\n        mutilate her, you think Sid would go out\n        with me?\n\n                STU\n        I think her father did it. How come they\n        can't find his ass?\n\n                RANDY\n        Because he's probably dead. His body\n        will come popping out in the last reel\n        somewhere...eyes gauged. See, the police\n        are always off track with this shit, if they'd\n        watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time.\n        There's formula to it. A very simple one.\n        Everyone's always a suspect--the father,\n        the principal, the town derelict...\n\n                STU\n        Which is you...\n\n                RANDY\n        So while they're off investigating a dead\n        end, Billy, who's been written off as a\n        suspect, is busy planning his next\n        hunting expedition.\n\n                BILLY\n            (o.c.)\n        How do we know you're not the killer?\n\nRandy spins around to find Billy right behind him.  Busted.\n\n                RANDY\n        Uh...hi, Billy.\n\n                BILLY\n        Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's\n        reality button?\n\nRandy shrugs, laughing it off.\n\n                RANDY\n        You're absolutely right. I'm the first\n        to admit it. If this were a scary movie,\n        I'd be the prime suspect.\n\n                STU\n        And what would be your motive?\n\n                RANDY\n        It's 1995--motives are incidental.\n\nEXT.  MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER\n\nDewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet.  It's almost\ndark.  The street is close to deserted.\n\nINT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS\n\nDewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum\nwhile Sid stares out the window.\n\n                DEWEY\n        A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.\n\n                TATUM\n        Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a\n        little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe.\n\nSid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a\nfew people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN\n        THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout\n        some killer in Texas.\n\n                TATUM\n        Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a\n        movie about you. Who's gonna play you?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Oh, god...\n\nDewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police\nstation. He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd\n        cast Tori Spelling.\n\nEXT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS\n\nThey pile out of the jeep.  Dewey heads for the station.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go\n        far.\n\nThe girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the\nstreet.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Is Billy going to be there tonight?\n\n                TATUM\n        He better not be. I told Stu to keep his\n        mouth shut. I think we can live without\n        EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for\n        one night.\n\nThey approach the grocery store.  Small and simple.  Sid and Tatum\ngrab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the\ncart through two sliding glass doors.\n\nA lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up\nfrom counting money.\n\n                CHECK OUT LADY\n        You girls gonna have to hurry it up.\n        We're under curfew.\n\n                TATUM\n        Two minutes tops.\n\nThey make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the\nautomated doors slide shut behind them and a...\n\nGHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just\noutside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows.\n\nEXT.  POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE\n\nSheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in,\nhurriedly.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?\n\n                DEWEY\n        Keeping my eye on Sidney.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real\n        bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls\n        were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's\n        father. He made the calls with his cellular\n        phone. It's confirmed.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Couldn't his cellular number have been\n        cloned?\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?\n        The anniversary of his wife's death. It all\n        fits. He's our man.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Have you contacted the bureau?\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        They believe he's out of state by now.\n        We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in\n        effect through the night. If he's not\n        picked up by morning--we'll do a house\n        to house.\n\n                DEWEY\n        You think he could still be in town?\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?\n\n                DEWEY\n        She's with my sister. Should I bring her\n        in?\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        Hold off for now. Just stay close to\n        her.\n\n                DEWEY\n        She'll be with her friends over at Stu\n        Maker's tonight.\n\n                SHERIFF BURKE\n        Watch her. Don't let on--just keep your\n        eyes out.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Yes, sir.\n\nINT.  SUPERMARKET - FEW MINUTES LATER\n\nSidney and Tatum push a basket through the junk food section.  The\nstore is completely empty.  The girls gab freely.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I\n        just can't relax.\n\n                TATUM\n        You have a few intimacy issues as a\n        result of your mother's untimely death.\n        It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        But he's been so patient with me, Tatum.\n        You know, with all the sex stuff. How\n        many guys would put up with a girlfriend\n        who's sexually anorexic?\n\n                TATUM\n        Billy and his penis don't deserve you.\n\nSidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf.  Down the aisle,\nthrough the storefront window the GHOST MASKED FIGURE still stands\nwatching their every move.\n\nEXT.  SUPERMARKET\n\nSid pushes the cart out of the glass door with Tatum riding it.\nThe GHOST MASKED FIGURE is nowhere to be found.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        What do you think about when you're\n        having sex?\n\n                TATUM\n        With Stu, there's little time to stop and\n        reflect. But sometimes before, to relax\n        and get in the mood, I think about Grant\n        Goodeve.\n\nSid pushes the cart and Tatum across the street.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Who?\n\n                TATUM\n        Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on\n        EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He\n        was the one who lived off alone. He would come\n        around every now and then with his guitar and\n        sing \"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love...\"\n        He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot\n        brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I\n        was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show\n        came on every day after school right during my\n        puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental\n        in my maturing as a woman.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        How does that get you in the mood with\n        Stu?\n\n                TATUM\n        During foreplay, I sing the theme song to\n        myself. \"Eight is enough to fill our lives\n        with love...\" It's a real turn on.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        No way.\n\n                TATUM\n        Grant wrote the song himself. I'm\n        convinced the lyrics had a secret\n        meaning, \"Eight is enough...\"\n\nSid pushes the cart up to Dewey's jeep.  Tatum hops off.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        What secret meaning? Like a Satanical\n        thing?\n\n                TATUM\n        Watch the show, Sid. His basket is\n        bigger than the one you're pushing.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        TATUM!\n\n                TATUM\n        Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits\n        til he's dead but the minute you mention\n        an eight inch weenie. Watch out.\n\nSidney stops just short of a laugh.  Tatum pulls the back jeep\ndoor, loading the groceries in.  Behind her, the GHOST MASKED\nFIGURE appears, just out of their sight, behind the jeep's open\nback door.\n\n                TATUM\n        There's that sense of humor. I knew it\n        still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some\n        fun tonight.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Deal.\n\nSidney moves to the back door and closes it shut, when from\nbehind...\n\nDEWEY stands.  Sid jumps, startled.\n\n                DEWEY\n        You girls ready.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Yeah.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard\n        tonight, Sid.\n\n                TATUM\n        No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the\n        way, I promise.\n\n                TATUM\n        Shit.\n\nTatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way, blindly.  It rolls\ndown the road by itself, gaining speed on a decline running smack\ninto the GHOST MASKED FIGURE who stops the cart cold with one\nhand.\n\nEXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT\n\nDewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road.  Headlights\nilluminate the thick woods that line each side.  Following behind\nthem at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan.\n\nDewey comes to the end of the road.  It dead ends at...\n\nSTU'S HOUSE which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with\nno neighbors in sight.  A huge old home just ripe for a night of\nfun and...terror.\n\nFrom the looks of things the party has already started.  Music is\nBLARING. A few KIDS hang on the porch.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER\n\nA big room with KIDS sprinkled throughout-smoking, drinking,\ncutting up.  A stereo BLASTS music while the TV airs around the\nclock killer coverage.\n\nTatum and Sid enter with groceries.  Various FRIENDS greet them.\n\n                TATUM\n        Caterer's here.\n\nThe girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an\nenormous kitchen.  Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink\ndrinking beer through a funnel.\n\n                TATUM\n        That's mature.\n\n                STU\n        Where you guys been? We had to start\n        without you.\n\nEXT.  STU'S HOUSE - ROAD\n\nThe newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the\nroad a few feet down from the front yard.\n\nINT.  NEWSVAN\n\nKenny and Gale move around inside the van.  Kenny hovers over a\ncontrol panel complete with video monitors.\n\n                KENNY\n        What's the plan?\n\n                GALE\n        Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a\n        window and tape all of tonight's\n        festivities.\n\nKenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.  He\nchecks its battery pack.\n\n                KENNY\n        The control board's glitched. You know\n        we can't carry a live picture.\n\n                GALE\n        What's the delay?\n\n                KENNY\n        About thirty seconds.\n\n                GALE\n        As long as it records I don't give a\n        shit. We're not doing a remote.\n\nGale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness,\nnot seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.  A hand grabs her\nshoulder, Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find...\n\nDewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Evening, ma'am.\n\n                GALE\n        Deputy...good evening.\n\n                DEWEY\n        What brings you out to these parts?\n\n                GALE\n        You never know when or where a story will\n        break.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Not much story here. Just a bunch of\n        kids cutting loose.\n\n                GALE\n        Then what are you doing here?\n\n                DEWEY\n        Keeping an eye on things. Checking the\n        place out.\n\n                GALE\n        Mind if I join you?\n\nDewey considers for a whole two seconds.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Not at all.\n\nGale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny's hand, and\nthrows it in her bag.

Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst\nthem.  He carries an armful of videos.\n\n                RANDY\n        I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER\n        night.\n\nHe lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.  Stu and\nTatum dive in.\n\n                STU\n        I thought everything was checked out.\n\n                RANDY\n        I had 'em hid in the foreign section.\n\nSidney peruses the videos.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT\n        --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these\n        movies?\n\n                RANDY\n        She's the Scream Queen.\n\n                STU\n        With that set of lungs--she should be.\n\n                TATUM\n            (to Sid)\n        Tits--see.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER\n\nThe party is going strong.  Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit,\nlean.  Some crowd around the floor in front of the television.\nRandy is taking a vote.\n\n                RANDY\n        How many EVIL DEAD'S?\n            (hands go up)\n        How many HELLRAISER'S?\n\nHands go up.  BICKERING AD-LIB, etc.\n\nThe doorbell RINGS.  Stu goes for it.\n\n                STU\n        I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're\n        in the fridge in the garage.\n\n                TATUM\n        What am I? The beer wench?\n\n                STU\n            (o.c.)\n        Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick\n        from INSIDE STORY?\n\nThey look up the hallway to see Dewey and Gale standing in the\nfoyer.\n\n                TATUM\n        Shit, Dewey!\n\nEveryone perks up, eyeing Gale.\n\n                TATUM\n        What is she doing here?\n\n                DEWEY\n        She's with me.

KITCHEN\n\nTatum is alone in the kitchen.  She empties popcorn into a bowl,\nthen pulls open the refrigerator...looks quickly, then\nremembers...\n\nShe moves through the adjoining laundry room to the...\n\nINT.  GARAGE\n\nThe kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage.\nTatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch.\n\nShe finds a button and hits it.  BRRRRMMM!  The electric garage\ndoor starts to rise.  Wrong switch.  She hits it again and it\ncloses.\n\nShe finds another switch.  CLICK.  A small lightbulb overhead\ncomes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving\npockets of shadows along the wall.\n\nTatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it,\nnot seeing the kitchen door, quietly, slowly, closing behind her,\nsealing her off from the rest of the house.\n\nTatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open.  Its light\ncasts a glow across her face.\n\nCRASH-BOOM!\n\nTatum jumps, spinning around just in time to see a cat escape\nthrough a large pet door that's built into the garage door.  She\nsmiles at her jumpiness.\n\nTatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads\nback to the kitchen.\n\nAt the kitchen door, she juggles the beer, reaching for the knob.\nIt's locked.\n\n                TATUM\n        SHIT!\n\nShe KICKS it with her foot several times.\n\n                TATUM\n        Hey, Shitheads!\n\nA moment.  No answer.\n\n                TATUM\n        OH, SHIT PISS!\n\nTatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button.\nBRRRMM!  It begins to rise.\n\nShe moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.  Suddenly, CRR-\nBRRRM!  The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down,\nclosing.\n\n                TATUM\n        What the...\n\nTatum spins around to see..\n\nA GHOST MASKED FIGURE\n\nSilhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the\nswitch.  Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes.\n\n                TATUM\n        Is that you, Randy? Cute.\n\nThe FIGURE stares at her, blankly.\n\n                TATUM\n        And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON\n        YOUR GARAGE.\n\nTatum takes a step towards the FIGURE.\n\n                TATUM\n        Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll\n        flip.\n\nThe FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side.\n\n                TATUM\n        Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?\n\nThe FIGURE slowly nods.\n\n                TATUM\n        Can I be the helpless victim?\n\nThe FIGURE slowly nods again.\n\n                TATUM\n        Okay, let's see. \"No, please don't kill\n        me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the\n        sequel.\"\n\nTatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too,\nblocking her.\n\n                TATUM\n        Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.\n\nTatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he's faster and\ncuts her off.\n\nTatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with\nthe other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside.\n\n                TATUM\n        Randy--will you stop?\n\nBut as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist\nhard, Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing...\n\n                TATUM\n        You little shit.\n\nTatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver\ncatches her eye.  She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as\nit darts forward, cutting into her forearm...\n\nTatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious.\n\nThe FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.  She staggers\nbackwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator,\nSCREAMING.\n\n                TATUM\n        Who are you?\n\nThe FIGURE lashes out with the knife.  Tatum dodges it, leaping\nback against the fridge.  The FIGURE advances.  Instinctively, she\nrips the top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face,\nsending him backwards, reeling.\n\nTatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.  In a panic, she BEATS\nand PULLS\non it, trying to make it lift.  She eyes the FIGURE...he's\nrecovering...\n\nShe goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for\nit...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso\njust as the...\n\nFIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.  Tatum goes crazy\nSCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through.\n\nEXT.  GARAGE DOOR\n\nTatum is half in/half out of the pet door.  She BEATS and JERKS\nwildly, unable to see the FIGURE on the other side...\n\nA true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the\nFIGURE, knocking him away.\n\nShe takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she\nstops...stuck.  She pulls and tugs but can't move.  She listens\nbut hears nothing.  Where did he go?  An agonizing silence.  And\nthen...\n\nCRR-BRRRM!  The garage door is activated.  It begins to rise\nupward, taking\nTatum with it.  She SCREAMS MADLY.\n\n                TATUM\n        NOOOOOOOO.....\n\nTatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free\nherself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up...\n\nShe looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage\nrafters just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly.\n\nINT.  FOYER - MINUTES LATER\n\nIt's getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door,\nmuttering, \"parents and curfew\", etc.  The door hangs open wide.\nSid moves to close it when....\n\nBILLY appears in a classic fake scare.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Billy?

Look it up.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        It's okay. We need to talk.\n\nSid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase.  Randy appears\nfrom the kitchen just in time to see Sid and Billy disappear\nupstairs.\n\n                RANDY\n        What's Leatherface doing here?\n\n                STU\n        He came to make up.\n\n                RANDY\n        There goes my chance with Sid.\n\n                STU\n        Like you had one.\n\nINT.  NEWSVAN\n\nKenny fidgets at the control board.  He hits a coupla buttons,\nbangs the side of the monitor and a picture emerges...the living\nroom.  The camera is positioned just above the television...\n\nON SCREEN\n\nThe party is in full swing.  Several TEENS sit right in front of\nthe television.  Because of the camera's position they appear to\nbe staring right into the lens.\n\nSuddenly, the van's side door slides open and Gale pops in.\n\n                KENNY\n        Got a picture. Perfect placement. We\n        can see everything.\n\nGale is ecstatic.\n\n                GALE\n        Tell me, Kenny, has a cheesy tabloid\n        journalist ever won the Pulitzer?\n\nINT.  BEDROOM\n\nA large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a\nbalcony.\n\nSid and Billy stare at each other for a long moment.  Awkward.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        So...\n\n                BILLY\n        So...I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit\n        and I'm sorry.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        No, Billy. I'm the one who's been\n        selfish and self-absorbed with all of my\n        post traumatic stress.\n\n                BILLY\n        You lost your mom...\n\n                SIDNEY\n        But you're right--enough is enough. I\n        can't wallow in the grief process forever\n        and I can't keep lying to myself about\n        who my mom was.\n\nBilly bows his head quietly, knowingly.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I think in some weird analytical,\n        psychological bullshit way I'm scared\n        I'm gonna turn out just like her, you\n        know? Like the bad seed or something...\n\n                BILLY\n        Oh Sidney...\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Everytime I get close to you I see my\n        mom. I know it doesn't make sense.\n\n                BILLY\n        Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in\n        SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she\n        kept having flashbacks of her dead father.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        But this is life. This isn't a movie.\n\n                BILLY\n        Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's\n        one great big movie. Only you can't\n        pick your genre.\n\nBilly moves to her.  They embrace, tenderly.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I wanna let go. I do...\n\n                BILLY\n        Ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. I\n        promise.\n\nSidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long\nand hard.  She breaks away passionately, out of breath.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?\n\nBilly nibbles her neck.\n\n                BILLY\n        Sshh..it's okay.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Or even a good porno.\n\n                BILLY\n            (shocked)\n        What?\n\nShe stares at him, her eyes sexually charged.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        You heard me.\n\n                BILLY\n            (incredulous)\n        Are you serious?\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (surprising herself)\n        Yeah...I think so.\n\nThey smile at each other.\n\nINT.

When do\n        we see Jamie Lee's breasts?\n\n                RANDY\n        Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie\n        Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.\n        She didn't show her tits until she went legit.\n\n                BOY TEEN\n        No way.\n\n                RANDY\n        That's why she always lived.

Don't you\n        know the rules?\n\nStu finishes his beer.\n\n                STU\n        What rules?\n\nRandy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of\nthe television, explaining.\n\n                RANDY\n        There are certain rules that one must\n        abide by in order to successfully survive\n        a horror movie. For instance: 1. You\n        can never have sex. The minute you get a\n        little nookie--you're as good as gone.\n        Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink\n        or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an\n        extension of number one. And 3. Never,\n        ever, ever, under any circumstances, say\n        \"I'll be right back.\"\n\n                STU\n        Wanna another beer?\n\n                RANDY\n        Yeah.\n\n                STU\n        I'll be right back.\n\nEverybody \"ooohhs\".\n\n                RANDY\n        There he goes folks--a dead man.

Just as Sid's bra straps slide\nof her shoulders...\n\nBilly moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off,\nBlocking Sidney from view.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER\n\nBack in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone\nRINGS.  Everyone ignores it.  It RINGS again.\n\nFinally, Randy grabs the receiver from the side table.\n\n                RANDY\n        Hello? Yeah....HOLY SHIT.\n\nRandy, freaked, drops the phone, finds the TV remote and pauses\nthe movie, the others protest\n\"Hey, Put is back...\" etc.\n\n                RANDY\n        Listen up. They found Principal Himbry\n        dead. He was gutted and hung from the\n        goal post on the football field.\n\nThis stills the room.  Complete silence as the news sinks in.

BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER\n\nThe sex is over...and both Sid and Billy are dressing\nrespectively.  That post-sex awkwardness.\n\nSid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone\non the nightstand...it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses\nher face.  She turns to Billy who sits on the floor, putting on\nhis shoes.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Who did you call?\n\n                BILLY\n        What?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        When you're arrested-you're allowed one\n        phone call? Who did you call?\n\n                BILLY\n        I called my dad.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw\n        him.\n\n                BILLY\n        Yeah...and when I called no one answered.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Uh-huh.\n\n                BILLY\n        You don't still think it was me?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        No, but if it were you, that would have\n        been a very clever way to throw me off\n        track. Using your one phone call to call\n        me so I wouldn't think it was you.\n\nBilly stands up.\n\n                BILLY\n        What do I have to do to prove to you I'm\n        not a killer?\n\nHe makes a move toward her when..from behind, in a split instant,\nfrom the open balcony doors comes...\n\nTHE GHOST FIGURE\n\nSidney sees the FIGURE immedietely, SCREAMING.  Billy tries to\ncalm her, oblivious to the advancing GHOST.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        BILLYWATCHOUT!!!!\n\nBilly barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air.\nIt strikes down with force...hitting his chest as blood sprays the\nair.\n\nON SIDNEY as red crimson splatters across her face...as the knife\nis thrust in and out of Billy who tries hard to put up a\nfight..but it's useless...he never had a chance.  His body falls\nto the floor..lifeless.\n\nANGLE ON GHOST\n\nas he watches Billy's body come to a still before quietly, calmly\nturning his attention to...\n\nSIDNEY who stands, numb...scared to death.  And only when the\nGHOST takes a step forward does Sidney break.  She takes off like\na rocket...leaping over the bed and out the door.\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\nSidney tears out the door and down the hall, coated in Billy's\nblood.\n\nANGLE ON THE GHOST\n\nas he catches up with her, grabbing hold of her collar.  She pulls\naway from him...her shirt ripping down the back.\n\nHer hands find a door knob and she goes for it, pulling the door\nopen...moving quickly inside...locking it behind her.\n\nINT.  DARK SPACE - CONTINUOUS\n\nTotal darkness.  Sidney's hands scour the wall for a light switch.\nThe doorknob turns...the lock holds..as the door is nearly SHAKEN\nfrom it's hinges...and then...\n\nNOTHING.  All goes silent.  Only Sidney's rapid BREATHING fills\nthe space around her.\n\nSidney, trembling, shaking, reaches above her, feeling, until she\nfinds a string.  She pulls it...as a lightbulb SWITCHES on\noverhead.\n\nShe's in a small box of a room.  The door is on one side, a small,\nnarrow staircase on the other.  She eyes the doorknob, then the\nstaircase...contemplating...but it's an easy decision.  There's no\nfucking way she's going up to the attic.\n\nShe unlocks the door and pushes on it.  But it won't give...she\npushes on it again.  It's locked from the other side.  Shit.  She\nturns to the staircase.\n\nEXT.  DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS\n\nA long, deserted country road.  In the distance, a single\nflashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night.  Gale\nand Dewey can be heard.\n\n                GALE\n        So is Dewey your real name?\n\n                DEWEY\n        Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck\n        with a long time ago.\n\n                GALE\n        I like it. It's... sexy.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Nah... it's just this town's way of not\n        taking me serious.\n\n                GALE\n        What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a\n        meteorologist...\n\nCLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side-\nflirtatiously.  Gale is surprisingly nervous.\n\n                GALE\n        People treat me like the Antichrist of\n        television journalism.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I don't think you're so bad.\n\nGale smiles.\n\n                GALE\n        Are all the local boys as sweet as you?\n\nDewey blushes.  He starts to say something when headlights appear\nbehind them.  They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come\nracing right at them.\n\nDewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars\nspeed by, oblivious to them.\n\nIN THE DITCH\n\nGale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.  He steals a\nglance in her eyes before rolling off her.\n\n                DEWEY\n        You okay?\n\nSomething takes Gale's attention.\n\n                GALE\n        What's that?\n\nDewey looks to where gale points.  He finds the flashlight and\naims it into the bush.  The tail end of a car is just visible.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Looks like a car.\n\nDewey helps her up and they move to it.  He shines the flashlight\non the plates but it's already obvious to the CAMERA.  This is the\nsame car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in.\n\n                DEWEY\n        Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.\n\n                GALE\n        Sidney's father?\n\n                DEWEY\n        We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here.\n        What the fuck is he doing here?\n\nDewey is panicked.  He grabs Gale and they race off down the road.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nRandy continues to watch TV.  He is now sloppy drunk, completely\ninvolved in the movie on the screen.\n\nSCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room.\n\n                RANDY\n            (to TV)\n        No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out!\n        Behind you!\n\nAnd if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED\nFIGURE that stands directly behind him...knife poised.\n\nINT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS\n\nKenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.  He\ntosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches\nhis eye.\n\nON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the\nmovie.  Directly behind him...the GHOST.  Kenny does a double-\ntake.  No fucking way.  He watches as the GHOST stands still,\nunmoving, knife raised.\n\n                KENNY\n        JESUS...FUCK...\n\nThe GHOST takes a silent step forward.\n\n                KENNY\n            (screaming at the monitor)\n        BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU!\n\nThis kid needs help.  Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the\nside door.  He slides it open and sticks his head out as...\n\nA LONG, SHARP BLADE\n\ncomes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.  Kenny\nfalls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon\nhim.\n\nTHE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR\n\njust in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy,\nleaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a\nthirty second walk to the newsvan.\n\nINT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes,\nand the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window\non the front wall of the house.\n\nSidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over\nthat...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection.\nShe cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood.  She stares\nlong and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.  She\nmoves on, determined.\n\nShe eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could\nonly reach it...\n\nEXT.  FRONT YARD\n\nGale and Dewey come running up the drive, frantic.\n\n                DEWEY\n        I'll call for backup.\n\n                GALE\n        I'll get my camera.\n\nThey split up.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS GALE as she rushes to the\nnewsvan, throwing open the door.\n\n                GALE\n        Kenny! Camera! Quick!\n\nThe van is empty.\n\n                GALE\n        Kenny?\n\nA CAR HORN goes off.  Gale spins around.  It came from the patrol\njeep in the driveway.\n\n                GALE\n            (calling out)\n        Dewey?\n\nShe moves across the yard to the jeep, the door hangs open...Dewey\nis nowhere to be found.\n\n                GALE\n        Dewey? Where are you?\n\nA look of pure dread comes over Gale.\n\nINT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS\n\nSidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the\nwindow.  She climbs to the top, holding onto the window frame.\n\nShe spots Gale almost immedietely.  She SCREAMS OUT, looking for\nthe window latch.  But there's not one.  It doesn't open.  Sidney\nstarts beating on it...trying to break it...\n\nEXT.  FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS\n\nGale, hanging tough, approaches the front door, unable to hear\nSidney's SCREAMS three floors up.  Gale reaches for the door just\nas she hears LOUD, HORRIBLE SHRIEKS from just inside.  She backs\naway.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nAN EAR-CURDLING JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAM BLASTS through the empty\nliving room as the horror movie on TV comes to it's horrifying\nclimax.\n\nRandy is now gone.\n\nEXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS\n\nGale races across the yard putting distance between her and the\nhouse.  She moves back to the van...\n\nINT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS\n\nSidney has found an old tennis racket.  She swings a solid\nforehand at the window.\n\nTHE WINDOW SPRAYS GLASS\n\nSidney moves quickly, lifting herself up over broken glass and\npulling herself through the window frame.\n\nEXT.  SIDE OF THE HOUSE\n\nSidney wastes no time.  She looks for Gale, SCREAMING, but Gale is\ngone.\n\nSid lowers herself down the ledge, sliding down a sloped portion\nof the roof onto...\n\nTHE MASTER'S BEDROOM BALCONY.\n\nThen she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself,\nletting herself hang as low as she can...then she lets go, free-\nfalling the rest of the way...but in a split instant...\n\nTHE GHOST APPEARS\n\ngrabbing her wrists in midair.\n\nHer body hangs, dangling against the side of the house.  The GHOST\nbegins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony.\n\nSidney jerks, pulls, twists...but the HANDS have her, hoisting her\nup...Sidney SCREAMS MADLY...yanking one last time, freeing\nherself.\n\nSHE DROPS TO THE GROUND, a good seven feet, landing on her back,\nhitting hard.  She grabs at a pained leg and brings herself\nupright.\n\nINT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS\n\nGale is frantic.  She starts the engine up and hits the headlights\nwhen she discovers she can't see out of the windshield.\n\nGale rubs at the glass.  Sure enough, something is on the\nwindshield outside, blocking her sight.  Gale hits the wipers as\nBLOOD SMEARS across the glass, it drips down from above.\n\nGale SCREAMS as a HAND reaches in through the open window...she\nlooks up to see...\n\nRANDY, staring at her madly.\n\n                RANDY\n        What's going on?\n\nA sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car\nforward, into a ditch.  She hits the BRAKES.  Randy is thrown\nforward, away from the van.\n\nGale reverses, backs up, hits the brakes again...just as Kenny's\nface comes sliding down the outside of the windshield...eyes wide,\nface distorted, blood everywhere.\n\nGale hits the gas, and yanks the wheel, sending Kenny's corpse\nflying off the top of the van.\n\nGale spins the van around, onto the road, hits the gas madly,\ngaining speed just as...\n\nSIDNEY APPEARS\n\nin the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling\na young Sissy Spacek.\n\nGale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van\nveers off the road at top speed...flipping over on its side,\nsliding off into the thick foliage.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS\n\nSidney races to where the van lay on it's side.  Sidney peers\nthrough the windshield...Gale's body lay limp and bloody.\n\nSIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.  She sees the\npatrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it.\n\nINT.  JEEP\n\nSidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!  Shit.  Just\nthen, Sidney's eyes go to the front porch.  She watches as the\nfront door opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness,\nundetectable.\n\nSidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the\nhouse, revealing...\n\nDEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        DEWEY!\n\nSidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body,\nslumped, knees buckled...\n\nAnd then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the\nporch hard.  Standing behind him is...\n\nTHE GHOST\n\nSIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        NOOOOOOOO!!!!!\n\nSid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.  She\nreaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits.\n\nAnd watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling\nwith something.  Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he\nholds...\n\nTHE KEYS\n\nThey jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying\nthis...\n\nSidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the\ndoor, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it\nimpossible to unlock.  Her face is pressed against the\nglass...inches from the MASKED FIGURE.\n\nShe uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST\nDISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view.\n\nSidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over\nher own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED.\n\nThen she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers\nside door.  She pounces on the lock, holding it down.\n\nA shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.  The\nlock turns on the other side.  Sidney leaps over and holds it\ndown, securing it.  This is beyond nerve-racking.  Sidney is\ncertifiable.\n\nHer eyes spot the police radio for the first time.  She grabs the\nmouthpiece and hits the switch.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house\n        on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA\n        KILL ME!\n\nEXT.  FRONT OF JEEP\n\nANGLE through front windshield.  Sidney RANTING into the police\nband.  She doesn't see the...\n\nGHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl\nin behind her.\n\nThe GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck.\n\nSidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the\nGHOST.\n\nShe falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him.\n\nHer hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she\npulls...\n\nThe door swings open...\n\nSidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground.\n\nEXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS\n\nSidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.  She brings\nherself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see\nnothing...\n\nTHE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED.\n\nSidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere.  Completely gone.\nVanished.  Sid crawls to the front porch where...\n\nDEWEY'S BODY LAY\n\nThinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and\ngrabs his gun when a VOICE ECHO'S behind her...\n\n                VOICE\n            (o.c.)\n        Sidney!\n\nShe turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.  He appears stone\ncold sober.\n\n                RANDY\n        Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here.\n\nSidney throws the gun forward.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Stop. Right there.\n\n                RANDY\n        Don't shoot. It's me.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Don't come any closer.\n\n                RANDY\n        Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's\n        dead, she's been killed...I think Stu did\n        it.\n\nHe takes a step forward when another VOICE SPEAKS UP.\n\n                VOICE\n            (o.c.)\n        Don't believe him, Sid.\n\nSidney spins around to see Stu moving up the walk.\n\n                STU\n        He's lying. He killed Tatum. And Billy.\n\nStu moves closer to Sidney.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Stay away.\n\nShe aims the gun in his direction.\n\n                STU\n        His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.\n        He's gone psycho.\n\n                RANDY\n        Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the\n        one.\n\nSidney has lost it, she doesn't know who to trust.  She aims the\ngun at Stu..then Randy..then Stu...\n\n                STU\n        Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.\n\n                RANDY\n        No, Sid.\n\nThey both move toward her.  There's no time.  She must act now.\nFinally...\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Fuck you both.\n\nAnd with that, Sidney steps back into the house and SLAMS the\nfront door shut.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM / FOYER\n\nSid locks and bolts the door.  From the other side she can hear\nRandy SCREAMING.\n\n                RANDY\n        NO, SID. OPEN UP. PLEASE...\n        HE'S GONE CRAZY.\n\nHis fists POUND against the door.  Sidney, stumbling in the\ndarkness, rushes to the phone in the living room.  Just as she\nreaches for it...it RINGS.  It scares the life out of her.  She\nSCREAMS, yanking it up.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Please! God! Help me!\n\n                VOICE\n            (from the phone)\n        Having fun Sidney?\n\nSidney falls apart, SCREAMING.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        NOOOOOOOOO!!!\n\nShe throws the phone down, disconnecting the call.\n\nSid moves back to the door.  RANDY'S SCREAMS ARE MADDENING.  She\neyes the lock, deliberating.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (at the door)\n        GOAWAYLEAVEMEALONE!\n\nCLUNK!  A NOISE UPSTAIRS.\n\nSidney looks up the staircase, into the darkness, her face SHOCKED\nto see...\n\nBILLY\n\nemerging from the shadows, stumbling down the stairs.  Very much\nalive.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Oh God. Billy!\n\nHe's blood-soaked and dazed.  Sidney meets him in the landing,\ngrabbing him, holding him...\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I thought you were...\n\n                BILLY\n        I'm alright. Gotta...get...help.\n\nBilly goes for the door.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        He's out there.\n\nRandy continues POUNDING ON THE DOOR, SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS\nLUNGS.\n\n                RANDY\n            (through door)\n        Please, you gotta let me in. He's\n        gonna kill me.\n\nBilly goes for the door.  Sidney blocks him.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        NO! Don't believe him.\n\n                BILLY\n        It's okay. Give me the gun.\n\nSidney hands him the gun.  Billy turns and unlocks the door,\nopening it.  Randy rushes in, grabbing Billy, pleading...\n\n                RANDY\n        Help me...\n\n                BILLY\n            (calming him)\n        Shhhh. It's okay.\n\n                RANDY\n        Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad.\n\nSlowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face.\n\n                BILLY\n        \"We all go a little mad sometimes.\"\n\nRandy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls\nthe trigger.  The BLAST throws Randy's body against the wall\nbefore sliding to a heap on the floor...still.\n\n                BILLY\n        Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO\n\nBILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY...\n\nWho stands only feet away, face aghast...\n\nFuck, no...this can't be happening.  Billy's eyes are on her,\nunmoving.\n\nHe sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his\nface...tasting it.\n\n                BILLY\n        Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for\n        pig's blood in CARRIE.\n\nSidney is dumbfounded.  Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into\nthe dark refines of the kitchen.\n\nBilly, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.  She takes\nanother step back--petrified.\n\nCLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE.  It is no longer familiar to Sidney.  There\nis something inhuman now about his features.  His expression is\npure evil.\n\nShe takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen.\n\nTHE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline\nof a FIGURE appears...\n\nSTANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY.\n\nShe continues to back up, moving right into the arms of...\n\nSTU\n\nSidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Stu...please...help me...\n\nStu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile\nas he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face.\n\n                STU\n            (whispering into phone)\n        Surprise, Sidney.\n\nHis VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer.\n\nSidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.  It\nbecomes all too clear.\n\nShe stands between them, her mind racing, calculating...\n\nSHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM\n\nIf for no other reason than to put space between her and\nthem...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in.\n\n                BILLY\n        Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've\n        got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's\n        your turn.\n\n                STU\n        Oh yeah\n\nStu disappears into the kitchen.\n\n                BILLY\n            (to Sidney)\n        What's wrong? You look like you've seen\n        a ghost.\n\nSidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve.\n\nA NOISE comes from the kitchen.  A low dragging sound.  Stu\nreappears from the front hall...wrestling with\nsomething...someone...\n\nCLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it\nrolls into the living room.  Sidney looks down to find...\n\nHER FATHER\n\nbound and gagged.  His eyes wide in fear, very much alive.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Daddy!\n\nShe starts for him.\n\n                BILLY\n        Close enough.\n\nStu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott's shirt pocket.\n\n                STU\n        Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Why are you doing this?\n\n                STU\n        It's all part of the game.\n\n                BILLY\n        It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Fuck you.\n\n                BILLY\n        We already played that game. You lost,\n        remember?\n\n                STU\n        You have to play, Sid. Don't want to\n        disappoint your dad. He's been waiting\n        around all night.\n\n                BILLY\n        It's an easy game. We ask you a\n        question. If you get it wrong--you die.\n\n                STU\n        And if you get it right--you die.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        You're crazy--both of you.\n\n                STU\n        The official term is \"psychotic\".\n\n                SIDNEY\n        You'll never get away with this.\n\n                BILLY\n        Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't\n        believe how easy it was to frame him.\n\n                STU\n        Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took\n        a few notes. It was fun.\n\nBilly and Stu relish their madness, proud of themselves.\n\nSidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes.  She looks\nback to Billy, unflinching..a determined look on her face.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Why did you kill my mother?\n\n                BILLY\n        Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I\n        think she wants a motive. Hmmm...I don't\n        really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did\n        Norman Bates have a motive?\n\nStu plays along, shaking his head.\n\n                STU\n        Nope.\n\n                BILLY\n        And did they really ever explain why\n        Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?\n        Don't think so. You see, it's scarier\n        when there's no motive, Sid.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (fighting tears)\n        I don't understand...\n\n                BILLY\n        We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman\n        was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit\n        all over town like she was Sharon Stone or\n        something.\n\n                STU\n            (laughing)\n        ..so we put her out of her misery. I\n        mean, let's face it, your mom was no\n        Sharon Stone.\n\nStu cracks up over this while Billy turns very serious.\n\n                BILLY\n        Is that motive enough for you? Or how\n        about this? Did you know your slut\n        mother was sleeping with my dad and she's\n        the reason my mom moved out and deserted\n        me.\n\nA sudden silence.  Sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant\nwith truth.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        What?\n\nEven Stu is surprised with his seriousness.\n\n                BILLY\n        Think about it. On the off chance I get\n        caught-a motive like that could divide a\n        jury for years, don't you think?. You took\n        my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy\n        factor. Maternal abandonment causes\n        serious deviant behavior. It certainly\n        fucked you up. It made you have sex with\n        a psychopath.\n\n                STU\n        That's right and now that you're no\n        longer a virgin. You gotta die--those\n        are the rules.\n\nBilly sits the gun down on the table near the foyer.  And then\nmoves to Sidney with the butcher knife in hand.\n\n                BILLY\n        Pretend this is all just a scary movie,\n        Sid. How do you think it's going to end?\n\nSidney doesn't respond.\n\n                STU\n            (excited)\n        This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got\n        it all figured out. Why do you think we\n        kept your father alive so long? Why did\n        we save you for last?\n\n                BILLY\n        You know what time it is, Sid? It's\n        after midnight. It's your mother's\n        anniversary. We killed her exactly one\n        year ago today.\n\nBilly turns to Stu with the knife.  They eye each other.\n\n                BILLY\n        Ready?\n\n                STU\n        Yeah...\n\nBilly pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing\ninto Stu.  He stumbles to ho his knees, WINCING in pain.\n\n                STU\n        Jesus...\n\nSidney SCREAMS...as blood gushes..real blood, a dark, deep red.\nStu inspects the wound to his side...then he smiles...\n\n                STU\n        Good one. My turn.\n\nHe takes the knife from Billy.\n\n                BILLY\n        Don't forget-stay to the side and don't\n        go too deep.\n\nStu stabs at Billy's belly, puncturing him...Billy doubles over...\n\n                BILLY\n        Jesus...fuck, that hurt.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Stop it!\n\n                BILLY\n            (squelching the pain)\n        Got the ending figured out yet? Time's\n        running out.\n\n                STU\n        Come on, Sid. Think about it. Your\n        father is the chief suspect. We cloned\n        his cellular. The evidence is there.\n\nBilly takes the knife and slashes at Stu's arm, two quick\ncuts...he doubles over...\n\n                BILLY\n        What if your father snapped? Your mom's\n        anniversary set him off and he went on a\n        murder spree, killing everyone...\n\n                STU\n            (in major pain)\n        Except for me and Billy...we were left\n        for dead...\n\n                BILLY\n        And then he killed you and then shoots\n        himself in the head. It's a perfect\n        ending.\n\n                STU\n        Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on\n        and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these\n        days--you gotta have a sequel.\n\nStu takes the knife and cuts at Billy.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        You sick fucks--you've seen one too many\n        movies.\n\nBilly looks at her, bent over, crazed.\n\n                BILLY\n        Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies\n        don't create psychos. Movies just make\n        psychos more creative.\n\nStu staggers a bit.\n\n                STU\n        That's it, Billy. I can't take any more.\n        I'm feeling woozy.\n\n                BILLY\n        Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.\n\nBilly moves to Sidney's father.\n\n                STU\n        Where'd you put it?\n\nStu is searching the foyer for the gun.\n\n                BILLY\n        It's on the table.\n\n                STU\n        No, it's not.\n\nBilly hobbles over.  The gun is gone.\n\n                BILLY\n        Where the fuck is it?\n\n                VOICE\n            (off camera)\n        Right here, asshole.\n\nBilly and Stu look up in unison to see...\n\nGALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY\n\nstanding in the front door way, gun in hand.  Her body tattered\nand bloody.  Her hair a mess.\n\n                BILLY\n        I thought she was dead.\n\n                STU\n        She looked dead. Still does.\n\nGale holds the gun firm, in total control.\n\n                GALE\n        I've got an ending for you. The reporter\n        left for dead in the newsvan comes to,\n        stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the\n        gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.\n\nSidney steps forward.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        I like that ending.\n\nBilly lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.  Billy and Stu eye\neach other.\n\n                BILLY\n        She can't get both of us.\n\n                STU\n        Odds are--she'll miss anyway.\n\nIn a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.  She\npulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on.\n\nBilly charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING\nIT SHUT.  It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out\nthe door.  She goes down...out.\n\n                STU\n        Cool move.\n\nBilly steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where\nGale lays.  Then he turns back inside the house to find...\n\nSIDNEY GONE.\n\n                BILLY\n        Where'd she go?\n\nStu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has\ncompletely disappeared.  Only her father, bound and gagged remains\nin the living.\n\n                STU\n        I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.\n\n                BILLY\n        Where the fuck did she go?\n\nSuddenly, the phone RINGS.  Billy and Stu look at each other.\nCompletely surprised.  Billy scrambles over to the phone.\n\n                BILLY\n            (picking up phone)\n        Hello?\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (from phone)\n        Are you alone in the house?\n\nBilly looks to Mr. Prescott.  The cellular phone is gone.\n\n                BILLY\n        You bitch--where the fuck are you?\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little\n        game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST\n        CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED\n        YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?\n\nBilly looks around the living room.\n\n                BILLY\n        Find her.\n\nBilly is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose\nit.  He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees.\n\n                BILLY\n        FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!\n\n                STU\n        I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut\n        to deep.\n\nBilly throws the phone at Stu.  He mouths to him, so Sid can't\nhear.  \"Talk to her...\"  Then Billy takes off for the kitchen.\nStu takes the phone.\n\n                SIDNEY\n            (aware)\n        So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got\n        one. The police are on their way. What\n        are you going to tell them?\n\n                STU\n        Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive.\n\nBilly flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu.  He's\ncompletely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane.\n\n                BILLY\n            (SCREAMING in phone)\n        I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like\n        your slut whore mother.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed\n        Mama's boy.\n\nBilly starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad\nfit of rage...when he notices the hall closet.  Touche!  He smiles\ndeliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as...\n\nA GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the\nsharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.  Billy stumbles\nback, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella\nlodges in his chest, and he goes down.\n\nSidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head.  She looks at Billy,\ndisgusted, throwing the mask on Billy's now still body.  A\nmovement behind her sends her reeling around to find...\n\nRANDY slowly sitting up.  His body drenched in blood.  He's\nalive...barely.  He looks to Sidney...through pain...\n\n                RANDY\n        You know what I hate most about horror\n        movies? The final scene...it just goes on\n        and on...and it gets so stupid...\n\nRandy manages to stand when a FIGURE COMES LEAPING at him,\ncompletely unexpected...it's Stu...barreling into him...they fall\nback into the living room.  Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and\nturns to the living room to find...\n\nRandy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting,\nboth seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a...\n\nHAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the\nfloor...once again she finds Billy on top of her...\n\nIN THE LIVING ROOM\n\nRandy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing...\n\nON SIDNEY as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's\ngot...\n\nRandy is desperately trying to pry away from Stu...he grabs hold\nof the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out\nof Stu's clutch...\n\nHis hands find the top of the TV...the VCR...he yanks on it,\ngripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force-CRASHING\nthe VCR into Stu's head.  Stu drops.\n\nON SIDNEY as she digs her hand into Billy's open chest wound.  He\nCRIES OUT BLOODY MURDER.  Her other hand brings the gun up to his\nface...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash\nof silver appears above Sidney.\n\nBilly has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above\nSidney ready to strike...when a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER\nstriking Billy knocking him back into the living room.\n\nSidney looks up to see...\n\nGALE WEATHERS, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises\nabove the gun's chamber.\n\nSidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her.  Their eyes\nmeet.  A life truce.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nBilly and Stu lay face up, head to head.  Sid and Gale move over\nthem, staring down.  Randy joins them.\n\n                RANDY\n        Sid, you found me out...I'm a virgin.\n        And pretty happy about it right now.\n\nSidney nudges their bodies.  They both stir.\n\n                RANDY\n        Careful. This is the moment when you\n        think the killer's dead, but then he\n        springs back to life for one last scare.\n\nSidney grabs the gun from Gale.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Not this time.\n\nShe positions her foot on Stu's chest and aims.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        This is for my Mom, asshole.\n\nShe SHOOTS him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot.  The she\naims the barrel at Billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at\nher, blood bubbling from his lips.  He's not yet dead.  Their eyes\nlock.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        And this Billy stud-bucket is for having\n        an incredibly small weenie.\n\nShe FIRES another perfect shot.  They're both goners.\n\nSidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies.  A\nquiet moment when suddenly...\n\nA FIGURE LUNGES AT THEM\n\nBoth Sid and Gale and Randy SCREAM in epic, final scare\nproportions as Mr. Prescott leaps forward, still bound and gagged.\n\nSid catches her breath, relaxing.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Oh Daddy...\n\nShe rushes to him, untying him...while Gale moves to the bookcase\nand retrieves the hidden camera.\n\n                GALE\n        I wanna close-up.\n\nRandy appears by Sidney's side, helping her untie her father.\n\n                RANDY\n        This is probably an inappropriate\n        moment, but you think you'd want\n        to maybe go out with me sometime...\n        like on a date?\n\nSidney looks at him, dumbfounded.\n\n                RANDY\n        Maybe catch a movie?\n\nA long moment as Sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation\nto the slight trace of a smile.\n\n                SIDNEY\n        Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.\n\n                RANDY\n        You got it.\n\nHe smiles at her...watching as Sidney grabs hold of her father,\nholding him tight as Gale Weathers, with camera in hand, gets one\nhell of an ending to this SCARY MOVIE.\n\n\n\n                    THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nScream\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Kevin Williamson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:41.231397"}
