LOUISIANA - DAY (1791)\n</b>\n\tA disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket\n\tfrock coat, rides his horse through the fields of\n\tindigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.\n\n\tHe passes slave quarters and the distant colonial\n\tmansion of Pointe du Lac.\n\n\tHe comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he\n\tdismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate\n\tone in Greek Style.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tI had just lost my wife in\n\t\tchildbirth. She and the infant had\n\t\tbeen buried less than half a year.\n\n\tThere is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with\n\ta tiny cherub angel in her arms. Louis looks from the\n\tangel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:\n\n<b>\t\"DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791\n</b><b>\tINFANT JEAN MARIE - 1791\"\n</b>\n\tLouis rips away the vines already covering the\n\tinscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. His face\n\tis ashen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tI was twenty-four and life seemed\n\t\tfinished. I couldn't bear the pain\n\t\tof their loss. I longed for a\n\t\trelease from it.\n\n\n<b>\tINT. WATERFRONT TAVERN - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tLouis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between\n\ttwo whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. All\n\taround him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black African\n\tfreedmen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tI wanted to lose everything. My\n\t\twealth, my estate, my sanity. But\n\t\tLady Luck didn't oblige.\n\n\tLouis displays a hand of four aces. A gambler at the\n\ttable stands in fury, over turning money, cards,\n\tdrinks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou're calling me a cheat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGAMBLER\n</b>\t\tI'm calling you a piece of shit -\n\n\tThe Gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points\n\tit at Louis. The crowd hushes and draws back. Louis\n\tsmiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace\n\tshirt, exposing his chest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tThen do me a favor. Get rid of this\n\t\tpiece of shit...\n\n\tThe Gambler's finger on the trigger. His hand shakes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou lack the courage of your\n\t\tconvictions, sir. Do it.\n\n\tLESTAT, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from\n\tbeneath the shadow of his hood. Gleaming blue eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tMost of all I longed for death. I\n\t\tknow that now. I invited it, a\n\t\trelease from the pain of living...\n\n\tThe Gambler lowers his gun, scowling. Louis pockets the\n\tfistfulls of coins he has won.\n\n\n<b>\tEXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tLoud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians.\n\tLouis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking\n\tfrom a bottle. A pockmarked pimp follows behind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tMy invitation was open to anyone.\n\t\tSailors, thieves, whores and\n\t\tslaves...\n\n\n<b>\tEXT. WHARF - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tLouis, quite insensible, being propped up against a\n\twall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. The\n\tpimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to\n\tslice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He\n\tturns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him\n\tinto the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the\n\twhore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her\n\tmouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the\n\tground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his\n\tface, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore,\n\toff.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tBut it was a vampire that accepted.\n\n\n<b>\tIN THE WATER\n</b>\n\tThe bodies of the thief and whore float by. Above on\n\tthe wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them. He\n\tturns, to see Lestat, towering above him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tThey would have killed you -\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tThen my luck would have changed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tYou want death? Is it death you\n\t\twant?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYes...\n\n\tLestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the\n\tair, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his\n\tteeth in his neck.\n\n\n<b>\tON LOUIS' FACE\n</b>\n\tEvery muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is\n\tdrained from him.\n\n\n<b>\tON THEIR FEET\n</b>\n\tHovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.\n\n\tTHE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and\n\trigging of the boats around the wharf.\n\n\n<b>\tLESTAT\n</b>\n\tFloats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his\n\tblood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging\n\tfrom a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws\n\this teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tYou still want death? Or have you\n\t\ttasted it enough?\n\n\tLouis can barely get the words out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tEnough...\n\n\tLestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets\n\tinto the water below.\n\n\n<b>\tLOUIS' FACE\n</b>\n\tComing to the surface, in the water lapping by the\n\twharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside\n\thim. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him,\n\tdangling from the rope of the shipmast.\n\n\n<b>\tINT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO\n</b>\n<b>\tON MALLOY'S FACE\n</b>\n\tCaptivated, terrified, enthralled.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALLOY\n</b>\t\tThat's how it happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tNo. The Gift of Darkness requires\n\t\tmore than that, as you'll see.\n\n\n<b>\tEXT. WATERFRONT - DAY\n</b>\n\tLouis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish,\n\tthe carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.\n\tHe gets to his feet and walks weakly through the\n\tmudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tHe left me half dead that morning.\n\t\the wanted something from me. He\n\t\tcame back the following night.\n\n\n<b>\tINT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC\n</b>\n\tLouis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with\n\tmosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his\n\tface with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover\n\tin the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by\n\tthe bed, and withdraws, with the others.\n\n\tCandlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin.\n\n\tLouis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring\n\tincoherently. Then he opens his eyes.\n\n\tLESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands\n\tby the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see\n\tthat he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright.\n\tLestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible\n\t- and angel or monster.\n\n\tLouis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWho the hell are you? What are you\n\t\tdoing in my house?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tAnd a beautiful house it is too.\n\t\tYours is a good life, isn't it?\n\n\tLouis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel.\n\tLouis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand.\n\tLestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand\n\tand throws it away. His hand begins to heal.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tYou're not afraid of anything, are\n\t\tyou?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhy should I be?\n\n\tLouis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and\n\tpoint it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tAre you going to put that through\n\t\tme too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?\n\n\tHe comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the\n\tsword passes through his waistcoat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tWere all last night's promises for\n\t\tnothing?\n\n\tHe reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out\n\tthe sword.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat do you want from me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tI've come to answer your prayers.\n\t\tYou want to die, don't you? Life\n\t\thas no meaning anymore, does it?\n\n\tLestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis\n\tis becoming spellbound.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tThe wine has no taste. The food\n\t\tsickens you. There seems no reason\n\t\tfor any of it, does there? But what\n\t\tif I could give it back to you?\n\t\tPluck out the pain and give you\n\t\tanother life? And it would be for\n\t\tall time? And sickness and death\n\t\tcould never touch you again?\n\n\tThe vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE\n</b><b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>\tEXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tThe camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis'\n\twife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow,\n\tas if seen through some unearthly eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tVampires, that's what we are.\n\t\tCreatures of darkness, only we see\n\t\tit that darkness more clearly than\n\t\tany mortal has ever seen...\n\n\tLouis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the\n\toverhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and\n\tchild. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and\n\tchild.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tWouldn't it be sweet to bid pain\n\t\tgoodbye? To wave away anguish and\n\t\tgrief? To embrace the peace of the\n\t\tunending night?\n\n\tThe marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The\n\tangel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife,\n\tDiane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear-\n\tstreamed face. The child speaks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARBLE CHILD\n</b>\t\tPapa...\n\n\tLouis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself\n\ttouching cold marble. He cries out in anguish-\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tDiane!!!!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tThey are gone, Louis. Death took\n\t\tthem.

Lestat\n\tplaces a hand on his forehead and soothes him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tYou have to ask me for this. You\n\t\thave to want it, do you hear me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tGive it to me!!!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tVampires. We thrive on blood.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI want it!\n\n\tLestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis\n\tdoes not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat\n\tdraws back, then stands up and goes to the French\n\tdoors.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tTomorrow night. You must prove\n\t\tyourself.

If you come with me\n\t\ttomorrow, you'll never see it\n\t\tagain.\n\n\tHe leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty\n\tFrench window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty,\n\tover the swamplands and the plantation, filling the\n\troom, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the\n\tpicture of his dead wife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tMy last sunrise. That morning I was\n\t\tnot yet a vampire, and I saw my\n\t\tlast sunrise. I remember it\n\t\tcompletely, yet I don't remember\n\t\tany sunrise before it. I watched\n\t\tthe whole magnificence of the dawn\n\t\tfor the last time, as if it were\n\t\tthe first.

The sound\n\tof whipping is heard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tYour grief has unhinged you. You've\n\t\tlet your estate rot.\n\n\tIn the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is\n\twhipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLESTAT\n</b>\t\tYou let your overseer run riot,\n\t\twork your slaves to the bone.

More dead rats. He sees through the\n\tfloor-length window into rooms lined with stacked\n\tbooks. Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down\n\tfrom the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the\n\tbooks. The floors of the splendid rooms are bare,\n\texcept for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace. A\n\tsingle mirror reflecting the moon.\n\n\tDead rats.\n\n\tHe moves along the porch to the parlor windows. The\n\tcandle flickers inside. He sees -\n\n\n<b>\tHIS POV\n</b>\n\tLestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near\n\tstarvation.
