RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  1\r\n     Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the\r\n     center of what seems to be a makeshift \"meditation\" space.\r\n\r\n     We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).\r\n     He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight\r\n     white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all\r\n     this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you\r\n     notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.\r\n     His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.\r\n\r\n                         MAN (V.O.)\r\n               How did we end up here?\r\n                   (Beat.)\r\n               This place is a fucking dump.\r\n\r\n     We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure\r\n     breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.\r\n\r\n                         MAN (V.O.)\r\n               Smells like balls.\r\n\r\n     A slight twitch in Riggan's neck.\r\n\r\n                         MAN (V.O.)\r\n               We don't belong in this shithole.\r\n\r\n     A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow\r\n     Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.\r\n     On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's\r\n     and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good\r\n     looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She\r\n     stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan\r\n     through her iPhone.\r\n\r\n1A                                                                1A\r\n\r\n     The Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming\r\n     at her the whole time.\r\n\r\n                         RIGGAN\r\n               Sam, I can't--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                     10/29/14   /   2.\r\n\r\n                         SAM\r\n              Dad?

Or something soothing that\r\n              smells nice. Listen I can't--\r\n                        SAM\r\n              It all smells like fucking Kimchi!\r\n\r\n                        RIGGAN\r\n              Then whatever looks nice. Anything but\r\n              roses. No roses.\r\n\r\n                        KOREAN\r\n              Flowers don't need you touch! They need you\r\n              buy!!!\r\n\r\n                        SAM\r\n                  (Close into the screen.)\r\n              I hate this job.\r\n\r\n    And the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans\r\n    forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in\r\n    the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a\r\n    dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a\r\n    piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase \"A\r\n    thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing.\"\r\n\r\n                        ANNIE ON SPEAKERS\r\n              Riggan, they're starting scene\r\n              five. We need you on stage.\r\n\r\n                        RIGGAN\r\n              Shit...\r\n    Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He\r\n    hurries out...\r\n\r\n2   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            2\r\n\r\n    ...through the narrow corridors of the theater. There is a lot\r\n    of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and\r\n    disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the\r\n    stairs, a Stage Hand\u00b7 passes by in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n                        STAGE HAND\u00b7\r\n              Mr. Thomson.\r\n\r\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                    10/29/14   /   3.\r\n\r\n                        RIGGAN\r\n              Steve.\r\n\r\n                        STAGE HAND\u00b7\r\n              It's Daniel.\r\n\r\n                        RIGGAN\r\n                  (Already passed.)\r\n              Okay.\r\n\r\n    Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into\r\n    Jake (42) his producer and friend.\r\n\r\n                        JAKE\r\n              How's it going, buddy.\r\n\r\n                        RIGGAN\r\n              Great. It'd be even better if I\r\n              could get Ralph to stop acting like\r\n              he's in an educational video for\r\n              syphilis...\r\n    The camera moves off of them and onto...\r\n\r\n3   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              3\r\n    ...the stage. Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style\r\n    kitchen.\r\n\r\n    Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense,\r\n    her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she\r\n    is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every\r\n    person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40),\r\n    slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible.\r\n\r\n    A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from\r\n    highball glasses as they chat...\r\n\r\n                        LESLEY\r\n              He loved me.\r\n\r\n                        RALPH\r\n              Yeah. He loved her so much he tried\r\n              to kill her.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              He tried to kill you?\r\n\r\n                        LESLEY\r\n              No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did\r\n              beat me up one night. He dragged me\r\n              around the living room by my\r\n              ankles, yelling \"I love you, I love\r\n                        (MORE)\r\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                 10/29/14   /   4.\r\n                    LESLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          you, bitch.\" What do you do with a\r\n          love like that?\r\n\r\n                    RALPH\r\n          How is that-- That is not love and you know\r\n          it. Why do you insist on calling it--\r\n\r\n                    LESLEY\r\n          You can say what you want, but I know what\r\n          it was.\r\n                    RALPH\r\n          What about you, Nick? Does that sound like\r\n          love to you?\r\n\r\nRiggan arrives at the table and sits.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Sorry I'm late.\r\n              (Beat. In character.)\r\n          I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't\r\n          know the man. I've only heard his name\r\n          mentioned in passing. You'd have to\r\n          know the particulars. But I think what\r\n          you're saying is that love is absolute.\r\n\r\n                    RALPH\r\n          Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about\r\n          is... The kind of love I'm talking about,\r\n          you don't try and kill people.\r\n\r\n                    LESLEY\r\n              (Sadly.)\r\n          It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was. I don't\r\n          care what anybody says. He was ready to die\r\n          for it.\r\n\r\n                    RALPH\r\n          Ask her what he did after she left him.\r\n\r\n                    LESLEY\r\n          He shot himself in the mouth. But he\r\n          screwed that up, too. Poor Ed.\r\n\r\n                    RALPH\r\n          Poor Ed, my ass. The guy was dangerous.\r\n\r\n                     LAURA\r\n          How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in\r\n          the mouth?\r\n\r\n                    RALPH\r\n              (By the numbers.)\r\n          He used to carry this twenty-two. We lived\r\n          like fugitives those days.

Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How\r\n          many times do I have to-- Fugitives are\r\n          scared. Give me more of that.\r\n\r\nRalph nods. He takes a breath and dives in once again...\r\n\r\n                    RALPH\r\n              (The same but louder.)\r\n          We lived like fugitives those days...\r\n\r\nExtremely frustrated, Riggan stares out into the auditorium.\r\nFrom his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row.\r\nHis head buried in his hands, tortured by Ralph's performance.\r\nRiggan turns back to Ralph.\r\n\r\n                    RALPH (CONT'D)\r\n          ...I never knew if he was going to come out\r\n          of the bushes or from behind a car and just\r\n          start shooting.\r\n\r\nRiggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed\r\ndown the drain. Ralph is just that bad.\r\n\r\n                    RALPH (CONT'D)\r\n          The man was crazy. He was capable of\r\n          anything.\r\n\r\nThe actors all wait for a cue from Riggan, who is now staring\r\nup into the lights above the stage. Laura finally picks up\r\nRiggan's cue.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Christ. What a nightmare...\r\n\r\n                    RALPH\r\n          He used to call me at the hospital and\r\n          say...\r\n              (Over the top.)\r\n          \"Son of a bitch.

I just wanted to give\r\n          you a range, so you could--\r\n\r\nAnd with that a light comes barreling down from it's perch and\r\ncrashes into Ralph's head, making him hit the floor like a rag\r\ndoll.

On a television, a\r\nsegment of E! News. A busty blond, with an exaggerated smile,\r\nhosts.\r\n\r\n                    BLOND WOMAN\r\n          ...and when we come back, an exclusive\r\n          interview with Robert Downey Jr., who tells\r\n          us about the billion-dollar Iron Man\r\n          franchise. The talented actor invited us\r\n          onto the set of Iron Man 3...\r\n\r\nRiggan slams the tv off, his mind racing. He sits on a chair.\r\n\r\n                    MAN (V.O.)\r\n          That clown doesn't have half your talent\r\n          and he's making a fortune in that Tin Man\r\n          get up.\r\n\r\nRiggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches\r\nsight of a poster from a movie called \"Birdman 3\". The\r\nsuperhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings\r\nwidely spread, stares directly back at him. A hand written\r\nnote on the top of the poster reads: \"Thomson, break a wing!\r\nFrom the boys at Local 1.\" Riggan tries to calm himself with a\r\nmantra...\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          \"Breathing in, I embrace my anger.\r\n          Breathing out, I smile to it.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                10/29/14   /   10.\r\n\r\n                    BIRDMAN (V.O.)\r\n          Embrace it. Kiss it. Turn it around and\r\n          fuck it in the--\r\n\r\nA knock on the door behind him.\r\n\r\n                      RIGGAN\r\n          Not now!\r\n\r\nLaura opens the door and sticks her head in.\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Can I come in?\r\n\r\n                      RIGGAN\r\n          No.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Okay. Two words. Shia La Beouf.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          That's three words.\r\n\r\n                      LAURA\r\n          It's two.\r\n\r\n                      RIGGAN\r\n          Get out.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          I love you.\r\n\r\nShe closes the door. Riggan tries to calm himself down, but\r\nLaura opens the door again.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          I take it we're not going to dinner\r\n          anymore?\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          I don't have an actor.\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          I don't have a life.\r\n\r\n                      RIGGAN\r\n          Laura...\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Fine. Whatever.\r\n              (Goes to leave but stops.)\r\n          You remember at Joan's when you\r\n          asked me to come do a Broadway play\r\n          with you? You said it would be\r\n          fun...\r\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                  10/29/14     /   11.\r\n\r\n                          RIGGAN\r\n               Go away.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               So far? No fun.\r\n\r\n     Riggan closes the door and looks at the Birdman poster.\r\n\r\n                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)\r\n               Fun? You know what would be fun? Getting\r\n               the fuck out of here before we humiliate\r\n               ourselves. That would be fun.\r\n\r\n     Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at\r\n     his hair. As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig.\r\n     He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay\r\n     calm. Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end\r\n     of the table. A card in them says, \"They didn't have the\r\n     whatever you wanted - Sam\". Enraged, Riggan focuses on the\r\n     vase. It begins to shift. Then, with a surge of anger,\r\n     without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the\r\n     wall on the other side of the room.\r\n\r\n     The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor. It\r\n     hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room,\r\n     until it finally settles on Riggan, now dressed in a casual\r\n     blazer.\r\n\r\nA5                                                                 A5\r\n\r\n     It is later the same day. He is sitting on the sofa and on three\r\n     chairs in front of him are three journalists:\r\n\r\n     Gabriel, a geeky theatre journalist, wearing thick glasses and\r\n     a thin tie. Clara, a reporter from an entertainment blog. And\r\n     Han, a polite, obese Japanese journalist, who sits next to his\r\n     translator, another Japanese guy.\r\n\r\n                         GABRIEL\r\n               Why does somebody go from playing the lead\r\n               in a comic book franchise to adapting\r\n               Raymond Carver for the stage?\r\n\r\n     Riggan tries to remain calm.\r\n\r\n                         GABRIEL (CONT'D)\r\n               I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes\r\n               said, \"The cultural work done in the past\r\n               by gods and epic sagas is now done by\r\n               laundry detergent commercials and comic\r\n               strip characters.\" It's a big leap you've\r\n               taken...\r\n\r\n     Riggan shifts nervously.\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                10/29/14   /   12.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Well...

The husband was depressed.\r\n          Even when I told him his wife was gonna\r\n          pull through, he was still depressed. So,\r\n          I got up to his mouth hole and asked him,\r\n          and he told me it was because he couldn't\r\n          see her through the eye holes. Can you\r\n          imagine?

Desolate music.\r\n\r\n                          LAURA\r\n                    (To the audience as soliloquy.)\r\n                In the days before Nick's depression really\r\n                started to eat away at him, he had no idea\r\n                I was pregnant. And I never intended on\r\n                telling him. I guess we make choices in\r\n                life, and we choose to live with them. Or\r\n                not. I didn't want that baby...\r\n\r\n      Three dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura. We follow\r\n      the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing\r\n      pajamas.\r\n                          LAURA (O.S.)

But because I just wasn't ready to\r\n                love myself. There's a certain distance to\r\n                it all now. A wistful distance.\r\n                Underscored by a gentle breeze and the\r\n                sound of the birds... laughing at the\r\n                whimsy of it all.\r\n\r\n      A stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed. The\r\n      camera slips under the covers with them and stays there.\r\n\r\n                          MIKE\r\n                    (Whispering.)\r\n                Hey, Les...\r\n\r\n                          LESLEY\r\n                    (Whispering.)\r\n                What?\r\n                            MIKE\r\n                I'm hard.\r\n\r\n                          LESLEY\r\n                No, you're not.

He wears a\r\n     mustache and a long wig, that makes him look like a wild man.\r\n     He holds a gun in his right hand. A neon \"Motel\" sign is\r\n     illuminated. A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind\r\n     the set, accompanied by the appropriate sound effect.

He was off in a corner\r\n          laid out on a gurney. We took the old\r\n          couple up to the O.R.. They were a\r\n          mess. We worked like hell on them for\r\n          most of the night...\r\n\r\nWe pan along the auditorium back to the stage to find Riggan,\r\nMike, Lesley and Laura in the kitchen.\r\n                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n          When we were done, we wrapped them in\r\n          full body casts. The husband was\r\n          depressed. Even when I told him his\r\n          wife was gonna pull through, he was\r\n          still depressed. So, I got up to his\r\n          mouth hole and asked him, and he told\r\n          me it was because he couldn't see her\r\n          through the eye holes. Can you imagine?\r\n          I'm telling you, the man's heart was\r\n          breaking because he couldn't turn his\r\n          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.\r\n\r\n                    LESLEY\r\n              (In genuine tears.)\r\n          That's terrible. (Beat.) Perfect.\r\n          And terrible.\r\n\r\nShe is crushed. Laura holds Lesley, trying to control her own\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n              (Taking this in.)\r\n          Yeah. So I guess what we have to\r\n          ask ourselves is... What do we talk\r\n          about when we talk about love?\r\n\r\nThe lights go to a blackout and the audience applauds as some\r\nscene change music plays. As we follow Riggan off stage, the\r\nlights are turned on again, but now they have an orange mood.\r\nLesley is the only one on stage, doing a monologue.\r\n\r\n                    LESLEY\r\n          Mel and I have been together five\r\n          years, been married for four. But\r\n          it was Ed who taught me something\r\n          no one else could... He taught me\r\n          what it felt like to really feel\r\n          loved. And the terrible thing is\r\n          that if something happened to Mel\r\n          or myself, if something happened to\r\n          either one of us tomorrow, I think\r\n          the other one would grieve for a\r\n          while, you know, but then would go\r\n                    (MORE)\r\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                 10/29/14   /   81.\r\n                     LESLEY (CONT'D)\r\n           out and love again, have someone\r\n           else soon enough. All this-- All of\r\n           this love we're talking about... it\r\n           would just be a memory. Maybe not\r\n           even a memory. Am I wrong? I mean,\r\n           I don't know anything. And I'm the\r\n           first one to admit it.\r\n\r\nA Dresser waits in the wings to help Riggan with his change.\r\n\r\n                     DRESSER\r\n           That was amazing!\r\n\r\nRiggan looks proud. Things are finally going well. He undresses\r\nto his underwear and puts on a robe and his moccasins, as the\r\nstage begins to revolve. Laura, in costume, walks up beside\r\nhim. Over the following dialogue, the kitchen gives way to the\r\nextravagant garden set we saw before.\r\n\r\n                     LAURA\r\n               (A bit distant.)\r\n           It's actually going well.\r\n\r\n                     RIGGAN\r\n           Yeah. (A beat.) Hey. I think we have to\r\n           talk.\r\n\r\n                     LAURA\r\n               (Sad smile.)\r\n           No. We don't.\r\n\r\nRiggan nods.\r\n\r\n                     RIGGAN\r\n           Right. (Beat.) We will eventually,\r\n           though, `cause that's the only way I get\r\n           to say I'm sorry. I really am.\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n                     LAURA\r\n           We could've made good parents.\r\n\r\n                     RIGGAN\r\n           Horrible. We would've been just--\r\n\r\n                     LAURA\r\n           Awful.

I\r\n               thought I could be a mom. My body seems to\r\n               disagree.\r\n\r\n     The lights come up and Laura walks onto the stage.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n                   (Back to him.)\r\n               You were right. This was fun.\r\n     Riggan watches her go, but something else grabs his attention.\r\n     We pan across the stage to see Sam and Mike on the other side.\r\n     They talk and laugh. Sam kisses Mike softly. Mike playfully\r\n     grabs her ass.\r\n\r\n     We pan back to Riggan. His expression morphs from broken-\r\n     hearted to rage. He marches over to a stage hand.\r\n                         RIGGAN\r\n               You have a cigarette?\r\n\r\n     The stage hand holds out a pack, Riggan takes one.\r\n\r\n                         STAGE HAND\r\n               You need a light?\r\n\r\n     Riggan snatches the lighter and storms out through the hallway,\r\n     and out the back door of the theater to...\r\n\r\n41   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS         41\r\n\r\n     ...the alley. Down at the end, we can see the tourists making\r\n     their way about the streets. Riggan lights the cigarette and\r\n     leans back against the stage door trying to calm himself.\r\n\r\n                         RIGGAN\r\n               Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out,\r\n               I ease myself.\r\n\r\n     But this is New York City. A fluorescent light buzzes above his\r\n     head. Taxis honk their horns. The sound of pedestrians yelling\r\n     at one another. All fueling his agitation.\r\n     Riggan checks his watch. He pulls one last drag from the\r\n     cigarette before he tosses it, and turns to head back in, only\r\n     to realize the door has locked. He tries to pull it open to no\r\n     avail. He begins to knock loudly on the door. There is no\r\n     response. He knocks louder. Nothing.\r\n\r\n     He is turning to walk away when he realizes that his robe is\r\n     caught in the door. He checks his watch again and now is\r\n     beginning to panic. He tries to tear at the robe but the terry\r\n     cloth is too strong for him to rip. Frantically, he looks around\r\n     for an answer. No answer. No time. He pulls the robe off of him\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                  10/29/14     /   83.\r\n\r\n     and, wearing only his underwear and moccasins, he charges down\r\n     the alley way toward...\r\n\r\n42   EXT.

After a few seconds, the sound of the gunshot\r\n     from the scene echoes through the theater. The audience\r\n     applauds. The camera starts to move forward. A few seconds later\r\n     Riggan takes over the POV with his bloody long wig and the fake\r\n     gun. We follow up to...\r\n\r\n46   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             46\r\n\r\n     ...his dressing room. He puts on a robe. He walks to his\r\n     refrigerator without acknowledging Sam who is sitting on the\r\n     couch, scribbling her dashes on the toilet paper once again.\r\n     Riggan takes out a plastic container of bologna and a jar of\r\n     mustard. He sits in front of his dressing table, peels open the\r\n     bologna and opens the jar of mustard. Slice by slice, he dips\r\n     the bologna in the mustard and shoves it into his mouth.\r\n\r\n                         SAM\r\n               Dad...?\r\n\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                             10/29/14     /   87.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n              (Looking up.)\r\n          Hey.

Opening night, tomorrow.\r\n\r\n                      RIGGAN\r\n          Yeah.\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          That's exciting, huh?\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Yeah. Well... I don't know. The previews\r\n          have been a train wreck. We haven't been\r\n          able to get through a performance\r\n          without a raging fire... or a raging\r\n          hard-on. I'm not really sleeping, you\r\n          know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke.\r\n          Oh, and also, this play feels like a\r\n          miniature, deformed version of myself\r\n          that keeps following me around, hitting\r\n          me in the balls with a tiny hammer.\r\n              (Beat.)\r\n          Sorry, what was your question?\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n              (Looking through phone.)\r\n          Never mind...

Riggan notices the toilet paper.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          What are you doing? Some homework?\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          No. I don't-- When I was in rehab, they\r\n          made us do this.\r\n\r\n                      RIGGAN\r\n          Really...\r\n                    SAM\r\n          Yeah.

She takes the last\r\ntwo panels and tears them off.\r\n                    SAM (CONT'D)\r\n          And this... (Hands them to him.) ...is\r\n          supposed to represent the entire time us\r\n          humans have been here. One hundred and\r\n          fifty thousand years. That's it.\r\n              (Beat.)\r\n          I guess they were trying to remind us\r\n          that that's what all our egos and self-\r\n          obsession are worth.\r\n\r\nRiggan stares at the paper, and then at Sam.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n              (Casually.)\r\n          I was a shitty father, wasn't I?\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          No. You were a-- (She stops herself.)\r\n          You were fine.\r\nHe stops chewing and stares out.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Fine... You're right. I am just\r\n          \"fine\". Adorably mediocre.\r\n\r\nHe smiles to her sadly, and then he wipes the mustard from his\r\nface with the piece of toilet paper.\r\n\r\n                      SAM\r\n          Dad!\r\n\r\n                      RIGGAN\r\n          What?\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                10/29/14   /   89.\r\n\r\nSam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh... Shit. I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n              (Smiling.)\r\n          It's okay. You just destroyed the entire\r\n          human race in one blow.\r\n\r\nRiggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions.\r\n                    SAM (CONT'D)\r\n          Dad. (She hesitates.) Do you know\r\n          you're becoming a trending topic?\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Really? What does that mean?\r\n\r\nSam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to\r\nRiggan. Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of\r\nhimself in the streets in his underwear.\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          350,000 views in less than an hour.\r\n          Believe it or not, this is power.\r\n\r\nRiggan looks at more footage, seemingly confused. After a\r\nmoment, the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a\r\ntext message, which reads \"Truth or Dare?\"\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          It's for you.\r\n\r\nShe grabs the phone and looks at the screen. Then at her\r\nfather. Riggan is staring at her. She looks down.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Go ahead...\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n              (Hesitant.)\r\n          Are you...?\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Go.\r\n\r\nA sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits.\r\n\r\nRiggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on\r\nhis reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he\r\nspots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the\r\nground previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                     10/29/14   /   90.\r\n\r\n     He gets up and goes into the bathroom. He pulls off the long\r\n     wig and the mustache. He washes his face. Then he opens a\r\n     small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee. The\r\n     dark dye begins to run out, leaving only white hair. For the\r\n     first time we see that Riggan has a white beard.\r\n\r\n     He puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom. He grabs\r\n     a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and\r\n     into...\r\n\r\n47   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            47\r\n\r\n     ...the hallway. As he passes by Mike's door he can hear Sam and\r\n     Mike. They're trying to be as quiet as possible, but we can hear\r\n     them flirting and laughing.\r\n\r\n     He pauses for a moment but continues on. After a few seconds,\r\n     his phone vibrates. He looks at it. A text from Jake reads:\r\n     \"Have you seen this??? Awesome!!!\" He clicks the attachment and\r\n     sees the, now infamous, video of his underwear escapade in the\r\n     street. We zoom in until the image fills the screen, when we\r\n     finally pull away, we discover that...\r\n\r\n48   INT. RUM HOUSE - LATER                                         48\r\n     ...Riggan's video is being played now in a television in the\r\n     bar. We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video\r\n     caption that reads: \"Birdman goes viral, 930.000 views and\r\n     counting\". The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar,\r\n     drunk. He is one of the few customers. He polishes off his\r\n     drink.\r\n                         RIGGAN\r\n               Let me have another one.\r\n\r\n                         BARTENDER\r\n               You got it.\r\n\r\n     The bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan. A waiter steps\r\n     up to the bar. The bartender points to a martini.\r\n\r\n                         BARTENDER (CONT'D)\r\n                   (To the waiter.)\r\n               That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.\r\n\r\n     Riggan's head tilts at the mention of the name. He looks over to\r\n     see Tabitha sitting at a table, scratching in her notebook.\r\n\r\n                         RIGGAN\r\n                   (Hands the waiter a bill.)\r\n               I got it. She's a friend of mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n                                              10/29/14   /   91.\r\n\r\nThe waiter pockets the money and gives Riggan the drink. He\r\nwalks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her. Not\r\nlooking up, she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip.\r\n\r\nRiggan sits down across from her. She looks up and immediately\r\nrecognizes him. He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and\r\npushes it in front of her. She looks at him, and then down to\r\nthe napkin. She reads it in silence.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n              (Re: The napkin.)\r\n          That was twenty years before I put on that\r\n          damned costume.\r\n\r\nA pause.

Riggan sits numb. After a moment, he reaches\r\n      over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out\r\n      the sides of his mouth. Unaware, he slams the empty martini\r\n      glass on top of the Carver napkin and gets up. We follow him\r\n      out onto...\r\n\r\n49    EXT.

We pan around\r\n      to find Birdman (a stronger Riggan wearing a cool Birdman\r\n      outfit), following behind him.\r\n\r\n                          BIRDMAN\r\n                You spent your whole life building a\r\n                reputation and a bank account, and now\r\n                they're both blown.

The sound is so loud that it seems to belong to\r\n      another movie. The earth shakes. People run. Dust all over.\r\n      Fire.

Birdman uses his\r\n      powerful blow to send the alien flying away.\r\n\r\n                          BIRDMAN\r\n                And when you shout \"whooaa!\"...\r\n                    (Riggan shouts \"Whooaa!\")\r\n                ...it explodes in the eardrum of\r\n                millions.

See?\r\n                Gravity doesn't even apply to you.\r\n\r\n      The camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street.\r\n      There is something magical in his ascension, gently impelled by\r\n      the breeze. A beautiful backlight makes his body glow. Birdman\r\n      flutters around him.\r\n                          BIRDMAN (CONT'D)\r\n                Listen to me. We gotta go back!

Something\r\n      makes sense in what Birdman is telling him.\r\n\r\n      The camera becomes Riggan's POV. He looks down to see the\r\n      people on the street, watching him in awe.\r\n                          BIRDMAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n                We'll go back.

The camera\r\n      tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around,\r\n      and more cars has stopped, and they all point at Riggan,\r\n      worried about the situation.\r\n\r\n      A guy wearing shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his\r\n      window, one floor below Riggan, and looks up at him.\r\n\r\n                          GUY\r\n                Dude, what are you doing?\r\n\r\n      Riggan looks down at the people on the street far below.\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                               10/29/14   /   98.\r\n\r\n                    GUY (CONT'D)\r\n          You okay, buddy?

Do you want me to\r\n          call someone? Do you know where to go?\r\n\r\nRiggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly\r\ntoward him. He opens his eyes. The music begins to swell. Riggan\r\nstands up straight and proud, and in a voice that sounds like\r\nBirdman...\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Yes.

The music is rousing.\r\n      As he runs, he holds out his arms, spreading them wide. The\r\n      camera runs behind him, until suddenly...\r\n\r\n\r\nF50                                                                 F50\r\n      Riggan jumps, and the camera jumps after him. He rapidly\r\n      falls toward the street, toward the asphalt. But in his face\r\n      there is no fear. No. He spreads his arms again and...\r\n\r\n\r\nG50                                                                 G50\r\n\r\n      He takes flight, soaring high over Manhattan.

We pan to see a taxi driver coming out of his car,\r\n      running like a mad man toward us.\r\n\r\n      We stay with the Usher and the taxi driver as they argue.

He is wearing the long wig and\r\n          mustache for the motel scene.\r\n\r\n          Sylvia appears in the doorway.\r\n\r\n                                SYLVIA\r\n                      Wow, that is just NASCAR hot.\r\n\r\n          He smiles at her.\r\n                                SYLVIA (CONT'D)\r\n                      I just wanted to come say hello.

I hate roses...\r\n\r\n          She laughs.

You seem-- I don't know, you\r\n          seem abnormally calm.\r\n\r\n                     RIGGAN\r\n          I am calm. I'm great. I spent most of\r\n          the day observing how beautifully this\r\n          pile of dirty clothes was lit by the\r\n          warm afternoon sun. (A tiny smile.) So\r\n          beautiful.\r\nSylvia, teasing him, closes her eyes and imitates Riggan's\r\nmeditation posture.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n              (Mocking him.)\r\n          Oh yes.

I have this voice that talks to\r\n          me and tells me the truth. It's comforting,\r\n          and scary.\r\n\r\nA beat.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          I'm going to pretend I didn't hear you say\r\n          that.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Okay.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n              (Changing the subject.)\r\n          You wouldn't believe the crowd outside.\r\n          They said, some people paid up to 500\r\n          dollars a ticket.\r\n\r\nHe sits down.\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          You wanna hear something funny?\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          Sure.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Do you remember our last anniversary party?\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          Seriously?

Yeah, it rings a bell.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Yeah, well. Let's skip over that part\r\n          for a minute.\r\n                      SYLVIA\r\n          Gladly.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          After you threw the guests out of the\r\n          house, and the furniture out of the\r\n          window. You locked yourself in the\r\n          bathroom.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          I remember. Why are we--\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          I drove down to Malibu. I sat on the beach\r\n          for a while. Just... staring out at the\r\n          ocean.\r\n\r\n                      SYLVIA\r\n          Riggan...\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Until I walked straight into the water\r\n          and tried to drown myself.\r\n\r\nSilence. Sylvia stares at Riggan, surprised.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n          I was in up to my chest when I felt the\r\n          first one. On my back, like somebody was\r\n          holding a frying pan against me. And then\r\n          my chest, and my legs. The water was full\r\n          of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the\r\n          water, and I started rolling around the\r\n          sand like a maniac... crying.\r\n\r\nSylvia doesn't know how to react.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          You said it was a sunburn.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n              (Smiling.)\r\n          And you believed me.\r\n\r\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\r\n                                            10/29/14   /   103.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          To be honest, I didn't give a shit.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          I love you. And I love Sam.\r\n\r\n                      SYLVIA\r\n          I know.\r\n\r\nSilence. They stare at each other.\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          I never should have video taped Sam's\r\n          birth. First of all because you and Sam\r\n          both look like shit in that video. But\r\n          mostly because I missed the moment. I\r\n          should have just been there with the two\r\n          of you. Present in my own life. So I'd\r\n          have it. But, I don't. I don't have any of\r\n          it.\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          You have Sam.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          No, I don't.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          Listen, she's just--\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          No, I understand. She needed a father\r\n          and she got one shamefully successful\r\n          youtube video. Pretty pathetic.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n              (Putting a finger on\r\n               Riggan's lips.)\r\n          Shhh... There are more pathetic things\r\n          than that. That mustache, for example.\r\nShe kisses him.\r\n\r\n                    ANNIE ON SPEAKERS\r\n          Places for act two.

You\r\n          don't want to miss what's next.\r\n\r\nSylvia lingers for a moment, and not knowing what to say, she\r\nexits. Riggan opens a drawer and takes out a black case. He\r\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                 10/29/14   /   104.\r\n\r\n     gently opens the lid. Inside a revolver. He takes some bullets\r\n     out of a box and one by one loads them into the chamber as he\r\n     does his vocal exercises into the mirror.\r\n\r\n                         RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Twenty little leopards laughed at two\r\n               lofty lions. Twenty little leopards\r\n               laughed at two lofty lions. Twenty\r\n               little leopards... laughed.\r\n\r\n     He stares at the dressing room door, and with his telekinetic\r\n     powers he opens it. He snaps the cylinder into the gun and\r\n     exits out into...\r\n\r\n53   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                        53\r\n\r\n     ...the hallway.

She stays there, holding the\r\n     device. Riggan takes his place outside the motel door. We pan\r\n     toward the audience. The auditorium is full. The audience in\r\n     complete silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Riggan knocks firmly on the door. Silence again. Then...\r\n\r\n                         RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n               Terri!

I lived for\r\n               you-- I worshipped you...\r\n                         MIKE\r\n               Listen Ed, I know this is hard but--\r\n\r\n     Riggan raises one hand to silence Mike. Mike looks at him,\r\n     confused. His eyes narrow on the gun. There is no red plug.\r\n\r\n     Dead silence. An eerie electricity in the theater.\r\n\r\n                         RIGGAN\r\n               What's wrong with me? Why do I end\r\n               up having to beg people to love me?\r\n\r\n                         LESLEY\r\n               Ed. Eddie. Please...

You do.\r\n\r\n                         RIGGAN\r\n               I just wanted to be what you wanted.\r\n                   (Beat.)\r\n               Now I spend every fucking minute\r\n               praying to be someone else.

He\r\nsmiles the most beautiful insane smile.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't\r\n          exist. None of this matters.\r\n\r\nThen he raises a trembling arm, and with his eyes full of\r\ntears, he aims the gun at Mike.\r\n\r\n                       RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Pum.\r\n\r\nBut he doesn't shoot. Then he turns and aims at Tabitha\r\nDickinson who is sitting on the second row.\r\n                       RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Pum.\r\n\r\nAgain, no shot. Slowly, Riggan raises the gun toward his own\r\nhead, suddenly a frightening explosion. Blood sprays. Riggan\r\nfalls. We stay with the shell-shocked audience.

The sole exception is Tabitha, who remains seated, a\r\ndazed expression on her face.

He's alive. My\r\n          best friend is alive. And he is the\r\n          man of the hour!\r\n\r\nJake holds the New York Times up in the air.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          What is that?\r\n\r\n                    JAKE\r\n          You did it.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n              (Coming to them.)\r\n          You have to be shitting me... She\r\n          wrote a review?\r\n\r\nJake unfolds the newspaper and we see the headline of the\r\nreview: \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\".\r\n                    JAKE\r\n              (To Sylvia.)\r\n          Read it.\r\n\r\nHe hands her the newspaper. She begins to read to herself.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          I don't believe this...\r\n\r\n                    JAKE\r\n          Read it out loud!\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          \"Thompson has unwittingly given\r\n          birth to a new form that can only\r\n          be described as supra-realism.\r\n          Blood was spilled both literally\r\n          and metaphorically by artist and\r\n          audience alike.

And if he\r\n          doesn't like that one, we'll get\r\n          him another one. We can use Meg\r\n          Ryan's guy. Who gives a shit? Turn\r\n          on the tv. There are people praying\r\n          for him all over the country.\r\n          They're lighting candles in Central\r\n          Park. He did it. (To Riggan) You\r\n          did it!

You're so\r\n          full of shit, Jake.\r\n\r\nJake needs a few seconds to recover. Then he looks at Riggan\r\nwho just sits there, in silence.\r\n\r\n                    JAKE\r\n          Why aren't you saying anything?\r\n          This is what you wanted wasn't it?\r\n              (Riggan gazes at the\r\n               review.)\r\n          Riggan, this is what you wanted.\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          It's what I wanted.\r\n\r\n                    JAKE\r\n          Okay, listen. You're gonna get hit\r\n          with a \"brandishing a weapon\"\r\n          charge. If anybody talks to you, it\r\n          was an accident and we're doing an\r\n          internal invest--\r\n\r\nA newsman comes into the room and takes a quick picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\r\n                                              10/29/14   /   110.\r\n\r\n                    JAKE (CONT'D)\r\n              (Chasing him out.)\r\n          This is a hospital you motherfucker!\r\n\r\nJake rushes to the door, shoving the newsman and a few other\r\npaparazzi out the door. Security guards. Chaos. Finally\r\nsilence. Sylvia steps up and looks Riggan in the eye.\r\n\r\n                    SYLVIA\r\n          Is that what it was? An accident?\r\nRiggan just stares at her. His calm, sad eyes peeking through\r\nthe bandages. After a moment his gaze moves over her\r\nshoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the\r\ndoorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward\r\nsilence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone.\r\n\r\nShe kisses Sam on the head and exits. Sam walks the flowers\r\nto Riggan at the bed. She lays them on his chest.\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          Alchemillas.\r\n\r\nThe hint of a smile on Riggan's face.\r\n\r\n                    SAM (CONT'D)\r\n          Are you actually smiling?\r\n              (She smiles.)\r\n          What's so funny?\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          I can't smell them.\r\n\r\nA moment until the smiles turn to gentle laughter. She takes\r\nout her cell phone and snaps a picture of him.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)\r\n          What are you doing?\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          I'm posting this picture on your\r\n          Twitter page.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Very funny...\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          Set it up today.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          You're joking.\r\n\r\n                     SAM\r\n          I'm not.\r\n\r\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\n                                               10/29/14   /   111.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Let me see the picture.\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          Absolutely not. You look hideous.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          I'm just kidding. No, I'm not. You\r\n          look hideous.\r\n              (Working on phone.)\r\n          You already have 80 thousand\r\n          followers. In less than a day. And\r\n          I'm about to scare the shit out of\r\n          them.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          Let me see.\r\n                      SAM\r\n          No. Done.\r\n\r\nA moment between them. Sam picks up the flowers and kisses\r\nhim tenderly on the head. Riggan is pleasantly surprised by\r\nthat kiss.\r\n\r\n                    SAM (CONT'D)\r\n          Now, I'm going to find something to\r\n          put these flowers in.\r\n\r\nShe heads out of the room. Riggan lies there for a moment,\r\ntranquil. After a moment he reaches up and touches his\r\nbandages. Finally, he climbs out of the bed. We follow him\r\ninto...\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. BATHROOM - ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n...the bathroom. He stands before the mirror. He stares at\r\nhis reflection for a few seconds, and slowly begins to remove\r\nthe bandages. We can see that Riggan's nose has been\r\nreconstructed. It is a crooked, incomplete nose, like the one\r\nJavier Bardem has.\r\n\r\n                    RIGGAN\r\n          I do look hideous.\r\n\r\nIn the reflection, Riggan sees Birdman sitting on the toilet.\r\nThey look at each other, but say nothing. Riggan puts the\r\nbandages back on and we follow him out to...\r\n                                            10/29/14   /   112.\r\n\r\nINT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n...the room. He looks around, but Sam is gone. He ambles over\r\nto the window, his ass hanging out of the back of his\r\nhospital robe. He opens the window and feels the sun and the\r\nbreeze on his swollen face. We just hear the sounds of the\r\npeople standing down in the parking lot. Media trucks. Fans.\r\nWe stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about\r\nsomething. He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky. Then\r\nhe grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to\r\nstep up onto the sill.\r\nThe camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos\r\npropped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. One\r\nwith Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver's \"What we talk About\r\nWhen We Talk About Love\" laying on the surface.\r\n\r\nThe camera continues to pan until it comes to the door. Sam\r\nenters with a small vase. She looks around...\r\n\r\n                    SAM\r\n          Dad?\r\n\r\nShe goes to the bathroom and peers in... nothing.\r\n\r\n                    SAM (CONT'D)\r\n          Dad...?\r\n\r\nShe spots the opened window and registers the sounds from\r\noutside. Tentatively she walks toward the window. She gets\r\nthere, summons her courage and looks down. Nothing. Slowly,\r\nconfused, she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky. A\r\nsmile, filled with pride, begin to wash over her face.\r\n\r\n                                           SMASH TO BLACK         *\r\n FOXSEARCHLIGHT.COM/AWARDS\r\nReleased by Twentieth Century Fox \u00a9 2014 Twentieth Century Fox\r\n\n\n\n\nBirdman\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Alejandro G.
