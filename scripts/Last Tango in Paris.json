I'm afraid of spiders. The\r\n           key is missing. Strange things\r\n           happen.\r\n          One of the APT. GUESTS puts an empty WINE BOTTLE outside\r\n          their door.

As the\r\n          concierge TRILLS OUT FIGARO, she gives up and walks away.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)\r\n           Wait! Don't go!

Farming\r\n           community. We lived on a farm.\r\n           And I'd come home after school and\r\n           she'd be gone. In jail... or\r\n           something. And... I used to... I\r\n           used to have to milk a cow every\r\n           morning and every night and I liked\r\n           that. I remember...\r\n                         \r\n          An IRISH COUNTRY JIG plays over the MONOLOGUE.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n           One time I was all dressed up to go\r\n           out and take this girl to a\r\n           basketball game. And I started to\r\n           go out and my father said, \"You\r\n           have to milk the cow.\" I said,\r\n           \"Would you please milk it for me?\"\r\n           And he said, \"No, get your ass out\r\n           there.\" So I went out and I was in\r\n           a hurry and didn't have time to\r\n           change my shoes. And I had cow shit\r\n           all over my shoes. And on the way\r\n           to the basketball game, it smelled\r\n           in the car. I don't know. I-I can't\r\n           remember very many good things.\r\n           34.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          JEANNE'S VOICE\r\n           Not one?\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a\r\n           very nice guy. Old guy, very poor,\r\n           and worked real hard. I used to\r\n           work in a ditch, draining land for\r\n           farming. And he wore overalls and\r\n           he smoked a clay pipe. Half the\r\n           time he wouldn't put tobacco in it.\r\n           And I hated the work. It was hot\r\n           and dirty and... it broke my back.\r\n           And... all day long I'd watch his\r\n           spit which would run down the pipe\r\n           stem and hang on the bowl of the\r\n           pipe. And I used to make bets with\r\n           myself on when it was going to fall\r\n           off. And I always lost. I never saw\r\n           it fall off. I'd just look around\r\n           and it'd be gone and then the new\r\n           one would be there. And then we had\r\n           a beautiful... My mother... My\r\n           mother taught me to love nature.\r\n           And... I guess that was the most\r\n           she could do. And... we had... In\r\n           front of our house we had this big\r\n           field... meadow. It was a mustard\r\n           field in the summer and we had a\r\n           big black dog named Dutchy. And she\r\n           used to hunt for rabbits in that\r\n           field but she couldn't see them. So\r\n           she'd have to leap up in this\r\n           mustard field and look around very\r\n           quickly to see where the rabbits\r\n           were. And it was... very beautiful.\r\n           And she never caught the rabbits.\r\n                         \r\n          Jeanne looks up from the bed, MISCHIEVOUSLY.\r\n                         \r\n                          JEANNE\r\n           You have been had!\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Oh really?\r\n                         \r\n                          JEANNE\r\n           I don't wanna know anything about\r\n           your past, baby!\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           You think I was telling you the\r\n           truth?\r\n           35.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Jeanne flaps her arms.

I'm a widower. I've got a\r\n           little hotel, a kind of a dump. But\r\n           it's not completely a flophouse.\r\n           And... I used to live on my luck,\r\n           and I got married. My wife killed\r\n           herself.\r\n                         \r\n          AND WE...\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. SALLE WAGRAM SALON - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          As Paul WAXES ON, we watch a TANGO CONTEST in progress. He\r\n          wanders RUDELY between the DANCERS on the DANCE FLOOR,\r\n          invading their space and lighting a cigarette.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL'S VOICE\r\n           But you know, what the hell. I'm...\r\n           no prize. I picked up a nail when I\r\n           was in Cuba in and now I got a\r\n           prostate like an Idaho potato. But\r\n           I'm still a good stick man, even if\r\n           I can't have any children. Let's\r\n           see. I don't have any stomping\r\n           grounds. I don't have any friends.\r\n           I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd\r\n           probably settle for a hard chair\r\n           and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a\r\n           long, dull story even duller, I\r\n           come from a time when a guy like me\r\n           would drop into a joint like this\r\n           and pick up a young chick like you\r\n           and... and call her a bimbo.\r\n                         \r\n          He reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne\r\n          waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS.\r\n                         \r\n          He has a real JOIE DE VIVRE about him now that he LACKED\r\n          PREVIOUSLY.\r\n                         \r\n          She sits down at a GUEST TABLE on the outskirts of the DANCE\r\n          FLOOR.\r\n                         \r\n          He approaches her table and FEIGNS a GENTLEMAN PERSONA.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           I'm awfully sorry to intrude\r\n           but I was so struck with your\r\n           beauty that I thought I could offer\r\n           you a glass of champagne. Is this\r\n           seat taken?\r\n           90.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          JEANNE\r\n           No.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           May I?\r\n                         \r\n                          JEANNE\r\n           If you'd like to.\r\n                         \r\n          He sits down with her.
