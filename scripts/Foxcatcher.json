UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human-\r\n          sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front\r\n          of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking\r\n          one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then\r\n          other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing\r\n          gently with it.\r\n                         \r\n          Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy,\r\n          grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it\r\n          to the mat, landing on top.\r\n                         \r\n          QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy -\r\n          first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another -\r\n          SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          I/E.

He reaches behind the front seat and pulls\r\n          out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

A portrait of President Reagan\r\n          hangs on the painted cinder block wall.

Why do I push\r\n           myself to my limits - of pain, of\r\n           exhaustion - every day of my life?\r\n           Why do I wake up every morning and\r\n           make the commitment? Why do I do\r\n           it?\r\n           2.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to\r\n          make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with\r\n          these kids. This is just what's on his mind. All the time.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           In 13 months - if I train right, if\r\n           I push myself - I'll be going to\r\n           Seoul - that's a city in South\r\n           Korea. Does anyone know why?\r\n           Because that's where the Olympic\r\n           games are.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a\r\n          RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           Does anyone know what this is?\r\n                         \r\n          As a couple of kids start to raise their hands --\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           Olympic gold medal. I won it three\r\n           years ago at the `84 Games in Los\r\n           Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz -\r\n           my best friend, my older brother,\r\n           my best friend - won one too, just\r\n           23 hours and 16 minutes before I\r\n           did. That's unprecedented - two\r\n           brothers winning at the same\r\n           Olympics.\r\n                          (THEN)\r\n           Would you like me to win another\r\n           one? Would you like me to win\r\n           another gold medal - for us, for\r\n           America? Would you like to see me\r\n           and my big brother - Dave Schultz -\r\n           both win gold medals? Who here\r\n           wants to see the two brothers win\r\n           again?\r\n                         \r\n          Silence. A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands.\r\n          The rest are completely frozen.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           Well we're going to give it\r\n           absolutely everything we've got.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

We can read the label: \"THE\r\n          MARK SCHULTZ WRESTLING CLINIC.\" He starts making a copy.\r\n                         \r\n           MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm arranging a clinic in your area\r\n           next weekend, and I wanted to\r\n           invite you and some of your\r\n           wrestlers to join...\r\n                         \r\n           JUMP CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n           MARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)\r\n           That's Dave, my brother. I wrestle\r\n           at 180... No, he won't be there,\r\n           just me... Okay - well, good luck\r\n           with your season, coach.\r\n                         \r\n                          JUMP TO:\r\n                         \r\n          On the screen is a montage of highlights from Mark's career:\r\n          take downs, pins.

Pins him. Walks away, arms\r\n          raised. Crowd cheers.

MARK'S APARTMENT/OUTSIDE WALKWAY - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          Mark's outside at the second floor railing of this two-story\r\n          stucco building, looking out over the bleak landscape: a 7-\r\n          11, an Auto-Zone. He eats a hard-boiled egg. He watches a CAR\r\n          pull into the lot below. Dave gets out, looks up.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           Where were you today?\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Dave fills two mismatched glasses with tap water from the\r\n          faucet.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           How far'd you run? Ten?\r\n                         \r\n          Mark's on the tattered couch. He shrugs, though we should see\r\n          that he loves the fact that Dave is concerned about him.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n           More than ten?

This school called\r\n           me months ago to do a gig but now I\r\n           can't. Nancy's got a thing all day\r\n           so I gotta watch the kids. You\r\n           free?\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           I'll check.\r\n                         \r\n          He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar. There's\r\n          NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           You said Saturday or Sunday?\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           Saturday.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           Saturday could work.\r\n                         \r\n          He comes back in.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           Good. Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n          Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he's written down a\r\n          name and phone number in MARKER. He grabs one of Mark's VHS\r\n          labels and a pen and writes the information.\r\n           9.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n           Coach Vinson, Radnor High. I'll let\r\n           him know you'll call tomorrow.\r\n                         \r\n          He peels off the label and slaps it on Mark's leg.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n           And Mark. Please come back to the\r\n           gym. You don't have to do anything\r\n           with the team. Just train with me.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark's just looking at his older brother.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n           I need you there. Stay focused on\r\n           what's important. For both of us.\r\n           Seoul's the goal.\r\n                         \r\n          Beat. Beat. Then, Mark nods at his brother.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           Seoul's the goal.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. RADNOR HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Seven HIGH SCHOOL BOYS plus a couple of PRE-TEENS, all in\r\n          wrestling gear, sit on the mat in front of Mark. He seems\r\n          manic, evangelical, not tuned into his audience.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           The minute you step on the mat, you\r\n           are exactly who you are. You can't\r\n           hide. You can't pretend you trained\r\n           harder than you did, you want it\r\n           more than you do. My brother Dave\r\n           and me care about this more than we\r\n           care about anything. The difference\r\n           between the number one guy in the\r\n           world and the number four guy is\r\n           paper thin. The one who wins is the\r\n           one who wants it more, who's\r\n           willing to sacrifice, who can take\r\n           the pain. I can take the pain. My\r\n           brother Dave can take the pain. Can\r\n           you take the pain?\r\n                         \r\n          Blank looks from the teenage wrestlers. Mark gestures to a\r\n          table set up near the door, on which is his OPEN BRIEFCASE,\r\n          with a stack of TAPES.\r\n           10.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           I talk about all this in my\r\n           instructional videotape - which you\r\n           can purchase at the end of the day\r\n           for a nominal fee.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Mark exits the locker room in his wrestling gear, heading for\r\n          the MATS.\r\n                         \r\n          Dave's in his wrestling gear, on the far side of the gym,\r\n          talking with TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN in blazers with USA\r\n          WRESTLING INSIGNIA. Mark walks onto the mat, waits for him.\r\n                         \r\n          Dave and the two men see Mark, WAVE to him - but Mark\r\n          pretends not to notice, busies himself loosening his wrists,\r\n          hands, neck. Dave walks over to him.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           You remember Fred Cole from USA\r\n           Wrestling.\r\n                         \r\n          The men walk up behind Dave.\r\n                         \r\n                          FRED COLE\r\n           Hey there, Mark, how you been?\r\n                         \r\n          Mark sort of nods, but doesn't really respond.\r\n                         \r\n           FRED COLE (CONT'D)\r\n           (beat, then turns to Dave)\r\n           All right, Dave. Let us know if we\r\n           can count on you. We'll talk soon.\r\n                         \r\n          Dave nods. They walk away. Then Dave turns back to Mark.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           You been calling me and hanging up?\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           (adjusting his knee brace)\r\n           No. What do you mean?\r\n                         \r\n          Mark doesn't answer, just stands looking at him. For several\r\n          seconds, they look at each other. Then, slowly at first:\r\n                         \r\n          They start to circle each other. We sense immediately their\r\n          differences: Dave's hunched and not very muscular physique\r\n          belies his quickness and enormous strength.\r\n           11.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Mark's defining characteristic is brute force. A weight class\r\n          heavier than Dave, he can NEVER SEEM TO BEAT HIS OLDER\r\n          BROTHER.\r\n                         \r\n          The wrestling becomes intense and violent - Mark's head slams\r\n          into Dave's nose, drawing BLOOD. This only energizes Dave,\r\n          who slams Mark to the mat - dripping blood onto him.\r\n                         \r\n          VARIOUS SHOTS of the increasingly brutal match, ending with:\r\n                         \r\n          Dave rides Mark, who's on his stomach, flattened and splayed -\r\n          grappling for a hold. Mark glances up to SEE:\r\n          The USA Wrestling men WATCHING from near the door.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark looks away, gritting his teeth, but Dave's gotten his\r\n          hold. As Dave TURNS and slams the bigger Mark -\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. DAVE'S CAR/OUTSIDE MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          Mark looks out the window. Silence. They sit there, both\r\n          bruised and bloodied.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           Sorry about your nose.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           No, you're not.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Come by the house, have dinner with\r\n           me and Nance and the kids.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark's still looking out the window.

It's\r\n          decorated like a ski chalet. Brandon walks back from the\r\n          bedroom, holding KEYS out to Mark-\r\n                         \r\n                          BRANDON\r\n           Utilities are paid for - gas,\r\n           electric.

Mark stands still for a long time, gazing at\r\n          his new home - including some of the oddities, like the POLAR\r\n          BEAR SKIN RUG (with HEAD ON) which is draped over the sofa.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

The POLAR BEAR HEAD on the rug gazes blankly at him. A\r\n          KNOCK on the living room window. It's John du Pont, who\r\n          points toward the front door.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Mark walks\r\n          directly onto the mat, straight to the center, faces off with\r\n          the Bulgarian, NANEV. CAMERA stays tight on Mark looking\r\n          directly at Nanev, as the ref checks each of them.\r\n                         \r\n          WHISTLE. The match begins. Intense and rough. Neither able to\r\n          gain an edge. Dave coaches from Mark's corner.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          In between periods.

Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any\r\n          advantage. The whistle blows.\r\n                         \r\n          The ref takes each of their hands. He RAISES Mark's. He turns\r\n          them around, raises Mark's hand again.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach,\r\n          shakes his hand. He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming,\r\n          his arms open wide - embraces him.

Go.\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont clumsily attempts the escape. Mark is incredibly\r\n          gentle with him, even tender, easing him through the moves.\r\n           55.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           Okay.

THE CHALET - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Mark's HAIR IS NOW CUT SHORT AND BLEACHED WHITE. He's in\r\n          shorts - no shirt - on the phone. He's sipping a beer,\r\n          walking around the living room -\r\n                         \r\n           MARK (ON PHONE)\r\n           Yeah. I'm good. Yeah.... All good.\r\n                         \r\n          INTERCUT with Dave in the U of W gym office, looking out over\r\n          a wrestling team night practice.\r\n                         \r\n           DAVE (ON PHONE)\r\n           You working hard?\r\n                         \r\n           MARK (ON PHONE)\r\n           Yeah. No, I'm kind of giving myself\r\n           a bit of a break right now. I'll\r\n           ramp it up again as the trials come\r\n           closer.\r\n                         \r\n           DAVE (ON PHONE)\r\n           All right. How close?\r\n                         \r\n          There a KNOCK on Mark's window. Mark looks over and sees du\r\n          Pont standing outside, an eager look on his face. He beckons\r\n          to Mark and moves TWO FINGERS as if cutting his own hair.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           (to du Pont)\r\n           Just a sec...\r\n                         \r\n           DAVE (ON PHONE)\r\n           What's that?\r\n                         \r\n           MARK (ON PHONE)\r\n           No, I wasn't - listen, I gotta run -\r\n                         \r\n           DAVE (ON PHONE)\r\n           What're you doing?\r\n                         \r\n           MARK (ON PHONE)\r\n           I just - I gotta run.\r\n                         \r\n           DAVE (ON PHONE)\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Okay.

VERANDA/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Bowie's \"China Girl\" PLAYS through outdoor speakers. Mark\r\n          crops du Pont's hair with an ELECTRIC CLIPPER. It's\r\n          unseasonably warm out - Mark's in shorts and flip flops.\r\n                         \r\n          Both men are drinking from bottles of champagne. Du Pont's\r\n          drunk enough that his defenses are down. A vanity table is on\r\n          the veranda with a mirror and a bowl of COCAINE.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           Looking good.\r\n                          (NO REPLY)\r\n           Looking tough.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark finishes buzzing -- looks at du Pont's crew cut in the\r\n          mirror. Du Pont seems melancholy.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           I think you're ready.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           We just need some more talc.\r\n                         \r\n          They both reach over to the bowl of \"talc\", rub some on their\r\n          gums -- then they each snort a line.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK (CONT'D)\r\n           Yah!

Then I found out\r\n           Mother had been paying Cliff to be\r\n           friends with me.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark is moved, but doesn't know what to say.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           We all have demons.\r\n                         \r\n                          DU PONT\r\n                          (TOTALLY SINCERE)\r\n           It's good to know you and I have\r\n           come to this... friendship without\r\n           any of that nonsense. Financial\r\n           nonsense.\r\n                         \r\n          Neither mentions that du Pont is actually paying Mark.\r\n          Silence. Mark struggles whether to admit something. Then -\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           When Dave's son, Alex, was born he\r\n           had some problems with his lungs.\r\n           It looked like he wasn't gonna\r\n           live. I was sitting in the hospital\r\n           waiting room, and all I could think\r\n           was: Maybe it's better if he dies.\r\n           Dave won't be distracted. We can\r\n           get back to training together.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Alex is fine now and, you know,\r\n           he's my nephew. I'm not proud I\r\n           wanted him to die, but it's the\r\n           truth. That's just the truth.\r\n                          (THEN)\r\n           You gotta conquer your demons.\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont stands up. Expressionless, he disappears through the\r\n          sliding glass doors into the house. Mark LOOKS OUT over the\r\n          dark grounds of Foxcatcher. Quiet.\r\n                         \r\n          Then Mark jumps out of his skin as a MACHINE GUN FIRES\r\n          several rounds behind him.\r\n           58.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          When he turns around, there's du Pont, a determined look on\r\n          his face, pointing a semi-automatic MACHINE GUN out into the\r\n          rolling landscape.\r\n                         \r\n                          DU PONT\r\n           Conquer demons.\r\n                         \r\n          He FIRES again, a short burst of bullets into the dark. Du\r\n          Pont fires again, a sustained volley into the dark...\r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           (over the gunfire)\r\n           Yeahhhhh!!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont ceases fire and looks out. He begins lowering the gun\r\n          when it accidentally goes off, firing a few bullets into the\r\n          wood deck - though he doesn't seem to notice.\r\n                         \r\n                          DU PONT\r\n           They're dead.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. LEAR JET - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          SILENCE, save for the steady HUM of flight inside the cabin.\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont's gazing out the window of this private jet; he's\r\n          trying to be brave, but he's clearly terrified of the\r\n          upcoming match.\r\n                         \r\n          Mark sits next to du Pont, on the aisle.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. PHOENIX ARENA - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Between periods at the \"Du Pont Masters Open and Collegiate\r\n          Invitational\". Very few people in the Masters gym bleachers.\r\n          Large posters of the oiled-up Mark on the walls.\r\n                         \r\n          Through large OPEN DOORS, in the adjoining gym, a larger\r\n          crowd cheers on a number of NCAA wrestlers. FRED COLE and\r\n          another USA WRESTLING OFFICIAL look in from the other gym.\r\n          They SEE the posters of Mark on the walls, and they SEE:\r\n                         \r\n          An exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped\r\n          in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. Mark\r\n          OBLIGES. Mark glances at the OPEN DOORS, notices Fred Cole.\r\n          Self-conscious, he ignores Cole and focuses on John.\r\n           59.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          MARK\r\n           When he gives you the slightest\r\n           opening, you gotta shoot in on him.\r\n           Be aggressive. Show him who's boss.\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont nods wearily. He can barely move.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          The final minute of the match. It's clearly RIGGED. The OTHER\r\n          WRESTLER is trying to let the exhausted du Pont get the best\r\n          of him. Mark watches.\r\n                         \r\n          The REF blows the end of match whistle. The wrestlers stand,\r\n          du Pont struggling to his feet. The ref takes each of their\r\n          hands, and raises... du Pont's. He's \"won\".\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont limps off the mat. He approaches Mark, THROWS his\r\n          arms around him the way Mark hugged du Pont at the Worlds.\r\n          Mark glances toward the open doors to the other gym.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

So the American coach\r\n           tells his wrestler, \"Listen,\r\n           whatever you do don't let this guy\r\n           get you in The Pretzel or you're\r\n           dead.\" Sure enough, match starts,\r\n           the Russian gets him in The\r\n           Pretzel.\r\n                         \r\n          There are smiles around the table.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n           The coach buries his head in his\r\n           hands because he know's it's all\r\n           over. Suddenly, he hears the crowd\r\n           roar. When he looks up the Russian\r\n           is flying through the air - he\r\n           lands on his back, the American\r\n           jumps him. Pins him. Boom. The\r\n           match is over.\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont is studying Dave intently, fascinated by the hold he\r\n          has on people - the attention he gets.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n           \"Nobody's ever gotten out of The\r\n           Pretzel,\" the coach says afterward,\r\n           \"How'd you do it?\" \"Well, Coach, I\r\n           was just about to give up when I\r\n           opened my eyes and there was this\r\n           big hairy pair of balls right in\r\n           front of my face.

Dave's Subaru is parked in the yard\r\n          out front, and Dave lies half-in-half-out the driver's side\r\n          door, working on the FUSE BOX under the steering column.\r\n                         \r\n          Dave rises out of the car to see who's pulled up.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE\r\n           Hey, Coach.\r\n                         \r\n          Dave takes a step toward du Pont's car. Du Pont just looks at\r\n          him through his open driver's window.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n           What's up, John?\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont picks up his PISTOL from the seat.\r\n                         \r\n           LARGE SECURITY GUARD\r\n           Oh.

The bullet goes through Dave's hand,\r\n          smashing into his chest, throwing him to the ground.\r\n                         \r\n          The Security Guard scrambles out the car door and ducks\r\n          behind the passenger side fender.\r\n                         \r\n          Dave tries to crawl away.\r\n                         \r\n                          NANCY\r\n           Dave!....

She RUNS inside.\r\n                         \r\n          Du Pont SHOOTS Dave in the back. Then he SHOOTS him in the\r\n          back of the head.\r\n                         \r\n          After a few moments, he drives away.\r\n                         \r\n          Nancy runs outside.

He wears only\r\n          shorts, no shirt. A CLOCK ticks on the wall behind him.\r\n                         \r\n          After several moments, we START TO HEAR crowd-pumping MUSIC\r\n          in the background. LOUDER.

Mark's bare-\r\n          chested, no shoes.

He's got his\r\n          opponent on his back and he pounds his bloody face repeatedly.\r\n                         \r\n          The REF stops the fight. Mark stands.\r\n                         \r\n          He's completely still, except for his heavy breathing. The\r\n          other man's blood is on him.
