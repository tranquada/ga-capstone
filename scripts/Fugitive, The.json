He sees two sorters \n\tstanding by a small conveyor as he enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD\n\t\tGet out of here.\n\n\tHe and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry \n\tworker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead \n\trail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off \n\tswitch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker \n\ttakes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.\n\n\tGerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the \n\tmain room.\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD\n\t\t\t(to Renfro)\n\t\tWe're going in. Give me five \n\t\tminutes. Keep C.P.D. out.\n\n\tHe draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main \n\troom.\n\n\tINT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT\n\n\tHe moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.\n\n\tHe sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the \n\tdryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt \n\thim when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.\n\n\tKimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a \n\tvoice from the other end of the laundry.\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD (V.O.)\n\t\t\t(above the din)\n\t\tKimble!\n\n\tKimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.\n\n\tON NICHOLS\n\n\tMoving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room \n\twhere Gerard enters.\n\n\tON GERARD\n\n\tThe door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.\n\n\tThey enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves \n\tup the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both \n\tmove slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated \n\tequipment.\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD\n\t\t... There is no way out of here.\n\n\tThe building is locked down.\n\n\tCUT TO:\n\n\tKIMBLE\n\n\tMoves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near \n\tthe conveyor belts.\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD (O.S.)\n\t\tKimble... I know about Nichols. I \n\t\tknow about Sykes. Kimble stops.\n\n\tON GERARD\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD\n\t\t... Nichols borrowed your car the \n\t\tnight of the murder and called \n\t\tSykes from it.\n\n\tRENFRO\n\n\tSeparated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag \n\tcomes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, \n\tdodges it, gets his bearings and continues.\n\n\tKIMBLE\n\n\tListening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with \n\tNichols.\n\n\tGERARD\n\n\tMoving through the forest of massive bags.\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD\n\t\t... That's why there was no forced \n\t\tentry at your house. He'd used your \n\t\tkeys.\n\n\tKIMBLE \n\n\tRealizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.\n\n\tNICHOLS\n\n\tAlso listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the \n\tkiller. He moves behind the water softener tanks and \n\tchemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the \n\thanging control for the I-beam.\n\n\tGERARD\n\n\tMoves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He \n\tdodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can \n\tsee straight back toward the washers. \n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD\n\t\tKimble... Come meet me out here.\n\n\tON RENFRO\n\n\tHe steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks \n\tunder the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a \n\tWHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes \n\trushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, \n\topening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.\n\n\tNICHOLS\n\n\tSteps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty \n\tshoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. \n\tNichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.\n\n\tGERARD\n\n\tOblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor \n\tbelts. He makes one last appeal.\n\n\t\t\t\tGERARD\n\t\tIt's time to quit running... if you \n\t\tdon't, you know I'll stop you. He \n\t\tlistens, there is no answer.\n\n\tKIMBLE\n\n\tStarts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His \n\tshoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.\n\n\tGERARD\n\n\tMoves into the alley between the two giant washers. He \n\tpauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back \n\ton us...\n\n\tNICHOLS\n\n\tSteps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just \n\tbefore he fires however he hears...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMBLE (O.S.)\n\t\tHey, Chuckles...\n\n\tNichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick \n\tand clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor \n\tbehind Gerard.\n\n\tGERARD\n\n\tTurns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble \n\twith Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes \n\tinstantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.\n\n\tKimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.\n\n\tThey hold a look as deputies and police flood into the \n\troom surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.\n\n\tINT. / EXT.
