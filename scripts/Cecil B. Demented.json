SINCLAIR\r\n          STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the\r\n          projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young\r\n          man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter\r\n          girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns\r\n          interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk.
