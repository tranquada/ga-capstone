Hither came Conan, the\r\n           Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a\r\n           king born of battle.\r\n                         \r\n          Muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the\r\n          guttural CRIES of combat.\r\n                         \r\n                         UNBORN BABY\r\n                         \r\n          Eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its\r\n          tip not an inch from the baby's head.\r\n                         \r\n          As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we\r\n          travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FIELD - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody\r\n          sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian\r\n          beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody\r\n          stomach.\r\n                         \r\n          Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling\r\n          snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built\r\n          CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           Islene!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin\r\n          cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never\r\n          leaving Islene.\r\n                         \r\n          The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the\r\n          earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.\r\n                         \r\n                          AESIR\r\n           Now, now little whore.

In one fluid motion she swings the\r\n          sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the\r\n          Aesir's armor -- at his groin.\r\n                         \r\n                          ISLENE\r\n           I'd ask you the same.\r\n                         \r\n          The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the\r\n          killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The\r\n          Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.\r\n                         \r\n          Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees\r\n          beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands\r\n          back they are coated in blood.\r\n                         \r\n          Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a\r\n          knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          ISLENE (CONT'D)\r\n           Take your child.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           I cannot.\r\n                         \r\n          Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses\r\n          against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.\r\n                         \r\n                          ISLENE\r\n           There is no time, husband. I would\r\n           see my child's face.\r\n                         \r\n          Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the\r\n          knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife\r\n          to use. Never once does she scream.\r\n                         \r\n          A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up\r\n          through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap.\r\n                         \r\n                          ISLENE (CONT'D)\r\n           A boy. He will be strong.

You\r\n           must temper him.\r\n                         \r\n          She shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of\r\n          mother's milk, but of her blood.\r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ISLENE (CONT'D)\r\n                          (FADING)\r\n           Conan.

CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,\r\n          a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.\r\n                         \r\n          Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young\r\n          CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the\r\n          air, giving it an ethereal haze.\r\n                         \r\n          At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior\r\n          speaks.\r\n                         \r\n                          URAN\r\n           A Cimmerian warrior is like any\r\n           other man. A Cimmerian warrior\r\n           feels hunger. He feels cold. Like\r\n           other men he may lie and cheat.\r\n           (stares the boys down)\r\n           But when a Cimmerian warrior\r\n           hungers, he hungers only for the\r\n           blood of his enemy. When he feels\r\n           cold, it is the cold steel of his\r\n           sword. When he lies, he lies in\r\n           wait for his enemy. And when he\r\n           cheats, he cheats death itself!\r\n                         \r\n          Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good\r\n          two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,\r\n          but his face is as stoic, driven.\r\n                         \r\n                          URAN (CONT'D)\r\n           Conan! You are too young to be\r\n           here. Withdraw.\r\n                         \r\n          CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN\r\n          menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARGEST TEEN\r\n           He said leave, motherless whelp.\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm\r\n          towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the\r\n          teen in the throat.\r\n                         \r\n          The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for\r\n          air.\r\n                         \r\n          A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced\r\n          by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,\r\n          ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the\r\n          large stones in their mouths.\r\n                         \r\n                          URAN\r\n           In the black crag in the high pass\r\n           stands a wooden training sword. The\r\n           one who claims it, with stone still\r\n           in his mouth, will have earned the\r\n           right to train with the warriors.\r\n                         \r\n          The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.\r\n                         \r\n                          URAN (CONT'D)\r\n           Well? What are you waiting for?!\r\n                         \r\n          And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the\r\n          other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel\r\n          their stones. One or two succeed.\r\n                         \r\n          Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high\r\n          into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff\r\n          face.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.\r\n                         \r\n                         CLIFF FACE\r\n                         \r\n          And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.\r\n          They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock\r\n          face as though it were a ladder.\r\n                         \r\n          The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,\r\n          trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds\r\n          another path. In moments he is ahead.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. FOREST - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger\r\n          boys right behind him.\r\n                         \r\n          They race through the forest, heading uphill --\r\n                         \r\n          When Conan spots movement ahead. He pauses --\r\n           5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The\r\n          boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an\r\n          AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.\r\n                         \r\n          All the boys stop. Out of the dense forest come\r\n                         \r\n          FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES\r\n                         \r\n          Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand\r\n          axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their\r\n          waist.\r\n                         \r\n          The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They\r\n          turn and run in the opposite direction.\r\n                         \r\n          Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          CIMMERIAN BOY\r\n           Conan! Run!\r\n                         \r\n          But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. He\r\n          turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.\r\n                         \r\n          The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS.\r\n          They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT, escaping in the\r\n          other direction. One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit.\r\n          Corin desperately searches for his son.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           Conan? Conan?!\r\n                         \r\n          Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered\r\n          in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked\r\n          to pieces.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN (CONT'D)\r\n           What have you done, boy?\r\n                         \r\n          Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his\r\n          father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           They killed one. I killed three.

Can\r\n           you taste it?\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n                          (SMILES)\r\n           Indeed. I savor it.\r\n                         \r\n          Uran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop\r\n          the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers,\r\n          bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS.\r\n           12.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading\r\n          right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit\r\n          the tree trunks beside them.\r\n                         \r\n          And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they\r\n          notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows.\r\n          The flames lick at the substance --\r\n                         \r\n          KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian\r\n          warriors are burned alive.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees\r\n          flames rising above the treetops beyond.\r\n                         \r\n          He races back home.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Corin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly,\r\n          Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed\r\n          with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining\r\n          Cimmerians, savage against savage.\r\n                         \r\n          But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians\r\n          comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing\r\n          loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN\r\n          HORSEMEN into the village.\r\n                         \r\n          The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack\r\n          with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands\r\n          and dragging them to the ground.\r\n                         \r\n          The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his\r\n          men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied.\r\n                         \r\n                         CONAN\r\n                         \r\n          Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and\r\n          reaches the far end of the village.\r\n                         \r\n          Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians\r\n          still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are\r\n          helping the Spearmen slay the wounded.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest\r\n          Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and\r\n          rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the\r\n                         CHARGE --\r\n           13.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's\r\n          blade.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Father!\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           Come.\r\n                         \r\n          Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant\r\n          Conan from the battle, back toward the forge.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. FORGE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into\r\n          the room. He bolts the door behind him.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Do we need more weapons?\r\n                         \r\n          Corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating\r\n          in the dirt floor. Beneath it a trough of cooling water leads\r\n          under the hut and away from the village.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           Go. There is a hunting lodge in the\r\n           North Pass with provisions.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           No! I will fight!\r\n                         \r\n          Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face.\r\n          Corin's eyes are half-crazed.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           This fight is over, but yours has\r\n           just begun. You wanted to be a\r\n           warrior of the tribe, Conan--now\r\n           you must be its last.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Father, I am not afraid to die.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           Good. Make your death have purpose.\r\n                         \r\n          BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again,\r\n          BOOM.\r\n                         \r\n          A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and\r\n          MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away\r\n          the bolt.\r\n           14.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their\r\n          attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at\r\n          Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and --\r\n                         \r\n          THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising\r\n          up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a\r\n          crisp.\r\n                         \r\n          Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from\r\n          the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his\r\n          back.\r\n                         \r\n          Corin falls to his knees.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           No!\r\n                         \r\n          Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying\r\n          backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support\r\n          beams.\r\n                         \r\n          Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan,\r\n          pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from\r\n          his fallen father.\r\n                         \r\n          Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword\r\n          to deliver the killing blow.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)\r\n           I said I wanted a word with him.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge.\r\n          Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier,\r\n          grinning from ear to ear.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           As promised.\r\n                         \r\n                          PICT\r\n           (strange dialect -\r\n                          SUBTITLED)\r\n           Their heads. You promised me their\r\n           heads.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           All you wish, once we are gone.\r\n                         \r\n          The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh\r\n          stares down at Corin, sizing him up.\r\n                         \r\n          Corin lifts up into a sitting position, back to the forge.\r\n           15.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           I take no pleasure in this day,\r\n           barbarian. Your people are fierce\r\n           warriors, deserving of every story\r\n           told of them. But now you must\r\n           choose the story for yourself. I am\r\n           Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked\r\n           from the best Hyboria. My second,\r\n           Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo\r\n           and his Shadow Scouts from the\r\n           jungles of Zingara. And countless\r\n           others. They all had a day like\r\n           this one. They all chose a way\r\n           forward.\r\n                         \r\n          Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun. The lieutenants stand\r\n          behind Corin, eyeing Corin with malice.\r\n                         \r\n          Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at\r\n          him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to\r\n          give his son away.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           What is it you want?\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           I seek neither gold nor steel, but\r\n           flesh and blood. The last of a\r\n           royal line that goes back three\r\n           thousand years.\r\n                         \r\n          Corin LAUGHS.\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each\r\n           man is free here.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           But I seek a woman.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians\r\n          women are being herded by the slavers.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           A queen in hiding. Point her out\r\n           and you'll spare the lives of your\r\n           own. Perhaps even your wife?\r\n                         \r\n                          CORIN\r\n           My wife was killed, long ago, by\r\n           swine such as you.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar nods, understanding.\r\n           16.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           Then our stories began in the same\r\n           place, Cimmerian. I too lost my\r\n           wife to marauders. How many men, in\r\n           how many lands have suffered so?\r\n           The only answer is power, strength\r\n           unfettered, the kind of which can\r\n           unite all Hyboria under a single\r\n           crown. That is the legacy I seek.\r\n           Will you join me?\r\n                         \r\n          It's a powerful, convincing speech. But Corin holds his\r\n          tongue, unmoved.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Very well. Then death will be your\r\n           story. Your men will die. And your\r\n           women too, when I am done with\r\n           them. None will survive to carry\r\n           your name forth, and over time,\r\n           even your enemies will forget you\r\n           ever were. You will be wiped from\r\n           the pages of history.\r\n           (to his men)\r\n           Take your blood, but leave the\r\n           kill.\r\n                         \r\n          One by one, the lieutenants beat and stab Corin, taking\r\n          pleasure in his pain.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything\r\n          other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back,\r\n          pinning him to the ground.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Fariq! Come!\r\n                         \r\n          Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to\r\n          Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the\r\n          dispassion of a sociopath.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged\r\n          together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands\r\n          it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for\r\n          his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching\r\n          him multiplication.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Before you lies our enemy. His\r\n           tribe waits for him in the beyond.\r\n           What would you do?\r\n           17.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ\r\n           I would cut out his eyes, father,\r\n           so that he will not find them. So\r\n           he will wander the afterlife\r\n           forever.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar smiles.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           Show me your strength, Fariq.\r\n           Without it, you will never rule.\r\n           With it, you will never be\r\n           forgotten.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE.

He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who\r\n          was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           Men!\r\n           23.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their\r\n          weapons. Lucius draws his as well.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)\r\n           You've made a huge mistake, ape.\r\n           You'll never make it out of this\r\n           place.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           I came for you, Lucius.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           You talk as though you know me,\r\n           ape.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           I do. And I am no ape. I am\r\n           Cimmerian.\r\n                         \r\n          As recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into\r\n          action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and\r\n          other torture implements flying right into the first guard.\r\n                         \r\n          The second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan\r\n          just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the\r\n          iron bands of the prisoner cells.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his\r\n          sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own\r\n          sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH\r\n          LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot.\r\n                         \r\n          The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal\r\n          with three weapons attacks at once.\r\n                         \r\n          The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around\r\n          Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip.\r\n          Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying\r\n          into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling.\r\n                         \r\n          The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a\r\n          deep gash and causing him to drop his sword.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's\r\n          face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and\r\n          the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears.\r\n           24.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          However, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react.\r\n          The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift\r\n          Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by\r\n          the neck.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his\r\n          throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck\r\n          gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden\r\n          knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning\r\n          guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls\r\n          the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out\r\n          of Lucius' now liberated foot.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan takes Lucius' face and smashes it against the table.\r\n          Lucius looks, aghast, as Conan takes his injured hand and\r\n          places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. The\r\n          Cimmerian never even bats an eye.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           What do you want? Who are you?\r\n                         \r\n          Conan turns his face to the burnt side.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           I'm the one who made you pretty.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           Impossible! You're dead!\r\n                         \r\n          Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           No. I am death. And I came a long\r\n           way for you.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan lifts the sword.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           Wait!! Wait!!\r\n                          (CONAN PAUSES)\r\n           I can tell you where the rest are.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Where?\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           The end of the earth. You kill me,\r\n           and you'll never find them.\r\n           25.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Who are you offering?\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           Who do you think? All of them.\r\n           Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and\r\n           Khalar Singh himself. But you have\r\n           to swear you won't kill me.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan thinks about it.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           You have my word. You tell me where\r\n           I will find Khalar Singh, and I\r\n           will not kill you.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan lets Lucius go. Lucius hobbles to his chair.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           He is in a city called on the edge\r\n           of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of\r\n           Hyboria. Khor Khalba.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. He likes what he\r\n          sees. In a flash, Conan grabs Lucius' head again, yanking it\r\n          back, exposing his throat.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)\r\n           You gave your word!\r\n                         \r\n          Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring. He drops it in\r\n          Lucius' throat. The big man chokes instantly. A second later,\r\n          Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as Conan releases\r\n          him.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS (CONT'D)\r\n           What are you doing?!\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Toasting, to our deal.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from\r\n          the wall.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN (CONT'D)\r\n           Go. You are free.\r\n                         \r\n          One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by\r\n          shackles.\r\n                         \r\n                          ONE-EYED PRISONER\r\n           I won't get far like this.\r\n           26.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmen's sword.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           The key to your shackles sits in\r\n           the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.\r\n                         \r\n          The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice. As he closes in on\r\n          the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCIUS\r\n           Barbarian! I had your word!

DESERT SANDSTORM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          KHALAR SINGH looks older. Worn. He squints as he stares into\r\n          a howling sandstorm.\r\n                         \r\n          UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him. The\r\n          sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less\r\n          than five feet away.\r\n                         \r\n                          UKAFA\r\n           Khalar Singh, we've lost half our\r\n           cavalry legion, and still Fariq\r\n           presses on! We must turn back!\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           He says the Queen is here.\r\n                         \r\n                          UKAFA\r\n           He leads us in circles. He knows\r\n           nothing of leading an army --\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           Take care, Ukafa. You hold a\r\n           special place in my kingdom, but\r\n           blood you are not.\r\n                         \r\n                          UKAFA\r\n           My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am\r\n           simply concerned for your army.\r\n           27.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           And I would gladly sacrifice every\r\n           last man to get my hands on the\r\n           Queen. And in that respect, Fariq\r\n           has my confidence. He knows more of\r\n           the legends of Acheron than anyone.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO\r\n          and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his\r\n          twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is.\r\n          His frame is slight, his eyes beady.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ\r\n           Father, they are here! The hidden\r\n           oasis, just as it was written.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen\r\n          and shadowy Remo nods.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CAVE TUNNEL - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel\r\n          carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages.\r\n                         \r\n          And on the other side of the tunnel --\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. OASIS - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          A protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the\r\n          encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of\r\n          grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek-\r\n          influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick\r\n          houses.\r\n                         \r\n          And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about\r\n          their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes\r\n          and turbans.\r\n                         \r\n          The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of\r\n          the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around,\r\n          sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling\r\n          around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical\r\n          hurricane, protected by an unseen force.\r\n                         \r\n          A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the\r\n          reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and\r\n          softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped\r\n          in thorns.\r\n                         \r\n          One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl\r\n          next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in\r\n          pain, angry her prayer was interrupted.\r\n           28.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.\r\n          Tamara the studious good girl.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAMARA\r\n           Stop it!

Ilira SQUEALS, then\r\n          hits a grinning Tamara back.

But then we\r\n           discovered it. Acheron. The temple\r\n           that spawned an empire. We learned\r\n           that we were not broken goat-\r\n           herders on a desolate coastline. We\r\n           were the sons and daughters of\r\n           kings.\r\n           (stares in Ilira's eyes)\r\n           And queens.\r\n                         \r\n          He motions to Fariq, who brings the iron box forward.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           For thirty years I have searched\r\n           for you.

Never again will we\r\n           hide like rats. Never again will we\r\n           watch as our loved ones are\r\n           slaughtered. I call forth the\r\n           Queen. Stand and join me, and this\r\n           day will have a joyous end.\r\n                         \r\n          No one moves.\r\n                         \r\n                          FASSIR\r\n           You would have all the world\r\n           suffer, as you have suffered.

But one, in\r\n           particular, has developed a special\r\n           connection to the blood. A thirst.\r\n           It is said that only the Queen of\r\n           Acheron itself can resist its\r\n           embrace.\r\n                         \r\n          He stops, one woman away from Ilira.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           So what say you?

There's the\r\n          sound of SLITHERING as Fariq opens the box.

Conan just rides on -\r\n          - not his problem.\r\n                         \r\n          But as Conan passes Tamara, for a brief moment their eyes\r\n          meet. Something about her.

But\r\n          when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse\r\n          in its side, and Conan goes down.\r\n                         \r\n          Pissed, he draws his sword. The Slavers scramble around the\r\n          broken wagons, in chaos.\r\n                         \r\n          Only a pair of wagons still stands.

Then they notice\r\n                         \r\n                         TURANIAN HORSEMEN\r\n                         \r\n          racing down the hill, behind the boulders.\r\n                         \r\n          As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as\r\n          they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of\r\n          horses, throwing their riders.\r\n                         \r\n          More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven\r\n          into the desert floor. The remainder fight hand to hand, and\r\n          are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.\r\n          But their victory is short lived --\r\n                         \r\n          As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them,\r\n          before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The\r\n          riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.\r\n                         \r\n                         CONAN\r\n                         \r\n          Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it\r\n          rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan\r\n          launches himself down at the horsemen below.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square\r\n          in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other\r\n          riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He\r\n          cuts them down where they sit.\r\n                         \r\n          The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team,\r\n          trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see\r\n          a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's\r\n          decapitated.\r\n           38.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the\r\n          wagon.\r\n                         \r\n                         REMO\r\n                         \r\n          The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS\r\n          into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins,\r\n          stopping the wagon.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN (CONT'D)\r\n           You!\r\n                         \r\n          There's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW\r\n          SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of\r\n          the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have\r\n          her FIGHT BACK.\r\n                         \r\n          Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head\r\n          into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious\r\n          from behind.\r\n                         \r\n                         CONAN\r\n                         \r\n          Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives\r\n          and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very\r\n          fast.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way.\r\n                         \r\n          The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off,\r\n          speaking in the broken language of a savage.\r\n                         \r\n                          REMO\r\n           The girl! Bring her to Khalar!\r\n                         \r\n          Conan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword\r\n          and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword,\r\n          preparing to cut Conan's throat --\r\n                         \r\n          When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge\r\n          rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his\r\n          grip.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE\r\n          SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts\r\n          as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.\r\n           39.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards\r\n          the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY\r\n          MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         TAMARA\r\n                         \r\n          Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her,\r\n          his dagger out.

Come and claim\r\n           it.\r\n                         \r\n          GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER\r\n                         \r\n          The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing.\r\n                         \r\n          CONAN AND TAMARA\r\n                         \r\n          stand a hundred feet ahead.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Send her to me.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Send the gold.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between\r\n          them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged.\r\n                         \r\n          But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --\r\n                         \r\n          From out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of\r\n          the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked\r\n          lances, and they surround Conan.\r\n           51.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE\r\n          HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the\r\n          rider's skull with his broadsword.\r\n                         \r\n          The next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their\r\n          nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into\r\n          the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first\r\n          rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the\r\n          second rider's neck.\r\n                         \r\n          The last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT\r\n          THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both\r\n          human and animal head tumble to the desert floor.\r\n                         \r\n          All four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.\r\n                         \r\n                         KHALAR\r\n                         \r\n          Smiles. He's got Tamara by the neck.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           You're fast. But are you fast\r\n           enough?\r\n                         \r\n          Conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his\r\n          archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming\r\n          arrows stream toward him.\r\n                         \r\n          EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a\r\n          huge dust cloud.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack.\r\n                         \r\n          But Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the\r\n          gates.\r\n                         \r\n          Baring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself.\r\n                         \r\n          Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who\r\n          evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword.\r\n                         \r\n          Explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he\r\n                         REACHES\r\n                         \r\n          THE GREAT WALL\r\n                         \r\n          Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a\r\n          mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking\r\n          half the vertical of the wall in a single leap.\r\n                         \r\n          Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops\r\n          only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two\r\n          upward bounds.\r\n           52.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         WALL WALK\r\n                         \r\n          Conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great\r\n          Wall.\r\n                         \r\n                         FARIQ\r\n                         \r\n          Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan\r\n          takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ\r\n           You should have run, while you\r\n           could.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS\r\n          THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the\r\n          slight Fariq.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well-\r\n          trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade\r\n          cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           Fariq!\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and\r\n          flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to\r\n          stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall\r\n          walk.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           I was wondering what it would take\r\n           for you to stop cowering.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           I wasn't cowering. I was studying.\r\n           You're quite gifted with a sword,\r\n           but it's not from schooling. Your\r\n           speed and power makes up for a lack\r\n           of -- finesse. I've seen such\r\n           fighting before -- Cimmerian.\r\n                         \r\n          Enraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar\r\n          Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds\r\n          nothing but air. Khalar is fast.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Cimmerian it is. Now it makes\r\n           sense. You came for blood, not\r\n           gold.\r\n           53.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a\r\n          broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space,\r\n          Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's\r\n          attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his\r\n          tulwar.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have\r\n          just as easily sliced his throat.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Your people barely afforded me a\r\n           challenge. You're little more than\r\n           beasts.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing\r\n          entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades\r\n          the attack.\r\n                         \r\n          Down the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar\r\n          seems complacent enough just to defend.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           You've come a long way, barbarian,\r\n           only to fail.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice,\r\n          both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan,\r\n          sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet.\r\n                         \r\n          CRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword\r\n          clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a\r\n          circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off\r\n          the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating\r\n          punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.\r\n          CRUNCH.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           So much for vengeance.\r\n           (to his soldiers)\r\n           Get me oil -- and a torch.\r\n                         \r\n          Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Is that really the best you could\r\n           do? Is that as far as you could\r\n           think ahead? Just rush in and kill\r\n           me?\r\n           54.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Behind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her\r\n          hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as\r\n          well.\r\n                         \r\n                         TAMARA' HANDS\r\n                         \r\n          Between the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S\r\n          DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds.\r\n                         \r\n          With all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick\r\n          enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER,\r\n          LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER.\r\n                         \r\n          Cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched\r\n          arrows.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHEREN\r\n           No!!\r\n                         \r\n          But it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan.\r\n          BOOM.\r\n                         \r\n                         EXPLOSION\r\n                         \r\n          The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction.\r\n          Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the\r\n          concussion.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is\r\n          THROWN AGAINST THE WALL!\r\n                         \r\n                         KHALAR SINGH\r\n                         \r\n          The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the\r\n          explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire.\r\n                         \r\n          He grits his teeth and climbs the wall.\r\n                         \r\n          ATOP THE WALL\r\n                         \r\n          A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara\r\n          are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two\r\n          figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara\r\n          holding Conan atop the horse.\r\n                         \r\n          Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           Ukafa, you will take half our\r\n           forces North, to the Sea.

Acheron was an empire that\r\n           swallowed all of Hyboria, led by\r\n           the King and his legion of demon\r\n           warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.\r\n           Immortal.

Every twenty years, a\r\n           new queen from the royal line would\r\n           be coronated with a crown of iron.\r\n           Spikes would pierce her, slowly\r\n           drain her precious blood, and\r\n           through her suffering Acheron would\r\n           remain invincible. Until one of my\r\n           ancestors, an Acheronian himself,\r\n           put a stop to this tyranny. He and\r\n           others spirited the new Queen away,\r\n           hiding her from the empire and all\r\n           those who would raise it again.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           What care I for queens and empires?\r\n                         \r\n          Conan turns to head back to his bed.

A man with no\r\n           home, no people, none but the\r\n           company of ghosts.

I've seen in him\r\n           great mirth, only to watch it\r\n           smothered by greater melancholy. He\r\n           owes a blood debt, and he can\r\n           entertain no other joy, no other\r\n           cause, until it is fulfilled.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAMARA\r\n           And yet you call him friend, and\r\n           risk death to help him.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ARTUS\r\n           Let me tell you something of Conan.\r\n           He will never lie.

DUNGEON - THE PIT - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a\r\n          large circular chamber, lit by many torches. Before them lies\r\n          a PIT, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop\r\n          it.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq enters, an AIDE holding the iron box he used earlier.\r\n          Fariq has a bandage on his face where Conan struck him, and\r\n          he looks even more angry and malevolent than before.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ\r\n           Here we stand again.

He slaps\r\n          one. Then another, his rage only building.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           My father, he tires of your\r\n           charade. He grows impatient. But I\r\n           have no such haste.

He closes in on the\r\n          YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK, a true innocent with terrified eyes.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           Perhaps you'd like to see the end\r\n           your sisters faced back at the\r\n           monastery?\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq slowly opens the box before her.\r\n                         \r\n                         ACHERONIAN BOX\r\n                         \r\n          In the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque TENTACLE. The\r\n          tentacle is severed, but still alive, thirsting for blood.\r\n                         \r\n          Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq\r\n          closes the box.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           No? Your fear is not enough yet?\r\n           Let's try harder.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           I've read all there is to know of\r\n           mighty Acheron. Why would true\r\n           Acheronians protect a traitor to\r\n           their own? You once held the entire\r\n           world in your grasp, now you hide\r\n           and cower like pitiful mice.\r\n                         \r\n          He pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing\r\n          down into the pit.\r\n                         \r\n          AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes.\r\n          The girl looks below.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           And mice are meant to be swallowed\r\n           whole.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one\r\n          in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the\r\n          young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the\r\n          darkness below.\r\n                         \r\n          Her SCREAMS echo.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           What was in the box could only\r\n           drink from you one at a time. But\r\n           the beast of Acheron, it will claim\r\n           four of you this night.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n           64.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ (CONT'D)\r\n           Who will spare the rest and tell me\r\n           which of you is the queen?\r\n                         \r\n          Not a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself,\r\n          but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at\r\n          her.\r\n                         \r\n          CU - ILIRA'S EYES\r\n                         \r\n          Her pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into\r\n          her.\r\n                         \r\n           FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           I am here, swine.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at\r\n          him.\r\n                         \r\n                          FEMALE MONK\r\n           I am the one you seek.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq smiles.\r\n                         \r\n                          FARIQ\r\n           At last.

Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart.\r\n                         \r\n          The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction.

Ukafa, unarmed, is\r\n          forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him. A pair\r\n          of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and\r\n          arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.\r\n                         \r\n          The battle goes to hand-to-hand. It's primal, each of them\r\n          covered in blood.

Conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against\r\n          the harpoon crossbow.\r\n                         \r\n          Ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby.

Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank\r\n          close enough for him to jump to.\r\n                         \r\n                          AKHUN (CONT'D)\r\n           You'll make a nice meal.\r\n                         \r\n          Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time\r\n          Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him\r\n          focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one\r\n          great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.\r\n           87.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the\r\n          abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

As\r\n          Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, Conan\r\n          notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is\r\n          LOOSE.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           I saw my father die.

Both their heads get caved\r\n          in.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq rushes Conan, getting in too close for Conan's wide\r\n          swings. Conan simply meets Fariq's sword with the heavy\r\n          chains, then encircles Fariq's neck with the steel bonds.\r\n                         \r\n          Fariq CHOKES, falling to the ground, gasping for air. But\r\n          Conan doesn't kill him -- yet.\r\n                         \r\n                         THE FORGE\r\n                         \r\n          A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge.\r\n          Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.\r\n                         \r\n                         FARIQ\r\n                         \r\n          Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of\r\n          Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward\r\n          his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword.

On the back of Khalar's horse,\r\n          bound, rides the helpless Tamara.\r\n                         \r\n          As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe\r\n          inspiring sight. A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock\r\n          formation, rises over the peninsula.\r\n                         \r\n          As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the\r\n          mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty\r\n          feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone. It has the\r\n          appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.\r\n           93.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Moonlight from the huge eyes of\r\n          the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces\r\n          of demonic warrior statues.\r\n                         \r\n          At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too\r\n          numerous to count.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAMARA\r\n           This is no empire, only a\r\n           graveyard.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           You see only with your eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and\r\n          light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain\r\n          reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing\r\n          the true scope of this place.\r\n                         \r\n          An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns\r\n          that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.\r\n                         \r\n          And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised\r\n          THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar turns to his guards.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Close the gates and stay here.

Around its edges are deep channels, for\r\n          the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles\r\n          of bone.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           The Acheronians had a wonderful\r\n           sense of balance, don't you think?\r\n           For one to ascend to royalty,\r\n           another must fall.\r\n                         \r\n          With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.\r\n           94.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar\r\n          absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the\r\n          altar, his two guards shackling her in place.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           For a hundred generations the kings\r\n           of Acheron were crowned, and the\r\n           queens were sacrificed.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately\r\n          carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a\r\n          Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of\r\n          skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.\r\n                         \r\n          And from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A\r\n          CROWN OF IRON.

Huge rough spikes extend\r\n          from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than\r\n          a crown.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           What a day for you.

The spikes\r\n          around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE\r\n          THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony.\r\n                         \r\n          Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels\r\n          around the edges of the altar.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           It begins.

A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route\r\n          down from the cave roof above.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before\r\n          the altar.

More blood pours forth. The blood in the channels\r\n          speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the\r\n          sacrificial pool.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar\r\n          nimbly blocks his path.\r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           You are strong, Cimmerian, but we\r\n           both know you are not my equal.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Once you used my father to teach\r\n           your son a lesson about strength.\r\n           Now let me teach you.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan tosses out what is inside.

Conan tries to lift her off\r\n          the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Cimmerian!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Enraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and\r\n          force into an all-out attack. Conan simply sidesteps it, then\r\n          shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists.\r\n          Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just\r\n          inches from his face. Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking\r\n          the warlord back ten feet. Khalar's attack is feral,\r\n          uncontrolled. He's lost his balance.\r\n                         \r\n          Spinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second\r\n          shackle on her wrist. He continues his motion, bringing his\r\n          sword around to meet Khalar's next strike.\r\n           98.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more\r\n          polished warrior. Their battle takes them away from the\r\n          altar.\r\n                         \r\n          With her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out\r\n          and remove the crown.\r\n                         \r\n          THE KILLING FLOOR\r\n                         \r\n          Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking\r\n          Khalar's chest and drawing blood. The Guardsmen arrive from\r\n          the other side of the cave, drawing their swords.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian.\r\n                         \r\n           KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)\r\n           The Queen.

The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper\r\n          as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the\r\n          altar.\r\n                         \r\n          WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in\r\n          a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around\r\n          the altar until reaching the channel's end --\r\n                         \r\n          THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL\r\n          POOL.

The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor\r\n          of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.\r\n          Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can\r\n          reach to prevent them from falling further.\r\n           99.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the\r\n          cave.

I will kill\r\n           him myself.\r\n                         \r\n                         CONAN\r\n                         \r\n          Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across\r\n          chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave\r\n          of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining\r\n          Guardsmen.\r\n                         \r\n                         KHALAR'S GUARDSMEN\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with\r\n          mouths agape, realize the danger too late. The horde of\r\n          Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues\r\n          between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.\r\n                         \r\n                         CONAN\r\n                         \r\n          His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling\r\n          the cliffs of Cimmeria.\r\n           101.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         KHALAR\r\n                         \r\n          Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the\r\n          ready.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Your story ends here.\r\n                         \r\n          The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to\r\n          the statues.\r\n                         \r\n                         ACHERONIAN WARRIORS\r\n                         \r\n          The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip\r\n          their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the\r\n          blood of their victims. It is a violent ritual, both\r\n          Bacchantic and gruesome.\r\n                         \r\n                         KHALAR\r\n                         \r\n          Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone\r\n          statuary. Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.\r\n          Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely\r\n          misses his throat.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. Conan's eyes\r\n          narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN (CONT'D)\r\n           Like a woman, Fariq cried and\r\n           begged me to spare him.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive. Conan\r\n          backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.\r\n                         \r\n          And it comes quickly. Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS\r\n          Khalar across the stomach. Khalar loses his balance and\r\n          falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling\r\n          over the abyss.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan raises his sword to finish the job.\r\n                         \r\n           TAMARA (O.S.)\r\n           Conan!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Conan glances down. The Acheronian Commander drank his fill,\r\n          and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's\r\n          body. With one touch, the shackles open. He and the\r\n          Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.\r\n           102.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          KHALAR SINGH\r\n           They take her to a place you can\r\n           never follow. Who will you fail,\r\n           Cimmerian? Your father or your\r\n           woman?\r\n                         \r\n          Conan leaps down to the altar. The Acheronian Warriors\r\n          attack. Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers,\r\n          cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           Tamara!!\r\n                         \r\n          They leap on Conan, impossibly fast. They stab him. They cut\r\n          him. But he does not stop. Even wounded, he throws them into\r\n          the abyss.\r\n                         \r\n          And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her\r\n          below. He grabs her arm. The Commander grabs her other arm,\r\n          baring his shark-like teeth.\r\n                         \r\n          BLAM! Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and\r\n          the Commander falls into the abyss.\r\n                         \r\n          The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms. Only for\r\n          Tamara to scream.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAMARA\r\n           Conan!\r\n                         \r\n          Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes. Khalar's tulwar\r\n          narrowly misses, and Conan counters. His father's sword runs\r\n          Khalar Singh through.\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar's body falls into the abyss.\r\n                         \r\n          But the Acheronian Warriors surround them. Thousands climb\r\n          out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded\r\n          Conan. Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAMARA (CONT'D)\r\n           Conan, you know what you must do.\r\n           Kill me.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           No.\r\n                         \r\n                          TAMARA\r\n           It is the only way to end this. My\r\n           death gives others life.\r\n                         \r\n                          CONAN\r\n           I cannot.\r\n           103.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          TAMARA\r\n           You must. Your parents both\r\n           understood that purpose. Now it is\r\n           yours. Live, Conan.\r\n                         \r\n          A tear falls from Tamara's face. The demonic warriors prepare\r\n          to strike.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart. The crown spikes\r\n          retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.\r\n                         \r\n          BOOM! A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly\r\n          GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into\r\n          the abyss.\r\n                         \r\n                         ACHERONIAN CAVE\r\n                         \r\n          The cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof\r\n          dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.\r\n                         \r\n                         ALTAR\r\n                         \r\n          Conan pulls Tamara's body away, even as the world descends\r\n          into dust and debris.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Khalar's HORSE stands near the entrance. Conan puts Tamara's\r\n          body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. He\r\n          positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her.\r\n                         \r\n          Conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood\r\n          staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. HIGH PLATEAU - DAWN\r\n                         \r\n          A blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains.\r\n          Conan holds a single torch in his hand. His look is hard.\r\n          Grim.\r\n                         \r\n          We pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, Tamara's body atop it.\r\n          Conan places the torch to the pyre. It quickly spreads.\r\n                         \r\n          We move in, closer and closer upon Conan's ice blue eyes, a\r\n          blazing fire erupting in them. A fire that will never be\r\n          extinguished.\r\n                         \r\n           TAMARA (O.S.)\r\n           Live, Conan.
