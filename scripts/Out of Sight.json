Eyes are poked.  Faces punched.\n\n     A title reads: <b>\"GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.  BELLE GLADE,\n     FLORIDA.\"</b>\n\n     Foley is the oldest player here.  He's getting tired, starts to\n     lose his breath.  He finally walks off the court, breathing so\n     hard he can't even talk.  He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT\n     to come in and take his place.\n\n     Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath.  He looks\n     across the yard to where...\n\n<b>     A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES\n</b>\n     sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards.  All of\n     them are over sixty.

Another one sits nearby\n     painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.\n\n     Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches\n     his eye.  He watches as...\n\n<b>     TWO LATINO MEN\n</b>\n     both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop\n     and begin stretching out.  One of them nods to Foley.  Foley\n     nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks\n     over to a guard, PUPKO (\"PUP\"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.\n\n<b>                              PUP\n</b>                 You want something, Foley?\n\n     Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.\n\n<b>                              FOLEY\n</b>                 Some people are going out of here.\n                 What if I told you where and when?\n\n<b>                              PUP\n</b>                 How many?\n\n<b>                              FOLEY\n</b>                 I expect you to look out for me, Pup,\n                 let me run off work details.\n\n<b>                              PUP\n</b>                 Okay.
