SCHOOL. DAY                                              1    \n\n     JANUARY 1962. MONTAGE                                              \n\n     A nice girls' school in a south west London suburb. We see         \n     girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962:        \n     walking with books on their heads, practising their                \n     handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with          \n     each other.                                                        \n\n1A   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                          1A    \n\n     In one of the classrooms, MISS STUBBS, an attractive,              \n     bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group\n     of sixteen-year-old girls. Some of these girls seem to be\n     daydreaming - looking out of the window, examining their\n     fingernails. A couple, including a bespectacled girl who           \n     looks five years younger than everyone else in the class,\n     write down everything the teacher says. Only one, JENNY,\n     beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit\n     in which Miss Stubbs would like her to listen. She's\n     smiling, eyes shining - she loves Miss Stubbs, and these\n     lessons. Miss Stubbs asks a question, and Jenny puts up her        \n     hand - the only one in the class to do so.                         \n\n                         MISS STUBBS                                    \n                   (mock-sighing)                                       \n               Jenny. Again.                                            \n\n                         JENNY                                          \n               Isn't it because Mr Rochester's                          \n               blind?                                                   \n\n\n2    INT. BEDROOM. DAY                                             2    \n\n     Jenny's bedroom. Books about ponies, a much loved teddy\n     bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the\n     wall.\n\n     Jenny is bent over a small desk. Victorian novels, Latin\n     primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side\n     of her. She stands and stretches as she turns to us.\n\n     She kneels and flicks through her half-dozen or so LPs on\n     the floor near a cheap record player - they're all\n     classical, mostly by Elgar, apart from a Juliette Greco\n     record. This is the one she chooses. As the music begins,\n     she sings along.\n\n     Immediately there is a thumping noise - someone underneath\n     her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.\n\n                         MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n               I don't want to hear any French\n               singing. French singing wasn't on\n               the syllabus, last time I looked.\n\n                                                          2.\n\n\n\n    Jenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. She turns\n    the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her\n    head right next to the Dansette to hear it.\n\n    Close on Jenny as she silently mouths the words along with\n    the almost inaudible track.\n\n\n3   INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY                                         3\n\n    Jenny, her mother and father are finishing Sunday lunch.\n    Jenny's father JACK is in his forties, MARJORIE, her mother        \n    is slightly younger than Jack, but every bit as middle-\n    aged. The food is grey and brown, in keeping with the\n    colour scheme of the house. They aren't talking - they're\n    listening to Mantovani on the radio. Jenny gets up from the\n    lunch table.\n\n                        JENNY\n              I've got an English essay to do\n              by tomorrow morning.\n\n                        JACK\n              I don't want to hear anything\n              through the ceiling this\n              afternoon, apart from the sound\n              of sweat dripping onto textbooks.\n\n                          JENNY\n              Cello?\n\n                          JACK\n              No cello.\n\n                        JENNY\n              I thought we agreed that cello\n              was my interest or hobby?\n\n                        JACK\n              It's already your interest or\n              hobby. When they ask you \"What's\n              your interest or hobby?\" at your\n              Oxford interview, you can say,\n              \"Cello\". That wouldn't be a lie.\n              You don't need to practise a\n              hobby. A hobby is a hobby.\n\n                        JENNY\n              Or interest.\n\n                        JACK\n                  (ignoring her)\n              You don't need to be good at it.\n              You just have to be interested in\n              it.\n\n                                                          3.\n\n\n\n                        JENNY\n              Can I stop going to the youth\n              orchestra, then?\n\n                        JACK\n              No. The orchestra shows you're a\n              joiner-inner. Universities like\n              joiner-inners.\n\n                        JENNY\n              Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined\n              in. So now I can stop.\n\n                        JACK\n              Well, if you stop, that shows the\n              opposite, doesn't it? That shows\n              you're a rebel. They don't want\n              that at Oxford.\n\n                        JENNY\n              No. They don't want people who\n              think for themselves.\n\n                        JACK\n                  (missing the sarcasm, as\n                   is his wont)\n              Course they don't.\n\n\n4   INT. SCHOOL HALL. DAY                                         4    \n\n    Jenny with cello sits in the string section. Everyone is\n    getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving.\n    Along the row from Jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice-\n    looking boy of her age, GRAHAM, and she waves at him. Two\n    13 year old boys sitting between them wave too,\n    parodically, and then blow kisses, much to Graham's\n    embarrassment and Jenny's fury.\n\n    The silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly\n    one of the funniest moments of their lives - until one of\n    them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the\n    frantic gesturing, pungently. The comic value of the fart\n    tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are\n    scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.\n\n\n5   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                              5    \n\n    Jenny and Graham are talking while he struggles to take his\n    bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the\n    violin strapped to his back. Graham is nervous,\n    chronically unconfident and shy.\n\n                        GRAHAM\n              Should I wear, you know, Sunday\n              best?\n\n                                                            4.\n\n\n\n                        JENNY\n              You'd better, I'm afraid. Just to\n              show my father you're un jeune\n              homme serieux, not a teddy boy.\n\n                         GRAHAM\n              Oh, God.\n\n                        JENNY\n              It'll be all right. I won't wait.                        \n              It's going to bucket down in a                           \n              minute. I'll see you at the                              \n              weekend.                                                 \n\n    Jenny moves as quickly as she can towards the street.\n\n                        GRAHAM\n              Oh, yes. Bye.\n\n    The two silly boys from before arrive to blow more kisses.\n\n                        SMALLER BOY 1\n              Goodbye, darling! See you at the                         \n              weekend! I will miss you with all                        \n              of my heart!\n\n    Graham blushes. Jenny swipes the chief offender over the\n    head with her sheet music.\n\n\n6   EXT. BUS STOP. DAY                                            6\n\n    The rain has begun. Jenny attempts to cover herself. A             \n    mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and\n    a beautiful, sleek red sports car - a Bristol - stops to\n    let them across. David, possibly in his mid-thirties,\n    dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the\n    car. David, distracted, impatient, spots Jenny at the bus\n    stop.\n\n    In front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the\n    foot of one of the children,further slowing down their\n    painfully slow progress across the road.\n\n    Jenny is wet. David makes eye contact. Jenny smiles\n    ruefully, and enchantingly. David sighs, and then hesitates\n    for a moment. The window of the Bristol slowly rolls down.\n\n                         DAVID\n              Hello.\n\n    Jenny ignores him.\n\n                        DAVID\n              Listen. If you've got any sense,\n              you wouldn't take a lift from a\n              strange man.\n\n                                                          5.\n\n\n\n    Jenny smiles thinly.\n\n                        DAVID\n              I am, however, a music lover, and\n              I'm worried about your cello. So                         \n              what I propose is, you put it in                         \n              the car and walk alongside me.\n\n                        JENNY\n              How do I know you won't just\n              drive off with the cello?\n\n                        DAVID\n              Ah. Good point.\n\n    He winds down the other window and waves on the cars that\n    have stopped behind him.\n\n                        DAVID\n              How much does a new cello cost?\n              Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't\n              know. Let's say thirty.\n\n    He pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten-pound notes,\n    hands them to her.\n\n                        DAVID\n              There. Security.\n\n    Jenny laughs and waves the money away.                             \n\n\n7   EXT. STREET. NEAR SCHOOL. DAY.                                7    \n\n    Later. The cello is in the back seat of the Bristol. Jenny\n    is trotting alongside the car, while David leans\n    nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while\n    driving.\n\n                        DAVID\n              I'm David, by the way.\n\n    She says nothing.\n\n                        DAVID\n              And you are...?\n\n                        JENNY\n              Jenny. (Beat) I've never seen a\n              car like this before. C'est tres\n              chic.\n\n                        DAVID\n              It's a Bristol. Not many of `em\n              made.\n\n    Jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.\n\n                                                          6.\n\n\n\n                        DAVID\n              How did the concert go?\n\n                        JENNY\n              It was a rehearsal. The concert's\n              next Thursday.\n\n                        DAVID\n              What are you playing?\n\n                        JENNY\n                  (making a face)\n              Elgar.\n\n                        DAVID\n              Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a\n              shame he spent so much time in\n              Worcester, don't you? Worcester's\n              too near Birmingham. And you can\n              hear that in the music. There's a\n              horrible Brummy accent in there,\n              if you listen hard enough.\n\n    Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to\n    be able to make Elgar jokes.\n\n                        DAVID\n              Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and                         \n              Jews mix very well.                                    \n\n                        JENNY\n              I'm not a Jew!\n\n                         DAVID\n                   (smiling)\n              No. I am. I wasn't...accusing\n              you.\n\n                        JENNY\n              Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I\n              sit in the car with my cello?\n\n    David stops the car.\n\n                           DAVID\n              Jump in.\n\n\n8   INT. CAR. DAY                                               8\n\n    Jenny shuts the door and sinks approvingly into the white\n    leather seat. David regards the dripping girl with\n    amusement.\n\n                        JENNY\n              It's even nicer on the inside.\n\n                                                           7.\n\n\n\n                         DAVID\n               Where to, madam?\n\n     Jenny makes a face.\n\n                         JENNY\n               I only live round the corner.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What a shame. We'll just make it\n               last as long as we can.\n\n\n9    EXT. STREET. NEAR JENNY'S. DAY                               9     \n\n     The Bristol is crawling along the road at walking pace.\n\n\n10   INT/EXT. CAR JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                              10    \n\n     David reaches across Jenny while driving slowly, opens the         \n     glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes.\n\n                           DAVID\n               Smoke?\n\n                         JENNY\n               I'd better not. I'm a bit close\n               to home.\n\n     David lights one for himself.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I suppose cellists must go to a\n               lot of concerts.\n\n                         JENNY\n               We don't go to any concerts. We                          \n               don't believe in them.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Oh, they're real.\n\n                         JENNY\n               So people say.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Why don't we believe in them?\n\n                         JENNY\n               I suppose...What would he say?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Your father, this is?\n\n                                                           8.\n\n\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (Darkly)\n               Oh, yes. He'd say there's no\n               point to them. They're just for\n               fun. Apart from school concerts,\n               of course, which are no fun at\n               all, so we go to those. The\n               proper ones don't help you get                         \n               on.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Which of course is what is so                          \n               wonderful about them. Anyway,\n               you'll go one day.\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (heartfelt)\n               Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it\n               seems as though that's what all\n               this slog is for. If I get to\n               University, I'm going to read\n               what I want and think about what\n               I want and listen to what I want.\n               And I'm going to look at\n               paintings and go to French films\n               and talk to people who know lots\n               about lots.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Good for you. Which University?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go\n               anywhere?\n\n                         DAVID\n               I studied at what I believe they\n               call the University of Life. And\n               I didn't get a very good degree\n               there.\n\n     Jenny smiles.\n\n                         JENNY\n               This is me. Thank you.\n\n     She gets out of the car with the cello. David stares after\n     her for a moment, then drives off.\n\n\n11   INT. JENNY'S SITTING-ROOM. AFTERNOON                       11\n\n     Jenny, her parents and Graham are eating afternoon tea -\n     neat fish-paste sandwiches, Battenberg cake, best china.\n\n                         MARJORIE\n               How's your mother, Graham?\n\n                                                      9.\n\n\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          She's fine, thanks. She sends her\n          best, by the way.\n\n                    JACK\n          Where are you applying, Graham?\n\nJenny looks embarrassed. She knows what's coming.\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I'm not sure yet.\n\n                    JACK\n          Well, when will you be sure? You\n          can't let the grass grow under\n          your feet, you know. Otherwise\n          you'll be at the back of the\n          queue.\n\n                    JENNY\n              (deadpan)\n          I suppose so. I suppose the\n          growing grass would knock you off\n          balance, and then you'd fall\n          over, and by the time you picked\n          yourself up, there'd be a queue.\n\nHer father shoots her a look - is she being cheeky?\n\n                    GRAHAM\n          I might take a year off.\n\nJenny winces. Jack looks at him as if he's just said he'll\ntake all his clothes off.\n\n                      JACK\n          What for?\n\n                    GRAHAM\n              (mumbling)\n          I don't know. Maybe do some\n          travelling, that sort of thing.\n\n                    JACK\n          Travelling? What are you, a teddy\n          boy?\n\nClose-up of Jenny - she knows what's coming, and can't bear\nit. Beat.\n\n                    JACK\n              (nodding at Jenny)\n          You know she's going to Oxford,\n          don't you? Oxford. English. If we\n          can get her Latin up to scratch.\n\nJenny sighs.\n\n                                                           10.\n\n\n\n                          JACK\n                So she's studying English at\n                Oxford while you're a wandering\n                Jew...\n\n      Jenny looks at him curiously. Graham steels himself to\n      speak.\n\n                          GRAHAM\n                Mr Mellor...I'm not a teddy boy.\n                I'm an homme serieux. Jeune. An\n                homme jeune serieux homme.\n\n      Jenny winces again. Her father stares at Graham. Graham\n      blushes.\n\n\n12    INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                 12     \n\n      It's the night of the youth orchestra concert. Jenny, her\n      mother and father are on their way out of the door. Jack is\n      carrying the cello. Jenny is in her school uniform, with\n      her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. The three of\n      them are flustered. Jenny opens the front door for her\n      father and he stumbles outside.\n\n                             JENNY\n                Oh!\n\n\n12A   INT/EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                             12A    \n\n      She has seen something on the doorstep, and she stoops to\n      pick it up - a large bunch of flowers.\n\n                          JENNY\n                They're for me!\n\n                          MARJORIE\n                    (curious)\n                Who are they from?\n\n      Jenny opens the card that's attached to them.\n\n                             JENNY\n                Gosh. Him.\n\n                          MARJORIE\n                Who's `him'?\n\n                          JENNY\n                Just...A chap I met.\n\n                          MARJORIE\n                A chap who sends flowers? So he's\n                a man-chap?\n\n                                                     11.\n\n\n\n                    JENNY\n          Yes, he is, really.\n\nJack stares at the flowers in disbelief. The bunch of          \nflowers has created in Jack the kind of panic and fear more\ntypically associated with a biochemical attack.\n\n                    JACK\n          What's going on here?\n\n                    MARJORIE\n              (drily, knowing the\n               trouble this will\n               cause)\n          Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been\n          sent some flowers by a chap.\n\n                    JACK\n          A chap? What kind of chap? Who?\n          Why?\n\n                    JENNY\n              (patiently)\n          He's wishing me luck for tonight.\n\n                    JACK\n          Are you sure that's all he's\n          wishing? And where does he get\n          the money from?\n\n                    JENNY\n          He earns it, I expect.\n\n                    JACK\n          What do you mean, he earns it?\n          Why isn't he at school? What does\n          he do?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Can we just go? Otherwise the\n          bunch of good-luck flowers will\n          actually be responsible for me\n          actually missing the concert.\n          Which would be ironic, n'est ce\n          pas?\n\n                    JACK\n          Well I don't like it.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Objection noted. Jenny?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Noted.\n\n                                                           12.\n\n\n\n                          JACK\n                Ten bob's worth of luck, I\n                reckon. That's a lot for a\n                schoolgirl. You can't leave them\n                out here, anyway. I'd burgle a\n                house that had flowers outside.\n                They'll think we're made of\n                money.\n\n\n12B   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                12B    \n\n      Jenny sighs, puts them inside the house, shuts the door.          \n\n\n13    INT. COFFEE BAR. DAY                                       13\n\n      Jenny and two school friends, HATTIE and TINA, are sitting\n      at a table in a typical late-50s coffee bar, sipping\n      cappuccinos. Jenny is easily the most attractive of the\n      three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest.\n      HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier;\n      TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also\n      the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a\n      scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering\n      and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it\n      with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking\n      pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of\n      pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino\n      with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her\n      disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down.\n\n                          JENNY\n                The whole point about him is that                       \n                he doesn't feel.\n\n                          TINA\n                We still don't have to like him.\n\n                          JENNY\n                Camus doesn't want you to like\n                him. What he's trying to say is\n                that feeling is bourgeois. Being\n                engagee is bourgeois. His mother\n                dies and he doesn't feel\n                anything. He kills this Arab and\n                he doesn't feel anything.\n\n                          TINA\n                I wouldn't feel anything if my\n                mother died. Does that make me an\n                existentialist?\n\n                          JENNY\n                No. That just makes you a cow.\n\n                                                             13.\n\n\n\n                              HATTIE\n                 Une vache.\n\n     Laughter.\n\n\n14   EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY                                   14    \n\n     Jenny, Hattie and Tina emerge from the cafe, talking.\n\n                           JENNY\n                 Well I'm going to be French. I'm\n                 going to Paris and I'm going to\n                 smoke and listen to Jacques Brel\n                 and wear black. And I won't\n                 speak. Ever. C'est plus chic,\n                 comme...\n\n     She breaks off. Parked outside a tobacconists on the other\n     side of the road is the red Bristol. She looks towards the\n     shop, and David emerges with a copy of the Times and a\n     packet of cigars. Jenny crosses the road to talk to him\n     while the others watch.\n\n                              DAVID\n                 Hello.\n\n                           JENNY\n                 Hello. Thank you.\n\n                           DAVID\n                 How did it go?\n\n                           JENNY\n                 Oh, fine. I think. I mean, I\n                 didn't mess my bit up, anyway.\n                 And no-one got thrown out of the\n                 orchestra afterwards.\n\n                           DAVID\n                 Always the mark of a cultural\n                 triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran\n                 into you. What are you doing on\n                 Friday?\n\n                           JENNY\n                 Going to school.\n\n                           DAVID\n                 I meant the evening.\n\n                           JENNY\n                     (embarrassed)\n                 Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing.\n\n                                                     14.\n\n\n\n                    DAVID\n          Because I'm going to listen to                       \n          some Schubert in St John's, Smith                    \n          Square. My friends Danny and                         \n          Helen will be going too, so it\n          wouldn't be...I'll tell you what.\n          I'll come and pick you up, and if\n          your mother and father\n          disapprove, then you can have the\n          tickets and go with one of them.\n          How does that sound?\n\nJenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and his\neagerness to please seems to convince her.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Thank you. And I'd like you to\n          take me. I'd like to go with\n          someone who knows when to clap.\n\n                    DAVID\n          I usually watch Danny. He knows\n          that sort of thing.\n\nJenny smiles.\n\n                     DAVID\n          Seven? And we'll probably go for\n          a spot of supper afterwards, if\n          you...But if you, if that's\n          not...Well, we can always put you\n          in a taxi.\n\n                    JENNY\n              (flat disbelief)\n          Supper.\n\n                    DAVID\n          If you want.\n\n                    JENNY\n          The trouble is, we'll already\n          have eaten.\n\n                    DAVID\n          Well. I mean, if you'd like\n          supper, then, perhaps on Friday\n          you could...not eat?\n\n                    JENNY\n              (embarrassed again)\n          Oh. Yes. Of course.\n\nJenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of\nthe road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with\ntheir mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and\nstarts to walk on.\n\n                                                     15.\n\n\n\n                    TINA\n          I'm sorry. I just had the\n          strangest dream. I dreamed you\n          crossed the road and spoke to a\n          handsome man with the most\n          beautiful car I've ever seen. And\n          then you came back and you didn't\n          mention it.\n\nJenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgently.\n\n                    TINA\n          `Oo wazzee?\n\n                    JENNY\n              (light, playful)\n          Just a man who's been trying to\n          pick me up.

I've only just\n          realised! That's what's going to\n          happen to you, isn't it? Look at\n          her! Men are going to pick her up\n          in the street and take her out to\n          supper!\n\n                    HATTIE\n          God, you're right, Tina. I hadn't\n          thought of that.

JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                                  15\n\n     Jenny is dressed up for her evening out. She looks good,\n     but also stiff, uncomfortable - she's not herself in her\n     dress, which looks too old for her. Her father is standing\n     in front of her, shouting.\n\n                         JACK\n               I won't allow it!\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (coolly)\n               Fine.

I'll take her.\n\n                    JACK\n          And how are you going to get over                   \n          there?

A wandering Jew. So watch\n           yourself.\n\nShe   goes to the door.\n\n                      JACK\n               (panic-stricken and\n                 shouting)\n           What's she talking about? I've\n           never said anything like that in\n           my life! Anyway, it's just an\n           expression! I'm not against the\n           Jews!\n\nJenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly in\nhis early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket,\nslacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is\nbrighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most\ncolourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly\nexotic.\n\nDavid has obviously heard Jack's last line.\n\n                     DAVID\n               (pleasantly)\n           I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David                   \n           Goldman.                                            \n\nHe offers his hand.\n\n                     JACK\n           I didn't mean I'm not against\n           you...

He does so now,\nand shakes it for way too long.\n\n                     JACK\n           I'm sorry. What I'm saying is\n           that you're not the sort of, of\n           person I'd be against, if I were\n           the sort of person who was\n           against...people. You're not an\n           old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and\n           this is Marjorie.\n\n                                                     19.\n\n\n\n                    DAVID\n              (deadpan)\n          You didn't tell me you had a\n          sister, Jenny.\n\nGeneral confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjorie\ngiggles, and then offers her hand.\n\n                    DAVID\n          You're a lucky man, Jack.\n\n                    JACK\n          I suppose I am, yes.\n\nThey all sit down.\n\n                    DAVID\n          So. Gosh. (He looks around\n          approvingly.) This is lovely.\n\nMarjorie smiles.\n\n                       MARJORIE\n          Thank you.\n\n                    JACK\n          I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a\n          drink?\n\n                    DAVID\n          I'd love one, Jack, but we're\n          running a little late. If Jenny's\n          ready, perhaps we'll shoot off.\n\nJenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Ah. Well. Dad's got something to\n          tell you.\n\n                    JACK\n          No, no, nothing...It was more of\n          a question, really. How would you\n          get to St John's Smith Square                        \n          from here? For future reference?\n\n                    DAVID\n          Oh, it's a pretty straight run,\n          really. Up to Hammersmith, take                      \n          the A4 through Kensington and                        \n          you're there.                                        \n\n                    JACK\n          Simple as that.\n\n                    DAVID\n          Simple as that.\n\n                                                     20.\n\n\n\nJack smiles broadly.\n\n                     MARJORIE\n              (playfully)\n          So shall I book some tickets for                     \n          something?\n\n                       JACK\n                 (still smiling)\n          No.\n\nBeat.\n\n                    JACK\n          Back by ten, please, David. She's\n          usually in bed by then.\n\nJenny winces.\n\n                    DAVID\n          I was hoping Jenny would come\n          with me afterwards to have a bite\n          of supper with my aunt Helen.\n\nJenny studies him carefully. Suddenly his friends Danny and\nHelen have become `Aunt Helen'.\n\n                    JACK\n          Oh, well, I suppose...\n\n                    DAVID\n          How about if I promise to have\n          her in by eleven thirty?\n\n                    JACK\n          Well, it's Friday night. And if\n          you're going out to the West\n          End...\n\n                    DAVID\n          Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.\n          See you again.\n\nThey exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie.\nMarjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it\nsuavely,leaving her a little flustered.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Have a nice time.\n\n                       JENNY\n          Bye.\n\nJenny and David leave.\n\n                                                           21.\n\n\n\n                          JACK\n                    (sniffing the air)\n                What's that smell?

ST JOHN'S, SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                        15A    \n\n      Jenny and David walk toward the beautiful hall. Jenny             \n      suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for          \n      her - other adults are milling around outside, and the            \n      women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an        \n      incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late          \n      twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen         \n      is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get.           \n      She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both        \n      appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy          \n      Bohemian gear. She turns heads in a way that Jenny is not         \n      yet able to. Danny too is attractive, but soberly so. David       \n      and Jenny are, in a way, paler, less striking versions of         \n      these two.                                                        \n\n                          DAVID                                         \n                Hello hello.

They both give her      \n     fascinated and clearly appraising looks. They have heard         \n     about her.                                                       \n\n                           DAVID (CONT'D)                             \n               Shall we?                                              \n\n     They walk into the hall.                                         \n\n\n16   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                         16    \n\n     It's a beautiful hall - Jenny is dazzled by the                  \n     surroundings and the company. She's particularly bowled          \n     over by Helen.                                                   \n\n                         HELEN                                        \n               Look. We can leave our coats                           \n               over there. I want to get rid of                       \n               this.\n\n     She nods at the coat she's carrying. Jenny looks thrilled        \n     at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with Helen.      \n     Danny hands Helen his coat, without saying anything. The         \n     girls walk over to another reception table a few yards           \n     away, behind which is a cloakroom. A lady is exchanging          \n     overcoats for tickets. Almost involuntarily, Jenny touches       \n     the sleeve of Helen's velvety jacket. She stops herself.\n     Helen notices.\n\n                         JENNY\n               I'm so sorry.\n\n                         HELEN\n                   (amused)\n               That's OK. It's nice, isn't it?\n\n                         JENNY\n               It's beautiful. Where did it come\n               from?\n\n                         HELEN\n               Oh, South Ken somewhere.\n\n     Helen looks at Jenny's outfit, her frumpy `smart' dress,\n     apparently wanting to return the compliment.\n\n                         HELEN\n                   (nodding at the dress)\n               This is...Well, it's good for\n               this sort of concert, isn't it?\n\n                          JENNY\n                   (quietly)\n               Thank you.\n\n                                                       23.\n\n\n\nHelen is now at the front of the queue, and hands her coat\nover imperiously.\n\n                    HELEN\n          We should go shopping together\n          one day, if you want.\n\nShe takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady.                    \n\n                    JENNY\n          That would be nice. But South\n          Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher\n          pour moi.\n\nThey stare at each other. Helen is bewildered, Jenny\nembarrassed.\n\n                    HELEN\n          Sorry?\n\n                    JENNY\n          I just said....It was too\n          expensive for me.\n\n                    HELEN\n          No you didn't. You said something\n          completely different.\n\n                    JENNY\n          I just...Well, I said it in\n          French.\n\n                    HELEN\n          In French? Why?\n\nJenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can\nsee - that Helen is simply very dim.\n\n                    JENNY\n          I don't know.\n\nJenny looks away. Helen stares at her. The performance bell\nrings, and they make their way back to the men. To Jenny's\nsurprise and pleasure, Helen links arms with her as they\nwalk.\n\n                    HELEN\n          Anyway. It's too expensive for\n          me, too. We don't have to worry\n          about that. If you want something\n          in South Ken, get David to take\n          you shopping.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Why on earth would he want to\n          take me shopping?\n\n                                                          24.\n\n\n\n     Helen makes a knowing face.\n\n\n17   INT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                           17    \n\n     David, Jenny, Danny and Helen in a row in the middle of the\n     auditorium, watching the stage and listening to the music.\n     Jenny can't concentrate - she's too excited by the occasion\n     and the company. Jenny sneaks a glance at Helen, who stares\n     straight ahead, unblinking and enigmatic. David is smiling,\n     as if he's trying to communicate enjoyment; Danny's eyes\n     flicker across the stage - he understands the music, its\n     component parts, which musicians are contributing what.\n     Jenny takes it all in.\n\n\n18   EXT. ST JOHN'S SMITH SQUARE. NIGHT                           18    \n\n     Jenny, David, Danny and Helen emerge with the other concert-\n     goers.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I booked a table at Juliette's.                          \n               Will that kill the mood, do you\n               think?\n\n                         HELEN\n               Oh, I do hope so.                                        \n\n     The others laugh.\n\n                         HELEN\n               I always think I'm going to my\n               own funeral when I listen to\n               classical music. (Tentatively)\n               That was classical, wasn't it?\n\n                         DANNY\n               Yes. Very classical. As classical\n               as you can get.\n\n     Helen looks pleased.\n\n                          DAVID\n               Juliette's it is, then. Heaven\n               forbid that we should end the\n               evening reflecting on our own\n               mortality.\n\n     Jenny smiles in delight. She's never met people like this.\n\n\n19   INT. JULIETTE'S. NIGHT                                       19    \n\n     A singer in the Julie London mould is singing `I'm In The          \n     Mood For Love' while cigarette girls and glamorous\n     waitresses patrol the tables.\n\n                                                     25.\n\n\nJenny is sitting with the others at a table in the club,       \neating and talking. She looks about twelve, but she's          \nthrilled to be there. We know now that her life can never\nbe the same again, and there will be no going back to fish-\npaste sandwiches with spotty Graham.\n\n                    DAVID                                      \n          Have you never heard \"Chante\n          Francoise Sagan\"?\n\nJenny shakes her head. Her eyes are wide - she's clearly\nawe-struck. David offers her a cigarette - a Gitane - which\nshe takes. He lights it for her while she's listening.\n\n                    DANNY\n          Oh, it's wonderful.\n\n                    JENNY\n          I've only got....Well, I think\n          it's just called `Juliette\n          Greco'. The one with the eyes on\n          the sleeve. I saved up and got my\n          French conversation teacher to\n          bring it back after Christmas.\n\n                    HELEN\n          You've got a French conversation\n          teacher?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Yes.\n\n                    HELEN\n          Is that why you suddenly speak\n          French for no reason?\n\n                    DANNY                                      \n              (ignoring her)\n          You must have seen her sing?                         \n\nJenny shakes her head again and smiles. Where would she\nhave seen Juliette Greco? Danny, meanwhile, is baffled. Who    \nhasn't seen Juliette Greco?                                    \n\n                    DAVID\n          She's marvellous.\n\n                    DANNY\n          But you should see her in Paris,\n          not here. David will take you.\n\n                    DAVID\n          I'd love to. You'd fit right in.\n\n                    HELEN\n              (sympathetically)\n          Better than here, really.\n\n                                                     26.\n\n\n\n                    DAVID\n          It's wonderful to find a young\n          person who wants to know things.\n          There's so much I want you to\n          see.\n\nThey sip their drinks pensively, possibly to allow time for\nthe double-entendre to disappear into the smoke.\n\n                    DAVID\n          Are you still all right to come\n          and have a look at that Pembroke\n          Villas place with me on Friday,\n          Danny?\n\n                    DANNY\n          Oh. No. Can't do it. There's a\n          Burne-Jones coming up at\n          Christie's on Friday. And I want                     \n          it.                                                  \n\n                    JENNY\n              (laughing in disbelief)\n          You're thinking of buying a Burne-\n          Jones? A real one?\n\n                    DANNY\n          I just have a feeling that the\n          pre-Raphaelites are going to take\n          off.\n\n                    JENNY\n          I love the pre-Raphaelites.\n\n                    DAVID\n              (excited by her\n               education)\n          Do you?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Yes, of course. Rossetti and\n          Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman\n          Hunt, so much. He's so garish.\n\nDanny looks at her. There's clearly more to this schoolgirl\nthan he thought.\n\n                    DAVID\n          Absolutely! Why don't we all go\n          to the auction? Wouldn't that be\n          fun?\n\n                    JENNY\n          An auction. Gosh. How exciting.\n\n                                                          27.\n\n\n\n                         DANNY\n               Next Friday morning. David will\n               pick you up.\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (crestfallen)\n               Oh. Friday.\n\n                         DANNY\n               You're busy?\n\n                            JENNY\n               Well. Yes.\n\n     She doesn't want to explain why.                                  \n\n                            DANNY                                      \n               Tant pis.                                               \n\n     Helen looks at him aghast. Why has he started speaking            \n     French?                                                           \n\n                         DAVID\n               Are you sure you're busy?\n\n     Jenny hesitates.\n\n                         JENNY\n               No. I'm sure I could....re-\n               arrange. That would be lovely.\n\n\n20   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                   20\n\n     Jenny lets herself quietly into the house. The hallway is\n     dark, but she can hear noises from the kitchen. She pokes\n     her head round the corner, and sees her mother doing the\n     washing-up.\n\n                          MARJORIE\n               Oh, hello, love. Did you have a\n               nice time?\n\n                         JENNY\n               What are you doing?\n\n                         MARJORIE\n               I can't get this casserole dish\n               clean. We had hot-pot tonight,\n               and it's all burnt round...\n\n                         JENNY\n               It's twenty-five to twelve. We\n               finish tea at seven.                                    \n\n                                                             28.\n\n\n\n                           MARJORIE\n                 I know what the time is. How was\n                 your evening?\n\n                           JENNY\n                 It was...It was the best night of\n                 my life.\n\n                           MARJORIE\n                 And he took you home in his car?\n                 Right to the door?\n\n     Jenny looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard what\n     Jenny has just said.\n\n                           JENNY\n                 Goodnight, Mum.\n\n                           MARJORIE\n                 And I'm glad you enjoyed the\n                 concert.\n\n\n21   INT. CLASSROOM. DAY                                             21\n\n     Jenny, Hattie and Tina are    sitting on their desks, waiting\n     for the start of a lesson.    Nine or ten classmates are\n     scattered around the room,    talking distractedly, but\n     Jenny's group is much more    animated: Tina and Hattie are\n     leaning forward, listening    to Jenny, their eyes bright.\n     They are clearly awestruck    by Jenny's tales of the outside\n     world.\n\n                            TINA\n                     (to Hattie)\n                 I'm not interested in Schubert. I\n                 want to know what else was on the\n                 programme.\n\n     Laughter.\n\n                           JENNY\n                 There was nothing like that. He\n                 was the perfect gentleman. He\n                 just said he wanted to take me\n                 places and show me things.\n\n                           TINA\n                 Things plural? Oh my Gawd!\n\n     More laughter. The English teacher, MISS STUBBS, young and\n     fresh-faced and lively-looking, enters, and picks up on\n     the excitement of Jenny's coterie.\n\n                                                     29.\n\n\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          I knew that in the end `Jane\n          Eyre' would work its magic upon\n          you. I'm presuming that's what\n          you're so animated about.\n\nThe students start to sit down at desks in a more\nconventional arrangement.\n\n                       JENNY\n          Of course.\n\n                     TINA\n          `Jane Eyre' and Jenny's new\n          boyfriend.\n\n                    JENNY\n          He's not my \"new boyfriend\". God.\n\n                    TINA\n          It's true. He's more a man-\n          friend, isn't he? He's got a\n          sports-car, Miss Stubbs.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          Ah. A Mr Rochester figure.\n\n                     TINA\n          I think he must be as blind as Mr\n          Rochester.\n\nLaughter. Jenny pulls a face at her.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          Is there no end to your thirst\n          for literary understanding,\n          Jenny? As you may have noticed,\n          I'm attempting to turn the\n          subject away from Jenny's lurid\n          love-life and towards the matter\n          in hand.\n\nShe starts to hand out essays.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          And it's quite clear on this\n          evidence that most of you know\n          much too much about the former,\n          and almost nothing about the\n          latter. Reluctantly I must\n          concede that Jenny is evidently\n          an expert on both matters.\n          Excellent as always, Jenny.\n\nMiss Stubbs slaps an essay down on Jenny's desk. We can see\nthat it's marked `A+'.\n\n                                                            30.\n\n\n\n\n22   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM.

DAY                                             24\n\n     We see the Bristol parked outside, and Jenny walking\n     towards it, a small figure in a large playground. She's\n     clearly just changed out of her school uniform, and she's\n     making last-minute adjustments to her civvies. A teacher\n     walks towards her, and Jenny almost freezes - but the\n     teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past. Jenny\n     keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then\n     breaks into a run.\n\n\n25   INT/EXT. CAR/DILAPIDATED HOUSE. DAY                          25    \n\n     Jenny and David are driving along a North Kensington\n     street.\n\n                         JENNY\n               How do you know Danny?\n\n     David is distracted. He's driving slowly, apparently\n     looking for an address.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Oh, you know. We kept bumping\n               into each other, and we became\n               pals, and we've ended up doing a\n               bit of work together, when it\n               suits us.\n\n                         JENNY\n               What kind of work?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Property. A bit of art dealing.\n               Some buying and selling.

They are surrounded by what\n     appears to be all their worldly goods. David squats down on\n     his haunches, talks to the kids, tousles the hair of the\n     smallest. Then he takes out a bunch of keys and ushers the\n     family down the path. He unlocks the door and leads them\n     inside.\n\n     In an upper window of the house, we see an old lady peering\n     down anxiously.\n\n\n26   EXT. STREET/DILAPIDATED HOUSE.

He\n     lights them both.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I'm sorry about that.\n\n                         JENNY\n               How do you know those, those\n               ...Negro people?\n\n                         DAVID\n               They're clients.\n\n                          JENNY\n               Clients?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Jenny darling, even schwarzers\n               have to live somewhere. And it's\n               not as if they can rent off their\n               own kind, is it?\n\n     He starts the car and drives off.\n\n                         JENNY\n               I'm not sure I quite understand\n               what you do.\n\n                         DAVID\n               You don't need to.

Jenny is sipping a glass of white wine and\n     walking around the room enthralled, looking at Danny's\n     existing Pre-Raphaelite art collection; he has three or\n     four big paintings proudly displayed on his walls.

He'd have you arrested.\n\n                        DAVID\n           We'll see.\n\n                     JENNY\n           I'll bet you you can't do it.\n\n                        DAVID\n           How much?\n\n                     DANNY\n               (amused)\n           Be careful, Jenny. You don't know\n           who you're dealing with.\n\n                     JENNY\n           Half-a-crown.\n\n                        DAVID\n           You're on.\n\nThey shake hands. Jenny suddenly notice the clock on\nDanny's mantelpiece.\n\n                     JENNY\n           Mon dieu! You must take me back\n           to school. And I've got to change\n           back into my uniform.\n\nThere is a silence. Danny and David make momentary eye\ncontact - they are clearly contemplating the erotic\npossibilities of Jenny's last sentence. Helen notices.\n\n                     HELEN\n           Oh, behave yourselves.\n\nJenny looks at them all, mystified.\n\n                                                          37.\n\n\n\n\n30   INT. CLASSROOM/LATIN. DAY.                                  30    \n\n     Jenny is in her Latin class, waiting for the lesson to\n     begin. Tina and Hattie aren't with her, and she sits on her\n     own -the atmosphere of the class is very different from\n     Miss Stubbs' English lessons. The girls are different, more\n     serious, less fun, and the atmosphere is more sombre. The\n     teacher, MRS WILSON, is older, plainer, stricter. She pulls       \n     some papers out of her bag.\n\n                         MRS WILSON                                    \n               Test results for the Virgil\n               translation. We will start from\n               the bottom...Patricia.\n\n     Jenny puffs out her cheeks. She's not last.\n\n                         MRS WILSON (CONT'D)                           \n               Absent. Margaret. 48%. Jenny...\n\n     Jenny winces.\n\n                         MRS WILSON (CONT'D)                           \n               52%. That would just about scrape\n               a pass in the exam proper. Not\n               good enough for Oxford\n               candidates.\n\n\n31   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                                     31\n\n     Jenny and her mother are sitting on the sofa, staring into\n     space, clearly upset. On the coffee table in front of them\n     is the test, covered in red ink. They hear a key in the\n     lock, and they look at each other.\n\n                         MARJORIE\n               I'll talk to him.\n\n     Jack enters, back from work. He's wearing a suit and\n     carrying a battered briefcase. He looks at them, and then\n     notices the essay on the table.\n\n                         JACK\n               It's her Latin, isn't it?\n\n                         MARJORIE\n               The test didn't...Well, it didn't\n               go as well as we'd hoped.\n\n     He picks up the paper.\n\n                                    38.\n\n\n\n          JACK\nAnd you still say I shouldn't go\ndown there and have it out with\nwhatsername? The Latin teacher?\nBecause this is hopeless.\n\n          JENNY\nHow are you going to \"have it\nout\" with her? What are you going\nto do? Shout at her until she\ndecides I'm much cleverer than\nshe thinks?\n\n          MARJORIE\nEveryone's doing their best,\nJack.\n\n          JACK\nWhat if their best isn't good\nenough, though, eh? What do we do\nthen?\n\n          JENNY\nWe don't go to Oxford. Any of us.\nNot even you, Dad.\n\n          JACK\nPerhaps it's all a waste of time\nand money anyway.\n\n          MARJORIE\nYou don't mean that.\n\n          JACK\nWell, what's she going to do with\nan English degree? And if she's\ngoing to spend three years\nplaying that bloody cello and\ntalking in French to beatniks,\nthen I'm throwing good money\nafter bad. I suppose she might\nmeet a nice lawyer. But she could\ndo that at a dinner dance\ntomorrow.\n\n          JENNY\nOh, yes. That's the whole point\nof an Oxford education. It's the\nexpensive alternative to a dinner\ndance.\n\n          MARJORIE\nWhat about private tuition?\n\n          JACK\nIs anyone listening to me? How\nmuch is that going to cost me?\n\n                                              39.\n\n\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Five shillings an hour. Maybe a\n          little more for A-level.\n\n                    JACK\n          Five bob! But... we could spend\n          five bob on this and five bob on\n          that, and before we know it\n          that's our savings down the\n          drain.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          And what else are we spending\n          five bob on? What else are we\n          spending sixpence on?\n\n                    JACK\n          Oh, nothing. (He gestures round\n          the room.) It's all free. That\n          vase was free.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          It was, actually. It was a\n          present from Auntie Vi.\n\n                    JACK\n          That chair was free. The sofa.\n          We don't have to pay for\n          anything. And even if we did, we\n          don't have to work for it. That's\n          the beauty of life, Jenny.\n          Everything's free. Grows on\n          trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He\n          warms to his theme, and grows\n          progressively more berserk.)\n          We've got a lovely Oxford tree in\n          the garden, lucky for you, so\n          that's Oxford taken care of. And\n          a whole orchard of school trees,\n          so that's all free. I'm sure\n          there are some private tuition\n          trees out there. I'll go and have\n          a look.\n\nHe stands up.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Jack...\n\n                    JACK\n          No, no, won't take me a minute. I\n          think I saw some at the back\n          there, right next to the pocket\n          money tree. I'll just nip out\n          and check, see that they're\n          doing all right.\n\n                                                             40.\n\n\n                Don't want anyone climbing over\n                the wall and scrumping, do we?\n                And you never know. Maybe\n                there'll be a man with deep\n                pockets growing out there.\n                Because God knows we need to find\n                you one.\n\n      He leaves the room, apparently to   look in   the garden   for\n      the mythical trees.\n\n\n31A   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE                                           31A    \n\n      Jenny and her mother move to the window to    watch him\n      talking theatrically to the trees.\n\n\n32    EXT. STREET/COFFEE BAR. DAY.                                 32     \n\n      Jenny, Hattie and Tina are walking back from school.\n\n                          TINA\n                You could always go to\n                secretarial college with Hattie.\n\n                          JENNY\n                    (sarcastic)\n                Oh, thanks.\n\n                            HATTIE\n                Charming!\n\n                            JENNY\n                Oh, no.\n\n      Hattie and Tina follow Jenny's eyes, and they see Graham\n      coming towards them pushing his bike, red-faced, trousers\n      tucked into socks.\n\n                            GRAHAM\n                Hello.\n\n                          JENNY\n                Oh. Graham. Hello.\n\n                          GRAHAM\n                I haven't seen you for ages....It\n                all went wrong, didn't it? The\n                tea-party, I mean. Was it because\n                of the year off?\n\n                          JENNY\n                No, no. It's just...I've got so\n                much to do if I'm going to get\n                the grades I need.\n\n                                                          41.\n\n\n\n                         TINA\n               Yes. She's got no time for boys.\n\n     Hattie and Tina try to suppress giggles. Graham turns an\n     even brighter shade of red. Hattie and Tina enter the             \n     coffee bar. Jenny feels sorry for him, is on the verge of         \n     inviting him to join them...And changes her mind.                 \n\n                         JENNY                                         \n                   (quickly)                                           \n               Bye, Graham.                                            \n\n     She follows the girls inside.                                     \n\n\n33   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM/UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                   33    \n\n     Jenny is deep in her schoolwork. She has a Latin vocabulary\n     propped open on the window-ledge. She looks at it, walks\n     away, mutters to herself, attempting to memorize. Her\n     concentration is broken by a sudden gale of laughter from\n     downstairs.\n\n\n34   INT. JENNY'S HALL. NIGHT                                    34\n\n     She stands outside the living room for a moment, listening.\n     She hears a man's voice that does not belong to her father,\n     and then more laughter from her father and mother.\n\n\n35   INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT                                     35\n\n     David is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to\n     mimic all of the Goons. Jack and Marjorie are laughing so\n     hard that they can hardly see - they certainly miss Jenny's\n     entrance.\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (curious)\n               Hello.\n\n                         JACK\n               Oh. Hello. David does the most\n               brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny.\n               Actually, he can do all the                             \n               Goons.                                                  \n\n                         DAVID                                         \n               I don't think I'm very good at                          \n               Eccles.                                                 \n\n                         JACK                                          \n               Oh, no, you've got him...                               \n\n                                                     42.\n\n\n\n                    JENNY\n              (impatiently)                                 \n          But what's he doing here?\n\n                    DAVID\n          I wasn't going to disturb you. I\n          knew you'd have your nose to the\n          grindstone.\n\n                    JENNY\n              (incredulous)\n          You came to see Mum and Dad?\n\n                    JACK\n          Is that so hard to imagine?\n\nJenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee-table.\n\n                     JENNY\n          And you're drinking? But it's not\n          Christmas!\n\n                    JACK\n          Hark at her! Makes us sound as\n          though we've signed the pledge.\n          You don't know everything about\n          us, you know. We had a life\n          before you came along.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Yes, that's true. I'm only going\n          on what I've seen over the last\n          sixteen years.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          I'm trying to think what you\n          missed. Nothing much comes to\n          mind.\n\n                    JACK\n          They can't stand to see me\n          enjoying myself.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've\n          got a huge pile of Latin\n          translation to do.\n\n                    JACK\n          You didn't tell me David went to\n          Oxford.\n\nJenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight-\nfaced.\n\n                    JENNY\n          No. I didn't.\n\n                                    43.\n\n\n\n          DAVID\nFor all the good it did me.\n\n          JACK\nWhat did you read?\n\n          DAVID\nOh, English. Just like every\nother semi-employed layabout in\nLondon.\n\n          JACK\n    (marvelling at the\n     coincidence)\nEnglish! Which college?\n\n          DAVID\nMerton.\n\n          MARJORIE\nIsn't that funny?\n\n          JENNY\nExtraordinary.\n\n           DAVID\nI was just telling Jack that I'm\ngoing back next weekend. I go and\nsee my old professor every now\nand again.\n\n          JACK\nThat's what you need, Jenny.\nSomeone on the inside track. It's\nnot always what you know, is it,\nDavid?\n\n          DAVID\nToo true. And Clive would love\nJenny. Have you ever come across\nClive Lewis?\n\n          JENNY\nDad has never come across anyone.\n\n          DAVID\nI just thought he might know some\nof the books.\n\n          JENNY\nDad has never read any books.\n\n          JACK\n    (stung)\nWhat's he written?\n\n                                                     44.\n\n\n\n                    DAVID\n          He wrote a children's book called\n          `The Lion, The Witch and The\n          Wardrobe' that did very well, I\n          believe.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're\n          talking about?\n\n                    DAVID\n          Well, to us he was just the old\n          codger who taught Medieval\n          literature. But I came to know\n          him very well. We just...got\n          along, do you know what I mean?\n\nEveryone murmurs their comprehension.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Jenny used to love those books.\n\n                    DAVID\n          Gosh. That dates me. He was\n          writing them when I was there.\n\n                    JENNY\n          I'd love to meet him.\n\nThere is a pause.

Jenny is sitting at the dressing\n     table, being made up by Helen. Jenny looks three or four\n     years older, more sophisticated....more like Helen. She\n     can't believe it.

There\n               are millions of places I've never\n               seen because I've been stuck in\n               here.\n\n                         JENNY\n               You never get out?\n\n                         HELEN\n               There's never anywhere to go in\n               the places they stop.\n\n     Jenny looks out of the window. This is self-evidently true.\n\n\n45   INT. PUB. EVENING.                                            45\n\n     Helen and Danny, Jenny and David are standing in a quiet,\n     old-fashioned pub, warming themselves at an open fire.\n\n                                                     49.\n\n\nDavid has a pen in his hand, and he's holding a book - `The\nLion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'.\n\n                    DAVID\n          So. Now.Is he Clive, do you\n          think? Or CS?\n\n                    HELEN\n          I'm confused now. I thought you'd\n          made him up?\n\n                    DANNY\n              (attempting, briefly, to\n               be patient)\n          No, we...Never mind.\n\nDavid walks over to the nearest table and writes in the\nbook.\n\n                    DAVID\n          There.\n\nHe stands up, hands the book to Jenny.\n\n                    JENNY\n              (reads)\n          \"To dear Jenny.

He takes a long drink from his pint of bitter. A\ngroup of students enter, all carrying musical instruments.\nThey stand at the bar, waiting to be served. Jenny stares\nat them with longing - she wants to be one of them. Helen,\nmeanwhile, stares at them as if they were aliens.\n\n                    HELEN\n              (sotto voce)\n          Why are university girls so\n          strange-looking?\n\nHelen's right. The girls in the group are all bespectacled\nand frumpy. The others laugh.\n\n                    HELEN\n          It's true. And they can't all\n          have started off that way, can\n          they? Most girls aren't ugly, but\n          most girl students are. So there\n          must be something about those\n          places that, you know, makes you\n          fat, or spotty, or short-sighted.\n\n                                                     50.\n\n\n\n                    DAVID\n          Well, if you look at it that\n          way...I mean, that's proper\n          scientific analysis. And you\n          can't argue with science.\n\nHelen looks pleased.\n\n                    HELEN\n          I'm still not quite clear on what\n          you want to do when you get here.\n\n                    JENNY\n          I want to read English.\n\n                       HELEN\n          Books?\n\n                       JENNY\n          Sorry?\n\n                    HELEN\n          You want to read English books?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Oh. Yes. Reading English is just\n          another way of saying...\n\n                    DANNY\n          I wouldn't worry, Jenny. You're\n          wasting your breath.\n\n                    DAVID\n          Anyway, tomorrow we'll try to get\n          more of a feel for the place.\n\n                    DANNY\n          Absolutely. This would be a good\n          place to do a little business.\n\nDavid catches Jenny's eye. This isn't what he meant by\n\"getting a feel for the place.\"\n\n                    DANNY\n          All those little old ladies\n          wandering around...I'll bet this\n          place is rife with stats.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Please explain what stats are.\n          You're always going on about\n          them.\n\n                    DAVID\n          All right. Think of a number. Now                 \n          think about the most boring                       \n          lesson you've ever had at school.\n\n                                                          51.\n\n\n               Now double it. Done? Doubled? Now                      \n               multiply it by the number you                          \n               first thought of, and there you                        \n               are. That's the official boredom                       \n               content of stats.                                      \n\n     Jenny laughs.\n\n\n46   INT. B & B BEDROOM. NIGHT                                  46\n\n     A rather grotty and certainly unromantic B&B bedroom - so\n     unromantic, in fact, that it even has the same fusty\n     curtains from Jenny's sitting room. David is in bed, his\n     hands behind his head, waiting for Jenny. As far as we can\n     tell - he's wrapped up in the sheets quite tightly - he's\n     in his underwear. The bedroom is lit unromantically by the\n     40-watt overhead light. Jenny comes into the room wearing\n     one of Helen's nightdresses, a glamorous satiny item quite\n     inappropriate for the occasion or the surroundings. She\n     looks nervous.\n\n                         JENNY\n               We've got exactly the same\n               curtains at home.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Let's not talk about curtains.\n               You look beautiful. You really\n               are a princess.\n\n     Jenny was about to get into bed, but his tone makes her\n     pause at the edge of the bed.\n\n                         JENNY\n               There's something you should\n               know, David. I'm...Well, I'm a\n               virgin. And I want to stay that\n               way until I'm seventeen.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I think that's good. I think\n               that's right. And for your\n               seventeenth birthday I'm going to\n               take you to Paris or Rome or\n               Florence and make you feel like\n               the most beautiful princess in\n               the kingdom of love. But we can\n               still be romantic, can't we?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Well, yes. Of course we can.

I've\n          never met anyone like you. Action\n          is character, our English teacher\n          says.\n\n                    DAVID\n          What does that mean?\n\n                    JENNY\n          I think it means that if we never\n          did anything, we wouldn't be\n          anybody. And I never did anything\n          before I met you. And sometimes I\n          think no-one's ever done anything\n          in this stupid country, apart\n          from you.\n\n                    DAVID\n          That's a good place to end the\n          weekend. I'll give you a tinkle.\n\n                       JENNY\n          Thank you.\n\nThey look at each other. David is clearly smitten. He moves\ntowards her. He wants to kiss her, but he doesn't want to\nfrighten her - in the end, Jenny makes it easy for him and\nmoves towards him. They kiss gently and tenderly.\nFlustered, Jenny breaks it off, gets out of the car and\ngoes inside while David watches.\n\n                                                          58.\n\n\n\n\n55   INT.

When Jenny comes in, Jack beams. He has\n     clearly turned some kind of corner.\n\n                         JACK\n               Here she is!

Look at this,\n               Marjorie.\n\n     He hands it to her. She examines it reverently.\n\n                         MARJORIE\n               \"Clive\"...Lucky girl.

If it's not concerts,\n          it's famous authors. Bit\n          different from that lad you\n          brought home for tea, isn't he?\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          David's a lot older than Graham.\n\n                    JACK\n          Graham could live to be two\n          hundred, and he still wouldn't be\n          swanning around with famous\n          authors. Hasn't got it in him.\n\n                    JENNY\n          He might become a famous author,\n          for all you know.\n\n                     JACK\n          Being one isn't the same as\n          knowing one, is it? Anyone can be\n          one. But if you move in those\n          circles...\n\n                    JENNY\n          What?\n\n                    JACK\n          Well, it says something about\n          you, doesn't it? It says you're\n          going places. It says you're well\n          connected. He's an impressive\n          young man, that David. I like him\n          more and more.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Well, they say opposites attract,\n          don't they? I wouldn't have\n          thought he was your sort.\n\n                    JACK\n          He wasn't.

DAY                                              56\n\n     A group of girls cross-country running. Jenny and her             \n     friends are at the back of the group, and the gym teacher ,       \n     jogging backwards, gesticulates at them to get a move on.         \n\n                         GYM TEACHER                                   \n               Ladies, please.

From somewhere         \n     under a skirt, Jenny produces a packet of exotic-looking\n     cigarettes and offers them around.\n\n                         HATTIE\n               What the hell are those?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Russian Sobranies.\n\n     Hattie and Tina make snooty faces. Jenny takes a cigarette.\n     The others follow suit. Jenny lights them, and they all\n     grimace. The contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes,\n     and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced.\n\n                         HATTIE\n               Where did they come from?\n\n                         TINA\n               She might have bought them from\n               the Savoy, or Claridges, or the\n               opera, or some fancy nightclub.\n               Who knows, with Jenny?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Paris.

Marjorie kicks the door open with her\n     foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen\n     candles burning on it.

Her father and mother both look at her, apparently\n      attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the\n      lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two\n      unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the same\n      size - clearly books.\n\n                          MARJORIE\n                Who'd like a piece?\n\n      In truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising\n      specimen. There isn't enough icing on the top. She cuts a\n      couple of slices which immediately collapse.\n\n                          GRAHAM\n                Never mind.

Did you leave\n                anything in the shop?\n\n      David enters.

But\n          I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle\n          Daniel. They can have your\n          tickets.\n\nJack looks at him.\n\n                    JACK\n          Aunt Helen?

Don't you see? If\n               Aunt Helen's going to be\n               there...\n\n                          DAVID\n                   (the penny apparently\n                    dropping)\n               Of course!\n\n                         JACK\n               I didn't want to put a spoke in\n               anyone's wheels. But if you look\n               at it from my angle...A bachelor,                        \n               taking my daughter off to\n               Paris...\n\n                         DAVID\n               Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought\n               it through properly. I do\n               apologise, Jack. Would you prefer\n               it if Helen took Jenny on her\n               own? I don't mind. I've been to\n               Paris before.\n\n                         JACK\n               Oh, I couldn't possibly ask...No,\n               no. If Aunt Helen's going...\n\n     He smiles broadly. He's off the hook. Jenny catches David's\n     eye and smiles.\n\n\n59   INT. CLASSROOM.

Hattie shows Jenny a piece of paper\n     which apparently contains some kind of shopping list.\n\n                         TINA\n               There are some things you must\n               buy for us, and some things you\n               only have to buy for us if you're\n               a proper, true friend. (She\n               points at Hattie, then at\n               herself.) Chanel perfume, Chanel\n               perfume. (She repeats the\n               gesture) Chanel lipstick, Chanel\n               lipstick. What have I forgotten?\n\n                         HATTIE\n               Those funny cigarettes you were\n               smoking. Sobranies. Ten packets\n               each.\n\n     A very small girl, twelve or thirteen, comes in to the\n     classroom and approaches Jenny.\n\n                                                          69.\n\n\n\n                         SMALL GIRL\n               Are you the girl going to Paris?\n\n     Tina, Hattie and Jenny stare at her.\n\n                         SMALL GIRL\n               Well are you or aren't you?\n               Because I'd like some perfume.\n\n     Miss Stubbs comes into the classroom carrying books and\n     essays. She sees the small girl and shoos her out. She then\n     approaches Jenny and whispers discreetly into her ear.\n\n                         MISS STUBBS\n               Jenny, the headmistress would\n               like a word at the end of the\n               lesson. I'm afraid that the\n               legend of Mr Rochester may have\n               travelled further than you\n               intended.\n\n     Jenny looks at her, startled and a little sick.\n\n\n60   INT.

The headmistress\n     would probably choose to be wood-panelled if she could.\n     She's tweedy, bespectacled, severe. There is a knock at the\n     door. She doesn't look up from her paperwork.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               Come.\n\n     Jenny enters, looking young and frightened.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               Ah. Miss Mellor.\n\n     Jenny tries to look back at her with all the courage she\n     can muster.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               We're all very excited about your\n               forthcoming trip to Paris.

A\n               word of warning, Miss Mellor.\n\n                                                             70.\n\n\n               There may well have been the odd\n               sixth-form girl who has lost an\n               important part of herself -\n               perhaps the best part - while\n               under our supervision. These\n               things happen, regrettably. If,\n               however, we are made aware of\n               this loss, then of course the\n               young lady in question would have\n               to continue her studies\n               elsewhere, if she still has any\n               use for `A'-levels.

He is making\n     little whimpers of excitement, and Jenny is clearly trying\n     hard to hide her nerves. We're acutely aware of her age,\n     and of her virginity.

She looks fantastic in the clothes David has given\n     her for her birthday.\n\n\n65   INT. ART GALLERY. DAY                                      65\n\n     A crowded Left Bank gallery. Jenny is sitting on the floor\n     watching an impossibly handsome young Frenchman paint black\n     the body of an impressively passive naked woman. The young\n     man sitting next to Jenny gives her an appraising look.\n     David, standing at the back and looking square and\n     uncomfortable, notices.\n\n                                                          73.\n\n\n\n\n66   INT.

(For a moment, the\n     sound quality changes - soundtrack becomes source music,\n     seamlessly.) Jenny is studying the sleeve. She wants to hug\n     herself, she's so excited.\n\n\n67   EXT. CAFE. EVENING.                                          67\n\n     A Left Bank cafe - David and Jenny are eating steak frites\n     outside, drinking vin ordinaire, watching the world go by.\n     They are both anticipating the night ahead.\n\n\n68   EXT.

HOTEL ROOM. DAWN                                        70    \n\n     The bedroom is simple and romantic - everything the airport\n     hotel wasn't. David is lying amid rumpled sheets, smoking\n     what is clearly a post-coital cigarette, and watching Jenny\n     from behind.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Do you still feel like a\n               schoolgirl?\n\n     Jenny turns round, smiles, shakes her head.\n\n                         DAVID\n               And it wasn't too uncomfortable?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Not after the...first bit. It's\n               funny, though, isn't it? All that\n               poetry, and all those songs and\n               films, about something that lasts\n               no time at all?\n\n     David looks at her. She isn't being cruel. She just doesn't\n     know any different. She returns to her people-watching. He\n     smokes ruminatively.\n\n                                                          74.\n\n\n\n\n71   EXT. PARK.

Hattie and Tina are\n     examining their bottles of Chanel reverently. Jenny is back\n     to being her seventeen-year-old self; somehow her seventeen-\n     year-old self looks comical, and no longer appropriate.\n\n                         TINA\n               How can you go back to double\n               French when you've had a weekend\n               with an older man in a posh hotel\n               in Paris? You wouldn't catch me\n               coming anywhere near this dump.\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (artfully)\n               It wasn't all glamour.

Your life.\n\n     They smoke their Sobranies ruminatively.\n\n                         TINA\n               You're going to miss it. All the\n               swanning around in posh hotels.\n\n                         JENNY\n               Why will I need to miss it?\n\n                         TINA\n               When you go to Oxford. Unless\n               you're planning on being with\n               David forever.\n\n     Jenny doesn't say anything.\n\n                         HATTIE\n               You're not, are you?\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (distracted)\n               God, no.\n\n                         TINA\n               So? Won't you miss it?\n\n     Jenny shrugs. Clearly she will, and clearly she hasn't\n     thought about it before.\n\n                         HATTIE\n               We'll miss it.\n\n                                                          75.\n\n\n\n     Jenny laughs.\n\n\n72   INT.

You know that. You're\n                clever and you're pretty... But\n                sometimes those things fight. I'm\n                worried that at the moment clever\n                Jenny and pretty Jenny are\n                fighting.\n\n                          JENNY\n                What do you mean?\n\n                          MISS STUBBS\n                I couldn't bear it if clever\n                Jenny lost. It's because of\n                people like you that I plough\n                through illiterate essays by\n                Sandra Lovell about her pony. And\n                there aren't many of you, I can\n                tell you. One every few years. Is\n                your boyfriend interested in\n                clever Jenny?\n\n                          JENNY\n                I think so.\n\n                          MISS STUBBS\n                Interested enough to let her do\n                what she wants?\n\n                          JENNY\n                He couldn't stop me.\n\n                          MISS STUBBS\n                He might not have to stop you.\n                That's what I'm trying to tell\n                you.\n\n                                              76.\n\n\n\n                    JENNY\n              (frustrated)\n          I'm not sure what you're trying\n          to tell me.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          I'm telling you to go to Oxford.\n          No matter what.

These last few months, I've\n          been to Paris, and to jazz clubs,\n          and I've eaten in wonderful\n          restaurants, and seen wonderful\n          films, heard beautiful music...\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          I'm sure you have. But I was\n          filled up with beautiful things,\n          books and music and conversation,\n          in exactly the same way at\n          Cambridge. And I didn't have to\n          pay the same sort of price. Are\n          you taking precautions, Jenny?\n\nJenny stares at her angrily.\n\n                    JENNY\n          It's nothing to do with that.\n\n                                                          77.\n\n\n\n                            MISS STUBBS\n               Isn't it?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Maybe our lives are always going\n               to end up with pony essays. Or\n               housework. And yes, maybe we'll\n               go up to Oxford. But if we're all\n               going to die the moment we\n               graduate, maybe it's what we do\n               before that counts.\n\n                         MISS STUBBS\n               I'm sorry you think I'm dead.\n\n                         JENNY\n               I don't think you're dead.

The club is a smoky West End club, full of            \n     smartly-dressed and dubious-looking men, and young,\n     glamorous, dubious-looking women. Jenny and Helen look out\n     of place - Helen too ethereal, Jenny too innocent. There is\n     jazz playing.\n\n                         DANNY\n               There he is.\n\n     We see a nasty-looking man in his late 30s/early 40s. He is\n     wearing a white sharksin suit and smoking a big cigar. He's\n     standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastier-\n     looking man in a dark suit.\n\n     They find a table at the back and sit down. A waitress\n     comes over to their table.\n\n                         DAVID\n               A bottle of champagne, please.\n\n                         DANNY\n               Oh-ho.

Danny nudges David, and\n     they go over to talk to him just as the champagne arrives.\n     The waiter pops the bottle of champagne and pours two\n     glasses. The girls smile and clink glasses.\n\n                         HELEN\n               Don't worry.\n\n                         JENNY\n               About what?\n\n                         HELEN\n               Someone told me that in fifty\n               years no-one will speak Latin,\n               probably.

Danny puffs out his cheeks and shakes         \n     his head.                                                         \n\n                         DANNY\n               Well, I'm not sure you'd want him                       \n               to marry your sister. I'm not                           \n               even sure you'd want to talk to                         \n               him in a night-club, come to                            \n               that.                                                   \n\n     They both chuckle. There is a silence for a moment.\n\n                         DANNY\n                   (gently)\n               You do know what you're doing,\n               old chap? With Jenny?\n\n                         DAVID\n               This is the one, Danny.\n\n                         DANNY\n               We've heard that before.\n\n                         DAVID\n               You can see she's different.\n               She's got everything. You've got\n               Helen, and....\n\n                                                          80.\n\n\n\n                         DANNY\n                   (drily)\n               And you've got Helen with brains.\n\n                            DAVID\n                      (rumbled)\n               Yes.\n\n                         DANNY\n               I don't want to see her hurt.\n\n     They make their way back to their table.\n\n\n76   INT. CLUB. NIGHT                                            76\n\n     While David and Helen watch, Danny and Jenny dance. Danny's\n     a good dancer; Jenny is nervous at first, but becomes more\n     comfortable and more expressive, with Danny's help.\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (knowing that she should\n                    make conversation, as\n                    all the couples around\n                    her are doing)\n               Have you...Have you bought any\n               more paintings recently?\n\n                         DANNY\n               Have I? Let's think? Oh, I picked\n               up a little Piper the other day.\n               A good `un, I think.\n\n                         JENNY\n               I'm still trying to work out what\n               makes good things good. It's\n               hard, isn't it?\n\n                         DANNY\n               The thing is, Jenny, you know,\n               without necessarily being able to\n               explain why. You've got taste.\n               That's not even half the\n               battle. That's the whole war.\n\n     Jenny smiles at him with gratitude. There is a sudden\n     closeness between them. David is watching them carefully.\n     They return to their table.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Jenny, we should go. It's late.\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (disappointed)\n               Oh. Yes.\n\n                                                           81.\n\n\n\n                         DANNY\n               Alas. One day, school will be\n               over forever, and we can talk\n               about art all night.\n\n                         DAVID\n                   (to Danny)\n               You're all right in a taxi,\n               aren't you?\n\n     He guides Jenny firmly out of the club.\n\n\n77   EXT. CLUB. NIGHT.                                           77\n\n     Jenny is about to to open the passenger door of the\n     Bristol, but David stops her.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Wait there.\n\n     He runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts\n     rummaging through it. It seems to be full of everything\n     but the thing he's looking for.\n\n                         JENNY\n               What are you doing?\n\n     He slams the boot shut and comes back empty-handed.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Will you marry me?\n\n     Jenny stares at him for a moment, then laughs.\n\n                         JENNY\n               What were you looking for?\n\n                         DAVID\n               I thought I had a ring. It\n               wouldn't have been the right one.\n               But it would have done for\n               tonight.\n\n                          JENNY\n                   (eyes twinkling with\n                    amusement)\n               Oh, David.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I'm serious.\n\n                         JENNY\n               You're very sweet.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What do you think?\n\n                                                          82.\n\n\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (helplessly)\n               Please take me home.\n\n     She gets into the car. We see the desperation in David's\n     face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slams\n     the door on Jenny after she's got in.\n\n\n78   EXT. SCHOOL YARD. DAY                                        78    \n\n     Jenny, Tina and Hattie all smoking in the school toilets.\n     Jenny is distracted, and standing apart from the others.\n     Tina looks at her.\n\n                         TINA\n               How do you say `A penny for your\n               thoughts?' in French?\n\n                         HATTIE\n               A franc is too much, isn't it?\n\n                         TINA\n               For her thoughts, yes. You'd be\n               overpaying by about ninety-nine\n               centimes.\n\n     Suddenly the door bursts open and the Latin teacher comes\n     in.\n\n\n79   INT. HEAD'S OFFICE. DAY                                      79\n\n     The three girls are lined up in front of the headmistress,\n     hands by their sides.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               I'm surprised that you two are\n               standing in front of me. I'm not\n               surprised to find you here, Miss\n               Mellor, though I do feel rather\n               like the judge who sent Al Capone\n               to prison for tax evasion. We\n               take a very dim view of smoking.\n               We take an even dimmer view of\n               some of your other behaviour,\n               which as far as we know has taken\n               place off school premises. Your\n               appearance here today, however,\n               allows me to remind you that we\n               are trying to teach you how to\n               become young ladies, not\n               nightclub hostesses. In reality,\n               of course, you are neither. You\n               are merely silly little girls.\n               Detention after school. Go away.\n\n                                                             83.\n\n\n\n      Jenny's face sets hard. Something in her shuts down.\n\n\n80    EXT. JENNY'S BALCONY. EVENING                                80     \n\n      Jenny is smoking on the balcony.                                    \n\n\n80A   INT. JENNY'S BEDROOM.                                        80A    \n\n      Jenny is at her desk in her bedroom, trying to work, but\n      she can't concentrate. Her hair is tied back in a pony-\n      tail. She gets up, pulls back the curtains, looks out of\n      the window. We see what she sees: a sleepy suburban street\n      at night. She looks back at her desk. It looks even more\n      boring than the street. She looks at her scrubbed seventeen-\n      year-old face in the mirror - so much younger than the\n      Jenny we have seen with David. She makes herself up, and\n      she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes. In her           \n      make-up and her school uniform, she's half-woman, half-\n      child. We hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen: the\n      radio, the washing-up, occasional muffled conversation.\n      Jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs.\n\n\n81    INT. KITCHEN. EVENING                                        81\n\n      Jenny's mother and father are doing the washing up and\n      listening to the radio. They have their backs to the door.\n      Jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment\n\n                          MAN ON THE RADIO\n                They do need some looking after,\n                but nothing that will require too\n                much work. Just leave them in\n                your potting shed for a couple of\n                weeks, and they'll look after\n                themselves.\n\n                          JACK\n                Oh, aye. The potting shed. Who\n                does he think I am? Prince\n                Rainier of Monaco?\n\n                          JENNY\n                What if I got married instead of\n                going to college?\n\n      Jack and Marjorie turn around and stare at this strange\n      apparition wearing too much make-up and a school uniform.\n\n                           JACK\n                Married?\n\n                           JENNY\n                Married.\n\n                                                     84.\n\n\n\n                    JACK\n          It would depend who it was,\n          surely?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Would it? That's interesting.\n\n                    JACK\n          Course it would. I wouldn't want\n          you married off just for the\n          sake of it.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Thanks.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Has somebody asked you?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Yes.\n\n                    JACK\n          Who?\n\nMarjorie rolls her eyes.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          What did you tell him?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Nothing yet.\n\n                    JACK\n          David?\n\n                    JENNY\n          No. A man I just met walking his\n          dog.\n\n                    JACK\n          David's asked you to marry him?\n          Bloody hell. Pardon my French.\n\n                    MARJORIE\n          Do you have any choice? Or is it\n          too late.\n\nShe looks at her daughter knowingly. Jack merely looks\nconfused.\n\n                    JACK\n          Of course she's got a choice. But\n          it's an interesting one, isn't\n          it?\n\n                                                            85.\n\n\n\n                         JENNY\n               This is where you're supposed to\n               say, \"But what about Oxford?\"\n\n                         JACK\n               Well. Looked at it one way, you\n               wouldn't really need to go now,\n               would you? He's a man going\n               places. And say what you like,\n               but they know how to take care of\n               their money, don't they? He'll\n               see you're looked after.\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (quietly, turning the\n                    words over in her\n                    mouth)\n               I wouldn't need to go. Would you\n               like to expand on that?\n\n                         JACK\n               You know what I mean.\n\n     Jenny laughs bitterly. She can't believe it.\n\n                         JENNY\n               All that Latin! All those essays!\n               What was the point? Why didn't\n               you just send me out prowling\n               round nightclubs? It would have\n               been less trouble. And I might\n               have had more fun.\n\n                         JACK\n               We don't know about nightclubs.\n               We knew about education. Anyway,\n               it all turned out for the best.\n\n                           JENNY\n               How?\n\n                         JACK\n               He wouldn't have wanted you if\n               you were thick, would he?\n\n     Jenny stares at them and walks out.\n\n\n82   INT.

Miss Stubbs is standing at the front   of the class,\n     holding a copy of King Lear, and listening as   various\n     members of the class massacre the text. Some    are messing\n     about by overacting; others read to the best     of their\n     ability, tonelessly and with no understanding   of the words.\n\n                                                       86.\n\n\nLear himself is being read by Ann, the bespectacled girl      \nfrom the first scene. She's no King Lear, and she's one of\nthe bad readers.\n\n                    GIRL 1\n          May not an ass know when the cart\n          draws the horse?

Ha!\n          Waking? Tis not so. Who is it\n          that can tell me who I am?\n\nJenny's arm shoots up, as if to answer the question.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Ooh. Miss. Me. I can.\n\nMiss Stubbs looks at Jenny more in sorrow than in anger -\nJenny's behaviour now is something new in their\nrelationship. Jenny stares back at her defiantly. Suddenly\nMiss Stubbs notices something glinting on her hand: an\nengagement ring.\n\n                                                       87.\n\n\n\n                       MISS STUBBS\n          Oh, Jenny.\n\nShe is, as she promised she would be, heartbroken.\n\n                       JENNY\n          What?\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          Take it off.\n\nHattie, who is sitting behind Jenny, notices the ring, too,\nfor the first time.\n\n                    HATTIE\n          Oh my God. Is that really what I\n          think it is? I'M GOING TO BE A\n          BRIDESMAID!\n\nThere is an excited susurration in the classroom.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          You know there's a school rule\n          about jewelry.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Half the girls in this room are\n          wearing jewelry.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          Yes. But none of it is going to\n          ruin their lives.\n\n                    JENNY\n              (coolly)\n          We have a difference of opinion\n          on that.\n\nMiss Stubbs stares at her. Jenny can only just steel\nherself to stare back.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          Let's see who's right. Come with\n          me.\n\nJenny doesn't move.\n\n                    MISS STUBBS\n          Please don't make me drag you out\n          like a child.\n\nJenny gets to her feet. Teacher and pupil leave the room,\nwhile the rest of the class watches.\n\n                                                    88.\n\n\n\n\n83   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY                      83\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               How far advanced are these\n               ridiculous plans? Have you set a\n               date? Have you decided on a\n               church?\n\n                         JENNY\n               We won't be getting married in a\n               church. David's Jewish.\n\n     The headmistress stares at her, dumbfounded.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               Jewish? He's a Jew? You're aware,\n               I take it, that the Jews killed\n               our Lord?\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (beginning to feel less\n                    intimidated by her\n                    surroundings)\n               And you're aware, I suppose, that\n               our Lord was Jewish?\n\n     The headmistress snorts scornfully\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               I suppose he told you that. We're\n               all very sorry about what\n               happened in the War. But there's\n               no excuse for that sort of\n               malicious and untruthful\n               propaganda.\n\n     Jenny smiles to herself.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               Anyway, I can now see that you\n               are even more in need of\n               responsible advice than I\n               realised. Is it true that you\n               don't intend to sit for your\n               exams? And therefore you won't be\n               applying for University?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Yes, that's right.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               What do you think you're doing?\n\n                         JENNY\n               Nobody has been able to explain\n               to me the point of University.\n\n                                                     89.\n\n\n          Therefore I don't see the point\n          of the exams, either.\n\n                    HEADMISTRESS\n          Nobody does anything worth doing\n          without a degree.\n\n                    JENNY\n          And nobody does anything worth\n          doing with one, either. No woman,\n          anyway.\n\n                    HEADMISTRESS\n          So what I do isn't worth doing.\n          Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs\n          Wilson, or any of us here.\n\nJenny doesn't say anything. The headmistress takes her\nsilence as an admission of defeat.\n\n                    HEADMISTRESS\n          Because none of us would be here\n          without our degrees, you realise\n          that, don't you? And yes, of\n          course studying is hard, and\n          boring, and...\n\nJenny can't contain herself any longer.\n\n                       JENNY\n          Boring!\n\n                       HEADMISTRESS\n          I'm sorry?\n\n                    JENNY\n          Studying is hard and boring.\n          Teaching is hard and boring. So\n          you're telling me to be bored,\n          and then bored, and then finally\n          bored again, this time for the\n          rest of my life. This whole\n          stupid country is bored. There's\n          no life in it, or colour in it,\n          or fun in it. It's probably just\n          as well that the Russians are\n          going to drop a nuclear bomb on\n          us any day now. So my choice is\n          either to do something hard and\n          boring, OR to marry my... my Jew,\n          and go to Paris and Rome and\n          listen to jazz and read and eat\n          good food in nice restaurants and\n          have fun. It's not enough to\n          educate us any more, Mrs Walters.\n          You've got to tell us why you're\n          doing it.\n\n                                                          90.\n\n\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               Because without formal\n               qualifications...\n\n     She grinds to a halt. She has never had to answer this\n     question before.\n\n                         HEADMISTRESS\n               It doesn't have to be teaching,\n               you know. There's the Civil\n               Service.\n\n     Jenny stands up.\n\n                         JENNY\n               I don't wish to be impertinent,\n               Mrs Walters. But it is an\n               argument worth rehearsing. You\n               never know. Someone else might\n               want to know what the point of it\n               all is, one day.\n\n     She leaves the office.\n\n\n84   EXT. SCHOOL. DAY                                            84\n\n     Jenny is half-walking, half-running, towards the school\n     gates. She's scared, of course, but exhilarated, too. All\n     that pressure, and all those years of education, suddenly\n     over, unexpectedly, and certainly unceremoniously. She\n     looks neither left nor right, but other girls, younger\n     girls, watch her through the windows as she leaves. Jenny\n     doesn't even look round when she goes through the school\n     gates.\n\n\n85   INT. KITCHEN. EVENING                                       85\n\n     Later. Jenny and Marjorie are sitting at the kitchen table.\n     Jack is standing over them; he hasn't even taken his coat\n     off, or put his briefcase down.\n\n                         JACK\n               How d'you mean, left?\n\n     Jenny doesn't answer.\n\n                         JACK\n               What about your exams?\n\n                         JENNY\n               I'm not sitting them.\n\n                         JACK\n               What are we going to tell people?\n\n                                                          91.\n\n\n\n                         JENNY\n                   (witheringly)\n               Oh, telling people. I'd forgotten\n               that what we tell people is more\n               important than anything.\n\n                         JACK\n               All that...\n\n     Marjorie knows what he's going to say, and doesn't want him\n     to.\n\n                         MARJORIE\n               Jack!\n\n                         JACK\n               No. No need for Jack. She should\n               hear it. All that money! Do you\n               know how much it's cost me for\n               you to go through school and take\n               no exams?\n\n                         JENNY\n               I'm sure David will pay you back.\n               Send him a bill. As you said, he\n               wouldn't have wanted me if I was\n               dim, so he should fork out. Just\n               tell me why there's a point in\n               sitting my exams, and there's no\n               point in me going to University.\n\n     Jack gapes at her. He's floundering.\n\n                         JACK\n               You know what your trouble is,\n               don't you? You're too clever by\n               half.\n\n                         JENNY\n               In which case I should have left\n               school years ago, shouldn't I?\n               Ask them for the money back. If\n               I'm too clever by half, you\n               overpaid by a third.\n\n\n86   INT. DANNY'S FLAT.

DAY                                   87A    \n\n      Jenny is making David a cup of tea. Her mother is keeping          \n      an eye on Jenny - in Marjorie's mind at least, this is a           \n      rehearsal for something.                                           \n\n                          DAVID                                          \n                I haven't put my...my stamp on it                        \n                yet.

Or would he\n               feel insulted?\n\n     Jenny watches David as he dials the number. He notices her,\n     waves, puts the money in the slot.\n\n                         JACK\n               He'd feel insulted, probably. He\n               said tonight was his treat. That\n               must include the petrol, for\n               God's sakes?\n\n     David starts to talk, and turns away, as if he's frightened\n     that someone in the car can lip-read.\n\n                         JACK\n               What do you think?\n\n     Nobody pays him any attention. They lapse into silence.\n     Jack starts to fiddle with the features in the car - a\n     table springs down from the seat in front of him, much to\n     his alarm.\n\n                         JACK\n               God almighty.

She finds the\n     cigarettes, and closes the glove compartment. But she has\n     seen something in there, so she opens it again. She takes\n     out some letters and papers and starts to look through\n     them.\n\n\n98   EXT. GARAGE.

He sees Jenny looking through letters and papers,\n     sees the open glove compartment, starts to run across the\n     forecourt.\n\n                         DAVID\n                   (desperately)\n               Jenny!\n\n     It's too late.

David swings the car\n      around and they drive home in silence; Jenny cries\n      constantly, without making a sound.\n\n\n100   EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                  100\n\n      The Bristol draws up outside Jenny's house. David jumps out\n      of the car and lets Marjorie and Jack out. Jack starts to\n      walk towards the house and then stops.\n\n                          JACK\n                    (desperately)\n                You can sort this out, can't you,\n                David?\n\n      Jenny gets out of the car too.\n\n                           DAVID\n                Of course I can. She's just got\n                the wrong end of the stick about\n                something.\n\n                          JENNY\n                Go inside, Dad.\n\n      Jenny and David watch Jack and Marjorie go into the house.\n      The moment the door is closed, Jenny walks towards David.\n      She's holding a bunch of letters that she took out of the\n      glove compartment. She starts to throw them at him, one by\n      one.\n\n                          JENNY\n                Mr and Mrs David Goldman, Mr and                        \n                Mrs David Goldman, Mr and Mrs                           \n                David Goldman, Mr and Mrs David                         \n                Goldman..                                               \n\n      When she has thrown the last one, she flies at David - she\n      slaps him, punches him, scratches him. David tries to grab\n      her hands, but she's too wild.\n\n                          DAVID\n                Just let me...\n\n                          JENNY\n                You're MARRIED!\n\n                          DAVID\n                Legally, yes, but...\n\n      Finally he manages to subdue her. She leans against the\n      car, distraught.\n\n                          JENNY\n                When were you going to tell me?\n\n                                                    102.\n\n\n\n                    DAVID\n          Soon. It just - it never seemed\n          the right time. You seemed so\n          happy, and I was happy, and...It\n          would have spoiled everything.\n          What can I do, Minnie?

I\n          didn't take my exams. Where's it\n          all gone, now? I gave my life\n          away.                                                \n\n                    DAVID\n          Jenny, I can get a divorce.\n          Everything will turn out for   the\n          best. You'll see.\n\nWe can see Jack and Marjorie peering through the lace\ncurtains anxiously.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Go and tell them. Go and tell\n          them, then go and tell your wife.\n          I want to see you. I want to\n          stand there and watch.\n\nDavid stands on the pavement, looking towards the house. He\nlooks away; he can't make eye contact with Jenny's parents.\n\n                    DAVID\n          They're not going to listen to me\n          now. Let me come round tomorrow.\n          When everyone's calmed down a\n          bit.\n\n                    JENNY\n              (suddenly desperate)\n          Please don't leave me to tell\n          them on my own.

They gave\n          me you.\n\nHe opens the boot. It's full of cases of whiskey. Jenny\ndoesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. David\ntakes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Two minutes. And then I'll come\n          out and drag you in.\n\n                                                          104.\n\n\n\n      Jenny marches into the house and slams the door. The camera\n      stays on David. He gets back into the car and takes\n      another slug of whiskey. Then his shoulders begin to\n      shake, and he cries and cries.\n\n\n101   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. NIGHT                                   101\n\n      Jenny comes in, leaving the door open for David. Her\n      parents are standing in the sitting room, looking at her\n      anxiously. Their coats are still on, and they haven't put\n      the lights on yet.\n\n                          JACK\n                What's going on?\n\n                          JENNY\n                He's helping himself to some\n                Dutch courage before facing you.\n                Stolen Dutch courage, from the\n                look of it. He has something to\n                tell you.\n\n      She stands, pale and young-looking again, opposite her\n      parents. Suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights.\n      Shot from their POV of the Bristol roaring off up the\n      street.\n\n                          JACK\n                He just drove off.\n\n      We close slowly in on Jenny's face. But of course he'd\n      drive off!\n\n                          JACK\n                    (pathetic)\n                Can you tell us? Please? Jenny?\n\n      Jenny can't deal with her own pain, let alone his. He\n      already looks like a broken, foolish old man. They should\n      hug. But they don't.\n\n\n102   EXT. STREET/DAVID'S HOUSE. DAY                              102    \n\n      A suburban street, full of semi-detached houses, not far\n      from Jenny's house. Jenny walks down the road tentatively -\n      she's looking at the numbers on the houses. She looks young\n      again - tired, no make-up, no elegant clothes. She can't\n      bring herself to wear anything that David bought her.\n\n      She hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house,\n      steels herself to walk down. But just at that moment the\n      door opens; there's a homely-looking woman, early 30s. She\n      is holding the hand of a three-year-old. Jenny is stunned.\n      But there's more to come.\n\n                                                    105.\n\n\nThe woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into\nthe house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. David\nhas found time to father another baby.\n\n                       WIFE\n          Oh. Hello.\n\n                    JENNY\n              (almost inaudible)\n          Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must\n          have the wrong house.\n\nThe woman stares at her.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Yes. I wanted number...It's my\n          cello lesson. Silly. I...\n\nShe dries up and looks at the woman helplessly.\n\n                    WIFE\n          Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God.\n          You're a child.\n\nJenny blushes. Beat. She turns and tries to walk back up\nthe driveway, but the woman won't let her go.\n\n                    WIFE\n          No. No. You stay here. If you're\n          old enough to sleep with him,\n          you're old enough to look at me.\n\n                       JENNY\n          I can't.\n\nBut she doesn't move, either.\n\n                    WIFE\n          You didn't know about any of\n          this. Presumably.\n\nJenny shakes her head.\n\n                    WIFE\n          No. They never do. Did he ask you\n          to marry him?\n\nJenny nods.\n\n                    WIFE\n          Yes. Of course he did. You're not\n          in the family way, are you?\n          Because that's happened before.\n\nJenny shakes her head.\n\n                                                          106.\n\n\n\n                          WIFE\n                Thank God for that. At least you\n                can escape intact. (Beat)\n                Relatively speaking. Not all of\n                them have done.\n\n      She nods at the children.\n\n                          WIFE\n                That's why he never goes through\n                with anything. He does love them.\n\n                          JENNY\n                    (looking into the pram)\n                She's beautiful.\n\n                          WIFE\n                Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's\n                four months old.\n\n      Jenny does the maths. It's all she can do to stop herself\n      from reeling backwards - she's visibly shaken.\n\n                          JENNY\n                Four months!\n\n                          WIFE\n                Yes. Babies often are that sort\n                of age. Perhaps you can remember\n                a night four months ago when he\n                seemed a little distracted.\n                Anyway. If you'll excuse us.\n\n      She pushes past Jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the\n      path.\n\n\n103   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. DAY                                     103\n\n      Marjorie and Jack are in the kitchen. Marjorie is sipping\n      tea, shoulders hunched, defeated. Jack is pacing around the\n      room, furious. Normal life has clearly been suspended\n      during this crisis. Jenny walks in.\n\n                          MARJORIE\n                Did you see her?\n\n                          JENNY\n                I saw her. I didn't talk to her.\n                There wasn't any need.\n\n                          JACK\n                Well we've got to have this out.\n                If you won't do it, I will.\n\n      He starts for the door.\n\n                                                          107.\n\n\n\n                          JENNY\n                    (contemptuously)\n                Sit down.\n\n                          JACK\n                I beg your pardon? I'm still your\n                father, Jenny.\n\n                          JENNY\n                Oh, you're my father again, are\n                you? What were you when you\n                encouraged me to throw my life\n                away? I'm a silly schoolgirl.\n                Was, anyway. Silly schoolgirls\n                are always being seduced by\n                glamorous older men. But what\n                about you two?\n\n                          JACK\n                We didn't...\n\n      He gives up hopelessly. Marjorie says nothing.\n\n                          JENNY\n                And now I've got nothing.\n                I'm...I'm broken.\n\n      Jack looks at her.\n\n                          JACK\n                That doesn't mean....what I think\n                it means, does it? It can't.\n\n                          JENNY\n                What are you talking about?\n\n                          JACK\n                Just tell me that you\n                didn't...you haven't, you\n                know...You didn't....                                   \n\n      Jenny looks at him in disbelief.\n\n                          MARJORIE\n                    (to Jack)\n                I wondered how stupid you were.\n                Now I know.\n\n\n104   INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                                  104    \n\n      Jack stands outside Jenny's bedroom door with a cup of tea.\n      He knocks tentatively.\n\n                                                             108.\n\n\n\n\n105   INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT                                           105\n\n      Close-up of the floaty print dress that Helen gave her. The\n      dress is suddenly jerked out of shot, and we pull back to\n      reveal a weeping Jenny stuffing it violently into an\n      already full box of things she is throwing out. The\n      contents represent her now-despised, David-created adult\n      self. We can see Juliette Greco albums, photos, expensive-\n      looking jewelry boxes. She continues to stuff things into\n      the box. There's a knock on the door.\n\n                            JACK (O.S.)\n                Jenny.\n\n      She continue to put her David-life away into bags. She\n      ignores him.\n\n\n106   INT. UPPER HALLWAY. NIGHT                                     106    \n\n      Jack is almost in tears.\n\n                          JACK\n                There's a cup of tea for you\n                here.\n\n      No answer. He puts the tea on the floor, and sits down next\n      to it.\n\n                          JACK\n                I know I made a mess of\n                everything.\n\n      He waits for an answer - nothing.\n\n                          JACK\n                All my life I've been scared, and\n                I didn't want you to be scared.\n                That's why I wanted you to go to\n                Oxford. So that if someone asked\n                you out to a nice restaurant, you\n                wouldn't panic about what was a\n                starter and what was a main\n                course. And then David came\n                along, and he had money, and he\n                knew famous writers, and he knew\n                how to get to classical music                              \n                concerts. But he wasn't who he                             \n                said he was. He wasn't who you\n                said he was, either.\n\n\n107   INT. BEDROOM.

And I said to Marjorie,\n                 Well, they've got that wrong,\n                 because how would our Jenny get\n                 her book signed, if he wasn't in\n                 Oxford?\n\n\n109    INT.

She knows he's right.\n\n                           JACK (O.S.)\n                 Jenny, I'm sorry.\n\n\n109A   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                  109A      \n\n       Jenny is sitting on the sofa in Danny's flat. Danny and           \n       Helen are in dressing gowns; there are newspapers strewn          \n       around. Danny pours her a brandy. Helen is sitting next to        \n       her, holding her hand.                                            \n\n                           HELEN                                         \n                 I don't really understand what                          \n                 difference it makes. When I found                       \n                 out that...                                             \n\n                           DANNY                                         \n                 Helen!

You both watched me...                         \n                 carrying on with a married man,                         \n                 but you don't think it's worth                          \n                 saying anything.                                        \n\n                                                          110.\n\n\n\n                          DANNY                                         \n                Ah, well if you want that sort of                       \n                conversation...You watched David                        \n                and I help ourselves to a map,                          \n                and you didn't say much, either.                        \n\n      He holds Jenny's gaze. She looks away.                            \n\n\n110   INT. HEADMISTRESS'S OFFICE. DAY                            110    \n\n      Jenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting; it\n      completes a circle. She's back where she started from, or\n      would like to be, anyway. If she seems older than she did\n      when we first met her, it's because things have happened to\n      her, and they've left a mark on her face. She's worried and\n      tired. The headmistress, meanwhile, is delighted by her\n      return - but only because of the opportunities for smugness\n      and schadenfreude it provides.\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                So. Your Jewish friend turned out\n                to be married already, I\n                understand. How unfortunate.\n\n      Jenny doesn't say anything. She has clearly decided to\n      swallow anything she has to.\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                Anyway. How do you think we can\n                help?\n\n                          JENNY\n                I'd like to repeat my last year\n                at school. Start all over again.\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                I got the impression the last\n                time we spoke that you didn't see\n                the point of school. Or of me, or\n                of any of us here.\n\n                          JENNY\n                I know. I was stupid.\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                So what is the point?\n\n                          JENNY\n                I know that I need to go to\n                university.\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                And what happens if some other\n                chap wants to marry you during\n                your studies next year?\n\n                                                          111.\n\n\n\n                          JENNY\n                    (laughing bitterly)\n                Some other chap? There won't be\n                any other chaps. Not for a long,\n                long time, anyway.\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                I'm afraid I think you're the\n                sort of young lady who attracts\n                chaps whether she wants to or\n                not. No,I think the offer of a\n                place at this school would be\n                wasted on you. You showed how\n                little you valued us only weeks\n                ago. And I must confess that it\n                gives me a sort of grim\n                satisfaction to return the\n                sentiment now.\n\n                          JENNY\n                    (bitterly)\n                Is it really so grim, your\n                satisfaction?\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                It gives me no pleasure to see\n                our schoolgirls throw their lives\n                away. Although, of course, you're\n                not one of our schoolgirls any\n                more. Through your own volition.\n\n                          JENNY\n                I suppose you think I'm a ruined\n                woman.\n\n                          HEADMISTRESS\n                Oh, you're not a woman.\n\n      Beat. Jenny stands up and leaves without saying a word. The\n      headmistress is pleased with her final line.\n\n\n111   INT. BEDROOM.

She has\n      become ageless, genderless - her life is now monastic.\n\n\n112   EXT. PARK.

Who'd have thought there'd\n                be a down side to all that? I\n                could tell you all about the\n                imagery in Jane Eyre. But I\n                couldn't see that a man who stole\n                maps from old ladies might be a\n                liar.\n\n      They look at her.

STREET MISS STUBBS FLAT. DUSK.                         114    \n\n      Jenny in a suburban street. She's looking for an address.\n      She finds the house, walks down the path, rings on a bell.\n      Miss Stubbs comes to the door.\n\n                            MISS STUBBS\n                Jenny!\n\n      It's a warm greeting. She ushers her inside.\n\n\n115   INT. MISS STUBBS' FLAT. DUSK.                               115\n\n      It's a proper Bohemian flat, up in the eaves. There are\n      books and papers and paintings covering every available\n      surface. Jenny looks around. Finally, for the first time,\n      we see her in somewhere she can feel at home.\n\n                          JENNY\n                This is lovely.\n\n      Miss Stubbs makes a face.\n\n                          JENNY\n                But it is. Really. I'd love to\n                live somewhere like this.\n\n      Miss Stubbs laughs.\n\n                          MISS STUBBS\n                Oh, it's not hard. Go to Oxford\n                and become a teacher and this is\n                what you end up with.\n\n                          JENNY\n                But all these books and\n                pictures....\n\n                           MISS STUBBS\n                Penguin paperbacks.

Do you like him?\n\n      Jenny pauses.\n\n                          JENNY\n                Yes. I do. Still.\n\n                          MISS STUBBS\n                Still? Gosh, you sound very old\n                and wise.\n\n                           JENNY\n                    (heartfelt)\n                I feel old. But really not very\n                wise. Miss Stubbs, I'm....I need\n                your help.\n\n                          MISS STUBBS\n                I was so hoping that's what you\n                were going to say.\n\n\n116   EXT. STREET IN OXFORD. DAY                                 116\n\n      Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on        \n      Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her\n      precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling\n      through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her\n      for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and\n      leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave\n      it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:\n      it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road\n      just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she\n      can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a           \n      littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of           \n      cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her,           \n      stops, then walks towards her.\n\n                                                    115.\n\n\n\n                      DAVID\n          Jenny.\n\nJenny says nothing.\n\n                    DAVID\n          Jenny. Minnie. I wanted to tell\n          you that I am going to ask my\n          wife for a divorce.\n\nJenny looks at him disbelievingly.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Don't you understand what you've\n          done?\n\nDavid looks at her. This isn't going to be as easy as he\nthought.\n\n                    DAVID\n          I can see my behaviour must have\n          been... confusing. But we've\n          never sat down and had a proper\n          chat about it all. About the whys\n          and wherefores. They can wait.\n          The important thing is that\n          you're still my Minnie Mouse, and\n          I love you, and you had fun. You\n          know you had fun.\n\n                    JENNY\n          Yes. I had fun. But I had fun\n          with the wrong person, at all the                    \n          wrong times. And I can't ever get\n          those times back, now.(Beat)                         \n          Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every                    \n          day I wake up and pinch myself.\n          And when I think how close I                         \n          came...                                              \n\nShe looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a\ndream. A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts,\nleans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her\nto finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man\noffers her his arm. They walk away together, and David\nstares longingly after them.\n\n\n\n                      THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Education\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Nick Hornby\u00a0\u00a0Lynn Barber\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:22.582129"}
