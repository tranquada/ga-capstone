We see         \n     girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962:        \n     walking with books on their heads, practising their                \n     handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with          \n     each other.                                                        \n\n<b>1A   INT.

Some of these girls seem to be\n     daydreaming - looking out of the window, examining their\n     fingernails. A couple, including a bespectacled girl who           \n     looks five years younger than everyone else in the class,\n     write down everything the teacher says. Only one, JENNY,\n     beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit\n     in which Miss Stubbs would like her to listen. She's\n     smiling, eyes shining - she loves Miss Stubbs, and these\n     lessons. Miss Stubbs asks a question, and Jenny puts up her        \n     hand - the only one in the class to do so.                         \n\n<b>                         MISS STUBBS                                    \n</b>                   (mock-sighing)                                       \n               Jenny.

Books about ponies, a much loved teddy\n     bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the\n     wall.\n\n     Jenny is bent over a small desk. Victorian novels, Latin\n     primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side\n     of her. She stands and stretches as she turns to us.\n\n     She kneels and flicks through her half-dozen or so LPs on\n     the floor near a cheap record player - they're all\n     classical, mostly by Elgar, apart from a Juliette Greco\n     record. This is the one she chooses. As the music begins,\n     she sings along.\n\n     Immediately there is a thumping noise - someone underneath\n     her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.\n\n<b>                         MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>               I don't want to hear any French\n               singing.

She turns\n    the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her\n    head right next to the Dansette to hear it.\n\n    Close on Jenny as she silently mouths the words along with\n    the almost inaudible track.\n\n\n<b>3   INT.

The food is grey and brown, in keeping with the\n    colour scheme of the house. They aren't talking - they're\n    listening to Mantovani on the radio.

Everyone is\n    getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving.\n    Along the row from Jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice-\n    looking boy of her age, GRAHAM, and she waves at him. Two\n    13 year old boys sitting between them wave too,\n    parodically, and then blow kisses, much to Graham's\n    embarrassment and Jenny's fury.\n\n    The silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly\n    one of the funniest moments of their lives - until one of\n    them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the\n    frantic gesturing, pungently. The comic value of the fart\n    tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are\n    scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.\n\n\n<b>5   EXT. SCHOOL.

Jenny swipes the chief offender over the\n    head with her sheet music.\n\n\n<b>6   EXT. BUS STOP. DAY                                            6\n</b>\n    The rain has begun. Jenny attempts to cover herself. A             \n    mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and\n    a beautiful, sleek red sports car - a Bristol - stops to\n    let them across. David, possibly in his mid-thirties,\n    dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the\n    car. David, distracted, impatient, spots Jenny at the bus\n    stop.\n\n    In front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the\n    foot of one of the children,further slowing down their\n    painfully slow progress across the road.\n\n    Jenny is wet. David makes eye contact. Jenny smiles\n    ruefully, and enchantingly. David sighs, and then hesitates\n    for a moment. The window of the Bristol slowly rolls down.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>              Hello.\n\n    Jenny ignores him.\n\n<b>                        DAVID\n</b>              Listen.

Jack is\n      carrying the cello. Jenny is in her school uniform, with\n      her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. The three of\n      them are flustered. Jenny opens the front door for her\n      father and he stumbles outside.\n\n<b>                             JENNY\n</b>                Oh!\n\n\n<b>12A   INT/EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE.

Jenny is easily the most attractive of the\n      three - and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest.\n      HATTIE is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier;\n      TINA is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. She is also\n      the least middle-class of the three - she's clearly a\n      scholarship girl. They are all dressed in an unflattering\n      and unambiguous school uniform - no attempts to disguise it\n      with more fashionable accessories. Jenny is smoking\n      pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of\n      pout. Tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino\n      with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. Jenny tuts her\n      disapproval. Tina sighs, and puts her spoon down.\n\n<b>                          JENNY\n</b>                The whole point about him is that                       \n                he doesn't feel.\n\n<b>                          TINA\n</b>                We still don't have to like him.\n\n<b>                          JENNY\n</b>                Camus doesn't want you to like\n                him. What he's trying to say is\n                that feeling is bourgeois. Being\n                engagee is bourgeois. His mother\n                dies and he doesn't feel\n                anything.

Jenny             \n      suddenly looks young in the dress that looks too old for          \n      her - other adults are milling around outside, and the            \n      women don't look like girls dressed up. David makes for an        \n      incredibly glamorous and attractive couple in their late          \n      twenties who are waiting outside - DANNY and HELEN. Helen         \n      is as far from anyone's idea of an aunt as one can get.           \n      She's no more beautiful than Jenny, but she's dressed both        \n      appropriately and spectacularly, in early-60s, pre-hippy          \n      Bohemian gear.

Nine or ten classmates are\n     scattered around the room,    talking distractedly, but\n     Jenny's group is much more    animated: Tina and Hattie are\n     leaning forward, listening    to Jenny, their eyes bright.\n     They are clearly awestruck    by Jenny's tales of the outside\n     world.\n\n<b>                            TINA\n</b>                     (to Hattie)\n                 I'm not interested in Schubert.

So I move the coloureds\n               in and the old ladies move out\n               and I buy their flats cheap.\n               That's what I do.

Marjorie kicks the door open with her\n     foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen\n     candles burning on it.

Her father and mother both look at her, apparently\n      attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the\n      lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two\n      unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the same\n      size - clearly books.\n\n<b>                          MARJORIE\n</b>                Who'd like a piece?\n\n      In truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising\n      specimen.

Their coats are still on, and they haven't put\n      the lights on yet.\n\n<b>                          JACK\n</b>                What's going on?\n\n<b>                          JENNY\n</b>                He's helping himself to some\n                Dutch courage before facing you.\n                Stolen Dutch courage, from the\n                look of it. He has something to\n                tell you.\n\n      She stands, pale and young-looking again, opposite her\n      parents. Suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights.\n      Shot from their POV of the Bristol roaring off up the\n      street.\n\n<b>                          JACK\n</b>                He just drove off.\n\n      We close slowly in on Jenny's face. But of course he'd\n      drive off!\n\n<b>                          JACK\n</b>                    (pathetic)\n                Can you tell us? Please? Jenny?\n\n      Jenny can't deal with her own pain, let alone his. He\n      already looks like a broken, foolish old man. They should\n      hug. But they don't.\n\n\n<b>102   EXT. STREET/DAVID'S HOUSE. DAY                              102    \n</b>\n      A suburban street, full of semi-detached houses, not far\n      from Jenny's house. Jenny walks down the road tentatively -\n      she's looking at the numbers on the houses. She looks young\n      again - tired, no make-up, no elegant clothes. She can't\n      bring herself to wear anything that David bought her.\n\n      She hesitates at the top of the driveway to the house,\n      steels herself to walk down. But just at that moment the\n      door opens; there's a homely-looking woman, early 30s. She\n      is holding the hand of a three-year-old. Jenny is stunned.\n      But there's more to come.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                    105.\n</b>\n\nThe woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into\nthe house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. David\nhas found time to father another baby.\n\n<b>                       WIFE\n</b>          Oh. Hello.\n\n<b>                    JENNY\n</b>              (almost inaudible)\n          Hello.

I...\n\nShe dries up and looks at the woman helplessly.\n\n<b>                    WIFE\n</b>          Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God.\n          You're a child.\n\nJenny blushes. Beat. She turns and tries to walk back up\nthe driveway, but the woman won't let her go.\n\n<b>                    WIFE\n</b>          No. No. You stay here. If you're\n          old enough to sleep with him,\n          you're old enough to look at me.\n\n<b>                       JENNY\n</b>          I can't.\n\nBut she doesn't move, either.\n\n<b>                    WIFE\n</b>          You didn't know about any of\n          this. Presumably.\n\nJenny shakes her head.\n\n<b>                    WIFE\n</b>          No. They never do. Did he ask you\n          to marry him?\n\nJenny nods.\n\n<b>                    WIFE\n</b>          Yes. Of course he did. You're not\n          in the family way, are you?\n          Because that's happened before.\n\nJenny shakes her head.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                          106.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                          WIFE\n</b>                Thank God for that. At least you\n                can escape intact. (Beat)\n                Relatively speaking. Not all of\n                them have done.\n\n      She nods at the children.\n\n<b>                          WIFE\n</b>                That's why he never goes through\n                with anything. He does love them.\n\n<b>                          JENNY\n</b>                    (looking into the pram)\n                She's beautiful.\n\n<b>                          WIFE\n</b>                Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's\n                four months old.\n\n      Jenny does the maths. It's all she can do to stop herself\n      from reeling backwards - she's visibly shaken.\n\n<b>                          JENNY\n</b>                Four months!\n\n<b>                          WIFE\n</b>                Yes.

The\n      dress is suddenly jerked out of shot, and we pull back to\n      reveal a weeping Jenny stuffing it violently into an\n      already full box of things she is throwing out. The\n      contents represent her now-despised, David-created adult\n      self. We can see Juliette Greco albums, photos, expensive-\n      looking jewelry boxes. She continues to stuff things into\n      the box.

Close on        \n      Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her\n      precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling\n      through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her\n      for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and\n      leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave\n      it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:\n      it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road\n      just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she\n      can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a           \n      littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of           \n      cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line.

A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts,\nleans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her\nto finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man\noffers her his arm. They walk away together, and David\nstares longingly after them.\n\n\n\n<b>                      THE END\n</b><b>\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/An-Education.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>An Education</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Nick Hornby\" title=\"Scripts by Nick Hornby\">Nick Hornby</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Lynn Barber\" title=\"Scripts by Lynn Barber\">Lynn Barber</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/An Education Script.html#comments\" title=\"An Education comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:58:41.864002"}
