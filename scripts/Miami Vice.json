OCEAN - CLOSE UP:  WATER - MORNING LIGHT\n\n   We are at the delicate interface between ocean and\n   air...liquid and gas...the event horizon where molecules\n   evaporate.  This interchange is ethereal.  Then, low\n   frequencies rumble through depths...louder...closer, now...\n   And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the\n   ROAR of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots...\n\n   OFFSHORE RACER:  \"BORN TO WIN\"\n\n   in PROFILE.\n\n   AERIAL:  \"BORN TO WIN\"\n\n   ...has a canopy, low like a B-1 bomber and extends a half\n   mile.  It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes\n   to 150 knots with another 1,100 RPM left...\n\n   INT. RACE BOAT - SONNY CROCKETT\n\n   pilots the \"Born to Win\" in full helmet.  On the throttle and\n   flaps is RICARDO TUBBS...\n\n   EXT. OCEAN - \"BORN TO WIN\"\n\n   leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a\n   couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media.  At the last\n   moment occurs a small power loss, and \"Born to Win\" gets\n   nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, \"Goddess\"...\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n   EXT. MARINA - \"BORN TO WIN\" - LATER\n\n   thunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs.  The canopy\n   is up.  Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off.  Dockhands tie\n   it off.  It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:  nine-\n   figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German\n   princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions\n   about asset origins.  The exception is \"Born to Win's\"\n   sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4\" SWITEK.  He\n   looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.  Next\n   to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones.  We'll\n   see her again.\n\n   WINNING CIRCLE - CROCKETT + TUBBS\n\n   in second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of\n   \"Goddess,\" neither of whom speak English.  The #3 boat,\n   \"Bicardi Silver,\" was driven by David Scott and throttled by\n   John Tomlinson...\n\n   CROCKETT + TUBBS\n\n   leave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican\n   billionaires.

Change your mind; get\n             inclined?  Let me know...\n\n   Whatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't\n   want.  (Nicholas brokers \"go-fast\" runs, moving loads from\n   offshore into South Florida.  Among guys who pilot offshore\n   race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but\n   no one's found them yet.)

ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - A KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n   A couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel.\n   Off-screen a restaurant-grade Sub-Zero opens with a hiss.\n   Fan starts.  Beyond the kitchen we SEE through a dining room\n   to a den.  A chair is overturned.  We HEAR muffled sounds.\n   We SEE feet extend through a door jamb.  Someone's on the\n   floor.  A television is playing, distantly.\n\n   INT. DEN - SEE FAMILY PICTURES\n\n   so close they almost come to life.  A Venezuelan family, two\n   boys and a girl in a pool.  Maria, Alonzo, the two boys at\n   their sister's baptism.  And we see holding the baby daughter\n   is Riccardo Tubbs.\n\n   A family dinner at a South American restaurant.  Tubbs sits\n   with the youngest daughter on his lap.  Maria is on the other\n   side of him.  This is the image that almost comes to life.\n   We hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a Sunday\n   afternoon when families take the grandparents and have\n   dinner.\n\n   INT. KITCHEN - SUB ZERO REFRIGERATOR\n\n   MOVE from the bright glare of the interior ONTO\n\n   the broad neck of a MAN.  A Viking is tattooed there.  The\n   image morphs into a naked woman presenting her rear to a\n   muscled biker next to a chopper above a swastika residing\n   between shoulder blades.  SS lightning bolts are on his neck.\n   PULL BACK from this MAN, who is bent into the frig because\n   he's hungry.  His head is shaved and he's naked from the\n   waist up.  A BLACK HEFTY GARBAGE BAG is tied around his\n   waist.  Yellow industrial gloves are on his hands.  Something\n   bad is happening in this house...\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n   INT.

That's\n             not faith; that's delusional...\n\n   Wearing enough of nothing to hide the micro .380, which Gina\n   checks right now.  There's a round in the chamber.\n\n   AERIAL:  THE SIKORSKI crosses past the stacks of $5 million\n   condos to a landing pad on a roof.  The Miami of the '80's,\n   that twilight-zone frontier built on coke-fueled cash flow,\n   is over.  The frontier development stage is passed.  It has\n   BECOME Casablanca.  Anything goes; everything has a price.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n   EXT. ROOFTOP LANDING PAD - WIDE\n\n   The chopper rockets in, settles.\n\n   INT. UTILITY STAIRCASE\n\n   Crockett, Tubbs and Gina descend to the 25th-floor penthouse,\n   the target.

They clear the room.  They check for bugs\n   and external surveillance.  They pull curtains.  Tubbs from a\n   bag pulls a scanner.  Under the two beds.  Behind the\n   picture.  The lamp.  The telephone.  Meanwhile...\n\n   CROCKETT\n\n   \"traps\" the room to reveal if it had been searched while they\n   were gone.  He aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the\n   bench.  A matchstick goes against the closed closet door.  A\n   ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone.\n\n                        TUBBS (cont'd)\n             ...show time.\n\n   From his bag Tubbs pulls a Smith & Wesson J-frame hammerless\n   in .357 Magnum.  He holsters this on his ankle.  A Remington\n   780 shotgun with pistol grip, sawed-off to a 12-inch barrel\n   gets slung on a bungee-cord shoulder strap under his right\n   arm.  .9mm under his shirt in his waistband and two spare\n   magazines clipped to his belt.\n\n   CROCKETT\n\n   loads a .45 \"race\" gun with rounded sights and a magna-ported\n   barrel, cross-drawn, and a blunt .45 Para-Ordnance in the\n   small of his back.

Someone's been here.\n\n   INT. HOTEL ROOM - CROCKETT + TUBBS\n\n   enter stealthily.  Then, they relax.  They need not have\n   bothered being so careful about detecting a clandestine\n   surveillance.\n\n   OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS\n\n   The room is overtly destroyed.

HAITIAN PARAMILITARY in soccer jerseys and shorts with\n   assault rifles...\n\n   BEDROOM DOORWAY - FOUR MORE PARAMILITARY\n\n   AK's are aimed at Crockett and Tubbs' heads.  Crockett's .45\n   and his Para-Ordnance are in each hand.  Tubbs' shotgun is\n   aimed at the front door, his .9mm at the men streaming in the\n   windows.  Frozen moment.

In the front seat, his SMG is ready;\n   his eyes never leave Crockett and Tubbs.\n\n   EXT. ROAD - CARAVAN\n\n   A military Hummer in the front carries Isabella with her\n   security.  Behind is a crew cab with bench seats loaded with\n   Haitian paramilitary.\n\n   INT. MERCEDES - TUBBS\n\n   They approach a town.  He nudges Crockett.  A police\n   roadblock's ahead.\n\n   CROCKETT\n\n   has seen something else.  He indicates the pager on his\n   waist.\n\n   TUBBS' POV:  PAGER - NO SIGNAL\n\n   That's what's surprising.  Tubbs pulls his cell phone.\n   Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock.\n   Crockett gets tense...\n\n   TUBBS\n\n   watches.  His cell's SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR steps down to\n   zero.\n\n   EXT. POLICE ROADBLOCK - COPS\n\n   stop the caravan.  Is this turning bad?\n\n   INT. CAR - CROCKETT\n\n   alarmed.\n\n   EXT. ROADBLOCK - HAITIAN COPS\n\n   check under the vehicles with mirrors.  See all the weapons.\n   Salute.  Usher the convoy past.\n\n   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS\n\n   exchange a look.  Then they get it.  The cops work as\n   security for the narcotrafficker.  The caravan advances\n   towards a major intersection.  This one is blocked-off by\n   Haitian military.\n\n   EXT. SECOND CHECKPOINT - CAR DOOR\n\n   is snatched open.  Haitian soldiers search Crockett and\n   Tubbs.  They defer to the Russian-speaking security.\n   Mercedes pulls forward...\n\n   CROCKETT\n\n   eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban\n   area?  Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over\n   Baghdad.  It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a\n   dope deal.\n\n   CROCKETT + TUBBS\n\n   SEE a third circle of security approach.\n\n   PRIVATE-SECTOR TYPES IN BUSINESS SUITS\n\n   carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some\n   with night-vision goggles.  The vehicles stop.\n\n   EXT. TOWN SQUARE\n\n   Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out.  They're pushed\n   around and searched.  A working class Glaswegion Scot, a\n   couple of 5'10\" Brits are off to the side with short hair and\n   shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex-\n   SAS).  Russians are ex-KGB.  Languages overheard:  smatterings\n   of Russian, Hebrew and English.  Crockett and Tubbs look at\n   each other:  they get it.  This is the cream of private\n   sector security.  And it says top dollar infrastructure.\n\n   THEY + WE SEE:  EXT. TOWN SQUARE\n\n   Four avenues lead in.  Each avenue is blocked.  The square is\n   closed down to vehicles and pedestrians.  Locals have\n   disappeared.  In the center of the square are FOUR MATCHING\n   BLACK SUBURBANS.\n\n   CROCKETT\n\n   gestures to Tubbs to look up.  They see...\n\n   ROOFTOPS:  TWO-MAN TEAMS - SNIPER + SPOTTER\n\n   with night-vision goggles...\n\n   CROCKETT + TUBBS\n\n   are clean.\n\n   CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA\n\n   cross through a no-man's land.  It feels like being in the\n   open in Kosovo.\n\n   TUBBS\n\n   checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a\n   hydraulic mast.  The rear's converted into computer equipment\n   sitting in ruggedized racks...\n\n   INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - WIDE\n\n   Doors open.  The interior has been converted into a\n   luxurious, limo-like office with swivel seats.  Isabella\n   followed by Crockett and Tubbs enter.  It's occupied by\n   ARCHANGEL DE JESUS MONTOYA-LONDONO.  He's not flashy.  He has\n   smooth skin, slightly opalescent, black eyes.  His right arm\n   is normal length, but shriveled.\n\n                        MONTOYA\n             Please take that seat on the\n             side...\n\n                        TUBBS\n             Thank you.\n\n                        MONTOYA\n                  (polite, friendly)\n             Excuse me because I am very busy\n             and have many things to do, so this\n             will be brief.

You will prosper beyond your\n             dreams and you can live in Miami in\n             millionaire style.\n                  (beat)\n             If you are arrested, there will be\n             lawyers made available to you in\n             the United States.

You will contact and work\n             through Jos\u00e9 Yero on logistics and\n             communications.  To do with money,\n             you will work through my wife,\n             Isabella...\n\n   Crockett notices that Montoya lightly holds her hand.  It's\n   confident.  And he sees the slight smile on Isabella's face\n   as she watches he and Tubbs...\n\n                        MONTOYA (cont'd)\n             More than I, in finance and\n             business, she is very dangerous.  I\n             look forward to our doing work\n             together.  Whether we do or not, it\n             is unlikely we will meet again.  So\n             I extend my best wishes to your\n             families...\n                  (to Tubbs)\n             Particularly to your beautiful\n             wife.\n                  (beat)\n             Thank you for making this long trip\n             to see me...\n\n   Dismissed, they exit.\n\n   EXT. TOWN SQUARE - EXTREMELY CLOSE:  TUBBS\n\n   Subterranean alarms are going off.  Tubbs finds himself in\n   this small city, occupied by narcotraffickers and their\n   security in the middle of nowhere.  Urgency agitates Tubbs.\n   He controls it...\n\n   CROCKETT\n\n   in the town square, now, too.  But Isabella stayed inside\n   Montoya's Suburban.  Now, she lowers her window.\n\n   ROADBLOCKS\n\n   break up.  Montoya's Suburbans pull out.  The security cordon\n   deforms.  It all disappears around them.  It leaves only the\n   Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs...\n\n   CLOSER:  CROCKETT\n\n   looks after the caravan.\n\n   CROCKETT'S POV:  ISABELLA'S EYES\n\n   in the side-view mirror on the passenger side.

His attention is on the woman in the\n   mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell\n   phone.\n\n   TUBBS' CELL PHONE\n\n   Signal strength returns.

Off the wings are two booms that connect to a rear\n   wing.  It's a Burt Rutan aircraft design.\n\n   There is neither metal nor exposed exhausts for radar or IF\n   to spot.  It does 200 knots at 22,000 feet.  It'll fly,\n   forever, 1,000 kilos of flake worth $23 million, and the\n   total air weight is less than two Bentleys.
