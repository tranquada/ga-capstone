HOUSE IN THE CYPRESS - CROCKETT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n   staring out the window at the narrow jetty.  Isabella sits,\n   distantly, alone at the end.\n\n<b>   CLOSER:  ISABELLA\n</b>\n   Crockett joins her.  She's withdrawn into herself.\n\n<b>                        CROCKETT\n</b>             No part of it wasn't real.\n\n<b>                        ISABELLA\n</b>             I know.\n                  (quietly)\n             And now?\n\n<b>                        CROCKETT\n</b>             It still is.  I'm so in this, I\n             don't know which way is up... All I\n             know is I won't let anything bad\n             happen to you.\n                  (beat)\n             Just like I said.\n                  (beat)\n             And I know we can't ever see each\n             other again.  And we never will.\n\n   Isabella sits there for a moment.  She glances at him, looks\n   away.  Then...\n\n<b>                        ISABELLA\n</b>             You said time is luck...\n\n   Meaning, who can tell?  There may be a time for them\n   somewhere else.\n\n<b>                        CROCKETT\n</b>             Luck ran out.\n                  (beat)\n             This was too good to last.\n\n   He touches her hand.  And she leans all her weight against\n   his arm.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>   INT. CYPRESS HOUSE, BEDROOM - CROCKETT - LATER\n</b>\n   asleep.  The moonlight is silver tinged with green.  Someone\n   else had been in the bed with him, but he is there alone,\n   now.  Crockett wakes up.  He looks around.  She was there and\n   now she's gone.\n\n   He gets out of the bed and looks out to the ocean and the\n   jetty.  The boat's gone.  She's gone.  Sonny Crockett looks\n   out the window.\n\n\n\n<b>                                                  THE END\n</b>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Miami-Vice.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Miami Vice</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Michael Mann\" title=\"Scripts by Michael Mann\">Michael Mann</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Anthony Yerkovich\" title=\"Scripts by Anthony Yerkovich\">Anthony Yerkovich</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Miami Vice Script.html#comments\" title=\"Miami Vice comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:11:32.942867"}
