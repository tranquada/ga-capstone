NIGHTCLUB- EVENING                                   1\r\n\r\n    A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and\r\n    hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are\r\n    stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We\r\n    descend into a black, throbbing tunnel.\r\n\r\n    Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers.   Hips, legs\r\n    feet dancing.\r\n\r\n    A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole.   Hoots\r\n    and cheers.\r\n\r\n    The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom.\r\n    More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.\r\n\r\n                        FEMALE DJ (O.S.)\r\n              Let's go! Where all my sexy\r\n              Sagittarian ladies at?\r\n\r\n    Arms go up.   A collection of whoops ripple the crowd.\r\n\r\n    The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward\r\n    headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted\r\n    heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing\r\n    on the ceiling.\r\n\r\n                           FEMALE DJ (O.S.)\r\n              Oh my God!\r\n\r\n    ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing\r\n    and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is\r\n    pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar\r\n    bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Where your singles at?!! Where your\r\n              singles at?!! Yeah, baby!\r\n\r\n    Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the\r\n    dancer's boot. Alike drops her beer in all the jostling.\r\n\r\n                        FEMALE DJ\r\n              Goddamn I love my job!\r\n\r\n    Laura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly\r\n    waves Alike's wrist in the air.\r\n                                                             2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins\r\n    to direct her attention at her.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Stop! Chill!!\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Whatchu' come here for?!\r\n\r\n    Alike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders\r\n    her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage.\r\n    Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at\r\n    the edge of the stage. Alike looks away and breaks through a\r\n    snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Oof,\r\n              sorry ladies.\r\n\r\n    Finally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at\r\n    the clock on her cell phone.\r\n\r\n                          ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n              Shit!\r\n\r\n    She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer\r\n    visible. Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing\r\n    crowd, she retreats for the bar.\r\n\r\n                          FEMALE DJ\r\n              Let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n2   INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR- NIGHT                                     2\r\n\r\n    Alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar. Her gaze settles\r\n    on a CUTE GIRL a little ways down, staring out at the dance\r\n    floor. Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her\r\n    shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl.\r\n\r\n                          ALIKE\r\n              Hi.\r\n\r\n    The girl ignores her. Alike clears her throat and speaks a\r\n    little too loudly.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n              Umm... Hey! How are you?!\r\n\r\n    The girl jerks around and frowns at Alike, looking her up and\r\n    down.\r\n\r\n                          CUTE GIRL\r\n              What?!\r\n                                                                3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Umm...sorry. I was just sayin'\r\n              Umm...hi.\r\n\r\n                        CUTE GIRL\r\n              Oh.\r\n\r\n    The girl dismisses Alike and turns back toward the floor.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Oh. You wanna drink or something?\r\n              Hey! Hey! Over here!\r\n\r\n    Alike strains, snapping at the bartender. A CONFIDENT WOMAN\r\n    swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand. The cute\r\n    girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance\r\n    floor. Alike looks around just in time to see her leaving.\r\n    The bartender finally materializes, and Alike slinks away.\r\n\r\n\r\n3   INT. NIGHTCLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT                                  3\r\n\r\n    Alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the\r\n    cramped, 2 stall bathroom. A COUPLE in front of her makes out\r\n    vigorously, and she folds her arms and looks away.\r\n\r\n    A buff 30-SOMETHING WOMAN with locs smiles and winks at\r\n    Alike. Alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks\r\n    away. The line inches forward. Alike glances around\r\n    searching for the woman. The 30-something has already lost\r\n    interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more\r\n    FEMININE WOMAN strutting out of the restroom. Embarrassed,\r\n    Alike faces front again. Two androgynous gangsters (AGs) who\r\n    have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer.\r\n    Alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance. One of\r\n    the AG's breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the\r\n    line inches forward again. Alike pretends not to notice and\r\n    slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch\r\n    along the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER                                     4\r\n\r\n    Alike dozes on the couch.\r\n\r\n                        FEMALE DJ\r\n              Give it up for Sin-A-Min ladies!!\r\n\r\n    Alike wakes with a start. She checks the time on her cell\r\n    phone. Cursing, she scrambles up from the couch.\r\n                                                             4.\r\n\r\n\r\n5   INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR - EVENING                                  5\r\n\r\n    Laura dances with a cute SHORT HAIRED GIRL.\r\n\r\n    Alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              C'mon, we're late.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Huh?\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              I gotta go!\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Hold on a minute.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              C'mon, why you trippin'?\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              What?\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Why are you trippin', you know I\r\n              gotta go!\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              What?\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              You know I gotta go.   I'ma get in\r\n              trouble.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Lemme dance with shortie first,\r\n              then I'll be ready.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              What?\r\n\r\n    Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair\r\n    continue their wobbling, uneven groove. Alike endures several\r\n    moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both \"feminine\"\r\n    and \"butch\" push past her without a second glance. Alike tugs\r\n    at Laura's jersey. Laura, happily tangled in her dance\r\n    partner's embrace rolls her eyes.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Stop pulling on my clothes!\r\n                                                                5.\r\n\r\n\r\n6   EXT. BUS STOP- NIGHT                                             6\r\n\r\n    Laura sulks, frowning out at the night. Alike extends the\r\n    olive branch.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              How many numbers you get? One?\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              I could've gotten more, but your\r\n              moms was holding me up.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n              Oooh.   That's jacked up.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              How many you get?\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Tonya, Denise, Shelley. No wait\r\n              that's old, I can delete that one.\r\n              Tonya...\r\n\r\n    Laura snatches the phone from Alike. Alike swipes at it but\r\n    misses. Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through\r\n    the numbers with the other.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Ain't Shelley that chick from your\r\n              math class?! Denise... What?\r\n              These are your damn study group\r\n              numbers! Why you frontin'?!\r\n\r\n    Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her\r\n    sleeve.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              I don't see you with no list of\r\n              numbers.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              I'm not the one looking for a\r\n              girlfriend, man.

I'm\r\n              sayin', whatchu waitin' for?!\r\n\r\n    Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows\r\n    her and sneers.\r\n                                                             6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit\r\n              since 6th grade.

BUS - NIGHT                                              7\r\n\r\n    Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears\r\n    on. A middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly\r\n    constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the\r\n    window. Alike reaches over and presses the tape. Laura elbows\r\n    Alike.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Quit playing.\r\n\r\n                           ALIKE\r\n              Your stop.\r\n\r\n                           LAURA\r\n              Huh?\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Your stop-- you're getting off\r\n              here, right?\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              Nah, I'll roll with you a few more\r\n              stops.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              Why you gon' walk all the way back\r\n              down for?

The light flicks on over the back\r\n    door.\r\n                                                             7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              You ain't big, nigga. Trying to\r\n              protect somebody. Hurry up, man,\r\n              get off!\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n                  (to bus driver)\r\n              That's alright man--next stop. Next\r\n              stop!\r\n\r\n    Alike elbows Laura sharply. The bus driver frowns in the rear\r\n    view.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              You ain't gotta push me, why're you\r\n              beastin'?\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              I'm not beastin'.\r\n\r\n    Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door.\r\n\r\n                        LAURA\r\n              You got a problem. Call me.\r\n\r\n                        ALIKE\r\n              I'ma call you.\r\n\r\n    Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away. Laura drums a\r\n    little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off. Alike\r\n    waves and faces forward again. An OLD LADY sitting nearby\r\n    shoots her a disapproving look. Alike rolls her eyes and\r\n    moves to a seat farther away.\r\n\r\n\r\n8   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         8\r\n\r\n    Alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a\r\n    breath. She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a\r\n    fitting baby doll shirt that reads \"Princess.\" She stuffs\r\n    her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair\r\n    of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. She slumps back\r\n    against the seat and stares into the night.\r\n\r\n    The bus stops at a lonely island of curb. Alike is a dark\r\n    silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n9   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                9\r\n\r\n    Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip\r\n    through. The house is dark except for the flashing microwave\r\n    clock.\r\n                                                               8.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway.

Sharonda swings the door\r\nopen wide.\r\n\r\n                    SHARONDA\r\n          Good night Lee!\r\n\r\nSharonda slams her door.      The light clicks on underneath\r\nAlike's parent's door.\r\n                                                                  9.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AUDREY (O.S.)\r\n               Lee?

ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     10\r\n\r\n     Alike rushes to shove her stuffed backpack under the bed.\r\n     She tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother, AUDREY\r\n     appears in the doorway.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Nice to know you still live here.\r\n\r\n     Alike peels off her socks and slumps on the bed.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY (CONT'D)\r\n               What're you doing home so late,\r\n               anyway?\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Lost track of time.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               You know what time your curfew is.\r\n               Where were you?\r\n\r\n                            ALIKE\r\n               Movies.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               The show ended at midnight.

Alike turns her back on\r\n     her and slumps into pajamas.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               At least you were cute. Where'd you\r\n               get that shirt? `Princess'. I like\r\n               that.\r\n\r\n     Alike winds the princess shirt around her fist and launches\r\n     to the top of the closet.\r\n\r\n                            ALIKE\r\n               It's old.\r\n                                                             10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Compliments your figure.

Vinegar replaces\r\n     honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               I really don't care for that young\r\n               lady you run around with anyway.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Yeah, okay!\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               And tie your head up.\r\n\r\n     Alike snags a satin headscarf from the nightstand and slaps\r\n     it around her head.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY(CONT'D)\r\n               It's your head.

Alike is still. She listens for the door to\r\n     her parent's room to shut before snatching off the scarf and\r\n     storming to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n11   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                     11\r\n\r\n     Alike turns on the faucet, wets the soap and puts it back in\r\n     the dish, wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack.\r\n     She plops down on the toilet and looks up. A crucifix frowns\r\n     down at her from the wall.\r\n                                                             11.\r\n\r\n\r\n     She averts her eyes and stands to leave.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY (O.S.)\r\n               Did you brush your teeth?\r\n\r\n     Alike wets her toothbrush and throws it back into the holder.\r\n\r\n                           AUDREY (O.S.)\r\n               Lee?\r\n\r\n     Alike squeezes out a dollop of toothpaste and smears a little\r\n     around the sink. She stares at her reflection.\r\n\r\n                           AUDREY (O.S.)\r\n               Lee?\r\n\r\n     Alike flicks water droplets at the mirror for good measure.\r\n\r\n                           ALIKE\r\n               Yes, mom.\r\n\r\n\r\n12   EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING                                     12\r\n\r\n     Alike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the\r\n     perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter. STUDENTS\r\n     horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging\r\n     their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes. The school\r\n     bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building.\r\n     Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last\r\n     STRAGGLERS finally trickle in. She yanks her hoodie tighter\r\n     and launches across the lawn and into the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n13   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING                             13\r\n\r\n     A second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers\r\n     and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into\r\n     classrooms. Alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks\r\n     out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the\r\n     bathroom. One last straggler BINA, a 17 year-old girl with\r\n     mature, but down-to-earth good looks rushes past Alike. The\r\n     two exchange a brief, confused look then mutually dismiss\r\n     each other as they hurry in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n14   INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING                            14\r\n\r\n     Alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut\r\n     behind her. She rips off her hoodie and the \"girly\" shirt\r\n     beneath and flings them to the floor. She pulls out a pair of\r\n     wife-beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head. She\r\n     unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head.\r\n                                                             12.\r\n\r\n\r\n     She stares at her reflection in the window and tries\r\n     unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt. Her eyes scour her\r\n     reflection again and again for any imperfections. She spots\r\n     the earrings and yanks them out of her ears. The late bell\r\n     beckons and Alike stuffs her \"feminine\" clothes into her\r\n     backpack and bolts.\r\n\r\n\r\n15   INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY                                    15\r\n\r\n     The MATH TEACHER glides up and down the aisles passing out\r\n     graded tests. A chorus of groans follows in her wake.\r\n\r\n                         MATH TEACHER\r\n               As promised, I will be grading\r\n               these on a curve.\r\n\r\n     Alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom.\r\n     The desks in front her and beside her are empty. She is\r\n     ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes.\r\n\r\n                         MATH TEACHER (CONT'D)\r\n               But the highest grade on the test\r\n               was a 98.\r\n\r\n     The math teacher puts Alike's test on her desk and gives her\r\n     a little smile. Alike doesn't smile back.\r\n\r\n     The lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the\r\n     room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks. Alike jabs\r\n     her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very\r\n     deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her\r\n     before heading toward the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n16   INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY                                  16\r\n\r\n     The cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying.\r\n     Clusters of girls and boys loud-talk, flirt, fight and\r\n     horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the\r\n     walls. Alike walks alone, staying at the fringes of the crowd\r\n     and shrugs through the cafeteria line.\r\n\r\n\r\n17   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY                                    17\r\n\r\n     Alike flees the cafeteria, tray laden with rubbery cuisine of\r\n     dubious nutritional value. She raps on the door of a\r\n     classroom and slips in.\r\n\r\n                            MRS. ALVARADO (O.S.)\r\n               Hey there!\r\n                                                             13.\r\n\r\n\r\n18   INT.

ALVARADO, a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type\r\n     reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks\r\n     and sunflower seed paste. Her small desk radio plays\r\n     alternative rock. Sun beams into the empty classroom and\r\n     Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and\r\n     pulls up a chair next to her desk.\r\n\r\n                         MRS.

But...I don't know.\r\n               Is it your best?

ALVARADO\r\n               I believe you can go deeper.\r\n\r\n\r\n19   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON                           19\r\n\r\n     Audrey is a heat-seeking missile, whipping through the sparse\r\n     hallways of the trauma wing, her clipboard and pen in\r\n     constant motion. NURSES and AIDES scatter in her wake,\r\n     suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to\r\n     avoid her caustic gaze. She barks at a cluster of CLERKS chit-\r\n     chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to\r\n     escape. Audrey drills her.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Oh, so your log is all up to date?\r\n\r\n                           CLERK\r\n               No I--\r\n\r\n                          AUDREY\r\n               And you've checked the round for\r\n               any calls?\r\n\r\n                           CLERK\r\n               Well I --\r\n                                                             15.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Do you even know which doctors are\r\n               on the floor?\r\n\r\n                         CLERK\r\n               No ma'am I--\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Then I suggest you get busy.\r\n\r\n     The clerk skitters off red-faced, and Audrey looks daggers\r\n     into her back before storming the break room.\r\n\r\n\r\n20   INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        20\r\n\r\n     Audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads\r\n     toward a table. A few lounging AIDES wad up their garbage and\r\n     flee the break room. Audrey settles down at the table and\r\n     pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote, pretending not\r\n     to be hurt. She peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins\r\n     reading. A big red department store bag sits next to her work\r\n     tote. The television suspended over the table mumbles\r\n     corporate healthcare infomercials. MRS. SINGLETARY, one of\r\n     Audrey's co-workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag\r\n     on the table across from her.\r\n\r\n                         MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n               Hey girl! Mind if I sit here?\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               No, not at all. Help yourself.\r\n\r\n                         MRS.

Some\r\n               vanilla yogurt.\r\n\r\n                          MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n               No I meant in the bag. What do you\r\n               have in the shopping bag--the big\r\n               red thing?\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Oh I'm...I don't know where my mind\r\n               is...Yeah, this is just uh--well\r\n               let me get your opinion.\r\n\r\n     Audrey's steely exterior melts away and suddenly she is all\r\n     butterflies and giggles. She rifles through the bag and\r\n     hoists out a pink ribbed v-neck sweater.\r\n                                                          16.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          Oh that's nice.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Yeah see isn't this cute?\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          Umm-hmm. That's for your daughter?\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Yeah, this is for Alike.\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          The youngest one.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          No she's the oldest one.\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          Oh, the other one. Okay.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          What, you think it's too young?\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          No, no. For whatever reason the\r\n          youngest one popped in my mind\r\n          first. But I think it should be\r\n          fine. It's really cute.\r\n\r\n                       AUDREY\r\n          Thank you.\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          It'll compliment her figure.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Now see that's what I thought...\r\n          But Lee doesn't like anything I\r\n          pick out for her anymore.\r\n\r\nMrs. Singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the\r\nsweater from Audrey.\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going\r\n          on 27 mind you, banned me from\r\n          buying her any more clothes. We\r\n          have two completely different\r\n          tastes. I just give her gift cards\r\n          now and trust me, we're both\r\n          happier for it. Is it her birthday?\r\n                                                        17.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Singletary hands the sweater back to Audrey who smooths\r\nit carefully back into the tissue paper.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          No, no. I just wanted to get her\r\n          something nice. You know.\r\n\r\nThree ROWDY CO-WORKERS burst into the room chattering and\r\nfinger popping.\r\n\r\n                    ROWDY CO-WORKER #1\r\n          Hey, Brenda!\r\n\r\n      ROWDY CO-WORKER #2              ROWDY CO-WORKER #3\r\nOooooh Audrey, you got me a     What'chall in here talking\r\npresent?                        about?\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Well, no we--\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          None of yo' damn business!!\r\n\r\nThe co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various\r\nparts of the breakroom. Audrey shoves the sweater back in the\r\nbag and nestles it between her feet. Somebody cranks on a\r\nsmall radio and a frisky R&B beat invades the air. Mrs.\r\nSingletary pats Audrey on the arm.\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          Let me know how it goes.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Oh I will. I'll call you when--\r\n\r\n                    ROWDY CO-WORKER #3\r\n          Hey Bren' this is what I was\r\n          telling you about!!\r\n\r\nCo-worker #3 shoves a tabloid in Mrs. Singletary's face,\r\ntapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page.\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          Is that her?!\r\n\r\n      ROWDY CO-WORKER #3              ROWDY CO-WORKER #2\r\nTold you!                       Look how big she done got!\r\n\r\nThe center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone\r\nat the fringes. She collects her shopping bag and looks\r\naround to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave.\r\n                                                             18.\r\n\r\n\r\n21   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - EVENING                            21\r\n\r\n     Audrey, Sharonda, Alike, and their father, ARTHUR, 40-\r\n     something with a used-to-be athletic build, are all gathered\r\n     around the dinner table for a rare family dinner. Everyone\r\n     takes half-hearted nibbles at their food avoiding eye contact\r\n     with each other. Sharonda picks at her food.\r\n\r\n                         SHARONDA\r\n               I don't see why we can't just watch\r\n               TV like usual.\r\n\r\n     Alike elbows Sharonda.\r\n\r\n                          SHARONDA\r\n               Quit it!\r\n\r\n                          ALIKE\r\n               Shut up.\r\n\r\n                         SHARONDA\r\n               You don't tell me what to do!\r\n\r\n                          AUDREY\r\n               Girls.\r\n\r\n     The phone rings and Arthur beats a path to bedroom to get it.\r\n     Audrey wilts.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               I'm expecting a call.\r\n\r\n     Audrey stares after him then glares back at Alike and\r\n     Sharonda.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               This is your father's night off.\r\n\r\n     Alike casts a glance in the direction of the bedroom, where\r\n     Arthur can be heard talking in hushed tones. She rolls her\r\n     eyes and slinks down into her seat.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY (CONT'D)\r\n               So straighten up.\r\n\r\n     Arthur settles back into his chair, his mood a little\r\n     brighter. Seeing an opportunity for brownie points, Sharonda\r\n     pitches in.\r\n\r\n                         SHARONDA\r\n               Homecoming got moved this year.\r\n               It's gonna be in September instead\r\n               of October.\r\n                                                           19.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AUDREY\r\n          Oh really?\r\n\r\n                    SHARONDA\r\n          Yeah. Which means I'll be able to\r\n          go to Autumn Ball and the\r\n          Homecoming Dance.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Who are you going with?\r\n\r\n                    SHARONDA\r\n          I don't know. Maybe Derek. If he\r\n          asks me. Maybe Parrish. I haven't\r\n          decided yet. But for homecoming, I\r\n          definitely want to go with Craig.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Oooh, I see. Lee, who are you\r\n          going with?\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Umm. I'm not going.\r\n\r\nArthur gives Alike an approving Daddy's girl wink. Alike\r\nbeams back.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Not going? This is your junior\r\n          year. How can you not go?\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't\r\n          want to go, she doesn't have to go.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          But it's her junior year, she's not\r\n          gonna have any memories.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          I don't like all those boys buzzing\r\n          around my daughters anyway.\r\n\r\n                    SHARONDA\r\n          Nobody buzzes around Alike.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          That's right and it better stay\r\n          that way. Matter of fact, I don't\r\n          know if I'ma let you go.\r\n\r\n                       SHARONDA\r\n          Daaa-aad?!\r\n                                                             20.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alike smirks and takes her plate to the sink. Arthur jabs her\r\n     on the arm as she walks by. Audrey tears into a dinner roll\r\n     shooting daggers at anyone who dares to make eye contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n22   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                 22\r\n\r\n     Laura brings a steaming cup of Ramen noodles to a worn\r\n     kitchen table splayed with bills. Her older sister CANDACE,\r\n     a stout 30 something with pleasant but hard-working looks\r\n     scribbles notes on the back of an envelope while soaking her\r\n     feet. Laura takes a sip of her soup and starts sifting\r\n     through a pile of envelopes.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               How much we paid him last time?\r\n\r\n                         CANDACE\r\n               Six twenty-five.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               So that makes--we owe another two\r\n               seventy-five for the rest of the\r\n               month.\r\n\r\n     Candace pecks on a calculator and scribbles on the envelope.\r\n     Laura flips through more bills.\r\n\r\n                           LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n               Electric?\r\n\r\n                           CANDACE\r\n               Half.\r\n\r\n                           LAURA\r\n               Phone?\r\n\r\n                         CANDACE\r\n               Let it ride.\r\n\r\n                           LAURA\r\n               Gas?\r\n\r\n                           CANDACE\r\n               How much?\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               Eighty-five.\r\n\r\n                         CANDACE\r\n               Half. No let it ride.\r\n\r\n     Laura locks her hands on top of her head and leans back in\r\n     her chair, surveying the financial carnage.\r\n                                                        21.\r\n\r\n\r\nCandace reaches inside a CERAMIC HEN on the table and pulls\r\nout a wad of money. She counts out several hundred dollars\r\ninto an envelope.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          I can get some more hours--\r\n\r\n                    CANDACE\r\n          No. You know what you need to do.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Nah Candy, I can't just dip out on\r\n          you like that--\r\n\r\n                    CANDACE\r\n          I was doing just fine before you\r\n          moved in, remember? I can handle\r\n          it.\r\n\r\nLaura sucks her teeth.\r\n\r\n                    CANDACE (CONT'D)\r\n          You working was only supposed to be\r\n          temporary. Mom would've wanted--\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Who?!

Candace stares back, unfazed. Laura caves first.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          I'll get the money orders in the\r\n          morning.\r\n\r\nLaura tugs at the envelope but Candace doesn't let go right\r\naway.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          I'll look into it alright?\r\n\r\nCandace relinquishes the envelope and Laura stalks off down\r\nthe hallway to her room.\r\n\r\n                    CANDACE\r\n          The next test is coming up soon!\r\n                                                             22.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LAURA (O.S.)\r\n               I said I'll look into it!\r\n\r\n     Candace smiles wanly and sips her soup. She takes a foot out\r\n     of the water and kneads it.\r\n\r\n\r\n23   INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING                            23\r\n\r\n     Alike slams into her usual stall and launches into her\r\n     `Superman' changing routine. She unrolls pulls a jersey from\r\n     her backpack and yanks it over her head.\r\n\r\n\r\n24   EXT. SCHOOL LAWN - AFTERNOON                              24\r\n\r\n     Alike sits off to one side of the stairs, headphoned into\r\n     oblivion and scribbling into her composition book. A group of\r\n     FAST GIRLS strut by and encamp on the opposite wall, giggling\r\n     and yakking on cell phones. One of the girls, MIKA cuts a\r\n     flirty smile at Alike. Alike turns away and buries herself in\r\n     her book, but cranks down the volume on her iPod.\r\n\r\n                         MIKA'S FRIEND\r\n               It was like seven of us--Me,\r\n               Khalil, Misha, Tamara....\r\n\r\n                         FAST GIRL #2\r\n               Tamara Marks?\r\n\r\n                         MIKA'S FRIEND\r\n               Heeeell no--Fat Tamara.\r\n\r\n                         MIKA\r\n               Oh I was about to say, Tamara Marks\r\n               is a ughh--I can't stand her.\r\n\r\n                         MIKA'S FRIEND\r\n               Anyway, it was all of us and oh\r\n               Laura, you know that girl from the\r\n               restaurant?

An obnoxious R&B video plays on the\r\n     TV.

Sharonda appears in the doorway, looking from\r\n     Audrey to Arthur.\r\n\r\n                            SHARONDA\r\n               I'm ready.\r\n\r\n     Arthur pushes up from the table.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               Alike, you look beautiful.\r\n               Everybody looks beautiful, okay?\r\n\r\n     Arthur disappears into the bedroom. Alike snatches up her\r\n     bible and launches out the door, Sharonda follows. Audrey\r\n     pulls on her sunglasses and hat and slams the door behind\r\n     her.\r\n\r\n\r\n34   EXT. CHURCH - DAY                                            34\r\n\r\n     Alike sits in the passenger seat of the car as Audrey chit\r\n     chats with other churchgoers. Sharonda sits in the back\r\n     seat, flipping through a CD case and occasionally passing\r\n     CD's to Alike to play. Alike faces stonily forward except to\r\n     cast impatient glances in Audrey's direction. Audrey raps on\r\n     the window.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Lee! Lee!

Don't\r\n          you live off of St. James Place?\r\n\r\n                    MRS. SINGLETARY\r\n          There is something to be said for\r\n          safety in numbers.\r\n\r\nBina nods. Alike squirms.\r\n\r\n                     MRS.

I\r\n               know that much.\r\n\r\n     An invisible scab is ripped open in Alike and the fire dies\r\n     in her eyes. Satisfied, Audrey slips the car into gear.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY (CONT'D)\r\n               You may not like Bina, but you're\r\n               certainly gonna be spending much\r\n               less time with that Laura person, I\r\n               guarantee you that much.\r\n\r\n                         SHARONDA\r\n               Moooom, can you--\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Be quiet.

So\r\n               stop dodging me, let's just go to\r\n               school together and be done with\r\n               it. We don't have to see each\r\n               other any other time than that.\r\n\r\n     Alike doesn't miss a step.    Bina yells after her.\r\n\r\n                         BINA (CONT'D)\r\n               Whatever, my mother asks me again,\r\n               I'm telling her.

Bina crosses the street and continues in\r\n     the direction away from school. Alike spins around scanning\r\n     the street, then catches sight of her on the opposite\r\n     sidewalk.\r\n\r\n                           ALIKE\r\n               Hey!\r\n\r\n     Bina keeps on pushing, the school now in sight.\r\n                                                        44.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey!\r\n\r\nAlike checks for traffic then dashes across the street to\r\ncatch up with her.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey look, I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                    BINA\r\n          Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna\r\n          bug out.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          No for real, I'm sorry.

This is Lee, I'm not able to\r\n               answer my phone right now--\r\n\r\n     Laura snaps her cell phone shut. A GED study book still\r\n     glossy and uncreased is propped open on the bed in front of\r\n     her. She opens her cell phone again and pulls up Alike's\r\n     number. Her thumb hovers over the `talk' button. She snaps\r\n     the phone shut and tosses it aside before turning the radio\r\n     down and dragging the book closer. The cell phone rings and\r\n     she snatches it up. A picture of a girl making a kissy face\r\n     with the name \"Tasha\" underneath blinks onto the screen and\r\n     Laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside. She hoists\r\n     the GED book into her lap and lets her head hit the wall.\r\n     There is a knock at her bedroom door and Candace peeks in.\r\n\r\n                         CANDACE\r\n               How's it comin'?\r\n\r\n                            LAURA\r\n               It's good.\r\n\r\n     Candace smiles at Laura and hesitates before closing the\r\n     door. Candace turns the radio off before ducking back out.\r\n     Laura sighs and flips back to the beginning of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n38   INT.

He is talking to a news\r\nreporter and a bad news graphic reading \"East Side Drug Bust--\r\nDetective Arthur Freeman\" blots out the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n                    SOCK\r\n          Look who's big time.\r\n\r\n                    MACK\r\n          Brother was looking clean though.\r\n          Looked just like, look like...uh--\r\n          Danny Glover!\r\n\r\nArthur and Mack laugh and slap hands. Sock sneers at their\r\nrevelry.\r\n\r\nThe bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset BUTCH WOMAN\r\nstrolls in. Her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain\r\nclinks against her ample carpenter pants. All three men turn\r\nto stare.\r\n\r\n                    MACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Been more of that since they opened\r\n          up that new club `cross the way.\r\n\r\nArthur grunts and returns to his paper.\r\n\r\n                    SOCK\r\n              (to Butch Woman)\r\n          Excuse me Miss??!!

You hear me talkin' to\r\n          you?!\r\n\r\nMack snatches Sock's cup. Sock pivots around to protest.\r\n\r\n                    SOCK\r\n          Hey!!\r\n                                                        48.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MACK\r\n          Mind your business.\r\n\r\nSock yanks his cup back and turns to resume his taunts. He's\r\ncaught off guard and stumbles backward as the woman pushes up\r\nto the counter with a case of liquor. Arthur steps out of the\r\nway and observes.\r\n\r\n                    BUTCH WOMAN\r\n          And a pack of Kools.\r\n\r\nMack nods and fishes under the counter.\r\n\r\n                    SOCK\r\n          Say, I been trying to get your\r\n          attention.

See, I just want to\r\n          know how does pussy taste?\r\n\r\nThe woman directs her full attention at Sock for the first\r\ntime. Mack watches as he quickly punches in the sale. Arthur\r\nstiffens.\r\n\r\n                    SOCK (CONT'D)\r\n          You know, I just wanna know if you\r\n          go with women for the taste, or is\r\n          it just you're too big, black, and\r\n          ugly so don't no man want you?\r\n\r\nSock laughs at his own nasty joke and takes a sip from his\r\ncup.\r\n\r\n                    MACK\r\n          $65.07 ma'am.\r\n\r\nThe woman counts out the money and smiles at Sock.\r\n\r\n                    BUTCH WOMAN\r\n          I can't lie, pussy do taste good.\r\n\r\n                     SOCK\r\n          Oh yeah?\r\n\r\nThe woman takes her time putting away her change.\r\n                                                           49.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Maybe you should try it yourself\r\n          sometime.

Arthur chokes back a guffaw. As soon\r\nas the woman clears the door, Arthur and Mack explode in\r\nlaughter. Sock is livid and screams after her.\r\n\r\n                    SOCK\r\n          Fuckin' Bulldagger! He-She!

He don't\r\n          know what he's talking about!\r\n\r\nArthur grinds Sock's collar tighter around his trembling\r\nfist. Sock glares back, clearly punked.\r\n\r\n                    MACK (CONT'D)\r\n          He ain't moved outside a two-mile\r\n          radius of where he crawled out his\r\n          mammy's pussy.

Sock tromps to the door.\r\n\r\n                         SOCK\r\n               Fuck y'all!\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               I should arrest your ass.\r\n\r\n                         SOCK\r\n               Man, fuck y'all!!\r\n\r\n                         MACK\r\n               Free, don't pay him no mind. Just\r\n               talkin' trash.\r\n\r\n     Mack playfully jabs him in the shoulder and bustles\r\n     underneath the counter.

LAURA'S KITCHEN - DAY                                  40\r\n\r\n     Laura swings through the front door of her apartment, Alike\r\n     close behind. She slides two twenty dollar bills underneath\r\n     the ceramic hen on the table and breezes into her bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n41   INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - LATER                                41\r\n\r\n     Alike is a paper doll in Laura's floor length mirror, dressed\r\n     only in boxers and a wife beater. Laura holds a bright orange\r\n     polo shirt up in front of Alike's torso. Alike cocks her head\r\n     to the side and considers.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               Damn, this is your color.

You coulda\r\n          called a nigga. Put this on.\r\n\r\nLaura pulls away the orange polo shirt and hands Alike a\r\nturquoise one instead. Alike hoists the oversized shirt over\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          My bad. She's making me hang out\r\n          with this chick from church.

You a grown-ass woman,\r\n          bruh!\r\n\r\nLaura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap\r\nfrom the wall rack and drops it onto Alike's head. Alike\r\nconsiders and takes it off. Laura puts another cap in its\r\nplace. Before Alike can object, Laura tosses her a pair of\r\ndenim shorts.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          Try these with it. So I guess the\r\n          piers is out for Saturday, huh?\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          I don't even know if that's me\r\n          anymore.\r\n\r\nAlike struggles into the jean shorts, widening her stance so\r\nthey don't fall down. Laura tosses her a belt and admires\r\nAlike's reflection.\r\n\r\n                     LAURA\r\n          Yeah, that's hot, yo. You should\r\n          rock that.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n          I was gonna see if you wanna do\r\n          something different?\r\n\r\nAlike strips off the baseball cap and hangs it back on the\r\nrack.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Different like what?\r\n\r\nAlike peels out of the polo shirt.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          I don't know--maybe like a open mic\r\n          or something.\r\n                                                             52.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               Open mic? Nah, man. It's plenty\r\n               chicks at the piers, you just gotta\r\n               be more confident.\r\n\r\n     Laura crosses to her closet and scans its inventory. The\r\n     jeans are arranged crisply on hangers from light to dark and\r\n     some still have store tags. Most of the shirts are still\r\n     enclosed in protective plastic covers from the dry cleaners.\r\n     Laura passes Alike a perfectly folded button down shirt.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n               You can rock this. I haven't even\r\n               worn it yet. But I understand if\r\n               you got better things to do.\r\n\r\n     Alike holds the shirt against her torso and stares at her\r\n     reflection. She catches Laura's eager look in the mirror and\r\n     wilts.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Nah, I'm down.\r\n\r\n                          LAURA\r\n               You sure?

It's gonna be tight\r\n               watch... we gon' do it up!\r\n\r\n     Laura holds a new pair of jeans against her body and does a\r\n     little dance. Alike laughs wanly.\r\n\r\n\r\n42   INT.

The thick, fierce\r\nguitar rhythms of Tamar-kali's \"Boot\" consume the room.

The doorbell rings and she\r\n     rushes across the room and opens the door in her most sing-\r\n     song voice.\r\n\r\n                            AUDREY\r\n               He-llooo.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               Hello Mrs. Freeman.

Equally bedecked\r\n     observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both\r\n     sides. Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone.

She shoves the phone\r\n     in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of\r\n     the evening. Brake lights bathe Laura and her circle of AG's\r\n     in red as late-night predators cruise the strip for fresh\r\n     meat. Laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an\r\n     alley across the street and looks away. One of the entourage\r\n     passes Laura a joint and she inhales deeply. A few of the\r\n     girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break\r\n     off and scatter into the night one by one.\r\n\r\n                         PIER GIRL #1\r\n               `Member when we used to stay out\r\n               here all night?\r\n\r\n                         PIER GIRL #2\r\n               Shit, used to?\r\n\r\n                         PIER GIRL #1\r\n               You stay with your sister now, huh?\r\n\r\n     Laura nods and spits.\r\n\r\n                         PIER GIRL #2\r\n               Lucky as hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n49   INT.

The desks are pulled\r\n     together in a rough circle and are filled with heavily\r\n     pierced, dyed hair, and vintage clothes types. Mrs. Alvarado\r\n     sits cross-legged atop her desk taking notes.

Just\r\n          take it.\r\n\r\nAlike summons the courage for one last swipe. She manages to\r\ngrab it but Bina doesn't let go right away.

Bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next\r\n     foray.

She leans in and pecks Alike on\r\n     the cheek. Alike lets the kiss soak in, glancing at Bina\r\n     sidelong. Bina leans in again, this time planting a long kiss\r\n     on Alike's lips. Alike pulls away. Bina tenses for the\r\n     verdict.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n               Why'd you do that for?\r\n\r\n                            BINA\r\n               Sorry---\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               No, I'm sorry.

LAURA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                          52\r\n\r\n     Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades. A\r\n     cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Laura's neck like a\r\n     PERSONAL CHEERLEADER. Music blasts from the TV but doesn't\r\n     drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage.\r\n     There is a knock at the door.\r\n                                                        65.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          You'll get that for me?\r\n\r\nOne of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door\r\nwithout greeting and walks away. Alike is left alone to\r\nescort herself in. Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at\r\nthe fringes of the pack.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Wassup man.\r\n\r\nA collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table\r\nalthough no one addresses Alike directly. Laura slams the\r\ntable and raises her hands in triumph.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Board, goddammit!! I told you!\r\n\r\n                    PIER GIRL #1\r\n          Awww, we shoulda been done set you!\r\n\r\nLaura slaps hands with her partner. The unlucky pair of\r\npartners argue. The personal cheerleader kisses Laura on the\r\nneck. Alike looks away.\r\n\r\n                    PERSONAL CHEERLEADER\r\n          Good game, baby!\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          What's good, Lee?\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Just came to say wassup.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Whatchu got, Ty?\r\n\r\n                    PIER GIRL #2\r\n          Three, maybe four.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          We goin' eight!!\r\n\r\nRoars of disbelief from around the table. Alike is quickly\r\nforgotten in the ruckus. Alike circles to Laura's side. The\r\npersonal cheerleader looks her up and down.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Can I talk to you for a second?\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Now I got to cut you!!

Alike endures another\r\n     few moments of card slapping, table pounding dejection before\r\n     leaning into Laura's ear.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               I really need to talk to you--\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               I said later!\r\n\r\n     Wide-eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table.\r\n     Laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up.\r\n     Alike picks up her face and slips away.\r\n\r\n                         PIER GIRL #3\r\n               Thought that was your girl?\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               Mind your business. Bam! That's\r\n               what I thought!\r\n\r\n     Laura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig\r\n     of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n53   INT. ALIKE'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        53\r\n\r\n     Audrey lies awake in bed. The clock on the nightstand\r\n     indicates a little past two in the morning. She looks at the\r\n     sliver of light underneath the bedroom door, the sound of\r\n     Arthur's key in the door breaks the silence. Arthur's voice\r\n     in hushed tones. Audrey rolls over and faces the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n54   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 54\r\n\r\n     Alike watches her father's footsteps break up the light\r\n     beneath her door.

My daughter's up.\r\n\r\n     Arthur flips his cell phone shut and tucks it into his\r\n     pocket. He fishes a beer out of the fridge.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Who was that?\r\n\r\n     Arthur sips his beer and walks over to the kitchen table. A\r\n     foil covered plate with a little pink sticky note waits.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               What you doing up?\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Just wanted to talk.\r\n\r\n     Arthur crumples the sticky note and tosses it into the trash\r\n     without reading it.

Laura tosses the pillow onto the\r\n     couch.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               My sister gets home at six so, you\r\n               gotta be gone by then.\r\n\r\n                         PIER GIRL #2\r\n               Good looking.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               There's some lunchmeat in there\r\n               too, help yourself.\r\n\r\n                         PIER GIRL #2\r\n               `Preciate ya.\r\n\r\n     Laura pulls up close to the kitchen table. The GED test prep\r\n     book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her.\r\n\r\n     She finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice\r\n     answers into a spiral notebook. A stack of old Math and\r\n     English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is\r\n     peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\n57   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                           57\r\n\r\n     Alike spies on Bina stuffing books into her locker. She draws\r\n     her breath and approaches.\r\n\r\n                           ALIKE\r\n               Hey.\r\n                                                          72.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BINA\r\n          Hey.\r\n\r\nA long awkward silence. Alike leans against the bank of\r\nlockers, not daring to make eye contact.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          I'm sorry about the other day.\r\n\r\n                       BINA\r\n          It's cool.\r\n\r\nBina pretends to rearrange books in her locker.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n          Things have been crazy.

FAMILY CAR - DAY                                        58\r\n\r\n     Arthur coaches Alike as she navigates the car to a jerky stop\r\n     in front of Mack's liquor store.\r\n\r\n                          ARTHUR\r\n               Easy, easy now. Watch your right\r\n               hand side.\r\n\r\n                            ALIKE\r\n               I am.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               Don't ride the brakes though.

Can I\r\n               drive back?\r\n\r\n     Arthur rubs his chest in mock heart-attack.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               I don't about that. You're shaky\r\n               girl, you're shaky. Get us some\r\n               chips and I'll think about it.\r\n\r\n     Arthur hands Alike a five dollar bill and she bounces down\r\n     out of the car.\r\n\r\n\r\n59   EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS                               59\r\n\r\n     Arthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic\r\n     chair outside his door. Sock and TWO OTHER MEN chit chat\r\n     nearby. Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches. Alike bops\r\n     into the store.\r\n\r\n                            MACK\r\n               Hey, baby!\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Hey Mr. Ferguson!\r\n\r\n                         MACK\r\n               I see Alike's been running circles\r\n               around you again!\r\n\r\n                          ARTHUR\r\n               Little bit, little bit. I still got\r\n               it though.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Arthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock\r\n     whispering to one of the men.\r\n                                                             74.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Arthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato\r\n     chip rack. She twirls the string of her basketball shorts\r\n     round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t-\r\n     shirt up over her nose. The smile evaporates from Arthur's\r\n     face.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Sock peers back at him, smirking. Arthur starts toward him,\r\n     when Alike saunters out between them.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               We better get going.\r\n\r\n                         MACK (CONT'D)\r\n               Gone already?\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               I'll holler at you later.\r\n\r\n     Arthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from\r\n     Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n               Get in the car.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               But you said I could drive--\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               I said get in the car!\r\n\r\n     Alike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the\r\n     store. She slumps into the car and slams the door. Arthur\r\n     piles into the driver's seat. They sit in silence for a\r\n     moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n60   INT.

Arthur\r\n     searches her face a moment longer, then starts the car and\r\n     pulls away in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n61   INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                   61\r\n\r\n     Audrey reclines on the couch reading a book. The doorknob\r\n     jiggles and Audrey folds the book against her chest,\r\n     pretending to be asleep.\r\n                                                           75.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair, not even\r\nbothering to approach Audrey's sleeping form.\r\n\r\nArthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of Audrey's\r\nfoil covered plates. He tosses it aside and gathers sandwich\r\ningredients instead. Audrey yawns and props herself up on one\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Oh you're home?\r\n\r\n                       ARTHUR\r\n          Hey.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          I must've dozed off.

Mom scoots over on the couch.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          There's room over here. You can see\r\n          the TV better.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          This is fine.\r\n\r\nArthur props his feet up on the coffee table and catches\r\nAudrey's hurt expression. He winks at her.\r\n\r\n                       ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n          Thank you.\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          Just alike.\r\n\r\n                       ARTHUR\r\n          Say what?\r\n                                                        76.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          You and your daughter.

She's hardly ever home in\r\n          the first place and you're just\r\n          like her, creeping in all hours of\r\n          the night. Both of you. Running\r\n          around like you got something to\r\n          hide, like I'm the big, bad witch\r\n          and what about me? I'm home by\r\n          myself all the time and Sharonda's\r\n          getting older and starting to go\r\n          out and pretty soon--\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          I don't have anything to hide.

Really? I'm not your dumb\r\n               damn floozy in the street. And you\r\n               will not talk to me that way.\r\n\r\n     Audrey slaps the sandwich off Arthur's plate and storms to\r\n     the bedroom. Arthur sees Sharonda peeking from her bedroom\r\n     door but can't summon any words. Sharonda skitters into\r\n     Alike's bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n62   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 62\r\n\r\n     Alike is awake, hands folded behind her head.

HOUSE PARTY/POETRY SLAM - NIGHT                         63\r\n\r\n     A MOHAWKED WOMAN yowls into a microphone atop a coffee table\r\n     turned stage. Kids roam from room to room nursing plastic\r\n     cups. Some in elaborate ensembles, some in thrift store duds,\r\n     others in plain old jeans, but no two people the same. Alike\r\n     clad in simple shirt and jeans looks especially comfortable\r\n     as she and Bina ease their way through the crowd. In between\r\n     performers, guitar riffs rock the large loft apartment and\r\n     render their voices practically inaudible.\r\n\r\n     MONTAGE:\r\n\r\n     --Bina introduces Alike to different people, Alike is\r\n     welcomed\r\n\r\n     --Alike & Bina point out different performers, they laugh and\r\n     talk in each other's ears\r\n\r\n     --Alike and Bina dance wildly in the middle of the crowd,\r\n     surrounded by dozens of other clamorous bodies\r\n\r\n     --One performer beckons Alike up onto the table, Alike demurs\r\n     at first, then leaps on top of the table. Bina cheers.\r\n\r\n     --Alike drags a giggling Bina out of the party and they crash\r\n     into the open night\r\n\r\n\r\n64   EXT. THE PIERS - NIGHT                                       64\r\n\r\n     Lights glisten across the Hudson River--distant orbs\r\n     reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak\r\n     defiance against the night sky. A sodium vapor glow veils\r\n     everything in generous haloes, making the night more\r\n     beautiful than it really is.\r\n\r\n     Dancing silhouettes, laughing, playing, yelling, flying,\r\n     always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with\r\n     clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house. Like Puck on a\r\n     midsummer's night, like Peter Pan and his lost boys. Among\r\n     the silhouettes is Laura, enthroned atop a railing. Laura,\r\n     smoking a joint grandly, surrounded by an adoring circle, a\r\n     sycophantic harem of four.\r\n                                                             79.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Laura, completely miserable as she watches two other\r\n     silhouettes drawing closer, spinning, collapsing, now\r\n     righting, always connected. Alike and Bina. Bina smiles and\r\n     snakes her arms around Alike's neck. Alike too shy to react,\r\n     giggles and folds. Laura watches the pair spin and passes to\r\n     the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n65   EXT. THE PIERS- CONTINUOUS                                65\r\n\r\n     Laura cuffs Alike on the neck, pulling Alike's hoodie up over\r\n     her face. Alike's laugh is tentative at first, not sure\r\n     whether this is play or for real. Laura chuckles, breaking\r\n     the ice. The pair slapbox and rough house, both missing with\r\n     wild arcing blows. Laura aims a mini charge at Alike that\r\n     lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance\r\n     away. Alike swipes Laura's hat. Laura claps Alike on the\r\n     shoulder and Alike waves to Bina. Bina waves and smiles.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               So whatchu you think? She's cool\r\n               right?\r\n\r\n     Laura looks around and shrugs. Laura plucks a fresh joint out\r\n     of her coat and lights it.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n               She's hot right? I told you. It was\r\n               so tight. I'm tellin' you, you\r\n               shoulda been there tonight!\r\n\r\n     Laura takes a puff and offers it to Alike.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               This one's just for me and you.\r\n\r\n     Alike waves it off, oblivious and intoxicated with the night.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               And she's smart, too. She does\r\n               poetry, you should hear it. It's\r\n               like, it's good, you know?\r\n\r\n     Laura stops walking and Alike skips ahead, still chattering.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n               I was thinking next weekend the\r\n               three of us could--\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               Look, I'm right here.\r\n\r\n     Alike snaps out of it.\r\n                                                        80.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh my bad, I thought you were\r\n          beside me. Anyway, I was thinking--\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          Look, I'm sorry for all the drama.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          No, it's cool. I shoulda--\r\n\r\n                     LAURA\r\n          What I'm saying is, I probably\r\n          overreacted.\r\n              (beat)\r\n          And then...I don't know. Seeing you\r\n          two together or whatever. I'm glad\r\n          to see you're finally happy.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          C'mon man, you know you're my best\r\n          friend. Nobody's gonna --\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          You don't need to say anything. I\r\n          just wanted to get it off my chest.\r\n          I'm happy for you, that's all.\r\n\r\nAlike shakes her head. Her mouth moves but nothing comes out.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          Because I love you, alright? And\r\n          I'm sayin'...I'm right here.\r\n\r\nAlike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off.\r\nLaura takes a long drag on the joint. Bina and Mika stumble\r\nover giggling. Bina hooks Alike's arm. Mika kisses Laura on\r\nthe neck. Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk\r\ncreeping back.\r\n\r\n                    MIKA\r\n          We goin' to get something to eat?\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          That's what's up.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Listen, umm--\r\n\r\nLaura pinches out the joint and hands it to Mika who tucks it\r\naway.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA\r\n          That's for later. Bina, nice to\r\n          meet you.\r\n                                                                81.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BINA\r\n                You too. We had fun.\r\n\r\n     Laura gives Bina a polite hug, pounds Alike on the shoulder\r\n     and starts to lead Mika away.\r\n\r\n                  MIKA                                 ALIKE\r\n     Byyeee!!                           Hey hold up!\r\n\r\n     Laura pumps a lazy    fist in the air in acknowledgement. Bina\r\n     takes Alike's hand    and slowly drags her away. Alike keeps\r\n     looking back, then    finally gives up. Laura looks back just as\r\n     Alike turns around    and disappears around the corner.\r\n\r\n                          BINA (CONT'D)\r\n                I like your friends. They're cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n66   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - LATER                                  66\r\n\r\n     Music videos play on the TV. Alike and Bina lay stretched out\r\n     on pillows, a plate of brownie crumbs between them. Alike\r\n     dozes. Bina smacks her with a pillow.\r\n\r\n                          ALIKE\r\n                I'm not sleep.\r\n\r\n                          BINA\r\n                Yes you are.\r\n\r\n     Alike rubs sleep out of her eyes and props herself up on one\r\n     elbow.\r\n\r\n                          ALIKE\r\n                Any brownies left?\r\n\r\n                            BINA\r\n                Nope.\r\n\r\n     Bina flicks off the TV and stares at Alike.\r\n\r\n                            ALIKE\r\n                What?\r\n\r\n                            BINA\r\n                Nothing.\r\n\r\n     Alike looks away.\r\n\r\n                            BINA (CONT'D)\r\n                What?\r\n\r\n                            ALIKE\r\n                Nothing.\r\n                                                             82.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alike folds her arms behind her head. Bina strokes Alike's\r\n     stomach. Her finger's dance at the top of Alike's pajama\r\n     bottoms. Their eyes meet. Alike sits bolt upright.\r\n\r\n                         BINA\r\n               What're you doing? What's wrong?\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               This is uh... I never... I'm sorry,\r\n               I'm trippin' out.\r\n\r\n                         BINA\r\n               It's okay. We don't have to.\r\n\r\n     Alike leans in and kisses Bina on the lips. Bina considers\r\n     and takes Alike's chin in her hand and kisses her back. Bina\r\n     places Alike's hand on her chest. Alike lets her hand linger,\r\n     then traces Bina's shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n67   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING                               67\r\n\r\n     Laura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the\r\n     mail. She pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it. The\r\n     return address reads \"NYS Educational & Testing Services\".\r\n     She flips the envelope over and looks around, she rips the\r\n     top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope. The\r\n     top of the slip reads \"'Campbell, Laura' GED TESTING\r\n     RESULTS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n68   EXT. BRONX HOME - MORNING                                    68\r\n\r\n     Laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a\r\n     small wooden frame home. The paint is peeling and the flowers\r\n     in the window-box are dead. A rusted metal mailbox next to\r\n     the door overflows with circulars. Laura lifts the circulars\r\n     out of the box and trashes them. She picks up a discarded\r\n     fast food bag and tosses it too. A dog barks from a\r\n     neighboring yard. Laura pulls open the screen door and tries\r\n     to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main\r\n     door, but it's covered over in aluminum foil. More barking.\r\n     Laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door. She\r\n     snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward.\r\n     Laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt. LAURA'S\r\n     MOTHER, 54, and no-nonsense opens the door and frowns down at\r\n     Laura through the screen.\r\n\r\n                         LAURA\r\n               Oh.\r\n\r\n     Laura's mother crosses her arms and looks at Laura up and\r\n     down.\r\n                                                        83.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          Thought you might've stepped out or\r\n          something? How've you been?\r\n\r\nLaura's mother frowns up and down the block before refocusing\r\non Laura. Laura takes a step closer to the door.\r\n\r\n                     LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          Me and Candy, you know we're doing\r\n          real good.\r\n\r\nLaura's mother puts her hand on the doorknob.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          We might even be moving to a bigger\r\n          place soon. You know she's workin'\r\n          at the hospital now, yeah you'd be\r\n          real proud of her. She might even\r\n          go back and get her RN--\r\n\r\nLaura takes another step forward.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          How--? How's Pops? You look good.\r\n          You look healthy, yeah you look\r\n          real good. You know uh, we miss you\r\n          and everything--\r\n\r\nLaura's mother starts to close the door. Laura backs away.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          I don't wanna take too much of your\r\n          time. I just stopped by--you know I\r\n          uh--I'm getting my stuff together\r\n          too--I uh--\r\n\r\nLaura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and\r\nadvances on the screen door again, holding it out.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          So, I did it. I took the test and--\r\n\r\nLaura's mother slams the door. Laura stands on her tiptoes\r\nand yells at the diamond shaped window.\r\n\r\n                    LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n          I got my GED!\r\n\r\nThe lock on the door snaps into place. Renewed barking from\r\nacross the street. Silence from the door. Laura brushes a\r\nfist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the\r\nmailbox.\r\n                                                             84.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LAURA (CONT'D)\r\n               But listen I--I gotta go. I gotta\r\n               get to work but I'ma leave it for\r\n               you to see. It was nice talking to\r\n               you.\r\n\r\n     Laura backs off the porch and starts down the walkway. She\r\n     stops halfway and bounds back onto the porch. She yanks the\r\n     envelope out of the mailbox and jams it into her pocket.\r\n     Laura storms off the porch and out of yard, never looking\r\n     back.\r\n\r\n\r\n69   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING                                69\r\n\r\n     Alike is asleep on the bed. Bina cleans up feverishly,\r\n     \"accidentally\" bumping Alike awake. Alike yawns and rolls\r\n     over, a huge grin spreading across her face as she remembers\r\n     her surroundings.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Hey.\r\n\r\n                         BINA\r\n               Hey.\r\n\r\n     Bina bolts to the dresser and crams clothes in.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               You up already?\r\n\r\n                         BINA\r\n               It's after one o'clock, actually.\r\n\r\n     Bina deposits an armful of clothes into the dirty clothes\r\n     hamper, and then begins making the bed with Alike still in\r\n     it. Alike pulls Bina down beside her.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               What's wrong?\r\n\r\n                         BINA\r\n               Nothin's wrong, I'm just cleaning\r\n               up. Don't worry about it.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Okay then, I'll help you.\r\n\r\n                         BINA\r\n               No, I got it.\r\n\r\n     Bina snatches a pillow from behind Alike and fluffs it.\r\n     Alike, still oblivious, grins and traces Bina's shoulder.\r\n                                                         85.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Look um--I just wanted to say that\r\n          last night...last night was\r\n          amazing...thank you for--\r\n\r\n                    BINA\r\n          Last night we were just playin'\r\n          around, that's all.\r\n\r\nBina flinches away from Alike's touch. Alike shoots a glance\r\nat the door and drops her voice to a choked whisper.\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Look... We can slow things down...\r\n          Nobody has to know that we're\r\n          together.\r\n\r\n                    BINA\r\n          \"Together\"? Whoa, no...\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Huh?! I thought...

Alike touches Bina's elbow, Bina flinches away.\r\n\r\n                    BINA\r\n          Look, I'm not gay okay? This isn't\r\n          me--I wasn't--I'm not ready for all\r\n          this...\r\n\r\nAlike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it\r\naround on the bed. Bina recoils and snatches it away.\r\nRecognition seeps across Alike's pained face. Bina moves away\r\nfrom the bed and turns her back on Alike.\r\n\r\nAlike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on.\r\nShe pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a\r\nsweatshirt down over her nightie. She flings her backpack\r\nopen on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering\r\nher things. Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an\r\narmful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag. Bina watches\r\nher, arms folded. Alike takes one last look around the room\r\nand heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face.\r\n\r\n                    BINA (CONT'D)\r\n          Lee?\r\n\r\nAlike ignores her and launches into the hallway.   Bina runs\r\nto her bedroom doorway.\r\n                                                             86.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BINA (CONT'D)\r\n               Wait--Lee?!\r\n\r\n     Alike beelines for the front door. Bina chases Alike across\r\n     the room.\r\n\r\n                         BINA (CONT'D)\r\n               Lee, stop please?\r\n\r\n     Alike wipes a sleeve across her swelling eyes and running\r\n     nose and turns to face her. Bina takes several steps toward\r\n     her. Alike lets go of the doorhandle, her voice cracks.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               What?\r\n\r\n                         BINA\r\n               You promise you won't tell anybody?\r\n\r\n\r\n70   EXT. BINA'S HOUSE/STREET - DAY                            70\r\n\r\n     Alike rages outside, weaving blind fury down the sidewalk.\r\n     She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out\r\n     into the street, narrowly missing getting hit by a car. She\r\n     continues her zag to the other sidewalk, her pace quickening.\r\n     She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into\r\n     the air. She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and\r\n     flings them into the street. Spinning and thrashing she\r\n     wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another\r\n     garbage can. She circles back and kicks the can over. She\r\n     hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds\r\n     her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of\r\n     a subway station.\r\n\r\n\r\n71   INT.

Alike slings off her\r\n     shirt and slams the door in Audrey's face. A livid Audrey\r\n     bangs on the door and jiggles the handle.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY (CONT'D)\r\n               You must have lost your damn mind!\r\n               Wait until your father gets home!\r\n\r\n\r\n72   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS                         72\r\n\r\n     Alike attacks her closet, ripping all the \"girly\" shirts from\r\n     the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan.\r\n     She plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the\r\n     floor. She launches a pair of pumps into the wall, followed\r\n     by a chunky pair of Timberlands. Silent sobs rack her body as\r\n     she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror. She\r\n     strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner.\r\n     Alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before\r\n     collapsing onto the bed. She writhes against the pillows and\r\n     covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist\r\n     through her body. Blackout.\r\n\r\n\r\n73   INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - LATER                              73\r\n\r\n     Alike jerks awake in her bed, a pillow pulled down around her\r\n     ears. The sound of a muffled argument leaks from her\r\n     parents's bedroom. The shouting gets louder, and Alike sits\r\n     upright in her bed as her father's footsteps boom past her\r\n     doorway and into the living room. Audrey's voice trails him\r\n     down the hallway, and Alike scrambles into a t-shirt and\r\n     shorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n74   INT. ALIKE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                        74\r\n\r\n     Arthur's hand is on the doorknob, a small tote flung over his\r\n     shoulder. Audrey blocks the door, her hands on her hips. They\r\n     both look up as Alike edges into the living room.\r\n                                                         88.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AUDREY\r\n          You see, that's exactly what I'm\r\n          talking about?!

Bina stares\r\n     out the window, completely detached.\r\n\r\n\r\n81   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON                              81\r\n\r\n     Audrey, still in her housecoat, stares into the refrigerator,\r\n     transfixed by the mountain of foil-covered plates. Her eyes\r\n     are cried-out buttons. Suddenly she remembers to breathe, and\r\n     her breaths come raggedly tearing out fresh tears. She yanks\r\n     a foil-covered plate, dumps its contents into the trash can\r\n     and tosses the plate into the sink. She dumps another and\r\n     another, her composure returning with each plate tossed. By\r\n     the time she gets to the last one, her breathing slows and\r\n     returns to normal. She disappears into the bedroom and\r\n     reappears with the red shopping bag. She calmly lifts out the\r\n     pink blouse and stuffs it into the garbage. She wads up the\r\n     shopping bag and stuffs it in too. She takes a deep breath\r\n     and wipes her sleeve across her nose.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n82   INT. ALIKE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                         82\r\n\r\n     Arthur, Audrey and Sharonda are pegged around the dinner\r\n     table. Audrey's make-up fails to cover the dark circles\r\n     beneath her eyes and Arthur has a week's worth of stubble.\r\n     There is a jagged hole where Alike usually sits. Noticing\r\n     the asymmetry, Audrey bundles up Alike's place setting and\r\n     sweeps it onto the floor. Sharonda looks from Audrey to\r\n     Arthur then into her plate.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               You want to say grace?\r\n\r\n     Arthur clears his throat.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               Heavenly Father...\r\n\r\n     Audrey thrusts her hands out to Arthur and Sharonda.   They\r\n     each take her hand and Arthur begins again.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n               Dear Heavenly Father we pray... we\r\n               pray thank you for this food and we\r\n               pray... we pray for your continued\r\n               blessing...\r\n\r\n     Arthur stops talking but his head remains bowed. An awkward\r\n     silence ensues. Audrey and Sharonda look up at him still\r\n     holding hands.\r\n                                                              96.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Amen!\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n               Amen.\r\n\r\n     Audrey switches to an overly cheery auto-pilot mode, babbling\r\n     to no one in particular.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               I got this recipe from a magazine.\r\n               Supposed to be very good. And you\r\n               see I made those green beans you\r\n               like. Sharonda pass the rice\r\n               please.\r\n\r\n     Sharonda, staring at her father doesn't reach for the bowl.\r\n\r\n                         SHARONDA\r\n               Dad. You know where she is.\r\n\r\n\r\n83   EXT. LAURA'S ROOFTOP - WEEKS LATER                         83\r\n\r\n     Alike and Laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart\r\n     of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Sunset paints the cityscape\r\n     pink and orange. The faint cadence of children playing drifts\r\n     in and out on a fickle breeze. Alike's wounds are healing and\r\n     she seems happy. The friends exchange wordless smiles and\r\n     soak in the peacefulness around them.\r\n\r\n     Laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate.\r\n     Arthur is standing in the doorway. Laura calls out to Alike.\r\n     Alike looks up and the smile fades from her face. Arthur\r\n     tries to move around Laura, but Laura stares him down. Laura\r\n     looks back at Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods.\r\n     Laura steps out of the way and watches Arthur pass.\r\n\r\n     Alike rises to face her father. She stands tall, her weight\r\n     is centered. Arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns\r\n     away from him. Distant playground voices fill the pause.\r\n\r\n\r\n     EXT. LAURA'S ROOFTOP - WEEKS LATER\r\n\r\n     Alike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook.\r\n     Laura swings open the door and Alike looks back in greeting,\r\n     her smile fading as Arthur appears behind her. Laura motions\r\n     to Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods. Laura steps\r\n     aside and watches Arthur pass.\r\n\r\n     Alike wanders to the edge of the roof, Arthur follows.\r\n     Distant playground voices fill the pause.\r\n                                                           97.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          Where's Mom?\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          She...your mother couldn't make it.\r\n\r\nAlike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline.\r\nArthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n          Remember our old place? Waaay out\r\n          in Queens? It was our first\r\n          apartment, we were so proud. Had\r\n          all those trees around it? In\r\n          October, the whooole block would be\r\n          covered with leaves. You remember.\r\n\r\nAlike makes no sign.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n          You couldnt've been more than 2\r\n          years old. And when the wind would\r\n          blow, all those leaves would come\r\n          rushing down the street at us and\r\n          you thought they were alive. You'd\r\n          get so scared. You'd cry and you'd\r\n          scream and beg for us to pick you\r\n          up. I would try and tell you\r\n          \"they're only leaves, baby\" and\r\n          make you stay on the ground. But\r\n          you were so afraid and you cried so\r\n          hard, your mother would always pick\r\n          you up. She always picked you up.\r\n\r\nArthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory. He dares a\r\nglance over at Alike.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n          `Member how we used to--\r\n\r\n                    ALIKE\r\n          I've been accepted into a early\r\n          college program.

A\r\n     bible and a daily devotional guide are spread open in front\r\n     of her. Alike knocks on the glass, and Audrey looks up\r\n     stunned. Alike comes in and sits across from her. Audrey\r\n     glances around, concerned about passing coworkers.\r\n\r\n                         ALIKE\r\n               Mom.\r\n\r\n                         AUDREY\r\n               Lee--Alike.
