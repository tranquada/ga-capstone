Why did they change it?\n\n<b>MR. M\n</b>I don't know.\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the \npieces.  But I never liked the Galactakons.  You only get one robot, \nand they don't come with a vehicle.  \n\n<b>MR. M\n</b>I see.\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>Plus you can't take them underwater.  And if you do they...Neat!\n\n<b>MR.

This is just terrific!\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>You're being paranoid Paul.\n\n<b>SCENE 37\n</b>\n<b>PAUL\n</b>These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind \nformat of eight over-lapping demographic groups.  Every region of the \ncountry was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to \n11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds.  \nWhen you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent \nmarket share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we \nshould see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total \nrevenue from all of last year.  Any questions?  Yes?  Yes?\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>I don't get it.\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>What exactly don't you get?\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>It turns from a building into a robot, right?\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>Precisely.\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>Well, what's fun about that?\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>Well, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our \nsuccess in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 \npercent in the last two years.  There, that might help.\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>Oh.\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>Yes?\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>I still don't get it.\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>What?!\n\n<b>MR. M\n</b>What don't you get Josh?\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>Well, there's a million robots that turn into something.  And this is a \nbuilding that turns into a robot.  So what's so fun about playing with \na building?  That's not any fun!\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>This is a skyscraper.\n\n<b>JOSH\n</b>Well, couldn't it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug \nor something?\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>A bug?\n<b>JOSH\n</b>Yeah!  Like a big prehistoric insect with maybe like giant claws that \ncould pick up a car and crush it like that!\n\n<b>MAN\n</b>A prehistoric transformer?\n\n<b>MR.

That man is a killer!\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>All he said was \"I don't get it.\"\n\n<b>PAUL\n</b>I don't get it!  I don't get!  I don't get!  He's going for the throat, \ntrying to eviscerate me!  Did you see the look on Macmillan's face?!\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>Mmm Hmm.\n\n<b>SCENE 39\n</b>\n<b>REALTOR\n</b>It's quite a unique space.  The lines are so clean and you don't get \nany of that partition quality.  It has 50-foot ceilings, all hardwood \nfloors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a brand new bathroom with \na jet stream jacuzzi.\n\n<b>BILLY\n</b>We'll take it.\n\n<b>SCENE 40\n</b>\n<b>MAN\n</b>Baskin.
