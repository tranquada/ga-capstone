And have them edit out all the commercials and talkin' and \nstuff?\n\nWOMAN\nYes Mr. Baskin.\n\nJOSH\nMiss Patterson.\n\nBILLY\nYou're the luckiest guy I know.\n\nSCENE 36\n\nPAUL\nDid you check Mattel?\n\nSUSAN\nNothing.\n\nPAUL\nColleco?\n\nSUSAN\nZero.\n\nPAUL\nHe can't come from nowhere Susan.  He has to come from somewhere.  How \nabout Hasbro?\n\nSUSAN\nYes.  And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.  I have called everywhere.  \nNobody's ever heard of him!\n\nPAUL\nGreat!\n\nSUSAN\nFace it Paul.  The guy comes from data processing.\n\nPAUL\nTerrific.  That is just terrific!  This is just terrific!\n\nSUSAN\nYou're being paranoid Paul.\n\nSCENE 37\n\nPAUL\nThese tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind \nformat of eight over-lapping demographic groups.  Every region of the \ncountry was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to \n11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds.  \nWhen you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent \nmarket share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we \nshould see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total \nrevenue from all of last year.  Any questions?  Yes?  Yes?\n\nJOSH\nI don't get it.\n\nPAUL\nWhat exactly don't you get?\n\nJOSH\nIt turns from a building into a robot, right?\n\nPAUL\nPrecisely.\n\nJOSH\nWell, what's fun about that?\n\nPAUL\nWell, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our \nsuccess in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 \npercent in the last two years.  There, that might help.\n\nJOSH\nOh.\n\nPAUL\nYes?\n\nJOSH\nI still don't get it.\n\nPAUL\nWhat?!\n\nMR. M\nWhat don't you get Josh?\n\nJOSH\nWell, there's a million robots that turn into something.  And this is a \nbuilding that turns into a robot.  So what's so fun about playing with \na building?  That's not any fun!\n\nPAUL\nThis is a skyscraper.\n\nJOSH\nWell, couldn't it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug \nor something?\n\nPAUL\nA bug?\nJOSH\nYeah!  Like a big prehistoric insect with maybe like giant claws that \ncould pick up a car and crush it like that!\n\nMAN\nA prehistoric transformer?\n\nMR. M\nInteresting.\n\nPAUL\nGentlemen!\n\nMAN\nSo the robot turns into a bug.\n\nPAUL\nAh, gentlemen, listen...\n\nMAN\nListen to him.  He's got a very good idea here.  The robot turns into a \nbug.\n\nMAN\nThis is a great idea!\n\nJOSH\nDifferent sizes and things.  And...you could have them wreck \nsomething...\n\nMAN\nA lady bug.  Transformers for girls!\n\nMR. M\nThis is a bug that moves....It's got all kinds of possibilities.\n\nPAUL\nThis doesn't just happen.  This doesn't happen.  You don't just come to \na meeting and say \"bugs.\"\n\nSUSAN\nI, uh....\n\nMR. M\nWell done, Josh.  Well done.\n\nSCENE 38\n\nPAUL\nHo! Ho! Ho!  He is vicious!  \n\nSUSAN\nHe's not vicious.\n\nPAUL\nOh, come on Susan, don't kid yourself.  That man is a killer!\n\nSUSAN\nAll he said was \"I don't get it.\"\n\nPAUL\nI don't get it!  I don't get!  I don't get!  He's going for the throat, \ntrying to eviscerate me!  Did you see the look on Macmillan's face?!\n\nSUSAN\nMmm Hmm.\n\nSCENE 39\n\nREALTOR\nIt's quite a unique space.  The lines are so clean and you don't get \nany of that partition quality.  It has 50-foot ceilings, all hardwood \nfloors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a brand new bathroom with \na jet stream jacuzzi.\n\nBILLY\nWe'll take it.\n\nSCENE 40\n\nMAN\nBaskin.  Rental delivery!\n\nJOSH\nDear Mom and Dad.  They said that I could write you and let you know I \nwas okay.  So far, they're treating me fine.  I've got enough to eat \nand I'm perfectly safe.  They say that I'll get out of here in about a \nmonth.  In the mean time, it's a lot like camp!  I watch TV and even \nget outside once in a while.  I know you miss me.  But try not to \nworry.  I think this experience might even be good for me.  I love you \nvery much and I know that I'll see you soon.  Your son, Joshua.  P.S.  \nGive Rachel a kiss from her big brother.\n\nSCENE 41\n\nWOMAN\nIt's very beautiful and I'm having a lovely time.\n\nMR. M\nI'm glad Miss Patterson.\n\nWOMAN\nIt's much better than last year.  I just wanted to tell you that.\n\nMR. M\nI'll have another scotch....Susan.\n\nSUSAN\nLove your tux.\n\nMR. M\nI think it's the same as the maitre's.\n\nSUSAN\nHave you decided what you're doing on the Danberry line?\n\nMR. M\nNo, I haven't.\n\nSUSAN\nWell, uh, I think if you got everyone's input up front, I mean right \nfrom the beginning....\n\nMR. M\nSusan, have a drink.\n\nSUSAN\nWhat?\n\nMR. M\nHave a couple drinks.  It's a party.\n\nSCENE 42\n\nMR. M\nJosh!  Glad you could make it.\n\nMAN\nBet he gets another raise.\n\nMR. M\nNow that's what I call a tuxedo.\n\nJOSH\nI rented it.  This is a real bow tie though.  I tied it myself.  And \nthat's why I was late.\n\nMR. M\nNo, you're not late at all.  Come on, let me show you around.\n\nJOSH\nHey, there's Miss Patterson!  Hi!  There's the guy from the meeting!  \nHi!\n\nSCENE 43\n\nPAUL\nThe guy's a damn knock-off artist.\n\nMAN\nWhat do you mean?\n\nPAUL\nThe Amphibian?  He takes 10,000 G. I. Joes, slaps some gills on them, \nwebs their feet, and packages them in seaweed....So I show him the \nschedule and he says, \"It's not correct accounting procedure!\"  Give me \na goddamn break!\n\nMAN\nBut the toy sold Paul.\n\nSUSAN\nExcuse me.\n\nSCENE 44\n\nSUSAN\nHi.\n\nJOSH\nHi.\n\nSUSAN\nAll the same people having all the same discussion.  It's like they \ncloned some party in 1983 and kept spinning it out again and again and \nagain.  I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll line.  \n\nJOSH\nThanks.\n\nSUSAN\nThey were so, incisive.  It's Beluga.  Macmillan orders it every \nyear....You all right?  You okay?  You want a glass of water?  You want \nsomething to drink?\n\nJOSH\nCould I have a milkshake or something?\n\nSUSAN\nI've got a car outside.  You want to get out of here?\n\nJOSH\nUh Huh.\n\nSUSAN\nLet's go.\n\nSCENE 45\n\nSUSAN\nI'm not really a big one for parties.  You know, I like things that are \na little more intimate.  \n\nJOSH\nWow!  Is this your car?\n\nSUSAN\nWell, it's the company's car.\n\nJOSH\nOh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen!\n\nSUSAN\nI mean, just seeing someone in the office, you don't really get a \nchance to know them.  I mean, just being with you here tonight, I \nreally get a sense of who you are.\n\nJOSH\nAre you gonna eat these fries?\n\nSUSAN\nNo. No....\n\nJOSH\nHey mister?  You want some of these fries?  We're not going to eat \nthem.\n\nDRIVER\nNo, thank you.\n\nSUSAN\nYou see, it's hard in a business situation...I mean there's this \ninvisible line and even you're attracted to someone...What, are you \ngoing to call someone before...?\n\nJOSH\nNo.\n\nSUSAN\nUh, I mean at this point in my life I...Don't...Don't play with the \nradio...Leave the uh...Don't...I'm really vulnerable right now!

I knew that there had to be \nsomething!\n\nJOSH\nNo.  No.  Susan, I'm not married.\n\nSUSAN\nYou're not?\n\nJOSH\nNo.  I'm a child!\n\nSUSAN\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\nI'm a child Susan, and I'm not ready for all this.\n\nSUSAN\nOh that's fine.  That is just great!\n\nJOSH\nWell, you see what happened....\n\nSUSAN\nNo.  I understand.  I'm not ready to make a commitment!\n\nJOSH\nNo!  No!  No!\n\nSUSAN\nI'm not ready to accept responsibility!\n\nJOSH\nNo!  You don't understand!  I mean, I'm thirteen years old!\n\nSUSAN\nOh!  And who isn't?  You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside \nof me, too!\n\nJOSH\nNo!  I mean I really am thirteen!  I went to bed one night and I was a \nkid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up.\n\nSUSAN\nOh right!  And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails!  Why \nare you doing this Josh?\n\nJOSH\nThere was this carnival in New Jersey.  I made a wish on this machine.  \nIt was called a Zoltar Machine...\n\nSUSAN\nOh stop it!\n\nJOSH\nIt was called a Zoltar Machine!  It had this bobbing head that looked \njust like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you \ncould make a wish and I did!  So I made a wish to be big!  That is what \nI'm trying to tell you!  I changed into a grown up but I'm really just \na kid!\n\nSUSAN\nFine Josh!  You're a kid!  Look, I really don't know what it is that \nyou're trying to tell me.  But we have a very big presentation to give \ntomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep.\n\nSCENE 70\n\nBILLY\nJosh?  Josh!  Oh, hi Mrs. Baskin.\n\nMOM\nHi.  I was just looking around and...Your hair is getting longer.\n\nBILLY\nI got it cut yesterday.\n\nMOM\nHe had a birthday.\n\nBILLY\nYeah, I know.  He'll be coming back real soon.  Everything is going to \nbe okay.\n\nMOM\nThanks.\n\nBILLY\nGoodnight.\n\nSCENE 71\n\nBILLY\nRight there.  Sea Point Park, New York!  Well?\n\nJOSH\nYes?\n\nWOMAN\nThey're waiting for you Mr. Baskin.\n\nJOSH\nThanks.\n\nBILLY\nSee you around.\n\nSCENE 72\n\nJOSH\nThere's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it.  \nAnd when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what \nthe character's going to do...Like if he going to go in and fight the \ndragon then you have to push one of the buttons.\n\nPAUL\nExcuse me.\n\nJOSH\nPaul.\n\nPAUL\nI don't get it.\n\nJOSH\nWell, it's a comic book that....\n\nSUSAN\nSee, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when \nyou reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes.  That's \nthe point.\n\nMR. M\nTerrific Susan.\n\nSUSAN\nA kid makes his own decision.\n\nMR. M\nThis is really possible?\n\nSUSAN\nYeah.  In fact, it's a very simple program.  Isn't that right?\nMAN\nSo what happens when you run out of choices?\n\nSUSAN\nWell, that's the great thing.  You can just sell different adventures.  \nJust pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options.\n\nMAN\nWe could market this on a comic book rack.\n\nJOSH\nI'll be right back.\n\nSCENE 73\n\nMR. M\nHow much would the unit cost?\n\nSUSAN\nWell, our initial figure is around...around $7.00, with a retail cost \nof around $18.95.\n\nPAUL\nYou expect a kid to pay $19.00 for a comic book?\n\nSUSAN\nI think a kid....Would you excuse me?\n\nSCENE 74\n\nSUSAN\nJosh!  Josh!\n\nSCENE 75\n\nJOSH\nWill you take me to Sea Point Park, New York?\n\nBILLY\nSea Point Park?  Josh!....Josh!  Josh!...Yes!\n\nSCENE 76\n\nSUSAN\nExcuse me.  You know him?  You know Josh?\n\nBILLY\nYeah.\n\nSUSAN\nLook, you have to tell me where he went.\n\nBILLY\nWho are you?\n\nSUSAN\nI'm his girlfriend.\n\nBILLY\nBilly Kopecky.\n\nSUSAN\nLook, you have to tell me where he went.  Where did he go?  Please, \ntell me.  Tell me!\n\nSCENE 77\n\nJOSH\nWork!  Damn it!....I wish I was a kid.\n\nSUSAN\nJosh!\n\nJOSH\nSusan!\n\nSUSAN\nYou know, you don't walk out on somebody!  You don't just get up and \nleave and walk out like that!  You don't do that!\n\nJOSH\nI know.  I know.  I'm really sorry.  I'm really sorry but I didn't know \nwhat to do.  I didn't know what to say.\n\nSUSAN\nOh God.  You got your wish.\n\nJOSH\nI tried to tell you.\n\nSUSAN\nI didn't listen, I guess.  I didn't hear you...\n\nJOSH\nI tried to tell you last night.\n\nSUSAN\n...or want to...or how would I have...or even if I did listen, why \nwould I know?  Why would I know that?!\n\nJOSH\nI've been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to \ngo home but there is only one reason for me to stay.\n\nSUSAN\nWhat?  What reason is that?\n\nJOSH\nWell, you...Oh, come on.  Don't cry.\n\nSUSAN\nSo, what are you?  15?  16?\n\nJOSH\nI'm 13.\n\nSUSAN\nWell, that explains it.\n\nJOSH\nMaybe you could come with me.\n\nSUSAN\nNo.  No.\n\nJOSH\nWhy not?\n\nSUSAN\nI've been there before.  It's hard enough the first time.  You know \nwhat I mean?  You don't know what I mean....Come on, I'll drive you \nhome.\n\nJOSH\nI'm sorry.\n\nSUSAN\nNo, I'll be okay.  You'll be fine.  In ten years, who knows?  Maybe you \nshould hold on to my number.\n\nSCENE 78\n\nSUSAN\nSo this is where you live.  Which one is it?\n\nJOSH\nThe one right there.\n\nSUSAN\nOh.  It's nice.  I'm gonna miss you.\n\nJOSH\nI'm gonna miss you, too.\n\nSUSAN\nYou won't even remember me.\n\nJOSH\nOh yes I will.\n\nSCENE 79\n\nJOSH\nMom?  Hello!\nMOM\nJosh?  Josh!  Josh!  Oh my God!  Oh, thank God you're home!\n\nJOSH\nOh Ma, I missed you all so much!\n\nSCENE 80\n\nJOSH\nI'm just not good enough.\n\nBILLY\nWhat are you talking about?  You've been hitting the ball over the \nfence almost every time in stick ball.  You just got to get used to a \nfatter bat.\n\nJOSH\nYou really think I could do it?\n\nBILLY\nYeah!\n\nJOSH\nCome on.  We'll hit some after supper.\n\nBILLY\nOkay.
