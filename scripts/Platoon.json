Nothing seems to \nlive or move in the midday sun.\n\n<b>TITLES RUN\n</b>\nA DOZEN NEW RECRUITS step off the plane, unloading their duffel \nbags, looking around like only the new can look around, their \nhair regulation-clipped, crisp, new green fatigues fitting them \nlike cardboard.\n\nCHRIS TAYLOR is just another one of them - as he turns into a \ntight closeup, to look at a motorized cart pulling up alongside \n... He's about 21.  Newmeat.  His face, unburned yet by the sun, \nis tense, bewildered, innocent, eyes searching for the truth.\n\nThey fall now on a heap of BODY BAGS in the back of the cart.  \nTwo soldiers begin loading them onto the plane.  Flies - hundreds \nof flies - buzz around them, the only cue to their contents.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGARDNER\n</b>\t\t(next to Chris, Southern accent)\n\tThat what I think it is?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSOLDIER 1\n</b>\t\t(a look)\n\tI guess so ...\n\nAn uncomfortable look between them.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSERGENT\n</b>\tOkay, let's go ...\n\nAs they move out, Chris' eyes moving with the body bags being \nloaded onto the plane.  Moving over now to a motley HALF DOZEN \nVETERANS bypassing them on their way to the plane.  They look \nhappy.  Very happy, chatting it up.\n\nThey pass the newboys - and they shake their heads, their eyes \nfull of an almost mocking pity.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVETERANS\n</b>\tWell I'll be dipped in shit - new meat!  Sorry bout \n\tthat boys - 'sin loi' buddy ... you gonna love the \n\tNam, man, for-fucking-ever.\n\nChris looking at them.  They pass, except for the last man who \nwalks slower than the rest, a slight limp.  His eyes fall on \nChris.\n\nThey're frightening eyes, starved, hollow, sunken deep in his \nface, black and dangerous.  The clammy pallor of malaria clings \nto him as he looks at Chris through decayed black teeth.  Then \nthe sun flares out on him and he's past.  And Chris looks back.  \nDisturbed.  It's as if the man was not real.  For a moment there.  \nAs if he were a ghost.\n\nChris walking, duffel bag on the shoulder, looks up at the \nlollipop sun burning a hole through the sky.  A rushing SOUND \nnow.  Of frightening intensity, an effect combining the blast of \nan airplane with the roar of a lion as we hardcut to:\n\n<b>EXT. JUNGLE - SOMEWHERE IN VIETNAM - DAY\n</b>\nThe sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we move \ndown into thick green jungle.  We hear the sound of MEN coming, a \nlot of men.  The thwack of a machete.  Brush being bulled.  We \nwait.  They are getting close.\n\nThe CREDITS continue to run.\n\nSUBTITLE reads: December 1967 - Bravo Company, 25th Infantry \nDivision - Somewhere near the Cambodian Border.\n\nA sweating white face comes into view. CHRIS - cutting point.  \nMachete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, M-16 in \nthe other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat exhaustion.  \nBreathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into \nthings, tripping, not quite falling, he looks pathetic here in \nthe naturalness of the jungle.  An urban transplant, slightly \nneurotic and getting more so.\n\nHis rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed \npounds banging noisily.\n\nBehind him BARNES now comes, the Platoon Sergeant.  Then the RTO, \nhis radio man, humming lightly.  Others are behind, the column \nsnaking back deep into the brush.\n\nWe cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen later.  \nYoung faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the field, exhausted \nyet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn, personalized, hair \nway past regulation length, medals, bandanas.  A jungle army.  \nBoys.\n\nChris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. Transfers the \nmachete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand.  The kid \ncuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of \nstrength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not \neven bothering to look ahead.  He smells something, looks around, \nslows his pace, eyes working ... around to the base of a tree.  \nHe moves past it.\n\nAnd as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around on a dead \ndecomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets, \nworms and flies feasting.\n\nChris draws his breath in, terrified.  Barnes suddenly appears \nalongside, his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook \nto Chris.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tWhat are you waiting for?  He ain't gonna bite you.  \n\tMove out.\n\nChris looks at him with pent-up hatred and crashes on.\n\n<b>EXT. PLATOON PC - DAY - MOVING\n</b>\nAt the COMPANY PC, CAPTAIN HARRIS on the radio.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRIS\n</b>\tBravo Two, Six.  What's the delay up there, move it \n\tout on point.  We've got a link up at Phase Line \n\tWhiskey at One Eight Zero Zero, over.\n\n<b>EXT. PLATOON PC - DAY - MOVING -- MORNING\n</b>\nAt the PLATOON PC, LIEUTENANT WOLFE sweats heavily as he speaks \nin his radio.  He is also new to the field, a dark little feisty \nguy, about 24, very hairy, especially in the eyebrows, an intense \nget-ahead look.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLIEUTENANT WOLFE\n</b>\tTwo Bravo, Two move it out.  Six says we're jamming \n\t'em up back there.  Over.\n\nBarnes, upfront, turns to SAL, his radio man, under his breath.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tTell that dipshit to get fucked.  Get that other \n\tfreshmeat up here.  Gardner.\n\nAs Barnes picks up his pace, irritated now at this reprimand from \nthe CO - coming up on Chris, who is soaked now from head to foot \nin sweat, dizzy, feeling sick, about to vomit.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWhat the hell's the matter with you Taylor!  You a \n\tsorry ass motherfucker.  Fall back.\n\nHe grabs Chris's machete out of his hand and bulls his way into \nthe foliage, tearing it apart, setting a new pace.\n\nChris being bypassed by the column, their eyes on him.  He is \nswatting at the red ants that are all over his neck.\n\nGARDNER, another new recruit, fat, hustling up to replace him.\n\nA big and black medic - DOC - comes over, gentle eyes and manner; \nwith him is Sergeant ELIAS, concerned.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOC\n</b>\tYou okay?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\tAnts.  I got ants on my neck ...\n\t\t(shaking them out)\n\n<b>\t\t\tDOC\n</b>\t\t(helping him)\n\tYeah, black ants are killers, you look sick man.  You \n\tneed a little salt.\n\t\t(reaching into his satchel)\n\nSergeant Elias, a handsome, graceful dark-haired Indian kid of \n23, the squad sergeant, is taking items out of Chris' pack - air \nmattress, extra unnecessary clothing, extra canteens, grenades, \ngas mask, books.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\t\t(shaking his head, amused)\n\tYou're humping way too much, troop, don't need half \n\tthis shit.  I'll haul it for you but next time you \n\tcheck it out with me okay?\n\nChris nodding, grateful, panting.\n\nThe men passing, watching.  Chris sorry about this, trying to \nkeep up face.\n\nBUNNY, a young 18 year-old with an angel's face, is pissing in \nthe dead gook's face.\n\nKING passes, glances at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKING\n</b>\tYou're a sick mother Bunny.\n\nBunny laughing about it.\n\nChris standing there one moment, fighting for his breath, \nsuddenly passes out, going over with his 70 pound rucksack, \nhitting the ground with a loud bang.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\t\t(concerned)\n\tHold it up.\n\nOn Chris - his eyes opening.  He seems all right.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t\t(trying to get up)\n\tI'm okay ... I'm okay.\n\nChris crumples backwards.  Elias helps him.\n\n<b>EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - DUSK\n</b>\nThe COMPANY - about 100 men who seem insignificant amid the size \nof the surrounding jungle - is digging into a perimeter of some \n100-yard radius.  A RESUPPLY CHOPPER lifts off in a flurry of \nblowing leaves.  Bare-chested soldiers chop down trees, clear \nfields of fire, set out claymores, fill sandbags, chow down.  \nLittle fires snake up against the greying red horizon.\n\n<b>EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER 31 - DOC'S POSITION - DUSK\n</b>\nWe cut close on a pair of grungy feet - the staple of the \ninfantry - moving up to DOC, the Medic, bandaging them for FU \nSHENG, a Hawaiin kid.\n\n<b>EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - RHAH'S POSITION - DUSK\n</b>\nRhah sets his tripflare.  Crawford, with him, putting out a \nclaymore.\n\n<b>EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - RODRIGUEZ - POSITION - DUSK\n</b>\nBack in the perimeter RODRIGUEZ sets his M-60 in the newly dug \nfoxhole.  SAL, next to him, is shaving in his helmet.\n\n<b>EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - KING'S POSITION - DUSK\n</b>\nKING looks like a king.  A lion of a black man but with a sleepy, \ngentle face, not to be roused, is painfully trying to scrawl a \nletter home with the pencil held awkwardly, mouthing the words.  \nFRANCIS, a young baby-faced black with long lashes and soft eyes, \npeeks over his shoulder, shaking his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS\n</b>\tShit, King, it ain't d-e-r-e man, it's d-e-a-r, and \n\tSara don't have no two r's in it, fool.  Shame on \n\tyou.\n\nKing shrugs, a sleepy stoned voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKING\n</b>\tDon't matter, she knows what it means ... an she \n\tdon't read too good nohow ...\n\n<b>EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - COMPANY PC - DUSK\n</b>\nSgt. Elias washes himself, attentive to his body, slender and \nwell-muscled, and extremely handsome youth.  Of Indian blood, \nwith long black hair, generous smile, wide facial bone structure, \ngypsy eyes, and the cleanest white teeth, he could be a young \nGreek god.  He is given somewhat to panache, a silver wristband \non his arm, a bandana of black parachute silk hanging from his \nneck, his fatigues tightened down at the ankle, he pulls his \npants down, checking for crotch rot, applying talcum powder to \nthe area, his buttocks facing us.\n\nLERNER, a white kid, 19, from Florida, stopping to admire the \nfrontal view.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\tMumm, any time sweetheart.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\tLerner, you'd choke to death on it.\n\n<b>EXT. COMPANY PERIMETER #1 - COMPANY PC - DUSK\n</b>\nAt the COMPANY COMMAND POST a beehive of activity with its four \nradios, personnel, some Vietnamese scouts milling around.  \nCAPTAIN HARRIS is running down a field map with his THREE \nLIEUTENANTS.  Harris, a broad-shouldered fine-looking military \nspecimen with the requisite Southern accent and football coach \nmannerism, is directing his remark to 2nd Platoon's LT.WOLFE, who \nlooks a little nervous.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN HARRIS\n</b>\tSky Six reports a fresh company of NVA moving across \n\tfrom Cambodia to this blue line.\n\t\t(points to position)\n\tWe got a good chance to light 'em up tonight.  All \n\tplatoons will set squad-size ambushes before full \n\tdark.  Lt. Wolfe\n\t\t(glances at him)\n\tYou 'bush in this area near that ol' Buddhist temple \n\twe passed on the hump in.  Lt. Hawkins, you take this \n\tarea in the rubber plantation...\n\n<b>\t\t\tLIEUTENANT WOLFE\n</b>\t\t(eager)\n\tNo problem sir ...\n\n<b>EXT. PLATOON PERIMETER #1 - CHRIS' FOXHOLE - DUSK\n</b>\nElsewhere, Chris scrapes out a foxhole, his shirt off, bandana \naround his head, the work hot and heavy.\n\nTEX is out there setting the claymore as BIG HAROLD and JUNIOR \nstart breaking down their C's.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\t\t(a whining high voice)\n\tHey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake \n\tman.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\t\t(laughes loudly)\n\tFuck you bitch.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\tC'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you \n\tthe turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\tTricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is \n\tnobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start \n\tyour game playing with me Junior.\n\nThey're both black, Junior with huge goggle eyes and a face of \npimples and pockmarks, his teeth yellowed and decayed, some of \nthem missing.  Harold is about twice his size, about 250 pounds, \na baby huey concentrating real hard on preparing his stove to eat \nwith.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\tYouse a pig man.  I hope Manny get dat laundry gig \n\tfor' you do.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\tDe fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known \n\tfor his thinking.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\tHe's a fool alright but you a bigger fool.  Hey, \n\twhiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna \n\tdig itself ...\n\nChris looks up, continues working, as Junior chuckles.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass \n\ttoday.  I killed a shit-eating dog.\n\t\t(laughing)\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\t\t(getting up)\n\tThat reminds me, I gotta take a shit.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\tYou gonna wipe your ass dis time?\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\tYeah if you let me have your shirt.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t\t(VOICE OVER, as he digs)\n\tSomebody once wrote Hell is the impossibility of \n\tReason.  That's what this place feels like.  I hate \n\tit already and it's only been a week.  Some goddamn \n\tweek, grandma ...\n\t\t(checking his raw blisters)\n\t... the hardest thing I think I've ever done is to go \n\ton point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what \n\tI'm doing.  A gook could be standing 3 feet in front \n\tof me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.  We get \n\tup at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m., \n\tdig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or \n\ta 3-man listening post in the jungle.  It's scary \n\tcause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm \n\tnew and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't \n\teven want to know your name.  The unwritten rule is a \n\tnew guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't \n\tput his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna \n\tget killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the \n\tfirst few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer \n\tthat much.  I can believe that ... If you're lucky \n\tyou get to stay in the perimeter at night and then \n\tyou pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 \n\thours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't \n\tthink I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I \n\tthink I've made a big mistake coming here ...\n\nAs he speaks, we cut around to various shots of the platoon \nmembers on the perimeter - shaving, eating, cooking, playing, etc \n<b>...\n</b>\n<b>EXT. PLATOON PC - NIGHT\n</b>\nTowards the end of this voice over, we cut to Sgt. BARNES moving \ntowards the PLATOON PC.  A powerful face, a quiet, angry fixed \nstare, a thick trimmed moustache that helps conceal a network of \nplastic surgery grafts and scars.  The distortion from the jaw up \nthe left side of his face to his forehead, punctuated by a severe \nindentation above the left eye where a bullet once penetrated his \nskull.\n\nWalking with him is Sgt. O'NEILL as they join WOLFE, Sgts. ELIAS \nand WARREN at the PLATOON PC where they're huddled over maps.  \nWarren is a black, thin, tall, paranoid man with untrusting eyes, \nsilent and bitter.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\t\t(to all, almost pleased about it)\n\tWe got boo-coo movement.  3rd Battalion just got hit \n\t15 kliks north of here.\n\t\t(the MEN react with wary silence)\n\n<b>\t\t\tO'NEILL\n</b>\t\t(eager to elaborate)\n\tYeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew \n\ta whole fucking platoon to pieces.  BAAD SHIT.\n\nBarnes inflects his next words at Wolfe, who is worried.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tYeah, they got two Lieutenants and a Captain.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWOLFE\n</b>\tJesus.\n\nElias quiet.  Barnes studying the map.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWOLFE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(to Barnes)\n\tWho do you want on ambush, Sergeant?\n\nBarnes doesn't bother acknowledging the question, barely glancing \nat the Lieutenant, to him a necessary evil.  Everybody knows \nwho's really in charge of the Platoon.  Barnes flicks his gaze to \nElias.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tElias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and \n\tFrancis from your squad.\n\t\t(to Warren)\n\tWe move out in two-zero mikes.\n\t\t(concluding)\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\tI thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.\n\nThey all look at each other.  O'Neill spits in the dust, a \nfreckled, short red head with a hard worried face, a lifer, 30 \ngoing on 60.\n\n<b>\t\t\tO'NEILL\n</b>\tShit!  Morehouse and Sal are short.  Fu Sheng's going \n\ton R&amp;R, you don't want to send their asses out on an \n\tambush.  You got the fresh meat Elias.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\t\t(to Barnes)\n\tThey don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna \n\trun into something.\n\n<b>\t\t\tO'NEILL\n</b>\tSo what am I going to do!  Get one of my guys zapped \n\tso some fuckface fresh from the World can get his \n\tbeauty fucking sleep!\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\tHey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to \n\tbe a prick everyday of your life, you know.\n\n<b>\t\t\tO'NEILL\n</b>\tFuck you Elias.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tYou get your men ready Elias ...\n\nConcluding the debate, no further argument, Barnes rises.  The \nmeeting's closed.  Lt. Wolfe hasn't said a word, looking as Elias \ndeparts, without a word.\n\n<b>\t\t\tO'NEILL\n</b>\t\t(watching him)\n\tFucking guy's got 3 years in and he thinks he's \n\tCochise or something ...\n\nHis resentment directed partly at the way in which Elias carries \nhimself, the natural sense of grace - and the dignity it bestows.\n\n<b>\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. PLATOON PERIMETER #1 - SQUAD ASSEMBLY POINT - DUSK\n</b>\nLater.  On the very edge of the perimeter, darkness coming down \nfast, the men in the ambush patrol rustle into their packs, all \nof them bitching.\n\nTex, carrying the M-60, looks up at the glowering sky.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEX\n</b>\tShit, looks like rain.  All night too.  Gonna grow \n\tmushrooms in your bad-ass crotch Junior.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\t\t(under his breath)\n\tGoddamn ain't no justice round here, you break your \n\tass for de white man ... gonna get our act together, \n\tdo some rappin' wid de brothers, change things ...\n\n<b>\t\t\tCRAWFORD\n</b>\tWhat's O'Neill have a nose up the lieutenant's ass \n\talready, how come we always get ambush.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS\n</b>\tPolitics, man, politics.  We always getting fucked \n\taround here.\n\nChris is scared, nervous with his last-minute equipment \nadjustments, his pack obviously overweight for a night mission as \nhe hauls it up.\n\nGardner, the other new boy, is jovial in contrast, his wallet \nextended towards Chris.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGARDNER\n</b>\tHey Chris, I show you a picture of Lucy Jean?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t\t(not to be bothered)\n\tNo ...\n\nGardner shows him his girl.  She's real dog u-g-l-y, and what \nmakes it worse is Gardner's put the standard photo of Raquel \nWelch alongside it, tits and all.  But he misses the irony of it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGARDNER\n</b>\t\t(admiring)\n\tYeah she's the one all right ... that's Lucy Jean.  \n\tShe's a-waiting for me.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t\t(nodding)\n\tYeah she's real pretty, you're lucky ...\n\nGardner puts it away.  Elias appears alongside them, checking \ntheir packs out, takes out Chris's poncho liner and other items.  \nHe carries a modified M-16 with a short barrel and a collapsible \nstock.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\t\t(to both boys)\n\tDon't need this or this ... you're doing okay.  Just \n\tstick close to Tex, do what he does.\n\t\t(calling out to Tex)\n\tTex you got Junior and Taylor here on your position.\n\nTex is a sour Texas Ranger type, chews tobacco, spits.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEX\n</b>\tDamn, 'Lias this gun's boss.  Put Taylor someplace \n\telse.\n\nChris feels the words like lashes on him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\tYou got Taylor ...\n\t\t(to Gardner)\n\t... Gardner you go with me\n\t\t(to Chris and Gardner)\n\t 'Case somethin' happens to you, you get separated or \n\tlost don't yell out okay.  Sit tight.  We'll get to \n\tyou.\n\nHis eyes.  Chris watching them.  A smile in them.  Elias moves \noff, a quality to the man that Chris admires.  A natural sense of \nleadership.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tOkay, let's move out.\n\nAs he follows King, on point, out the perimeter.  A single file.\n\n<b>EXT. THE AMBUSH NIGHT (RAIN)\n</b>\nNight is coming down.  The tone of the jungle sounds has subtly \nshifted - mellower, more sinuous and certainly scarier.\n\nThe file stops.  King, an experienced point man, listens.\n\nChris - carrying Tex's linked ammo - looks around, tense.  Behind \nhim is Gardner, trying to smile, starts to whisper something \n('Hey Taylor ...') when he's abruptly shushed.\n\nThe file moves on.  Gardner's pack rattling a little too loud.  A \nweird rush of cold wind now rattles the trees and the MONSOON \ncomes.  A hard slanting rain, sudden, tropic.\n\n<b>EXT. RUINS - JUNGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)\n</b>\nA piece of an old Buddhist temple, under a sulky moonlight now in \na state of decay, the jungle surging to engulf it.\n\nThe Men are setting up quickly and relatively quietly in the \nruins - alongside a miniscule trail.  The rain is coming down \nharder than ever.\n\nChris and Tex setting out their claymore mines, raveling back \ntheir detonating cords to their position, drenched.  In the far \ndistance, an ILLUMINATION ROUND brightens the sky for a brief \nmoment.  Various ad lib curses and directions are lost in the \nsound of the rain.\n\n<b>EXT. AMBUSH - BARNES' POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)\n</b>\nAt the Ambush CP, Ace whipsers into his radio.  A soft hissing \nsound.\n\n<b>EXT. AMBUSH - CHRIS'S POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)\n</b>\nLater.  Close on Chris being shaken awake.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEX\n</b>\tTaylor, you're on.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t\t(groggy)\n\tUh hunh.\n\nThe rain continuing to pelt them.

Chris prods him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\tJunior!\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\tUnh? ... Unh.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\tShaddup!  You're snoring ... Shhh.\n\nBending low into his eardrum.  Junior never wakes, rolls over \nwith a growl.  Silence.\n\n<b>\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)\n</b>\nLater.  A pool of muddy water has formed, in which a pair of \nbuttocks sit.  Move up to Chris still on duty, looking at his \nwatch, drawn, drenched, pathetic, rainwater coursing down his \nface.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t\t(continuing his letter)\n\t... 'Course Mom and Dad didn't want me to come, they \n\twanted me to be just like them - respectable, hard-\n\tworking, making $200 a week, a little house, a \n\tfamily.  They drove me crazy with their goddamn \n\tworld, grandma, you know Mom, I don't want to be a \n\twhite boy on Wall Street, I don't want my whole life \n\tto be predetermined by them.\n\nA large RIPPING SOUND as the wind blows down a big tree branch \nonto the jungle floor.

Well here I \n\tam - anonymous all right, with guys nobody really \n\tcares about - they come from the end of the line, \n\tmost of 'em, small towns you never heard of - \n\tPulaski, Tennessee, Brandon, Mississippi, Pork Bend, \n\tUtah, Wampum, Pennsylvania.  Two years' high school's \n\tabout it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for \n\t'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing, \n\tthey're poor, they're the unwanted of our society, \n\tyet they're fighting for our society and our freedom \n\tand what we call America, they're the bottom of the \n\tbarrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call \n\tthemselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can \n\ttake anything.

A long beat.  He sighs, the sigh kicking off the next \nimage.\n\n<b>EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT\n</b>\nChris jerks awake - very suddenly, very frightened.  THE RAIN HAS \nSTOPPED.  The jungle sounds are loud.  Cicadas, night animals, \nwater dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf.  And the whirr of \na million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at Chris' face.  \nHe looks around, startled.\n\nTex is asleep.  Junior is asleep.  What happened?  He looks at \nhis watch.  The mosquitoes are eating him alive.  He buries his \nhead in his green towel which he wears around his neck, but he \ncan't see.  A beat.  He moves again, miserable from the bites.  \nAnother beat.  Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift - \nsome of the animals dropping out.  A different tone.  A piece of \nwood is stepped on, a rustle of bush ...\n\nChris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek out.\n\nA shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15 \nyards.  It looks like a man.  But it doesn't move.  At all.  It \nlistens.\n\nChris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it.  It's a \nbush.  It has to be.  No human being could stand that still.  His \nheartbeats are up.  The moments take forever.  But deep down - \nsomewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is.\n\nThe figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves.  It IS a \nhuman being.  Oh my God!\n\nChris looks around.  Tex seems like a mile away.  Why doesn't \nanyone fire!  He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his \ngrenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, he \nis frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy.\n\nThe figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and comes \ndown the trail.  Now a second and third figure appear behind him \n- all in helmets and packs.  All coming right past Chris' \nposition.  Ten yards.  Nine.\n\nChris is rigid with terror.  Stark eyes.  Pleading with Tex to \nwake up, but out of reach.  He is about to have an anxiety \nattack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him.\n\nThe first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail, \nlooking left and right.  A rattle of his equipment, a creak of \nleather.  A smell.  The man's face now catches the moonlight and \nhis eyes come around on Chris.\n\nOriental eyes.  Looking right at him.  Startled.  Chris staring \nback, hypnotized.  It all happens very fast.  The figure murmurs \nsomething in Vietnamese.  A warning.  He swivels.\n\nA flash of muzzle fire.  A raking cough of automatic fire.  A \ngrenade explosion.\n\nChris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered, \nconfused, jarred.  All hell breaks loose around him with NOISE \nand SHOUTS.\n\nTex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEX\n</b><b>\tTHE CLAYMORE!  GET THOSE FUCKERS!\n</b>\nChris, not knowing what he's doing, is fumbling with the claymore \nhandles, presses them.  INSERT: They won't give.

Clicks the safeties \noff and blows them.\n\nThree EXPLOSIONS rip out into the night - and one of the ENEMY is \ncaught in a brief instant looking like an X-ray, his body lifted \nand swirling in the air, then enveloped in swirls of smoke.\n\nChris, trying to keep up, grabs his M-16, lays out a stream of \nfire.  The sound all around him is deafening.\n\n<b>EXT. GARDNER'S POSITION - NIGHT\n</b>\nGardner, freaking out, stands crouched, confused, tries to run, \ncollapses.\n\n<b>EXT.

A grenade explosion rocks \nthem.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEX (CONT'D)\n</b><b>\tAAAAAGHHH! MY ARM! MY ARM!\n</b>\nHis hand and wrist are gone, his face in the dirt.

A silence, punctuated by occasional \nshouts and fast moments, has enveloped once more the cemetery.  \nDoc crashes through the bush, kneels over Tex, who continues to \nhowl in deep pain.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEX\n</b>\t\t(freaked out)\n<b>\tMY ARM!

Junior scrambles over to \nTex's side.  Doc runs off.\n\nBig Harold cradles Chris, his big black hands like a mother, \nreassuring him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\tYou gonna be okay Taylor, okay, don't you start \n\tworrying now.\n\nChris looking up at him, eyes blinking slowly, dazed already by \nthe morphine.

King motions to him, it's cool.\n\nInside is another world.  Chris looking around amazed.  It's like \na private cabaret for the 'heads' who are there cooling out.  \nBoxes of food from the States, beers, whiskey bottles, crates \nfunctioning as tables, hammocks hanging from poles, electric \nfans, tape decks, paraphenalia.\n\nThe boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags.  The \nclothes are clean, the headbands, the medallions are out, \nanything distinctive and individualistic.  On the tapedeck, \nJefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'.\n\nTo Chris it is a new world.  And RHAH, the resident head, sitting \nthere in all his finery puffing a huge burning red bowl in a \nthree foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be the lord of final \njudgement in this smoky underworld.\n\nAcross his naked chest, birds and snakes are tatooed.  Around his \nneck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side.  On his \nknuckles 'Love' and 'Hate' are tattooed.  In his eyes, a dancing \nSatanic fire.  A poor rural Southern white, in his grizzled late \n20's, he could be a Biker King.  Giving Chris the once-over.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHAH\n</b>\tWhatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKING\n</b>\t\t(smiling)\n\tThis ain't Taylor.  Taylor been shot.

His eyes roving over \nLERNER, CRAWFORD, MANNY, FLASH, FRANCIS, HOYT, TUBBS, DOC, other \nfrom the Platoon, about 9 or 10 of them.\n\nRhah eyes him back, hands him the bowl.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHAH\n</b>\tYou lame Taylor?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHAH\n</b>\tYou lame or something?\n\n<b>\t\t\tKING\n</b>\t\t(smiling)\n\t... go ahead on, smoke it man.\n\nChris understands, takes the bowl.  Hesitates.  Then smokes it.  \nThe contact fumes are almost enough to knock him out.  He starts \ncoughing.  They're all laughing.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHAH\n</b>\tYour shit's in the wind troop.

King smoking from the pipe passing \nit back to Chris who takes another hit, doesn't cough this time, \nlooking around, wondering about these guys.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\tI didn't like it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHAH\n</b>\tBah, you're a child, Lerner.  Rhah don't waste time \n\ton you.\n\nThey go on ad-libbing with each other, teasing Doc, who's fairly \nstraight, saying he wants to go to med school in the fall.  'Be \nwhat?''A gynecologist, man.''What dat?' Francis suggests, 'Dats a \npussy doctor, man - he's gonna be Doctor Feelgood, man!' They're \nall cracking up, finding every joke funny.  As Chris finishes his \nhit on the pipe, looks up across the smoke, already dazed, \nsurprised to see ELIAS suddenly there - leaning out of his sling \nin a far corner of the hooch.  A Monkey is draped around his neck \nwith silver bracelets, rings, a necklace - like a sensual little \nEgyptian whore, Elias playing with it, spaced out in a sleeveless \nvest, tiger pants.  Dancing eyes on Chris, he swings out the \nhammock, comes over with the monkey.\n\nMeanwhile Manny has broken into a high falsetto snatch of blues \ndirected at Chris, joined by Big Harold and Francis, all of them \nclicking their hands.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMANNY &amp; BIG HAROLD &amp; DOC\n</b>\tOooh Chris, you look like you is high oh yeah, he \n\tlooks like he is high Ooooh Chris, you know you gonna \n\tbe that way all night oh yeah I think that you are \n\t...

Elias takes a hit and \nblows it down the bore - 'shotgunning' it into Chris' lungs.  \nChris staggers back, coughing.

His eyes \nperforming a funny little hop, skip and jump, as he holds it, his \nface turning red.\n\nThe monkey jabbers and jumps around on his neck, worried.  Elias \nthen blows the smoke out in its face, the monkey hating it.\n\nThe Group laughes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHey Crutcher.  I hear you got a Dear John from your \n\tgal.

NVA BUNKER - SANDERSON POSITION - DAY\n</b>\nBarnes is still there in the wrecked bunker, squatting there \nstaring as if his mind has disconnected for a moment.  He reaches \nup, touches his scars.

Barnes says it for \neveryone, 'The motherfuckers ...'\n\n<b>EXT. VILLAGE - TRAIL - DAY\n</b>\nThey come up out of the jungle onto the side of a CART TRAIL, \nwhere a tiny village overlooks the river.  The VILLAGE is poor, a \nseries of thatched hutches made of C-ration cardboard and \naluminum beer can sidings, faint whiffs of smoke coming from cook \nfires.  Pigs and dogs wander about.\n\nAn OLD VILLAGER watches them pass from his tillable plot, smoking \na cigarette, one leg wrapped around his hoe, resting, no \nexpression.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS (V.O.)\n</b>\t... the village, which had stood for maybe a thousand \n\tyears, didn't know we were coming that day.

A muted EXPLOSION.  Then \nsizzling acidic fumes.  Frying sounds.  A hideous scream from \nsomewhere deep in the hole.\n\nHoyt, watching, is sickened.  Barnes businesslike.\n\nThe Villagers, in grief, howl and tear at their faces.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFU SHENG\n</b>\t\t(hustling up to Barnes)\n\tSarge, we found some shit!\n\nBarnes going with him.\n\n<b>EXT.

GET \n<b>\tOUTTA THERE!\n</b>\nFrancis doesn't recognize him in his rage.  Bunny now coming in, \nfollowed by O'Neill, drawn by the shouting.\n\n<b>EXT. VILLAGE - WEAPONS CACHE - DAY\n</b>\nBarnes stares down at a WEAPONS CACHE buried cleverly underneath \nthe ruce urns.  Ace, Fu Sheng, Sgt.Warren, Lt.Wolfe, others, are \ndigging it out.  It's in white plastic wrappings - a load of AK-\n47's, rockets, grenades, claymores, carbines, flares, NVA \nuniforms.  A real find.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSGT.

The Young Man uses a pair of crutches \nfor his blown-off limb, hobbling like a mangy three-legged dog.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUNNY\n</b>\tHey look at this! Ma and Pa Kettle here.

Bunny amused, drawn in by Chris.  O'Neill watches \npassively from the lip of the hutch.\n\nThe Young Man continues to grin, not seeming to realize the \ndegree of danger he's in, which is what Chris wants - a token \nsign of acquiescence.  There is also the added element of showing \noff his manhood in front of an audience now.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUNNY\n</b>\tDo 'em man, do 'em.\n\nChris.  The trigger.  He pulls.  But he can't quite bring himself \nto kill.  The bullets exploding in the dirt at the edges of the \nyoung man's foot.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t\t(demonic)\n<b>\tDANCE YOU ONE-LEGGED MOTHERFUCKER, DANCE!!!\n</b>\nThe Young Man hops up and down in a reflex fear of the sounds of \nthe bullets as they thud into the dirt.  Yet his eyes remain \nfixed on Chris in wonderment.\n\nChris, firing out the magazine, seems to expend his bloodlust.  \nHe ceases, noticing - for the first time - the eyes of the Young \nMan.  They aren't stupid - nor fearful - but filled with \nresignation and despair - a despair that Chris, in disgust of \nhimself, recognizes.\n\nChris lowers the rifle, silent.\n\nThe Young Man's impassive face shines now with tears.  That sad \nyoung look - as if death itself would've been a release.  Chris \nturns his eyes away, an awkward sense of shame.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS\n</b>\t\t(leaves)\n\tLet's get out of here man.\n\nBut Bunny takes up the slack, moves forward on the young man.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUNNY\n</b>\t\t(to Chris)\n\tYou chickenshit man, they're laughing at you, look at \n\tthem faces.

It comes - suddenly \nand without warning.  Bunny is looking at O'Neill, the Vietnamese \ncouple are muttering something.  In one fluid move, Bunny swivels \nand with unbelievable savagery clubs the young one-legged man in \nthe side of the head with the butt of his 16.\n\n<b>\t\t\tO'NEILL (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(stunned)\n\n\tHey what are you doing!\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUNNY\n</b>\tFucker!\n\nThe young man is groaning on the floor of the hutch.

Never in his life has he seen \nsomething so horrifying as this.  And yet he does nothing.  He is \npart of it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUNNY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(stepping back, examines what's left of the head, amazed)\n\tWow!  You see his fucking head come apart?  Look at \n\tthat ... I never seen brains like dat before.  Jesus \n\tfucking Christ ...\n\nThe Old Lady is shrieking, hovering over the body of her son.  \nBunny studying her.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUNNY (CONT'D)\n</b>\tBetcha the old bitch runs the whole show.  Probably \n\thelped cut Manny's throat.  Probably cut my balls off \n\tif she could.\n\t\t(to Chris)\n\tCome on, man, let's do her.\n\nShe cowers from him.  Chris steps back, horrified.

Let's do the \n\twhole village!\n\nHe backs out of the hutch, scared.  Evidently Bunny is \ntemporarily insane.  But he spots O'Neill, yells at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBUNNY (CONT'D)\n</b><b>\tGET BACK HERE YOU FUCKING COWARD O'NEILL.  THIS IS \n</b><b>\tFOR SANDY ... THIS IS FOR SANDY MAN! AND SAL! AND \n</b><b>\tMANNY!\n</b>\nAs he clubs her to death.\n\nOn Chris' face, blood and brain tissue flying up into it.\n\n<b>EXT. CENTRAL AREA - VILLAGE - DAY\n</b>\nA tiny knot of men are ringed around Barnes who is questioning a \nsturdy-looking man who is the VILLAGE CHIEF.  He has been \nstripped of his shirt, scars all over his body, scared.  He has \nhis ID papers out, trembling, showing them to Lerner who speaks \nsome pidgen Vietnamese.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tWhere'd he get these wounds?\n\nLerner translates, the man talking back.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\tHe says he was hit in a bombing raid.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTONY\n</b>\tHe's a dink fosure.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tAsk him what the weapons are doing here?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\tHe says they had no choice.  The NVA killed the old \n\thoncho when he said no.  He says the rice is theirs.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tBullshit ... who the hell was the dink we just nailed \n\ton the riverbank?\n\nChris and O'Neill come up, watch.  Others coming from different \nplaces - sensing the narrowing drama.  But half the platoon is \nstill at work in the village.  We hear shouts, grenade \nexplosions, occasionally gunfire.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\t... He says he doesn't know, NVA haven't been around \n\tin a couple of months.  Maybe it was a scout or ...\n\nThe men around Barnes grumble.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tYeah sure it was.

The Village Chief's WIFE is now on the \nscene, a middle-aged woman with angry features, yelling at Lerner \ntrying to answer for her husband, a high-pitched barrage of \nindignant words directed mostly at Barnes, and interspersed with \nthe spitting of her betel nuts on the ground.\n\nThe Village Chief trying to talk her down.  But things are \ndefinitely getting out of control.  And the heat from the sun is \nonly aggravating the situation, pounding down on the actors in \nthe drama, their fatigues soaked in sweat and anger.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\t\t(finally)\n\tHe swears he doesn't know anything!  He hates the NVA \n\tbut they come when they want and ...\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR\n</b>\tHe's lying through his teeth!\n\n<b>\t\t\tTONY\n</b>\tWaste the fucker, then see who talks.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tWhat's the bitch saying?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\t\t(overwhelmed)\n\tShe's going on, I don't know - why are we shooting \n\tthe pigs, they're farmers ... they got to make a \n\tliving, all that crap ...\n\nThe Woman is still ranting when Barnes turns to her, quite \ncasually levels his M-16, and puts a bullet in her head.  She \ngoes down as if pole-axed.\n\nA stunned pause.  The Chief looking at his wife.  The Villagers \nin background reacting.\n\nWolfe looking ... Chris looking, shocked.  Doc, possibly the \nstraightest of them all, very uncomfortable.  They are all \nshocked insome way, but do nothing against the power of Banres.  \nBarnes walks over to the pig pen with the other Villagers, very \ncasually, confronts them.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\t\t(to Lerner)\n\tTell him he talks or I'm gonna waste more of 'em.\n\nLerner shaken up, muttering to the Village Chief who is in shock, \nkneeling next to the body of his wife, muttering in a high whine \nof pain.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES (CONT'D)\n</b>\tGo ahead, Lerner, ask him.\n\nA group of Villagers huddle to one side.\n\nLerner, shaken, is yelling at all of them, demanding an answer.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLERNER\n</b>\tThey don't know Sarge, they don't know!\n\t\t(half believes it)\n\nBarnes turns his attention on the other villagers, his intentions \napparent.  Everybody feels them.  They're next.  Barnes is \nunperturbed, very much in command of the situation, no rage, no \nemotions expressed.\n\nChris has never seen such a thing in his life - but can't react.  \nCan't stop it, just watches it like he's not quite there.\n\nThe same goes for Lieutenant Wolfe, for all of them.  The very \noutrageousness of Barns' killing seems to quell all protest.\n\n<b>\t\t\tACE\n</b>\t\t(sensing the impending massacre)\n\tHey Sarge can we get in on this.\n\nTony advances, the hairy Italian kid from Boston.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTONY\n</b>\tLet's go all the way, let's go for it!  Let's do the \n\twhole fucking village.  Come on, Sarge.\n\nChris' eyes ... Rodriguez next to him, is neutral but willing.\n\nFrancis is hesitant.\n\nFu Sheng and Junior are ready to go for it.  Lt.Wolfe is \npowerless, frozen.\n\nSgt.Warren stepping up.  The massacre is just about to break.\n\nThe Villagers know it, kneel in prayer, mutter.\n\nBarnes suddenly grabs and drags a young 19 year-old Woman, the \nVillage Chief's daughter, across the pen, throws her down on her \nknees, in front of the stunned Village Chief.  She's screaming.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tThis his daughter, right?\n\nLerner nods.  Barnes pulls his .45, puts it alongside her head.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(to Village Chief)\n\tYou lie ... You Vee Cee ...

He sticks the gun down above her skull.\n\nChris wanting to cry out, to do something - but can't!\n\nA FIGURE suddenly flares out in the sun, advancing on them.  It \nis Elias.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b><b>\tBARNES!!\n</b>\nBarnes looks around.

Elias is on him like a \nleopard.  Battering him with his fists.\n\nThey struggle in the dust, two titans, their faces equally \nconsumed with rage, clawing, spitting, punching, kicking, \npounding each other's skulls in the dirt.  A dust storm swirls \naround them, the men closing around like excited apes at a \nbloodfeast.\n\nMost of the men seem to be pulling for Barnes - Chris just \nwatching neutral.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLIEUTENANT WOLFE\n</b><b>\tBREAK IT UP!

It sparks a thick flare as Bunny lights \nthe dry straw on the roof of the Hutch where he killed the Old \nWoman and Young Boy.\n\nTheir legs sticking out at the threshold.

He \nshoots up out of his poncho liner as if shot, stunned.  Scared.  \nLooks around.  All is quiet.  Men sleeping.\n\nElias is huddled in his poncho on guard next to his foxhole.  \nChris joins him, sitting, wiping the sleep from his eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t...

'Cause the dead don't let em \n\tforget.\n\nHis eyes blazing, reliving the deaths in the village, licking the \nwounds for the platoon, mourning the failure of its heroism.  \nChris looking at him, a little awed by his intensity.  Elias \nlooks away, embarrassed that he has sermonized, looks back at the \nstars.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS (CONT'D)\n</b>\tOh shit!  Sometimes there's things in my head ... \n\tman.

You ever think about reincarnation, all that \n\tstuff?\n\nA lightning quick movement follows.  Elias' hand passing over his \nface like a mime, a click of the fingers and he leans closer to \nChris.  A new expression on his face.  Devil's eyes, mocking \nchild, danger in his soul, excitement, sex - the Elias that Chris \nsaw in the smoking session in base camp.  Chris smiles, sucked \nin, almost laughs and then the face is gone again.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELIAS\n</b>\tSure, goes on all the time.  Maybe a piece of me's in \n\tyou now, who knows.

Chris looks at him, looks away.  A \nshooting star falls suddenly and dryly through the cosmos.  Their \neyes.\n\n<b>EXT. JUNGLE - STREAM - DAY (RAIN)\n</b>\nThe Platoon moves along a shallow STREAM bordering the jungle.  A \nthick RAIN falls amid cracks of distant thunder.  Chris, Rhah, \nFrancis, Big Harold, others are at the rear of the platoon, their \nponchos pulled over them like big sad grey tents.  There's a \nholdup ahead and the Men rest on rocks or stand.  The rain makes \na pointilistic pattern, the men collages of grey, their rifles \nslung upside down to keep dry.\n\nBarnes is up ahead, out of the stream bank, on the radio.\n\n<b>EXT. JUNGLE CHURCH - DAY (RAIN)\n</b>\nLerner's on point, resting in the shadow of a decaying old French \nCatholic Church from the 19th Century.  The jungle has long ago \nwon the battle, vines creeping into the cracks, remnants of \narches layered around the church at the epicenter.  Behind Lerner \nis Sgt.Warren and his radioman.\n\n<b>EXT.

He goes over and checks them.\n\n<b>EXT. JUNGLE - STREAM - DAY (RAIN)\n</b>\nBack at the stream, Rhah, looking old and whiskered under his \nponcho hood, lights up a roach, puffs it.  Another crack of \nthunder.  Chris comes over, sits with him on his rock.  Rhah \npasses him the joint.  He smokes.\n\nBig Harold pulls a leech out of his open crotch area.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHAROLD\n</b>\tShit, lookit this little fucker trying to get up ma \n\tglory hole.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS\n</b>\tHey Big Harold, put dat in your turkey loaf it won't \n\tcome out your back end.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKING\n</b>\t\t(ribbing)\n\tYeah, big boy, thought you had that laundry gig all \n\tlaid out?\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\t\t(pissed)\n\tShit, got to paint myself white get one of dem jobs.  \n\tGet ma request in for a circumcision.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKING\n</b>\tGonna be a rabbi man?\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS\n</b>\tGonna cut your pecker down to size hunh Big Harold?\n\n<b>\t\t\tBIG HAROLD\n</b>\tDat's okay wid me, better to have a small one den no \n\tone at all.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKING\n</b>\tYour girlfriends gonna look for new lovers, man.  \n\tBest thing a bro's got's his flap.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHAROLD\n</b>\tI'll drink to your flap in Chicago, King.

He fires from the hip, \nproviding cover fire for Chris, then pops down.\n\n<b>EXT.

Lerner, can you hear me man?\n\nLerner groans.  A fresh burst of AK fire rakes the area.  Lerner \njerks spasmodically with the impact of the rounds.\n\nChris spots the sniper.  In a hole in the ground.  Twenty-five \nmeters off.  Snapping the magazine out of his AK to reload.  A \nlive gook.\n\nChris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in the \nhole.  This is the moement, Chris realizes it, it's now or never \nif Chris intends to get the gook.  He's got to make a move before \nthe man has reloaded his weapon.\n\nHe pulls his grenade, pops the pin.  He lets the spoon fly off, \nactivating the grenade-timer, as he humps to his feet and runs \nfor the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating.  That head is \ngoing to pop up any second with a freshly-loaded weapon and tear \nhis head off.\n\nChris won't make it back to the hole.  The throw has to be \nperfect.  He won't get another chance.  He heaves the frag, drops \nand rolls away.  The throw is perfect, the golden arc of flight \nfrom the outfield nailing the baserunner.  It twists cleanly in \nthe hole.  The explosion muffled but deadly.\n\nChris scrambles to his feet, a look of almost total surprise on \nhis face.  He can't seem to believe he did it.  Pointing his M-16 \nbefore him, he advances on the hole, looking over the muzzle to \nsee the badly-mangled NVA man twisted at the bottom.\n\nChris hurries over to Lerner.

It is so silent in comparison to \nthe racket from the battle across the forest.  The Mist clings to \nthe trees, moist and lovely.  Then, a flicker of movement, sound.\n\nChris hears it, tightens.  His POV - at fifty yards.  An \nevanescence of beige and green uniforms moving towards him very \nfast, scurrying.  They look like headless ghosts.\n\nChris opens fire.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b><b>\tGET EM!!!!!\n</b>\nRhah and Crawford open up.

Barnes \nturns now to deal with Elias.\n\n<b>EXT. ELIAS' JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nElsewhere, Elias stands silently, listens to the forest.  In the \ndistance the firefight can hardly be heard.  His helmet gone, his \nhair hanging free, he is at his best now - alone.  He hears it.  \nSomebody running through the jungle, about 100 yards, boots on \nleaves, coming towards him.\n\nHe begins to move lateral to the sound.  His steps unheard, \nbetter at this than the enemy.\n\nTHREE ENEMY FIGURES now appear, crouched and moving very fast \nwith light equipment through the mist.\n\nElias swerves up in immediate foreground, his back to us, FIRING.  \nAll three Figures fall.\n\nA quick glimpse of Elias, not bothering to stop, moving to his \nnext position.\n\n<b>EXT.

ELIAS' JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nTWO MORE ENEMY lie dead in the jungle.  A rustle of movement, \nthen a CRY - chilling, jubilant, a war cry.\n\nA pair of feet moving lightly over the jungle.

The \nFirst One mutter something sharp and they split fast in the \ndirection they've come.\n\nThey get about six steps when Elias suddenly rises up from the \nbush, not ten yards in front of them, his shots ripping into \nthem, driving the surprised life from them.  Elias is gone.\n\n<b>EXT. NVA JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nElsewhere, another three NVA stop, turn and flee back from where \nthey came.\n\n<b>EXT. JUNGLE CHURCH - DAY\n</b>\nChris and Rhah get Crawford back to the church grounds, lay him \ndown.  No activity around them.

Something is running towards him.  \nBut it's hidden by the bush.  He brings his rifle up smooth and \nquick, waits, then as the bush parts, Elias is standing there.  \nLooking at Barnes.\n\nBarnes sees him, starts to lower his rifle, but then stops.  He \nraises it back an inch, sights it.  Pause.  A cold searing look \nof hatred coming over his face.\n\nIn that moment, Elias understands.  Quick as a deer, he makes his \nmove, trying to plunge back into the bush.\n\nBarnes fires.  Once, twice, three times - the blast rocking the \njungle.\n\nElias jerking backwards into the bush, mortally wounded.  Bird \ncries.  A crime against nature.\n\nBarnes calmly lowers his rifle, and walks away from it.\n\n<b>EXT. CHRIS' JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\nChris, cutting through the jungle, hears the shots.  He stops, \nlistens.  Someone is moving through bush towards him, leaves and \nfoliage shaking.\n\nChris tightens, raises his rifle.\n\nBarnes steps through into his sight - sees him.\n\nChris lowers his rifle.  Barnes walking past him as if he weren't \neven there.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tElias is dead.  Join up with the platoon.  Move it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\t\t(shocked)\n\tHe's dead!  Where?  ...

The \ntwo platoons, Second and Third, reinforcing, are being evacuated \nas quickly as possible, one load (6-8 men, depending on the \nwounded) after other.  The choppers are spraying dust all over \nthe place.  A scene of chaos, radio talk layering it.

Tubbs and Crawford, both wounded, now \nmove past Chris, into the chopper.  Chris running back, with King \ncarrying a litter - their eyes falling on:\n\nBarnes talking with Wolfe and Ace, making signals under the \nroaring sounds of the chopper.  Shaking his head.  No.  No Elias.\n\nChris and King looking at each other, mute.  They numbly start \nloading Big Harold, minus his leg, onto the stretcher.\n\nThe Third Chopper is down now, waiting, roaring blades \nsilhouetting off the face of the cathedral.  A ROCKET BLAST \nsuddenly goes off not too far from the chopper, incoming fire.  \nThe DOOR GUNNER signaling for them to hurry, laying out fire.\n\n<b>INT/EXT.

So's the Door \nGunner.\n\nElias is coming out of the jungle.  Staggering, blood disfiguring \nhis face and chest, hanging on with all his dimming strength, \nlooking up at them - trying to reach them.\n\nChris shakes Wolfe, his words drowned out by the roar.\n\nThe Chopper Captain looking down, dips.  His co-pilot pointing.\n\nThe NVA are coming out of the jungle, closing on the spot where \nElias is.\n\nIncoming rounds are hitting the chopper.  The Door Gunner \nmaniacally firing.\n\nBarnes looking down at the man, can't believe it.\n\nElias is on his last legs now, obviously being hit by the \nincoming fire of the NVA.  He falls to his knees, still \nstretching upwards for life.\n\nThe Chopper Captain shakes his head at Wolfe.\n\nThe Chopper dips one more time firing at the NVA, low and fierce \nover the jungle.\n\nChris looking back in horror.\n\nElias crucified.

Once.  Twice.\n\nChris grimaces, groans, helpless now.  A flick of sound.\n\nA knife whipped out of Barnes' boot and pressing against Chris' \nthroat.  Chris bleeding from the nose and mouth.\n\nRhah suddenly spinning into action, fast now, realizing what \nBarnes intends to do.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHAH\n</b><b>\tEASY BARNES, EASY MAN!!!\n</b>\nBarnes is on the verge - about to kill again.\n\nChris waiting.\n\nRhah coaxing him, moving closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHAH (CONT'D)\n</b>\tYou'll do dinky dau in Long Binh Barnes.

We sense a man of enormous self-control.\n\nSuddenly he flicks his knife across Chris, leaving a mark below \nhis left eye.\n\nChris gasps.  Looking up at Barnes rising off him.  The boots \nalongside his face.\n\nThe Men looking on, the tension lowering.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\t\t(contemptuous)\n\tDeath?  What do you guys know about it?\n\nHe walks out.

AIR SHOTS - JUNGLE, CHURCH - DAY\n</b>\nChris sits at the very edge of a Huey Chopper, bandana around his \nforehead, long hair blowing in the wind, Barnes' mark below his \neyes, slicked out now like a jungle veteran, looking down at the \nVILLAGE where the massacre occurred.\n\nThe Village is still a smoking ruin, a few peasants and water \nbuffalo straggling like ants to reconstruct.\n\nBunny, next to Chris, pops his gum, indifferent.  Barnes, next to \nhim, shifts, reads a map.\n\nRodriguez is praying, his mouth moving without audible words, \ngetting ready for the drop.\n\nKing is making last minute adjustments in his pack.\n\nBunny now nudges Chris, points.  The Church in the Jungle where \nElias was killed is visible.  An outline of the Cemetery.  \nUncomfortable memories play over Chris' face.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS (V.O.)\n</b>\tThey sent us back into the valley the next day - \n\tabout 2,000 metres from Cambodia - into a battalion \n\tperimeter.

There were other battalions \n\tin the valley, we weren't the only ones but we knew \n\twe were going to be the bait to lure them out.  And \n\tsomewhere out there was the entire 141st NVA \n\tRegiment.\n\nThe BATTALION PERIMETER now breaks in the clear ahead.  Smoke \ngrenades of various colors are being popped on the cleared LZ.  \nIt's not big, its radius 200 yards, heavily sandbagged, deeply \ndug, rolls of barbed wire protecting it, radio antennas sprouting \nfrom the CP - and surrounded on all four sides by jungle.\n\nThe First Chopper rocking down, whipping up dust clouds.  Chris \njumps out, moving out fast as the Second Chopper starts in.\n\n<b>EXT.

King comes in with the claymore \nwires, attaching them to their detonators.

He turns and starts \nback to his foxhole.\n\nA man is watching him.  He's sitting on a sandbag, face in \nshadow.  It startles Chris, something about him.  Something \ndifferent.  A deep West Virginia drawl.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSMOKING MAN\n</b>\tGot a light?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS\n</b>\tUh sure ...\n\nGoes over reluctantly, flicks his lighter, cupping it from the \nwind.  The flame catches a sudden, uneasy expression in Chris' \nface as he sees the Smoking Man.\n\nWe come around and see what Chris sees in the light of the flame.  \nA face that smiles at him like a death's head, a large ugly \nblister on his mouth, whiskered, pale - but smiling.  A sick man \nwouldn't smile like this, but he is smiling too intimately, as if \nhe knows Chris from way back.  But he doesn't.  Or does he?  \nPerhaps it was the man Chris first saw at the airstrip when he \ncame in-country.  The same expression of evil, of a man who has \nseen too much and died, but still lives.\n\nChris feels an unnatural fear passing through him.\n\nThe Man stands, sucking on his cigarette, stretches.  He is thin \nand very tall, towering over Chris.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSMOKING MAN\n</b>\t... later.\n\nHe goes.  Chris watches him, wondering.  The man never looks \nback, a leisurely, confident stroll.  In that moment, there is an \nEXPLOSION from way out in the jungle, about a quarter of a mile.  \nThen another, then small arms fire.  Chris looks, knows.\n\n<b>EXT.

We now see a moving helmet \nwith a luminous plaque on the back of it, leading a file up the \nwire.  To a Jump-off point about 50 yards outside the U.S. \nperimeter.  Figures crouch.  Whispers.  Movement.  A pen \nflashlight on a drawing of the foxhole positions.  The NVA moving \nout in several directions at once.\n\n<b>EXT.

The SOUND \nnow of a whistle.  Two hoots, then a sharp third.  Then yelling.\n\nChris grabbing Francis' arm, pointing.  There is a VOICE directly \nout to the front of them - muttering something in Vietnamese, no \nmore than 20 yards away but unseen.

Ace goes down.\n\nDoc has cracked up, firing at anything, indifferent to his \nsafety.  One of the NVA goes down.  The Doc is hit in the side, \nwounded, struggles, is hit again, but keeps trying to fire.  He's \nhit a third time - in the jugular vein.  Nearby, Wolfe is firing \nmadly at the oncoming NVA.  One goes down.  A second is wounded, \nyelling in pain.  Wolfe reloading his 16, popping up, too late.  \nOne of them is coming over the sandbags.  He sees Wolfe.  Wolfe \nsees him.  In the same moment.\n\nWolfe hesitates, frozen up.  The gook unloads his AK-47, a \nmagazine worth, into Lieutenant Wolfe, who crashes down, sprawled \nunnaturally on the jungle floor.

SMACK!  He crumples.\n\n<b>INTERCUT\n</b>\nChris bellies into the area, see Barnes, recognizes him, amazed.\n\nAn ENEMY fires, taking Barnes high in the left thigh.  A patch of \nskin blowing off.  Barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like \na wounded horse.  Holds there, staring into the Enemy, waiting \nfor the coup de grace.\n\nA series of SHOUTS and the Enemy staggers dead as:\n\nChris lays out a curtain of fire.  A GRENADE goes off near him, \nblowing off his helmet.  Dazed, Chris rushes forward firing from \nthe hip - sucked into Barnes' suicidal vacuum.  He cuts down an \nEnemy as:\n\nBarnes, given a new lease, limps angrily forward and tackles a \nwounded Enemy trying to crawl away, terrified at the sight of \nBarnes coming after him.  Barnes lets out a vivid scream.\n\nAnd beats the soldier mercilessly, half the stock of his M-16 \nflying apart broken.\n\nChris swivels alert on his knees.  A pause.

The EYES - \nrefracted in a red-green flare overhead - the pupils distorted \ninto angry red points.\n\nFor Chris it is no doubt the most frightening single image he has \nseen in his life.  It will be in his nightmares forever.  The \nessence of evil: wrath, obsession, anger, fear, hatred, \npermanence - he is paralyzed.\n\nBarnes smashes him full across the face with the broken stock of \nhis M-16.  Not even conciously, for at this point, his mind has \ngone over the edge and the entire world is his enemy.  American \nor Vietnamese, it makes no difference as he strikes Chris harder \nand harder.\n\nChris struggles, moans, his teeth and nose cracked.  Barnes emits \nanother chilling yell an springs like a humpback up on his good \nright leg, the left bent - set to deliver the killing blow, the \nmangled rifle pulled to its highest arc.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS (CONT'D)\n</b>\tNooooooooo!\n\nThe PHANTOM FIGHTER JET comes now like a great white whale.  One \nbig beautiful monstrous beat of deafening sound.  Its silver and \nwhite belly hurtling low over the treeline in one giant leap of \nsound momentarily illuminated by a flare.  Then a monstrous ROAR \nof anger.\n\nThe bomb ripping Barnes off the body of Chris and spitting Chris \nacross the jungle floor - crashing into a tree some 30 yards \naway.\n\n<b>FADE OUT\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

A soft, furry \nhead, alert, rigidly still.\n\nChris fights his way up to his elbow, in pain, looking at the \neyes.  The head turns and in one fluid move, bolts.  Gone.  Like \nthe wind.  A deer.  A big brown deer.  Or was it?  Chris will \nnever be quite sure.  But whatever it was, it was surely a sign \nof grace - the grace of Elias.  This he knows as he feels himself \nfor the first time alive.\n\nAnd in pain.  His left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his \nside, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him.  Looking around \nhis garden of eden.  A messy jungle floor.  Cordite fumes.  \nBurned bush and trees.  Torn sandbags.  Dead NVA.  Bird songs \nsomewhere in the distance.  It is the very crack of dawn, a pink-\nred sun casting long oblique light patterns through the trees.  A \nholy light.\n\nChris pushes himself to his feet, feels his weight and the pain.  \nHe walks.  In the near distance, towards the LZ area, there's the \nsound of Armored Personnel carriers grinding, men moving, calling \nout in Americanese.  But Chris is alone here.\n\nHe fishes up an AK-47 from a dead NVA.  Checks it, a weapon.  \nWalks on.\n\n<b>EXT. PERIMETER #3 - BARNES' FOXHOLE - DAY\n</b>\nPast scores of NVA bodies.

Barnes looks \nup, begs.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBARNES\n</b>\tGet me a Medic will ya.  Go on ...\n\nChris doesn't move.  Barnes looks at him again, reading the \nintention that has crossed Chris' mind.

Just cold satisfaction and little feeling left.\n\nBehind him, the SOUND of a big machine moving.  He turns.\n\nA huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, followed by \nthe great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for \nits breakfast.\n\nA big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes boudning at him sniffs, followed \nby a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and greasy, unshaven \nface, earring in his left ear, 'DEATH CORPS' scrawled on his \nshirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's head, he looks \nlike a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel.  Behind him, a \nSECOND MONSTER MAN and the ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER grinding its \nengine, a human skull hanging from its turret.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMONSTER MAN\n</b>\t\t(to Dog)\n\tBozo!

The Soldier pointing to the LZ behind him as a sign \nhe should go that way.

Smashed on morphine, Chris looking out at the waving \nants below.\n\nNow the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over \nthe devestation.  The jungle forever locked in his memory, Chris \nlooks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCHRIS (V.O.)\n</b>\tI think now, looking back, we did not fight the \n\tenemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us \n\t... The war is over for me now, but it will always be \n\tthere - the rest of my days.  As I am sure Elias will \n\tbe - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called \n\tpossession of my soul ... There are times since I \n\thave felt like the child born of those two fathers \n\t... but be that as it may, those of us who did make \n\tit have an obligation to build again, to teach to \n\tothers what we know and to try with what's left of \n\tour lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life \n<b>\t...\n</b>\nThe music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of \nfilm with each actor's name listed - some with silly, clowning \nlooks, others sober, haunted.  Gardner, Tex, King, Rhah, Lerner, \nSanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys ... and then Barnes \nstaring quietly into the camera, and lastly Elias - shirt off, \nbowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile.\n\n<b>\tFADE OUT:\n</b>\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Platoon</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Oliver Stone\" title=\"Scripts by Oliver Stone\">Oliver Stone</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/War\" title=\"War Scripts\">War</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Platoon Script.html#comments\" title=\"Platoon comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:13:35.854419"}
