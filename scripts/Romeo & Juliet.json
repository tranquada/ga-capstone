The\n          convertible halts in front of them.\n\n          \n\n           BENVOLIO\n           He ran this way.

CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.\n\n\n          \n          The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the\n          bridge in imitation of a love sick fool.\n\n          \n\n           MERCUTIO\n           O Romeo, that she were, O that she\n\n           WERE\n           An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!\n\n          \n          The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight\n          blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam. The sound of\n          automatic weapons cocking pierces the night.\n\n          \n          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He's brave but not stupid. He gets\n          back into the car.\n\n          \n\n           MERCUTIO (CONT.)\n           Come, shall we go?\n\n          \n\n          EXT. THE BACK OF CAPULET MANSION.

Romeo's face appears between them.\n\n          \n          Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall. Below is a Greco-\n          Roman style pool area. To the right the darkened rear wing\n          of Capulet Mansion. Suddenly the back of the house explodes\n          with light.

She is still clad in her angel robe, but without\n          the halo and wings. She slowly descends to pool level.\n\n          \n\n           ROMEO\n           It is the East, and Juliet is the\n           sun!\n           Arise, fair sun, and kill the\n           envious moon,\n           Who is already sick and pale with\n\n           GRIEF\n           That thou her maid art far more\n           fair than she.\n           Be not her maid, since she is\n           envious.\n           Her vestal livery is but sick and\n           green,\n           And none but fools do wear it.\n          Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs.

Juliet screams, and turns,\n          toppling backwards. Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum\n          overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool.\n\n          \n\n          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL - UNDERWATER.

For the gentlewoman is\n           young; and therefore, if you should\n           deal double with her, truly it were\n           an ill thing and very weak dealing.\n\n          \n          BEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully.\n\n          \n\n           ROMEO\n           Bid her to come to confession this\n           afternoon,\n           And there she shall at Friar\n           Laurence's cell\n           Be shrived and\n           (PUSH IN ON: Romeo)\n           married.\n\n          \n\n          INT.

DAY.\n\n\n          \n          The kitchen, obviously the Nurse's domain, is decorated with\n          a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters. Most\n          of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying,\n          beauty.\n\n          \n          Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room.\n\n          \n\n           JULIET\n           O honey nurse, what news?\n\n          \n          The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the\n          refrigerator, does not turn around.\n\n          \n          Juliet cries impatiently.\n\n          \n\n           JULIET\n           Nurse!\n\n          \n          The nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food.

No, not he.\n           Though his face be better than any\n           man's, yet his leg excels all men's\n           and for a hand and a foot and a\n           body, though they be not to be\n           talked on, yet they are past\n           compare.\n           He's not the flower of courtesy,\n           but I'll warrant him as gentle as a\n           lamb.

And if we\n           meet we shall not 'scape a brawl.\n\n          \n          Mercutio strides out of the water.\n\n          \n\n           MERCUTIO\n           Thou art like one of these fellows\n           that, when he enters the confines\n           of a tavern, claps me his sword\n           upon the table and says 'God send\n           me no need of thee!'\n           (he hands Benvolio\n           his gun)\n           and by the operation of the second\n           cup draws him on the drawer, when\n           indeed there is no need.\n\n          \n          Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has\n          managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and\n          trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple.\n\n          \n          The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio\n          toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the\n          shade of the beach-side hang.\n\n          \n          Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into\n          the beach side parking lot.\n\n          \n\n           BENVOLIO\n           By my head, here comes the Capulets.\n\n          \n\n           MERCUTIO\n           By my heel, I care not.\n\n          \n\n          EXT.

Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused.\n          He hurls himself into his sedan.\n\n          \n          Kicking it into a sand spraying U-turn, he careens the short\n          distance to Romeo's car. Slamming into the back of it he\n          blocks Romeo in.\n\n          \n          Tybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and\n          headlights. Romeo flicks the locks down.

He ceremoniously disarms,\n          gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now\n          passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand\n          hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the\n          vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray.\n          Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of\n          the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into\n          an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces.\n\n          \n          Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo.\n\n          \n          Suddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the\n          concrete terrace. He plucks up one of the splintered wooden\n          palings and yells...\n\n          \n\n           MERCUTIO (CONT.)\n           Tybalt, you ratcatcher,\n\n          \n          ...as he bludgeons him across the face.

He misses, gouging instead\n          a slash of flesh from Mercutio's stomach.\n          A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his\n          bloodied side. Everyone is still. In the abrupt silence,\n          sirens are heard closing in the distance.

He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead\n          Capulets.\n\n          \n          Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an\n          unbelievable vision.

Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers.\n\n          \n\n           ROMEO (CONT.)\n           Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet\n           so fair?\n           Shall I believe that unsubstantial\n\n           DEATH\n           Is amorous and keeps thee here in\n\n           DARK\n           To be his paramour?

Tears slip\n          from her eyes.\n\n          \n\n           JULIET (CONT.)\n           Drunk all, and left\n           No friendly drop to help me after.\n           I will kiss thy lips.\n           Haply some poison yet doth hang on\n\n           THEM\n           To make me die with a restorative.\n\n          \n          She delicately kisses Romeo's lips.\n\n          \n\n           JULIET (CONT.)\n           (a heart-broken whisper)\n           Thy lips are warm.\n\n          \n          Desperately the lovers cling to each other.
