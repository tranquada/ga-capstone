BEACH. NIGHT.\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on the\n          grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur,\n          with fake chain mail and sword.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The sound\n          of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed as\n          Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong\n          and Romeo inhales smoke.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is\n          yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to\n          cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed as\n          a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged\n          and he swigs from a bottle.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckless\n          sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the\n          car skids to a halt.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver\n          stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself\n          firmly in the dirt.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first.

Recovering from the initial shock, they\n          laugh and cat-call raucously.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto\n          his head and yells above the music.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           MERCUTIO\n</b>           Strike drum!\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere\n          within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the\n          invitations.

All\n           are punished.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague\n          and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two\n          adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people\n          of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the\n          image pixilates into a television picture.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio\n          monitor.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          She turns:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           ANCHOR WOMAN\n</b>           (to camera)\n           A glooming peace this morning with\n           it brings:\n           The sun for sorrow will not show\n           his head.\n           Go hence, to have more talk of\n           these sad things.\n           Some shall be pardoned, and some\n           punished,\n           For never was a story of more woe\n           Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her\n          dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television\n          recedes into a black distance.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives\n          swells. When the television is very small it is switched off.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          BLACK SCREEN.
