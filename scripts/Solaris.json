The Man,\nwithout saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. \nThe dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.

Each of their suits are embroidered with\na small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the\nacronym DBA.\n\nKelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a\ndigitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven,\nlooking into the camera.\n\nThe man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. \nThe lower part of the screen has a time of day and date\ndisplay that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.\n\n<b>                    GIBARIAN\n</b>          We take off into the cosmos, ready\n          for anything: solitude, hardship,\n          exhaustion, death.

She moves to the\nedge of the bed in order to be near.\n\n<b>KELVIN\n</b>\nSweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear.\n\n<b>                    KELVIN (V.O.)\n</b>          I'm losing my mind.\n              (beat)\n          I'm breaking apart.\n\n<b>INT.

I am separate.  Why did I\n          return to Earth and lie about what\n          happened?  Lie about having contact\n          with something like Solaris?  I\n          knew something else was out there,\n          and didn't tell a soul.  I left\n          them in the dark.

To see if\n          she comes here?\n\n<b>KEVIN'S POV\n</b>\nOf the woods.\n\nBut there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of\nthe Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the\nAUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.\n\n<b>KELVIN\n</b>\nLooking from the doorway, notes this.

Still there is a light rain sound.\n\nThese dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are\nforming the shape of a circle.\n\nThe misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.\n\nAnd we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.\n\n<b>                                                FADE OUT.\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Solaris</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Steven Soderbergh\" title=\"Scripts by Steven Soderbergh\">Steven Soderbergh</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Solaris Script.html#comments\" title=\"Solaris comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:16:47.597378"}
