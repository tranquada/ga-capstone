Her expression\nindicates she's in a very raw emotional state.\n\nREVERSE ANGLE\n\nKelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN.\n\nHe is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The\ncontrast with his older self is striking.\n\nBACK TO KELVIN\n\nAsleep on the ship.  After a beat:\n\nEXTREME CLOSE-UP:\n\nRheya's LIPS.\n\nExcept the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and\nthere isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.\n\nA WIDER VIEW\n\nReveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is\nsitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now.\n\nShe is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her\nstillness.\n\nKELVIN\n\nAwakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.\n\nIf he is not entirely surprised it is because he has\nobviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply.\n\nRHEYA\n\nStands and makes her way to Kelvin.\n\nWithout hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore\neach other and we see all of it happen and two things are\nobvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they\nhaven't done it in some time.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM\n\nKelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms.\n\nHe wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he\nrises to sit on the edge of the bed.\n\nA wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to\nhis forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Oh, God.  I'm awake.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          Yes.\n\nHe looks at her.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Where did you come from?\n\nShe moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to\ndo, forever.\n\nBetween kisses.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          How are you here?\n\nShe stops.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          How do you mean?\n              (beat)\n          Chris, what's wrong?\n\nHearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,\nperhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream.\n\nHe stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          I love you.\n\nHe looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks\ndown.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          Do you love me?\n\nHe doesn't look up.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Yes.\n\nA beat.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          I need to see Snow.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          I'll go with you.\n\n                    KELVIN\n              (rising)\n          I'll just be a minute.\n\nShe bolts out of bed.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          Don't.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Why?\n\n                    RHEYA\n          I don't know.  I can't be alone.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          I'll be right back.\n\nShe is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left\nalone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his\narms on her shoulders to comfort her.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          All right.  All right.  Here.\n\nHe hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          What are they?\n\n                    KELVIN\n          To calm your anxiety.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          To calm my anxiety.\n\nShe takes the pills and smiles.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

I'll close the door\n          behind me.\n\nShe stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with\ndifficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya.\n\nHe walks across the docking bay to the control room and\nbegins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.\n\nKELVIN\n\nIn agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of\ntechnological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off\ninto space.\n\nRHEYA\n\nHer face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod\nwindow as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a\nbrutal finality.\n\nKELVIN\n\ncollapses to the ground, shattered.\n\nINSERT:\n\nA woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.

CONFERENCE ROOM\n\nBefore Kelvin's arrival.\n\nGibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          A pre-biological colloidal\n          envelope, possibly exceeding\n          terrestrial structures in\n          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. \n          Probably without life as we\n          conceive it, but capable of\n          performing functional activities on\n          an astronomic scale.  My view is\n          that Solaris has reached, in a\n          single bound, the \"homeostatic\n          ocean\" stage without passing\n          through stages of terrestrial\n          evolution.  I think it bypassed\n          cellular development altogether. \n          It hasn't taken endless eons to\n          adapt itself to its environment,\n          but in fact dominated its\n          environment immediately.  From the\n          moment it existed, it was the most\n          superior element in the Universe.\n          And now it passes the time doing\n          extravagant theoretical thinking\n          about the Universe, with us as the\n          cast.\n\nWe now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,\nwatched by Kelvin.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          It's engaged in a never-ending\n          process of transformation; an\n          ontological autometamorphosis,\n          begging the question: Can thought\n          exist separately from\n          consciousness?\n\n                    SNOW\n          It's God.\n\n                    SARTORIUS\n          I don't care what it is, we need to\n          figure out how to make it stop.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          Nelson, we have the opportunity --\n\n                    SARTORIUS\n          What if this thing follows us back\n          to Earth?

Not right now,\nanyway.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          I have these strange thoughts, I\n          don't know where they come from.\n              (beat)\n          I can't explain it.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Neither can I.  Not any of it. \n          There's no reference point for\n          what's going on; it's never\n          happened before.  It's a clean\n          break in the fabric of the\n          Universe; a gap.  There is nothing\n          to do but experience it, moment-to-\n          moment, and not let it destroy us.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          But that's what happened before.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Not this time.\n\nHe kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says\nnothing.  Then:\n\n                    RHEYA\n          Do you want to stay here?\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Do you?\n\n                    RHEYA\n          If you're here.\n\nThey kiss again...\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT.  KELVIN'S ROOM\n\nKelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.\n\nOffscreen, we hear the door open.\n\nSomeone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through\nthe frame and sits.\n\nAfter a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling\nto clear.  When it does:\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Gibarian.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          Leave the light off.\n\nA beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          I wish you'd come a little sooner. \n          I might not have had to kill\n          myself.\n\nHe smiles, looking at Kelvin.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          You think you're dreaming me, like\n          you dream her.  Understand\n          something: I am the real Gibarian. \n          Just a new incarnation.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          What do you want?\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          You're being tricked.  Sartorius\n          picked a fight with you to avoid\n          telling you about his idea for\n          getting rid of the visitors.  He's\n          figured out they're made of\n          subatomic particles called\n          neutrinos, and he's going to create\n          a negative neutrino field.  Twenty\n          four hours a day, until they're\n          back on Earth.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Can it work?\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          It can.  Ordinary matter, like\n          ours?  Not affected.  Everything\n          else, disintegrates.\n\nKelvin registers this.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          What I'm saying is: Don't trust\n          anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of\n          some sort.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          I can trust Rheya.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          You'll end up like me.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          You're not Gibarian...\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          No?  Who am I, then?\n\n                    KELVIN\n          A puppet.\n\n                    GIBARIAN\n          And you're not?  Maybe you're my\n          puppet.  But like all puppets, you\n          think you're actually human.  It's\n          The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if\n          they're human!\n\nGibarian smiles.\n\nKELVIN\n\nwakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled:\n\n                    RHEYA\n          What's wrong?\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Gibarian.  He was here.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          You said he was dead.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          He is.  But he was here...\n\nHe moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian,\nsome proof.  Finding none:\n\n                    KELVIN\n          He spoke to me.\n\nKelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows.\n\nINT.  LAB\n\nRheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's\nbody.\n\nIt is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not\nwith him.  \n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.

She\njust looks at them.\n\n                    KELVIN\n          Are you going to take them?\n\nShe nods and takes them.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          What's happening to us?\n\n                    KELVIN\n          It's all right.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          Please don't lie.

How\n          could it torture us like this?\n\n                    KELVIN\n          I don't think it knows it's\n          torturing us.

Beside her is a SMALL\nSTEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that\nsolidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.\n\nKelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her\nface and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,\nbut merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up.\n\nINT.  CORRIDOR\n\nKelvin is carrying Rheya.

KELVIN'S ROOM\n\nKelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have\nreturned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes\nand puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he\nhoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.

My theory is she can\n          only live here, that she will die\n          if she leaves this ship.\n\nKelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little\nharder; it's feeling like a seizure now.\n\n                    SNOW\n          Why do you think she hasn't\n          suggested that?  It's the most\n          obvious solution: Escape.

What about\n          the first one, the one you fucked\n          and then put into a rocket and\n          blasted into space?  You didn't\n          love her?\n\nRheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her\nstill, but she's too strong.  He stands, reluctantly, and\nwatches her.\n\n                    SNOW\n          What happens if she comes back?  Is\n          that polygamy?  And even if you\n          could take her home, how would you\n          get her through?  You think they're\n          not going to notice her?\n\nRheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic\nforce were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks\ndispassionately on the two of them:\n\n                    SNOW\n          I never get used to them, these...\n          \"Resurrections\".\n\nHe leaves.\n\nRheya continues her process of \"waking up\" -- it's violent,\neven sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then\nslowly returns to normal.\n\nKelvin puts his hand on her forehead.\n\nShe gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin.\n\nIt takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;\nshe shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead.\n\nShe begins to cry.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          What am I?  Why can't I die?\n\nShe turns away.\n\n                    RHEYA\n          I'm not Rheya.
