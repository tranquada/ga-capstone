GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET\n</b>\n<b>CREDIT SEQUENCE:\n</b>\nThe image is in black and white.\n\nThe sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant\nshadows on the sea.\n\nA little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe\n-- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to\nanother with amazing agility.\n\nIn one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the\nother, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and\nsweater.\n\nThe only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit --\nobvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as\nhe goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as\nhe leaps again... and pulls them up...\n\nThe little boy is JACQUES MAYOL.\n\nEnd credits.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET\n</b>\nJACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove.\n\nHe spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a\nfinger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives.\n\nHe surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and\nswims away from shore.\n\n\n<b>IN OPEN SEA\n</b>\nThe boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it\nin -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid\nbreaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if\nwe've never seen this before.\n\nHis gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water.\n40 feet deep.  And intensely blue.\n\nSuddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the\nblue.\n\n\n<b>UNDERWATER\n</b>\nJACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to\nhold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet\nunder... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray\neel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him.\nThe carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head.\n\nThe boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of\nhis bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel\ndelicately -- and slithers back into his hole.\n\nGravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  VILLAGE - DUSK\n</b>\nJACQUES walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost\ndry now.\n\nTwo boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch\nup with him and gesture toward the port.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTHE BOYS\n</b>\t\tJacques!

ROBERTO counts out loud.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n</b><b>\t\t1... 2... 3...\n</b>\nThe kids all walk over to the edge of the pier.  A few\nfeet away, JACQUES takes off his flippers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n</b><b>\t\t4... 5... 6...\n</b>\nENZO bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand.  The\nchildren cheer and clap.

ENZO smiles, taps him on the shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\tBrava!\n\nThe first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBOY\n</b>\t\t\t   (timidly)\n\t\tEnzo?

The pope calls him over.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPRIEST\n</b>\t\tJacques... Come, look.\n\nJACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the\nfaint gleam of the coin underwater.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPRIEST\n</b>\t\tIs it a coin shining down there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (overjoyed)\n\t\tIt is.

He swims in the water like a\nfish, goes directly to the coin.  Scoops it up, brings it\nto the surface.\n\nHe breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and\nsees he is no longer there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tPadre?\n\nHe looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- \"Boy on\na Dolphin\".\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>ON JACQUES - UNDERWATER\n</b>\nHe's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel.\nHe senses something behind him and turns around.  He sees\na dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically.  It\nseems to be watching him.  The surprise is such that\nJACQUES is in a panic, leaps up to the surface...\n\n\n<b>ON JACQUES - IN BED\n</b>\nHe bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream.\n\n\n<b>INT.  ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK\n</b>\nA BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows\nand throws open the shutters with a bang.  Sunlight pours\nin.  He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house,\nand runs his hand through his hair.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tFATHER\n</b>\t\t\t   (with a smile)\n\t\t... Come on, time to get up,\n\t\tJacques!\n\nJACQUES rubs his eyes.  His father walks over to a pile of\nblankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.  He\ngives the pile a kick.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tFATHER\n</b>\t\t\t   (screaming at the\n\t\t\t    top of his lungs)\n\t\tLouis, wake up!\n\nHe uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl\nof soup for Jacques.  A fifty year old man pokes his head\nout from under the pile of blankets.  It's UNCLE LOUIS,\nwho is having a very hard time, waking up.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nJACQUES bursts out of the house, running.  Diving gear\nunder his arm.  A piece of buttered bread in his mouth.\n\nHe catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS.  They're on\na path winding down to the port.  JACQUES slows down\nabruptly.  Tries to imitate their stride.  The weather is\nbalmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  SEA - DAY\n</b>\nTheir boat on the water.  The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES\noff the cliffs.  A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim\nthe waves of its wake.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BOAT - DAY\n</b>\nOn board.  JACQUES' Father checks the antique air pump.\nJACQUES polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and\nlays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's\nsuit.\n\nAt the foot of an old monastery another boat passes.\nThe Priest is in it.\n\nJACQUES' Father and LOUIS take off their caps.  JACQUES\ntakes the gold coin out of his pocket.\n\nThe pope nods to JACQUES.  His father looks over at him\nwithout understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin\nback in his pocket.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BOAT - DAY\n</b>\nLOUIS casts anchor.  A few feet away, siting on a rock,\nthe kid with little round glasses is fishing.  He turns\naround to the boat.  JACQUES smiles and waves at him.\nENZO waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing\nsession.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tFATHER\n</b>\t\tJacques, come help me.\n\nJACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit.  The burly\nman struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes.  He\nseems sluggish and tired.  JACQUES watches worriedly.  He\nhas a weird feeling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tYou shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\tThen you shouldn't eat everyday,\n\t\tJacques.\n\nHis father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tFATHER\n</b>\t\t\t   (winks at him)\n\t\tDon't worry.  When I'm tired down\n\t\tthere, the mermaids help me out.\n\nFather and son smile at each other.  Then his father puts\nthe helmet on.  JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump.\n\nThe heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater.  The\ngleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of\nsight.\n\nJACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions\nto maintain the flow of air.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\t\t   (to Jacques)\n\t\tHey!

JACQUES doesn't budge.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\tDon't you want to know where?\n\nJACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father.\nHe doesn't answer.\n\n\n<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER\n</b>\nHe moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit.  He\nis working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor.  He\nsees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached\nto a life line from the boat fastened to his waist.  He\nmoves on.\n\n\n<b>INT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING\n</b>\nThey keep up the rhythm.  Sitting on a rock at a distance,\nENZO watches them.  UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhy don't you ask me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhere I saw the mermaids?!

We're sitting here like\n\t\ttwo stones and I'm taking to myself.\n\t\tAsk me something, Goddamnit!\n\nJACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping\nand almost serenely asks him:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (in a completely\n\t\t\t    flat tone)\n\t\tWhy did my mother leave?\n\nUNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question.  A beat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\t\t   (ill at ease)\n\t\tCome on now, pump!\n\n\n<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER\n</b>\nHe is walking with difficulty at the bottom.  His bag is\nfull of sponges.  He seems to be having trouble breathing.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS\n</b>\nJACQUES and LOUIS are pumping silently.  UNCLE LOUIS feels\nobliged to answer JACQUES' question.\n\nUNCLE LOUIS finally breaks the silence and explains:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\tYour mother didn't leave.  She went\n\t\tback to America, that's all.  It's\n\t\ther home.  She's allergic to this\n\t\tIsland.  She likes refrigerators and\n\t\tmachines that clean the floor... so\n\t\tone day she left.  Woman are like\n\t\tthat, unpredictable, like the sea.\n\nThey haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing\nat the surface.  The air hose is being pulled down in a\nvery worrisome way.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (with a slight grin)\n\t\tSo where did you see mermaids?\n\nUNCLE LOUIS smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tUNCLE LOUIS\n</b>\t\tIn the bars in Athens!\n\nVery pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing.\nJACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders.  The air hose is\nsuddenly yanked down.  JACQUES immediately sees all the\nbubbles.  He is white as a sheet.\n\nJACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling\ndown at his father.  He grabs the life line and starts\npulling at it hysterically.  The air hose snaps and\nstarts flying around like some crazy snake.  JACQUES tries\nto jump overboard.  UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot\nat the last second.  JACQUES is slapping the water with\nhis hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let\nhim.  JACQUES is yelling desperately.  ENZO is now\nstanding on his rock, watching the scene, horrified.\n\nThe sea now looks as if it were boiling.\n\nUNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his\narms.  Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying\ndesperately.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\t\t   (screaming)\n\t\tJacques!

ITALIAN VILLAGE STREET - DAY\n</b>\nThe image is now in color.\n\nA rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which\nfills the screen.\n\n<b>SUPERIMPOSED:  1987 SICILY\n</b>\nALFREDO runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he\ncan go, surprisingly fast.\n\nHe runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he\nenters.  We have time to read the sign carrying the\nrestaurant's name:  \"LA MAMMA\".\n\n\n<b>INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY\n</b>\nALFREDO skips in.  He is panting, covered in sweat.  His\npanic is palpable.  The whole room watches him approach a\nlong table where a large family is having a birthday party\nfor a very old lady.\n\nHe has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can\nget the words out.

ENZO is asleep in\nthe fore peak, curled up on a coil of line, snoring away.\nHe wears his tuxedo jacket over a skimpy bathing suit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n</b>\t\tEnzo, wake up!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\t\t   (pulled from his\n\t\t\t    dream)\n\t\tEh?  Si!  Avanti!\n\nHe gets up on one arm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n</b>\t\tThe medics are looking all over for\n\t\tyou.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\t\t   (irritated)\n\t\tI'm meditating, can't you see?\n\t\tJacques does two hours of yoga\n\t\tbefore going down.  I can take a\n\t\tfive minute nap, can't I?\n\nThe boat stops.  The anchor is thrown over board.\n\nThe sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready\nfor the competition.  Today is ENZO'S turn to dive.  A man\nis hooking a plaque indicating the depth (324 feet) onto a\nlead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.\n\n\n<b>INT.  YACHT - DOCTOR'S CABIN - DAY\n</b>\nA medic is bending over ENZO, taking his blood pressure.\n\nROBERTO pulls the tuxedo jacket down.  The doctor puts a\nblood pressure band around ENZO'S upper arm, pumps it up.\nHe listens with his stethoscope.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n</b>\t\tMr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but\n\t\tI cannot allow you to dive in such\n\t\tan advanced state of exhaustion.\n\nENZO jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels,\nlifts him in the air.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\t\t   (outraged)\n\t\tWhat do you know about the sea?\n\t\tHuh?  Nothing!  So you just put your\n\t\ttubes and tin cans away.  The sea is\n\t\tmine!  I know when she is ready for\n\t\tme and when she isn't.  And today,\n\t\tshe is ready.  Understand?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n</b>\t\tYou dive at your own risk.  You're\n\t\tbeen warned.\n\nENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\tBrave.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM\n</b>\nIt's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee\nBoat.  ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim\nladder to the platform.  He's wearing a wet suit and fins.\nHe flip-flops to the end of the platform.\n\nROBERTO hands him his mask.  The goggles are filled with\npolystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible.\nOnly two pinholes to see through.  The mask fits tightly\nover his nose.  When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an\nastonished insect.  ENZO breathes faster and faster.\nROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving\napparatus.  ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp\nof air.\n\nROBERTO releases the weight.  It sinks and drags ENZO\ndown, he quickly disappears into the dark water...\n\n\n<b>BLACK AND WHITE\n</b>\nBut this is JACQUES as he was a child.  He swims along the\nbottom, finds and picks up a gold coin.  We can see its\nancient markings, a youth on a dolphin.\n\nJACQUES looks up.  In front of him is a dolphin, floating\nvertically, still, apparently just watching.  JACQUES\nisn't scared anymore.  But every time he swims toward the\ndolphin, it moves further away.  It finally disappears.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY\n</b>\nHe sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.  He\nlooks around the room, trying to get his bearings.\n\nJOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.  On the wall\nbehind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger.\nShe's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep.\n\nJACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA\nsleeping.  He walks over to her, touches her shoulder.\nShe wakes up, starts out of the chair.  She grabs the\nblanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on\nthe floor.  It's one of his.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\tYou scared me!\n\nJACQUES picks up the book.  JOHANA smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\tJust checking up on your family.\n\t\t\t   (then embarrassed)\n\t\tI guess I was drunker than I thought\n\t\tand the idea of going back to my\n\t\thotel in a wet dress...

No?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\tNo?  Huh?\n\t\t\t   (she says \"No\" as if\n\t\t\t    she had asked the\n\t\t\t    question)\n\t\tYes, of course!!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARINELAND - TAORMINA - DAY\n</b>\nJACQUES and JOHANA enter the dolphinarium.  JOHANA is\nwearing an old pair of JACQUES SHORTS along with an\noversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater.  She seems quite\npleased with her new attire.\n\nJACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and\nhead toward the dolphin pool.  It's pretty crowded, mostly\nkids.\n\nThe dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the\npool.  The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool\nand getting absolutely no reaction.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tWhat's the matter?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTRAINER\n</b>\t\tI don't understand.  We've tried for\n\t\ttwo days.  They won't eat.  They\n\t\twon't perform.  It's since we got\n\t\tthe new one.\n\n<b>CLOSE ON DOLPHIN\n</b>\nsurfacing.  It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool,\nlooks to JACQUES and SPEAKS.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tIs she the new one?\n\nSurprised, the trainer nods.\n\nJOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin.  She\ndoesn't understand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\tHow can you tell it's a female?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t... The way she moves.\n\nThree other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is\npatting.\n\nJACQUES is staring at the female dolphin.  It looks like\nthe animal is trying to tell him something.  Suddenly the\ndolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the\npool.\n\n\n<b>UNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL\n</b>\nJACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle.  Let's it pull\nhim along.  The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool,\nand pulls JACQUES to the bottom.  The other dolphins\ncircle above.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DOLPHIN POOL - DAY\n</b>\nJACQUES pops up.  As he does, three dolphins leap in the\nair behind him.  JOHANA walks closer to the pool.  She is\nso excited by what JACQUES is doing, she finally falls\ninto the pool.\n\nAfter a while, JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps\nJOHANA out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTRAINER\n</b>\t\tDid you ever think of trying the\n\t\tpublic pool?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\tHe's a dolphin specialist.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTRAINER\n</b>\t\tIn that case what's wrong with the\n\t\tnew one?  Is she sick or not.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (taking his time to\n\t\t\t    answer)\n\t\tNot the way you mean.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTRAINER\n</b>\t\tWhat am I supposed to do?

I certainly am\n\t\tentitled to complain!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tIt's going to cost you more than you\n\t\tthink!\n\nJACQUES turns around and walks off.  JOHANA catches up\nwith him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tShe's not like the others.  She\n\t\tcan't stand to be away from the sea.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\t\t   (impressed)\n\t\tHow do you know that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (stopping)\n\t\tI don't know, I just feel it.\n\n\n<b>INT.

Everybody\nis congratulating him.\n\nROBERTO is screaming, MAMMA MOLINARI is crying.  ENZO\nsmiles as he talks back to them.  He sees JACQUES.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\t\t   (screaming)\n\t\tAh!

So the trinket will just\n\t\thave to wait a bit.\n\nENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.  Inside his room is\nabsolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating.  Wet suits hung\nout to dry everywhere.  MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up\nmountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the\nmiddle of the room.  A lot of smoke... steam... color...\nnoise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet.\n\nJOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner\nof the room.

He puts\nthem in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as\nhis hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade...\n\nAlready euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his\nsystem, he moves into another reality altogether... seems\nto empty himself out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTECHNICIAN\n</b>\t\tDue minuti!\n\nJACQUES fills a small tube with water.  Pours it into his\nnostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... He\nputs on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems\nto be operating in a different time zone...

JACQUES hangs on like a\nribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down.\n\nAbove him, the boat disappears from sight.\n\nHe moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks\nlike a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him.\n\nBelow, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night.\nJACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the\nbrakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down.\n\nThe medics are waiting for him there.  They take his\npulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the\nbubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around\nthem...\n\nJACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he\nreleases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this\ntime into pitch black.\n\nBelow him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He\nreaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES\nbrakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body\nright side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to\ntake the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle\nof the gesture.\n\nThe dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and\nforefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES\ndoes not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES\ndoes not respond.\n\nThe diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and\nthen JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay.\nSlowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle\nof the balloon.\n\nThe dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The\nballoon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him\nup.\n\nAt the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the\nballoon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the\nsurface.\n\nJACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's\ngetting warm now... He closes his eyes.\n\nPasses the medical control without stopping... without\neven seeing it like someone asleep.\n\nHe's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air.\nJACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter.\n\nThe silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet\nto go.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - JACQUES - JOHANA - SUNSET\n</b>\nJACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals.\nJOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit on\nthe restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea.\n\nBelow them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets filled\nwith sponges.

In it, LAWRENCE waits to climb on board.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY\n</b>\nENZO puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse.  He is\nserious, concentrating hard.\n\nLAWRENCE'S boat slides along the big Committee Boat and\nthe DOCTOR climbs onto it.\n\n\n<b>INT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS\n</b>\nLAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.  There's a stack of graph\npaper on a cabin table.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tLAWRENCE\n</b>\t\t...

At the depths these men are\n\t\tdiving, it is a physiological\n\t\timpossibility that they can retain\n\t\tenough oxygen in their blood to make\n\t\tit back to the surface.  It's a\n\t\tfunction of how long it takes to get\n\t\tto the bottom, orient themselves and\n\t\tto return... To attempt to break\n\t\tMayol's record is simple suicide.\n\t\t\t   (to Novelli)\n\t\tFor the last time.  I'm telling you\n\t\tcancel the competition.\n\nNOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform\nwhere ENZO is concentrating.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n</b>\t\tMolinari's a seventeen time world\n\t\tchampion.

He sits at the edge of the platform\nhyperventilating, almost in a trance.\n\nWe see JACQUES in the background, talking to NOVELLI, he\nthen walks over to ENZO and climbs down next to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\tEnzo?\n\t\t\t   (no response)\n\t\tEnzo...

The\n\t\tdoctors say it isn't possible to go\n\t\tdeeper and live.

NOVELLI is\nballing out his assistants.\n\nJACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they\nwere a gaggle of geese.  He listens to the sound of the\ngueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the\nstopwatches.  He knows something is wrong.\n\nHe walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little\noxygen bottle which is there for security.  He takes a few\nbreaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives\ndown after ENZO.\n\n\n<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES\n</b>\nJACQUES pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand.\n80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming toward\nhim carrying ENZO'S unconscious body.\n\nJACQUES struggles with them, pushes them away, takes ENZO\nin his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic,\nscreaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the\nflow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion,\nthe memory of death.\n\nENZO has a big serene smile on his face.  The MEDICS push\nboth divers toward the surface.\n\nAs if they were on land, JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to\nwake him up.  He then slaps his face but ENZO remains\nunconscious.\n\nThey finally break the surface in each others arms.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ON DIVING PLATFORM\n</b>\nThey pull ENZO out of the water.  The doctors open his\njacket.  ENZO motions to JACQUES to come close.  He still\nhas that long smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tENZO\n</b>\t\t\t   (faintly)\n\t\tYou were right.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (moved)\n\t\t...

His eyes close.\n\nJACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs.\nThe doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES\nresists.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tLAWRENCE\n</b>\t\tJust give him five minutes!  What\n\t\tdoes it matter now, anyway... Come\n\t\ton, just leave him alone!\n\nLAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform.\n\nJACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his\nbelt.  Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S\nbody back into the water and dives after it.\n\n\n<b>UNDERWATER - JACQUES\n</b>\nHe holds ENZO in his arms.  Lets the dead weight of the\nbody pull him down, deeper and deeper.  The rope around\nJACQUES' waist runs out, stops his descent with an abrupt\njerk.  When he feels it, JACQUES lets go... watches as\nENZO'S body continues to drift by itself into the\nbottomless blue...\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM\n</b>\nThe doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that\nJACQUES is attached to.  He is unconscious when they pull\nhim up.  They hold him up by his feet.  JACQUES throws up\ngallons of water.  They put an oxygen mask on his face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tA DOCTOR\n</b>\t\t\t   (listening to his\n\t\t\t    heartbeat)\n\t\tThe heart is going to stop!  The\n\t\tstimulator, quickly.\n\nSuddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES.  Sounds\ndisappear.  The image slows down, the light fades.\n\nJACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down.\n\nHis heart stops.\n\nAmong the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle,\nsmiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She\nsmiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart\nstarts again slowly.\n\nThe image goes back to normal.\n\nSounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly\ncome back.\n\nJACQUES falls unconscious.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tA DOCTOR\n</b>\t\tThe heart started again!  It's all\n\t\tright!\n\nNOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nJACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever.\n\nJOHANA sits at his feet.\n\nLAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.  He takes a pill\nfrom a bottle and gives it to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tLAWRENCE\n</b>\t\tTake this.  Have a good sleep.\n\nJACQUES swallows the pills.  JOHANA walks over from the\nbalcony.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tLAWRENCE\n</b>\t\tSweet dreams.\n\nLAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep.\nHe goes out of the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (tenderly to Johana,\n\t\t\t    who had started to\n\t\t\t    leave the room)\n\t\tKiss me.\n\nJOHANA bends over and kisses him.\n\nJACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\tSleep now.  We'll talk later.\n\nJOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  HOTEL BAR - ON TERRACE - LAWRENCE - JOHANA\n</b>\nThey're at the little zinc bar.  Not talking, not really\ndrinking either, just toying with their glasses.\n\nROBERTO passes, stops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tROBERTO\n</b>\t\tI've packed all of...

JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES\n</b>\nJACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He\nis breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the\nroom becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable.\nThe ceiling turns into water.\n\nJACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The\nwater level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he\nis swallowed by it.\n\nAs he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air\nat the surface and going back very quickly to the blue.\n\nThe dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of\nmuscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They\nall break through the surface to gulp air regularly.\n\nSuddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the\nblue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar\npicture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a\nfew seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket,\ngulps air and goes back down.\n\nThe sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin,\nlocates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly\nlike a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two,\nthen in four, and this way, he isolates his victim.\n\nHe breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He\ngoes full power.  The fish he is after are even more\ndivided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a\npanic.\n\nThe exhausted fish is swallowed.\n\nThe dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface\nin slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright.\n\nHe screams inhumanly.\n\nImage is white, black, silence.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES\n</b>\nJOHANA opens the shutters.\n\nThe room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and\nglasses, lamps and vases.  The windows are blown out.\n\nJACQUES is lying in bed.  There is a thin trickle of blood\ncoming from his nose and ears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\t\t   (in a panic)\n\t\tJacques... Are you alright?\n\n\n<b>EXT.

He turns on the platform lights:  above\nand underwater.  He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90,\n120 feet...\n\nJACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus\nposition, concentrating...\n\nJOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him,\nwondering just how far he is going to push this whole\nthing.\n\nAs the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She\nunderstands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom,\ninto the blue, into himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJOHANA\n</b>\t\tJacques, you know I love you.\n\nJACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his\ngueuse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJACQUES\n</b>\t\t\t   (after a silence)\n\t\tDon't be sad...

He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is\nin his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns\non the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light\naround him.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

She cries her\ntears and looks down at the water.\n\n\n<b>UNDERWATER\n</b>\nThe headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet\naround JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of\nlight.  He stays there, patiently floating around and\naround his cable... as if he were waiting for something.\n\nA long form circles the border between the darkness and\nthe light.\n\nJACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses\nits body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the\nnight.  JACQUES watches in amazement.\n\nA dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead\nhim off.
