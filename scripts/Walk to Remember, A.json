Everyone\nturns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.\n\n\n<b>LANDON'S POV - JAMIE\n</b>\nFlanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing\nher Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but\nstill becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.\n\n\n<b>BACK TO SCENE\n</b>\nLandon swells with pride.\n\nJamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly\nmakes her way down the aisle.\n\nIn the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.\n\nJamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.     A\nmoment later, she and her father continue.\n\nA long, difficult walk.    A walk to remember.\n\n\n<b>AT ALTAR\n</b>\nThe nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father\nnear.\n\nApplause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.\n\nJamie sits.

Dr. Carter kneels.   Showing solidarity with his\nson.\n\nReverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's\ncheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.\n\n\n<b>LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV\n</b>\nReverend Sullivan towering over them.\n\n\n<b>BACK TO SCENE\n</b>\nReverend Sullivan kneels, too.\n\nJamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's\nhand in her left. Linking the three together.\n\nThe congregation silences.\n\nReverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.     Struggling.\n\n<b>                            REV.

He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin\nparchment thin.\n\nThe two men embrace.       Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.\n\n<b>                           REV.
