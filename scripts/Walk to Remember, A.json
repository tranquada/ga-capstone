JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER\n\nA big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of\nheads are bent over textbooks and notebooks.

Luis looks down at the book as if for the\nanswer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks\noff. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie\nstudying him.

I don't know if I\n             can pray, but I can do just about\n             anything else.\n\nNeither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the\nhouse and walk over.\n\n\nON GROUND\n\nLandon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend\nbetter.\n\n                           LANDON\n             Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie\n             needs.

JAMIE'S BEDROOM\n\nJamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too\nexhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up,\ngently carries her back to bed.

He lets her.\n\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - EARLY MARCH\n\nThe rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon\ncarries pieces of the older telescope to his car.

She opens her eyes.\n\n                        LANDON\n          You okay?\n\nShe nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his\nhead on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close\nagain. There's nothing to say.\n\n\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JAMIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME\n\nReverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at\nthe scene within.

Peace offerings.\n\nHe walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug.\nReady to work.\n\n                           LANDON\n             I've almost finished the rocker.\n             Did she order mirrors?\n\n                           REV. SULLIVAN\n             In there.\n\nAs they walk to the garage.\n\n                           REV. SULLIVAN\n             You have materials for the side\n             bearings?\n\n                           LANDON\n             I'm using an old phonographic\n             turntable.\n\n                           REV.

He yanks the garage door\nup. Goes in.\n\n                           LANDON\n             You know about this stuff?\n\n                           REV.

SULLIVAN\n             She did. But hardly anyone does\n             anything truly alone.\n\nThe Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package.\nLandon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door.\n\n                           LANDON\n                    (serious)\n             I need to do this alone.\n\nReverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long\nmoment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back\ndoor.\n\n\nINT. CHURCH - REVEREND'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING\n\nLandon stands in the doorway. The Reverend is wiping his\nglasses, his face, maybe of tears. He sees Landon.\n\n                           REV. SULLIVAN\n             You finish?\n\n                            LANDON\n             A few minutes ago. I have to ask\n             you something.\n\nLong pause.\n\n                           REV. SULLIVAN\n             When I was seventeen, I was sent\n             up for a year for stealing a car.\n                    (beat)\n             Sometimes I still feel that boy\n             inside me and I don't like him.\n                    (beat)\n             But I like you.\n\nThe Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.     Landon takes\nit. The two men shake. Allies now.\n\n\nINT. JAMIE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING\n\nJamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open.\nGroggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there.\nShowered, clean clothes.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              116.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           LANDON\n             We're going out.\n\nHe starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV.\n\n                           JAMIE\n             Can I -- go out?\n\n                           LANDON\n             You'll be fine for a few minutes.\n\nJamie looks at the nurse.    Uncertain.     The nurse nods.\n\n\nEXT. PARSONAGE ROOF - NIGHT\n\nLandon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The\nfinished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky.\nShe's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.\n\n                           JAMIE\n                    (grateful, touching\n                     it)\n             It's beautiful... Thank you.\n\nBut she looks at the lights of the house and streets\naround them.\n\n                           JAMIE\n             I don't know what we'll be able to\n             see... Help me stand.\n\nHe checks his watch.\n\n                           LANDON\n             Wait a sec.\n\nAs she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood\nsuddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every\nnearby house are switched off.\n\n\nEXT. DOWN STREET\n\nNeighbors step outside.    Hold up binoculars.\n\n\nEXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - PARKING LOT\n\nMembers of the Star Club and other students look through\ntraditional telescopes.\n\n                                                         117.\n\nEXT. PARSONAGE ROOF\n\nJamie hugs Landon in gratitude.\n\n                         LANDON\n           We have five minutes.\n\nJamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and\nshe peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back,\nwipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the\ntelescope into the correct position.\n\n\nHER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE\n\nHaley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and\nstreamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's\nhazy head and long tail.\n\n                         JAMIE (O.S.)\n           The comet of the century...\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nShe steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then\nmoves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely\nengrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:\n\n                           LANDON\n           You love me?\n\nShe leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.\n\n                         LANDON\n           Will you do something for me?\n\n                           JAMIE\n           Landon.    I can't even do for\n           myself.\n\n                         LANDON\n           But if you could, you would?\n\n                           JAMIE\n           Yes.\n\nHis throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear,\nsadness, and love.\n\n                         LANDON\n           Will you marry me?\n\nHER FACE\n\nIllness, happiness, disbelief.\n\n                                                          118.\n\nEXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - EARLY APRIL\n\nA sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms.    Dogwoods,\nwisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.\n\n\nINT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH\n\nBursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every\nkid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda;\nteachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel\nand others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation;\nCynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids;\nneighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.\n\nLandon stands with his father by the altar.\n\nThe \"WEDDING MARCH\" begins...\n\nThe double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone\nturns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.\n\n\nLANDON'S POV - JAMIE\n\nFlanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing\nher Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but\nstill becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nLandon swells with pride.\n\nJamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly\nmakes her way down the aisle.\n\nIn the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.\n\nJamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.     A\nmoment later, she and her father continue.\n\nA long, difficult walk.    A walk to remember.\n\n\nAT ALTAR\n\nThe nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father\nnear.\n\nApplause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.\n\nJamie sits.   Exhausted.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         119.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nLandon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.\n\nPause.   Dr. Carter kneels.   Showing solidarity with his\nson.\n\nReverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's\ncheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.\n\n\nLANDON AND JAMIE'S POV\n\nReverend Sullivan towering over them.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nReverend Sullivan kneels, too.\n\nJamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's\nhand in her left. Linking the three together.\n\nThe congregation silences.\n\nReverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.     Struggling.\n\n                            REV. SULLIVAN\n             As a father, I'm supposed to give\n             away my daughter. But I can no\n             more give Jamie away than I can\n             give away my heart. But I can let\n             another share in the joy she has\n             given me. May God's blessings be\n             with you both.\n\nHe reaches out, offering a hand to Landon.     Completing the\ncircle.\n\n                           REV. SULLIVAN\n             Landon, repeat after me. Do you\n             take...\n\nAs words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the\nCAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar --\nJamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.\n\nTO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter,\nJosh, Eric, Clay.\n\nThen BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a\npassage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His\nvoice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own\nwork.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              120.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n                           REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)\n             'Love is always patient and kind.\n             It is never jealous. Love is\n             never boastful or conceited. It\n             is never rude or selfish. It does\n             not take offense and is not\n             resentful. Love takes no pleasure\n             in other people's sins, but\n             delights in the truth. It is\n             always ready to excuse, to trust,\n             to hope, and to endure whatever\n             comes...'\n\nAnd the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...\n\n\nPARSONAGE\n\nin a different season.      Winter.\n\nUP the front steps and INTO...\n\n\nLIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY)\n\nAs it is now, in present day.\n\nThe nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting.\nLooking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The\nRainmaker...\n\nThe nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in.\nReverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin\nparchment thin.\n\nThe two men embrace.       Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.\n\n                           REV.

Pause.   Landon\nsearches for something meaningful to say.\n\n                            LANDON\n             She taught me -- everything.     She\n             saved my life.\n\nThe Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness.         Realizing\nnow why Landon has come.\n\n                           REV.

He makes a move to go.\nThen turns back.\n\n                           LANDON\n             I'm sorry she never got her\n             miracle.\n\n                             REV.
