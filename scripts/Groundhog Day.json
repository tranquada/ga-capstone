PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING\n\n          We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks\n          volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers\n          from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed\n          memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award\n          statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk\n          on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.\n          As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small\n          sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline\n          blanket.\n          GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his\n          head in the door.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           Christ, what a pit.

CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9\n          Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local\n          news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as\n          WPGH - Pittsburgh.\n          Phil ducks into the studio.\n\n          \n\n           -3-\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather\n          corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather\n          stats up on a chart.\n\n           PHIL\n           Get away from me. I'm working.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           So what's the outlook? We gonna\n           get that blizzard?\n          Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed\n          \"Phil's Phorecast\" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next\n          to the title.\n\n           PHIL\n           No way. All that moisture coming\n           up from the Gulf is going to miss\n           us completely and take a dump on\n           Harrisburg.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           (with authority)\n           Good, 'cause you're going up to\n           Punxsutawney to cover the\n           groundhog story tomorrow morning\n           and I want you back here in time\n           to do the five.\n\n           PHIL\n           Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will\n           you! I covered the goddamn\n           groundhog last year and the year\n           before that.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           And you'll do it :next year and\n           the year after, too. When I\n           worked in San Diego, I covered\n           the swallows coming back to\n           Capistrano for ten years in a\n           row.\n\n           PHIL\n           You should've killed the guy who\n           made you do that.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           I wanted to do it.\n\n           PHIL\n           Then you should've killed\n           yourself.

He comes out,\n           he looks around, he wrinkles up\n           his little nose, he sniffs around\n           a little, he sees his shadow, he\n           d oesn't see his shadow-- it's\n           nice. People like it.\n\n           PHIL\n           Many people are morons.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           Just do it.\n\n           PHIL\n           What'11 you give me?\n          Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a\n          very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           (to Phil)\n           I'll give you Rita.\n           (calls her over)\n           Rita, could you come here for a\n           second? I got a little job for\n           you.\n          Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,\n          personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,\n          a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this\n          point to realize it.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (TEASING)\n           You can't send Rita out on a\n           story like this. She's just a\n           cub, a pup, still wet behind the\n           ears. Look at her. Her ears are\n           sopping wet. This needs a\n           Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a\n           big story. People need to know.\n\n           RITA\n\n           (INTRIGUED)\n           What's the story?\n\n           HAWLEY\n           The Punxsutawney Groundhog\n           Festival.\n\n           RITA\n           Gil, if it's all right with you\n           I ' d rather follow-up on the\n           nurses' strike.\n\n          \n\n           -5-\n\n          \n\n           HAWLEY\n           You can do the nurses when you\n           get back. Just take the squeaky\n           wheel here up to Punxsutawney and\n           get him back in one piece. Okay?\n\n           RITA\n           Yeah, okay.\n          Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She\n          knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,\n          she finds him appealing in an odd way.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (PLEASANTLY)\n           You know, this could be extremely\n           interesting.\n\n           RITA\n           I've never done a weather story\n           before. What's Punxsutawney\n           like?\n\n           PHIL\n           Oh, it's an enchanted place. A\n           magical world. It's the\n           Constantinople of the whole\n           Western Appalachian-Susquehanna\n           Drainage system.\n\n           RITA\n           Do you always joke?\n\n           PHIL\n           About 70 to 80% of the time.\n           Inside I'm actually a very shy\n           and sensitive person.\n\n           RITA\n           A lot of people around here think\n           you're not very sincere.\n\n           PHIL\n           Tell me the names of these\n           people.\n\n           RITA\n           I'll line up a crew and\n           transportation. If you don't\n           feel like driving, we can all go\n           up in the van together.\n\n           PHIL\n           I think I'll take my own car.\n           I ' m not that fond of my fellow\n           man.\n\n          \n\n           -6-\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RITA\n\n           (EXITING)\n           Nice attitude.\n\n           PHIL\n           Nice face.\n           (calls after her)\n           Why don't you ride up with me?\n\n           RITA\n           No, thanks.\n          STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired\n          correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.\n\n          \n\n          INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATER\n\n          Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone\n          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past\n          two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number\n          of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching\n          himself on the TV monitor.\n\n           PHIL\n           (on the phone)\n           They don't really think of me as\n           a weatherman around here. More\n           of a \"personality,\" but with the\n           credibility of a first-class\n           broadcast journalist. Once you\n           look at my tape I think you'll\n           see what they mean.\n          Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for\n          a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about\n          this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little\n          scary.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n\n           (BITTERLY)\n           I just want to know one thing:\n           did I do something wrong or are\n           you just tired of me or what?

It's just that I don't have\n           time for a real relationship\n           right now.

I was just\n           talking to the CBS guy about a\n           network job. I want that. This\n           is just the beginning for me. I\n           can't waste any more time.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n           Are you saying our relationship\n           was a waste of time?\n\n           PHIL\n           Our relationship? We went out a\n           total of four times! And only\n           twice did anything happen. It\n           was fun but I don't see that as\n           a big commitment.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n           (closing in again)\n           I had our charts done.

You don't want to be with\n           me. You can do better. Look,\n           Stephanie, if I ever said or did\n           anything to mislead you I'm sorry\n           for that, but right now I have to\n           do this groundhog thing and I\n           don't have a handle on it yet.\n          He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and\n          puts on his jacket.\n\n           PHIL (CONT.)\n           I'll tell you what.

As he stands there, his body\n          casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the\n          camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.\n          Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the\n          brief appearance of the groundhog.

He starts breathing\n          heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's\n          going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric\n          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his\n          head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the\n          mirror with his sledgehammer.\n          Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into\n          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,\n          madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the\n          room with it.\n          As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,\n          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of\n          feathers.\n          Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed.

It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears.\n          Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil\n          transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.\n          Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,\n          everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.\n          An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up\n          a storm.\n\n           LEO\n           That's a great guy you've got\n           there.

STREET - NIGHT\n\n          \n          It is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm\n          in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita.\n          She looks like an angel.\n\n          \n\n           PHIL\n           Wait! Don't move!\n\n          \n          Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously,\n          joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.\n\n          \n\n           RITA\n           Making a snow man?

Several bystanders look\n          o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work.\n\n          \n\n           RITA\n           Can I look?\n\n          \n\n           PHIL\n           O kay, look.\n\n          \n          It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as\n          alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.\n\n          \n\n           RITA\n\n           (OVERWHELMED)\n           Nobody's ever done this for me.\n           Not even a drawing.

They are about to kiss, looking deep into\n          each others eyes.\n\n           PHIL\n           This one's for the Frog Prince.\n\n           RITA\n           What?\n\n           PHIL\n           Nothing.\n          They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.\n\n           PHIL\n           Will you come with me?\n          Rita nods.

Silence.\n          No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing.\n          Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are\n          different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed\n          now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep\n          under the covers.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (DISBELIEVING)\n           It's not true. It's not.

He stops after a few\n          bars.\n\n           PHIL (O.C.)\n           Yeah!!!!\n          Phil runs back into the room.\n\n           PHIL\n           It really happened!

You\n           can waste time, you can kill\n           time, you can do time, but if you\n           use it wisely, there's never\n           enough of it. So you'd better\n           make the most of the time you've\n           got.\n          A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita\n          rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita\n          and Phil continue their walk.\n\n          \n\n           -121-\n\n          \n\n           PHIL (V.O.)\n           Larry never got through the\n           blizzard, so none of my groundhog\n           reports ever made it on the air.\n           But Rita and I-- we lived happily\n           ever after.\n          Phil and Rita walk off together.\n          Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson\n          who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.\n\n           NED\n           But Phil told me you were his\n           accountant!\n\n           LARRY\n           Look, I told you!
