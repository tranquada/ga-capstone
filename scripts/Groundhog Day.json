Everywhere!\n\n<b>           CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LATER\n</b>\n          Phil and Rita, dressed now, enter and encounter Mrs. Lancaster\n          Phil hugs her.\n\n<b>           MRS. LANCASTER\n</b>           Oh, my!\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           -120-\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           PHIL\n</b>           Florence! Say hello to Rita.\n           She loves me.\n\n<b>           MRS. LANCASTER\n</b>           I'm not surprised.\n          He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          EXT. THE STREET - DAY\n</b>\n          Phil and Rita walk down Main Street hand in hand.\n\n<b>           A MAN\n</b>           Phil! Good morning!\n\n<b>           A LADY\n</b>           Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank\n           you.\n\n<b>           PHIL\n</b>           That's all right. I--\n          A FLORIST steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.\n\n<b>           FLORIST\n</b>           Phil, here. I want you to have\n           these.\n\n<b>           PHIL\n</b>           Thanks, Carl.\n          Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita.\n\n<b>           PHIL (V.O.)\n</b>           And so began my final lifetime,\n           and ended the longest winter on\n           record. I would find myself no\n           longer able to affect the chain\n           of events in this town, but I did\n           learn something about time. You\n           can waste time, you can kill\n           time, you can do time, but if you\n           use it wisely, there's never\n           enough of it. So you'd better\n           make the most of the time you've\n           got.\n          A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita\n          rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita\n          and Phil continue their walk.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           -121-\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           PHIL (V.O.)\n</b>           Larry never got through the\n           blizzard, so none of my groundhog\n           reports ever made it on the air.\n           But Rita and I-- we lived happily\n           ever after.\n          Phil and Rita walk off together.\n          Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson\n          who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.\n\n<b>           NED\n</b>           But Phil told me you were his\n           accountant!\n\n<b>           LARRY\n</b>           Look, I told you! He's nuts!\n          Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.\n\n<b>           NED\n</b>           Let me just tell you about single\n           premium life--\n          Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned\n          floundering in a snowbank.\n          Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street\n          revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside\n          that embraces it.\n\n<b>           THE END\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b> </pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Groundhog-Day.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Groundhog Day</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Danny Rubin\" title=\"Scripts by Danny Rubin\">Danny Rubin</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Groundhog Day Script.html#comments\" title=\"Groundhog Day comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:06:45.252647"}
