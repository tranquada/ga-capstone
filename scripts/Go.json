A DITCH - NIGHT\n\n             A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night,\n             DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a\n             beat.\n\n             Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the\n             riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached\n             beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine.\n\n             The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a\n             woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids.\n             Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding.\n\n             Bleeding a lot.\n\n             She tries to         push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles.\n             Her legs are         useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of\n             perverse joy         to her face, like she's just remembered the\n             punchline to         a favorite joke.\n\n                                          CLAIRE (V.O.)\n                               You know what I like best about Christmas?\n                               The surprises.\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n    2        INT.

A cigarette lighter flares.\n\n             We're in the trunk of a car with SIMON BAINES (22), a skinny\n             Brit with surfer hair. He looks around, realizes where he is.\n             Panicked, he starts POUNDING and KICKING.\n\n                                          CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D)\n                               You shake it, you weigh it, and you're\n                               totally convinced you have it pegged.

Two nose-ringed RIOT GRRRLS are drawing a\n     Christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic\n     marker.\n\n     Looking over at the entrance, he watches some GAPSTERS move\n     past the BOUNCERS. And behind them,\n\n     TODD GAINES.\n\n     Mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic. He hunches down.\n     Gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd.\n\n     Mannie works his way into the mob.\n\n     STROBES fire overhead.\n\n     Ronna dances on, oblivious...\n     Gaines circles, searching...\n     Mannie fights his way through the outer ring of MOSHERS...\n\n     Through the crowd, we see Gaines looking in...\n     Mannie grabs Ronna...\n     She smiles, tries to kiss him...\n\n     He YELLS in her ear. He has to repeat himself...\n     She looks back over her shoulder...\n     A space in the crowd...\n\n     She sees Gaines. He sees her.\n\n     The MUSIC STOPS. Dead silence.\n\n     Ronna and Gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity,\n     until suddenly...\n\n     The MUSIC BLASTS back, harder than ever. Like a shot, Ronna\n     and Mannie are out of there. Gaines plows through the crowd,\n     coming after them.\n\n\n51   EXT.

They hide back in the shadows as\n\n     GAINES\n\n     races past. Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over\n     his knees sweating and shaking.\n\n                            RONNA\n                  What's wrong?

He collapses to\n     his knees. She can't get him back up.\n\n     Without warning, he HEAVES. We hear the SPLASH on the asphalt.\n\n     She props his head back against a dumpster.

Keeping low,\n     Ronna works her way down a row, coming to Mannie's car. She\n     tries one key, then another.\n\n     We LOOK UP to see Todd Gaines watching her from the hood of a\n     nearby car.\n\n                             GAINES\n                  How's it going, Ronna?

By instinct, she\n     starts to move away.\n\n     A red Miata moves down the row behind Ronna. She looks to it\n     for help, but it's already passed.\n\n                             RONNA\n                  It's not what it looks like.

She ducks around the corner\n     of a van, only to see...\n\n     A RED MIATA\n\n     doing 20 in reverse. It brakes, but there's no time. It hits\n     her hard.\n\n     She flies up over the roof of the car, CRASHING down on the\n     soft top. Her limp body starts to slip down the windshield,\n     but finally sticks.\n\n     PUSH IN ON GAINES\n\n     seeing the hit. HEARING it. Stunned.\n\n     A beat, then we hear the engine REV, pulling back again. That\n     shakes Ronna loose, letting her drop over the headlights in\n     front.\n\n     Rolling down the slope at the edge of the field, Ronna topples\n     ass-first into a drainage ditch. Her body lands with a\n     sickening THUD.\n\n     GAINES\n\n     stands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded.\n\n     He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt\n     and grass. For a moment, all is quiet.\n\n     Finally, Gaines tucks the gun into his jeans. One last look\n     around, then he starts working his way back across the parking\n     lot. Disappears.\n\n                                                                            40.\n                                          \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)\n\n\n\n\n55   EXT.

Somewhere in the distance, the Mary Xmas Supafest is\n     still RAGING, but here it's only a WHISPER with a beat.\n\n     With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves. Turns herself over on her\n     back. Each breath WHEEZES and GURGLES.\n\n     She pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and\n     tosses it aside. She tries to push herself up. Her legs won't\n     move.\n\n     Catching her breath, she looks to the top of the ditch, waiting\n     for somebody to look in. No one does. Adjusting herself, she\n     slides against a weathered magazine. Spin. Jane's Addiction\n     on the cover.\n\n     She collapses back, a new wave of pain.\n\n     After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a\n     COUGHING. She pushes her hair back, streaking blood across her\n     face.\n\n                          RONNA\n               Mannie!!\n\n     There's no answer. The YELLING hurts.

You don't fuck with Victor.\n\n                         VICTOR\n               What happened!\n\n                          HOLLY\n               They shot Vic. They went out the back.\n\n     Victor KICKS the door open, ready to fire. The alley is clear.\n     The BARTENDER comes through the curtain.\n\n                          VICTOR\n                   (handing off gun)\n               Find them.\n\n     The man races out. Victor looks at his son's arm. It's\n     bloody, but he'll live. Holly SHOUTS down the hallway.\n\n                           HOLLY\n               Call 911.\n\n                         VICTOR\n               No! No cops.\n\n\n85   EXT.

None seem to hit. The\n     Ferrari tears down the street.\n\n\n86   INT. FERRARI / DRIVING - NIGHT                                         86\n\n     Taking a left, Marcus slows down a little. We're on an empty\n     street well away from the Crazy Horse. He dabs at his bloody\n     nose.\n\n                                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                            63.\n                                          \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)\n86   CONTINUED:                                                               86\n\n\n     In the passenger seat, Simon looks at the gun in the hand. He\n     suddenly throws it out.\n\n                             MARCUS\n                  What are you doing?\n\n                            SIMON\n                  Getting rid of the weapon.\n\n     Marcus slams on the brakes.\n\n                             MARCUS\n                  It has your fingerprints on it.\n\n                             SIMON\n                  Oh shit.\n\n     Craning around, Simon looks for it in the street. Marcus backs\n     the car up. Suddenly, a phone RINGS. Lights flicker on the\n     car phone.\n\n                             SIMON\n                  Do we answer?\n\n     Marcus brakes again. The phone keeps RINGING.\n\n                             MARCUS\n                  It's probably Orange County asking where\n                  the hell his car is.\n\n                             SIMON\n                  It's a cell phone. They can trace where\n                  we are even if we don't answer.\n\n                             MARCUS\n                  Get the gun. Go. Find it.\n\n     Simon climbs out and starts looking, crouching to look under\n     cars.\n\n     In the Ferrari, Marcus sits back and kicks the phone with his\n     boot, over and over until it stops, dead.\n\n     For a moment, silence.\n\n     Then the car's ALARM starts going off.     Marcus SCREAMS with\n     frustration. He punches buttons on the     keychain, but nothing\n     will quiet it. He tries the key in the     ignition. It won't\n     turn over. Climbing out of the car, he     kicks it with all his\n     might.\n\n     Simon finds the gun, crawling under a truck to get it.\n\n\n                                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                          64.\n                                        \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)\n86   CONTINUED: (2)                                                         86\n\n\n     Using his jacket, Marcus starts frantically wiping off the\n     inside and outside of the Ferrari. Simon joins him. The whole\n     time, the alarm is still WAILING.\n\n     Satisfied, Marcus motions that they're done. He and Simon take\n     off running down the street.\n\n\n87   INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                           87\n\n     A bent needle pierces two flaps of skin, drawing a line of\n     blood with the thread.\n\n     Victor ties another stitch in Vic Jr.'s arm. He's had practice\n     at this. In the background, the Bartender and Noelle are\n     watching. Victor's tirade is directed at all of them.\n\n                          VICTOR\n               Just because a rapper has a white buddy\n               doesn't mean he's Sidney Fucking Poitier.\n               You check them.

Simon cranks the wheel, barely avoiding the\n      car ahead of him.\n\n      Not slowing, Simon aims for the entrance lane, where the bar is\n      coming down behind a small Nissan. Threading the needle, Simon\n      makes it past the car and the gate. The Ram Charger smashes\n      through the bar.\n\n\n105B EXT.

Cop!\n\n      There's a police car waiting at the stoplight.         Simon hits the\n      brakes, just short of a SQUEAL. They stop in a         middle lane,\n      next to the cop. Simon and Marcus look over to         the OFFICER,\n      trying to be calm. Singh and Tiny peer out the         back.\n\n      The Ram Charger slowly approaches, no hurry. In the squad car,\n      the Officer takes a radio call. Drunken TOURISTS walk past.\n      The crosswalk switches to a flashing red hand.\n\n                              SIMON\n                   How did they find us?\n\n                             MARCUS\n                   It's their town. I'm sure they have\n                   people.\n\n      The Ram Charger pulls in right behind the Cadillac. It's so\n      tall, all we see are the blinding headlights through the back\n      window. Singh and Tiny slink down. Marcus checks the gun on\n      his lap.\n\n\n                                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                       71A.\n                                     \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)\n106A CONTINUED:                                                         106A\n\n\n    The red hand stops flashing. The opposing light goes from\n    green to yellow. Simon gently REVS the engine. Suddenly, a\n    WHOOP.\n\n    Lights flashing, the police car makes a right turn from the\n    left lane, cutting in front of them. The SIREN is deafening.\n    Simon sees his opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n                                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                           72.\n                                         \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)\n106A CONTINUED: (2)                                                        106A\n\n\n      Gunning the engine, he hangs a hard left, cutting across three\n      oncoming lanes. The Ram Charger tries to follow, but the\n      traffic is already moving. Over the protest of many HORNS, the\n      pickup finally forces its way through.\n\n\n107   EXT.

Singh's\n      head BANGS against the roof. The passenger-side mirror\n      smashes off against the wall.\n\n                           TINY\n                Mother of fuck!\n\n\n108   EXT.

There's only one\n      way out -- Simon's aiming for the boulevard on the far side.\n\n                           SINGH\n                    (looking out back)\n                I don't see `em.\n\n\n108A UP AHEAD                                                              108A\n\n      The end of the alley approaches. From the far edge, a flashing\n      orange light. A giant street-sweeper is slowly crossing the\n      alley.

Wider, it scrapes against one side.\n\n      Ahead, the street sweeper is blocking one-quarter of the\n      alley. One-third. A moment of hesitation, then Simon floors\n      it.

A ear-piercing SCREECH.\n\n      A ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are\n      scraped away. Forward momentum finally stops.\n\n\n109   INT.

Marcus's seat breaks,\n      PINNING him. He pushes back, but Singh YELPS in protest.\n\n      Simon blinks, trying to figure out if he's alive.

The car is wedged in tight sideways.\n      Further down the alley, we find the broken-off\n\n      SIDE MIRROR.\n\n      In its cracked face we see five Ram Chargers approaching. A\n      giant tire smashes the mirror to bits.\n\n                                                                           74.\n                                         \"GO\" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON)\n\n\n\n\n111   INT.

Looking over his seat, Marcus sees the\n      giant pickup heading right for them.

The Ram Charger\n      CRUNCHES into the side of the Cadillac, pushing it down the\n      alley. More sparks shoot off as it goes.\n\n      Looking ahead, the street sweeper has moved past the end of the\n      alley, but the far side of the street beyond is a construction\n      area, flashing baricades all around.

Everyone looks up. That's when\n      we come to find\n\n      TODD GAINES\n\n      sitting alone at a booth by the window, disassembling a\n      newspaper.

She's tired and wired, all nerves and\n      raw edges. There's static only she can feel.\n\n      She looks right past Gaines, out to the rain on the street. He\n      watches her, but doesn't try to catch her eye. The Jamaican\n      WAITER walks past her with a pot of coffee.\n\n                             WAITER\n                   Anywhere you want.\n\n                             CLAIRE\n                   I'm meeting people.\n\n      He doesn't care. Claire takes a seat at the table in front of\n      her, but it's not to her liking. Then a booth. She plays with\n      the salt shakers. Bad.\n\n      It's only now that she sees Gaines watching her. At first she\n      doesn't recognize him. Then a light goes on.

They both have\n      the same ink stamp on the back. He's busted, no way to talk\n      himself out.\n\n      The Waiter comes with coffee, refills Gaines' cup.\n\n      Claire overturns the cup in front of her. The Waiter fills it.\n      She overturns a second cup, points to it. A big weird smile.\n      Reluctantly, the Waiter fills that too.
