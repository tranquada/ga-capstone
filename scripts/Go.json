MANNIE'S CAR / PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                11\n</b>\n     The Beast is Mannie's pride and joy,    a late-70's Toyota held\n     together with duct tape and prayer.     It's outfitted for the\n     season with Christmas lights lining    the windshield and back\n     window. Santa has replaced Jesus on     the dashboard.\n\n     Ronna climbs in the passenger door, counting a stack of 20's\n     fresh from the ATM.
