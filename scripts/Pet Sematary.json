This in dark which slowly\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVES TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  A GRAVE MARKER  SUMMER DAY\n</b>\nIt's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in \nblack paint which has faded: SMUCKY  HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters \nare faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a \nchild.\n\n<b>MAIN TITLES BEGIN.\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER\n</b>\nA child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating: \n<b>BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER  \n</b><b>1971-1974.\n</b>\n<b>MAIN TITLES CONTINUE\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  TWO MARKERS\n</b>\nI think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for \nthe crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers \nthemselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers \nthere are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut \nbutter jars, etc.\n\nThese two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1, \n1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL \n1958 (another board).\n\n<b>MAIN TITLES CONTINUE\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  FIVE OR SIX MARKERS\n</b>\nWe can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the \n\"gravestones\" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that \nthis woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated -- \nanimal graveyard.\n\nWe can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER \nLIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood, \npainstakingly hammered flat.\n\n<b>MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY\n</b>\nFrom here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by \nforest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are \narranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this \nclearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard \nclearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which \nhold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the \nwords on the arch face those arriving along the path.\n\n<b>MAIN TITLES CONTINUE\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU\n</b>\nMAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is \nthe work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.\n\n<b>THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY \n</b>DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking \nacross to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead \nbranches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet \nfrom side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are \nthick tangles of underbrush that look impassible.\n\nAS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the \ndeadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible \nsnarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence? \nOur imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA \nHOLDS ON IT and then we\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\nBLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY.\n\n<b>EXT.  A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY  EVENING\n</b>\nSOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree...\n\nTo the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the \nwoods. Before it: a wide two-lane road.\n\nThe house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a \nshed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN \nREALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a \nbumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally.\n\nGROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts \nbetween the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver \nbody and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its \nshort-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it \ncomes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the \ndriveway of the house we've been looking at.\n\n<b>EXT.  REAR OF THE WAGON\n</b>\nAs LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the \nlicense plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED \n<b>YOUR M.D. TODAY?)\n</b>\nThe ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree-\nree-ree-ree of crickets. Then:\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE CREED (voice)\n\t\tIs this our new house, daddy?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS CREED (voice)\n\t\tThis is it.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE\n</b>\nThe two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32, \ngets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out \nfrom the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a \ngirl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house.\n\nThey come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon, \nstill staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tSo...what do you think?\n\nRACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tIt's gorgeous!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tAm I really gonna have my own room?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tYaay!\n\nShe looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging \ndown from the bough of a tree.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (to RACHEL)\n\t\tIs that a swing?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tYes, but the rope might be--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tYaay!\n\nShe goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tLet her go. It's cool.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tLouis, the house is beautiful.\n\nThey kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws \nher more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the \ncar. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tThe Master of Disaster awakes.\n\nThis SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tAnd Buckaroo Banzai.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tCome on--let's parole 'em.\n\nThey walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors, \nLOUIS to the rear of the wagon.\n\n<b>INT.  THE FRONT SEAT, WITH RAHEL AND GAGE\n</b>\nGAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly \nyelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are \nlittered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar \ncrud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in \nthis station wagon, and the wagon looks it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tDecided to wake up and see what home\n\t\tlooks like, huh?\n\nShe begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just \nwearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big \ntomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (voice)\n\t\tDaddy! Mommy! I see a path!\n\nLOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward:\n\n<b>EXT.  ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING\n</b>\nShe's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV\n</b>\nWe see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up \nits flank and into the dark woods.\n\nTHE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (irritated)\n\t\tNot so high, Ellie! You don't know\n\t\thow strong that rope is.\n\nShe puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then \nstands there, looking at his sister.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU\n</b>\nThe bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping \nthrough decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is \nfraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is \ngoing to have a great fall.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)\n</b>\nHe's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (raptuous voice)\n\t\tWheee!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tEllie, you heard your m---\n\nHis eyes widen.\n\n<b>EXT.  ELLIE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tWh--\n\nSOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swing--with \nELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams \nand begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised.\n\nLOUIS and RACHEL run to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLOUIS\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\tEllie! Are you all right?\tHoney? Are you okay?\n\n<b>EXT.  ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT\n</b>\nELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old \ngirl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tHurrts! It hurrrrts!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tAnyone who can scream that loud isn't\n\t\tready for intensive care just yet--\n\t\tlooks like she just skinned her knee.\n\nNevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from \nthe tire. RACHEL helps.\n\n<b>EXT.  GAGE\n</b>\nHe's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly \nforgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a \nbit; the boy needs a change.\n\nHe stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses \ninterest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station \nwagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a \nmoment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never \ngot around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the \nmesh.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGAGE\n</b>\t\tHi-Durch!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHURCH\n</b>\t\tWaow!\n\nGAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap. \nEither he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the \nstrength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment.\n\nSOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV)\n</b>\nA big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in \nblue letters--blasts by.\n\n<b>EXT.  GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER\n</b>\nThe windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his \nforehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by \nGAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGAGE\n</b>\t\tDruck!\n\nHe starts down the driveway toward the road.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING)\n</b>\nELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the \nwreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much \nfrom tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine \nher scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (to RACHEL)\n\t\tWould you get the first aid kit?\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (screaming)\n\t\tNot the stingy stuff! I don't want the\n\t\tstingy stuff, daddy!\n\nRACHEL suddenly looks around toward:\n\n<b>EXT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV)\n</b>\nNo one there.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tGage's gone!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tJesus, the road!\n\nThey get up together.\n\n<b>EXT.  GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD\n</b>\nA truck is coming. A great big one.\n\n<b>EXT.  ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU\n</b>\nThe grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.\n\n<b>EXT.  GAGE\n</b>\nHe takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab \nhim.\n\nGAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is \nused to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers \nare as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks.\n\n<b>EXT.  GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL\n</b>\nThe fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old \nblue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears \na faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply \nwrinkled and kindly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)\n\t\tNo you don't, my friend--not in\n\t\tthat road.\n\nBut he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGAGE\n</b>\t\tDrucks!\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (low)\n\t\tNo shit, Sherlock.\n\nJUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's \njoined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE \nbrings up the rear. She's still sniffling.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tGage!\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (hands him to her)\n\t\tHe was headed for the road, looked\n\t\tlike. I corralled him for you, missus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tThank you. Thank you so much.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.\n\nHe sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no \ncrushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as \nif he might have arthritis.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tJud Crandall. I live just across the road.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tI'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving\n\t\tthe wandering minstrel boy, here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tNo harm, no foul. But you want to watch\n\t\tout for that road. Those damn trucks go\n\t\tback and forth all day and most of the\n\t\tnight.\n\nHe leans over toward ELLIE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tWho might you be, little Miss?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tI'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642\n\t\tAlden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause)\n\t\tAt least, I used to.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tAnd now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow,\n\t\tand your dad's gonna be the new doctor\n\t\tup to the college, I hear, and I think\n\t\tyou're going to be just as happy as a\n\t\tclam here, Ellen Creed.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (to LOUIS)\n\t\tAre clams really happy?\n\nThey all laugh--even GAGE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tExcuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to\n\t\tchange this kid. It's nice to meet you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tSame here. Come over and visit when\n\t\tyou get the chance.\n\nAs RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away:\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (worries)\n\t\tDaddy, do I really have to have the\n\t\tstingy stuff?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tNo-I guess not.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tYayyy!\n\nShe goes belting off.\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (amused)\n\t\tI guess your daughter there ain't\n\t\tgoing to die after all.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (also amused)\n\t\tI guess not.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tHouse has stood empty for too long.\n\t\tIt's damn good to see people in it again.\n\nSOUND: A truck engine, gearing down.\n\n<b>EXT.  A MOVING VAN\n</b>\nIt blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHey--they actually found the place!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tMovin' in's mighty thirsty work. I\n\t\tusually sit out on my porch of an evening\n\t\tand pour a couple of beers over m'dinner.\n\t\tCome on over and join me, if you want.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWell, maybe I----\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (voice)\n\t\tLouis, what's this?\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE\n</b>\nGAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores \nthe nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to \nthe wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path \nELLIE has already glimpsed.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD\n</b>\nThey cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just \nclimbing out of the van.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFIRST MOVER\n</b>\t\tYou Mr. Creed?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYes. Just a second.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH\n</b>\nShe's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at \nthat strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the \ndeepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tThe movers--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tYes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does\n\t\tit go?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI don't have the slightest idea. When I saw\n\t\tthe house, this field was under four feet\n\t\tof snow.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (smiling)\n\t\tI bet Mr. Crandall knows!\n\nJUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that \nhe is serious.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tOh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and\n\t\ta good walk, too. I'll take you up there\n\t\tsometime, and tell you the story, too--\n\t\tafter you get settled in.\n\nHe smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of \nunderstanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference \nbetween the CREEDS and JUD.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT\n</b>\nSOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree... \n\nThere's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the \npath, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being \nmown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe.\n\n<b>INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT\n</b>\nThere's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in \nhere. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's \ngoing to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' \ncartons stacked all over the place.\n\nLOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned \ntired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first \nnight in the new place will understand.\n\nHe finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room. He \nsits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket, \nand lights one. He drops the spent match in the empty can, and \ntaps into the can during the scene.\n\nSOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of \nthe room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)\n\t\tKids are asleep, doc.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tGreat.\n\nHe hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just \ntwo good people in all the big darkness of their new house.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tYou're not really going over to have a\n\t\tbeer with that old guy, are you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWell, I've got a million questions about\n\t\tthe area, and---\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\t---and you'll end up doing a free\n\t\tconsultation on his arthritis or urinary\n\t\tproblems and---\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tDid you see his shirt?\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (giggles)\n\t\tSure. Bruce Springsteen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI really do have a million questions\n\t\tabout the area...but the thing I'm\n\t\treally curious about is how come this\n\t\toctogenarian Yankee is decorating the\n\t\tslumped remains of his pecs with the\n\t\tBoss.\n\nShe laughs.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT\n</b>\nPervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly \nup the crazy-paved path from the road's edge.\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (voice)\n\t\tThat you, doc?\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE\n</b>\nWe hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of \nJUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman \nearphones.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIt's me.\n\n<b>INT.  THE PORCH, WITH JUD\n</b>\nThe Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the \nheadphones casually around his neck, like a kid.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tWell, come on up and have a beer.\n\n<b>INT.  THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT\n</b>\nLOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with \nsome cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tYou need a glass?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tNot at all.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tGood for you.\n\nLOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tGod, that's fine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tAin't it just? The man who invented\n\t\tbeer, Louis, that man was having a\n\t\tprime day for himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat were you listening to?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tAllman Brothers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThe Eat A Peach album. God, they were\n\t\tgood before drugs and bad luck caught\n\t\tup with them. Listen to this, Louis.\n\nHe passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the \nWalkman's PLAY button.\n\nSOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats.\n\nLOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry. Wait.\n\nHe turns it down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tTry that.\n\nLOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments. \nIt's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot \nFenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tNice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tI like rock and roll. No...I guess\n\t\tthat's too mild. I love it. Since\n\t\tmy ears started to die out on me,\n\t\tit's the only music I can really hear.\n\t\tAnd since my wife died...I dunno, some-\n\t\ttimes a little rock and roll fills up\n\t\tnight. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause)\n\t\tOne more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope\n\t\tyour time here will be a happy one.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (great sincerity)\n\t\tThank you, Mr. Crandall.\n\nHe drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable \nsilence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look \ntoward:\n\n<b>EXT/INT.  THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)\n</b>\nOne of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are \nlittle amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too-- \nsweeps by in a blast of air.\n\n<b>INT.  THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (wincing)\n\t\tJesus!\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (lights a cigarette)\n\t\tThat's one mean road, all right--you\n\t\tremember that path your wife commented on?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tThe one that goes into the woods--sure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThat road--and those Orinco trucks--\n\t\tare the two main reasons it's there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat's at the end of it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (smiles)\n\t\tAnother day--after you get settled in a\n\t\tbit.

ROUTE 9  NIGHT\n</b>\nLOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA \nFOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He \npauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new \nhouse. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his \nattention the other way...toward the path.\n\nHe walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in \na wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.\n\nA SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS \nrecoils with a startled, muffled cry.\n\n<b>EXT.  CHURCH\n</b>\nThe cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in \nthe dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow!\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tChurch! God, you scared the life\n\t\tout of me!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHURCH\n</b>\t\tWaow!\n\nLOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND \ncomes again and he looks toward:\n\n<b>EXT.  THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nAnother Orinco tanker drones by, fast.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (to the cat)\n\t\tI know one thing that will keep you\n\t\thome, good buddy.\n\nHe starts toward the house.\n\nBLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD \n<b>SPEAK.\n</b>\n<b>INT.  A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU  DAY\n</b>\nWritten on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN \nJOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S \n<b>FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!\n</b>\nTHE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a \nfew cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape.\n\nWe look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL, \nclimbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a \nGerrypak.\n\n<b>EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD\n</b>\nThey are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them \ncatch up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tTake a look behind you.\n\nThey turn around, and their faces express their wonder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tMy God!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tIt's beautiful!\n\n<b>EXT.  THE VIEW\n</b>\nIt is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9 \njust behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning \nalong), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river \nvalley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue.\n\n<b>EXT.

FOREST  DAY\n</b>\nThese are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight \nshafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his \nmark here.\n\nTHE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is \ncarpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked.\n\nJUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there \nare wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps \nare.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWho owns the woods up ahead? Paper\n\t\tcompanies?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tNope. The Micmac Indians.

THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tJUD (stopping)\n\t\tThis is the place, honey.\n\nELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch \nbut can't. She whips around to look at her mother.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tWhat's it say, mommy?\n\nA strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like \nthis. Not a bit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tIt says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's\n\t\tmisspelled, but...that's what it\n\t\tsays.\n\nShe runs for the arch.

ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY\n</b>\nShe surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs \ntoward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as \nshe goes. We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD\n</b>\nThey are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is \nextremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and \nclearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tHow can you call it a good thing?\n\t\tA graveyard for pets killed in the\n\t\troad!

Daddy! Look at me!\n\n<b>EXT.  ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL\n</b>\nShe has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely \ndangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her \nlife.

Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up.\n\nLOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHave you got a death-wish, Ellen?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tWell, I thought it was safe--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tBest never to go climbing on old blowdowns\n\t\tlike this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tBite?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tAyuh.\n\n<b>EXT.

ELLIE\n</b>\nShe runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a \nkid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at \n<b>SMUCKY'S.\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN  NIGHT\n</b>\nThere are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on \nthem. Guess dinner was burned.\n\nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen \ntable. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is \nputting together a complicated model boat, using glue and \ntweezers. He's wearing glasses.\n\nELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown.

LOUIS comes out with a heavy \nbriefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens \nthe wagon's doorgate.\n\nA small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS. \nA rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the \nfront of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She \nlooks at the cat-carrier.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMISSY\n</b>\t\tGonna get his--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\t--nuts cut, yes.

She reaches for them, then winces and \npresses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an \nattack of indigestion.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (sees this)\n\t\tHow's that belly-ache of yours?\n\n\t\t\t\tMISSY (gets the sheets)\n\t\tNo better and no worse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou ought to see a doctor about it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMISSY\n</b>\t\tIt'll pass.

LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the \nwagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (anxious)\n\t\tStill friends, doc?\n\nLOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then \nhe smiles and hugs her.

VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS  MORNING\n</b>\nPASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one \ngirl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to \ndrop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the \nbearers.\n\nPASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead \nof the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has \nbeen shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male \nof about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red \njogging shorts.\n\nTHE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to \nmount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on \nbreak to either side. The infirmary doors open.\n\n<b>EXT..

THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA\n</b>\nTHE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will \nseem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after \nSirhan shot Bobby.\n\nAs the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by \nSTEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student \nnurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified.\n\nLOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between \nonlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and \npulsing brain tissue beneath.\n\nThere's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the \nblanket is having hysterics.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGIRL\n</b>\t\tVic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (to CHARLTON)\n\t\tGet her out. Get them all out.\n\nCHARLTON puts her arms around the girl.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL (struggling)\n\t\tNo! No! He can't die! He can't die!\n\nTHE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from \nSTEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes.\n\nCHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out \nthe door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tSteve, get the ambulance over here\n\t\tright now.

Blood suddenly spurts out of \nhis mouth. He begins to seizure.\n\nOne of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the \nstudent nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall.\n\nCHARLTON rushes over.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCANDYSTRIPER\n</b>\t\tI can't look at it...I can't stand it...\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLTON (slaps her)\n\t\tYes you by God can. Go get the hard\n\t\tstretcher!\n\nAs they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as \nCHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket, \n<b>THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHelp me hold him.\n\nThey hold PASCOW'S spasming body.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTEVE\n</b>\t\tIt wouldn't matter if we did have\n\t\tthe ambulance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIt wouldn't matter if we had the SST.\n\nPASCOW begins to quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHe's going.

PASCOW is dead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tSteve, will you get a sheet to cover\n\t\thim with?\n\nSTEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body \nof VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.\n\n<b>EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nIt's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful. Here \ncomes LOUIS'S station wagon. As it reaches THE CAMERA, it swivels \nto TRACK.\n\n\t\t\t\tRADIO (voice-over)\n\t\tTragedy struck on the first day of the\n\t\tUniversity of Maine's fall semester \n\t\twhen Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old\n\t\tsophomore--\n\n<b>INT.

But\n\t\twe can do it...and we're going to.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tBut--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tDoes she love the cat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYes, but--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThen come on.\n\nHe puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further \nargument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear \nMarshall Crenshaw singing \"Crystal Girl.\" JUD starts away. After a \nmoment, LOUIS follows.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH  LATE EVENING\n</b>\nThe SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree...\n\nThe SOUND of footfalls.\n\nFaintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing \"Working \nFor A Living.\"\n\nIt's now almost twilight.\n\nJUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around \ncuriously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWell, folks, here we are, in Louis\n\t\tCreed Dreamland.\n\nJUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck \nagain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tWhat say, Louis?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tNothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on\n\t\tthe outer circle or start a new one?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tWe're still not where we're going.\n\nHe walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThe place we're going is on the\n\t\tother side of that.\n\nHe points at the deadfall.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWe can't climb over that. We'll break\n\t\tour necks!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tNo. We won't. I have climbed it a time\n\t\tor two before, and I know all the places\n\t\tto step. Just follow me...move easy...don't\n\t\tlook down...and don't stop. If you stop,\n\t\tyou'll crash through for sure.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI'm not climbing that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tGive me the cat. I'll take care of it\n\t\tmyself.\n\nHe holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as \nhe says. After a moment he says:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tLet's go.\n\nJUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its \nsnarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of \nstairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (low)\n\t\tThank God my Blue Cross is paid up.\n\n<b>EXT.  THEIR FEET\n</b>\nFirst JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the \nswinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches \nand just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe's grinning, exhilarated.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tGod, this is amazing!\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD\n</b>\nThere are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both \nstern and a little scared.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tJust don't stop and--\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe looks down.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET\n</b>\nA dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot \nplunges down maybe six inches.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tAnd don't look down. Right.\n\nHe continues.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE DEADFALL, REVERSE  TWILIGHT\n</b>\nJUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches \nthe top.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (amazed)\n\t\tHoly...!\n\n<b>EXT.  BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nIn the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe-\ninspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines \nand juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias. \nThe sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an \nold forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle-\ncarpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path \ngoes on.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with \nfrank amazement.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tJUD (turns to look)\n\t\tCome on, Louis--don't stop!\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (grinning)\n\t\tI'm all right! I'm f--\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET\n</b>\nOne of the branches snaps. LOUIS'S foot plunges. His cuff rips.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, JUD'S POV\n</b>\nWe're looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-\nbalance. He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSER\n</b>\nHe does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his \nback, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand. His flashlight \nalso goes. Branches crack. White dust puffs out from under him.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD, AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL\n</b>\nLOUIS thumps to the ground nearby. JUD kneels beside him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tLouis! You all right?\n\nLOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is \ntorn. His ankle is bleeding.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (dazed)\n\t\tSure. I guess I just lost my happy \n\t\tthoughts for a second there.\n\nLOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather \nshredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (continues)\n\t\tI shouldn't have stopped...and it\n\t\tdoes bite.\n\nHe whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the \nlight comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tNo, you shouldn't have stopped. But\n\t\tyou got away with it. Important thing\n\t\tis are you sure you're all right?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tYou'll see before long. Let's go.\n\nHe starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying \nthe bag.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, FROM THE DEADFALL\n</b>\nAgain, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go \ntolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient \nfirs.\n\nSOUND OF CRICKETS, LOW at first, then UP TO LOUD: Ree-ree-ree...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  TWILIGHT\n</b>\nLots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too. The SOUND \nOF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack: BUZZ OF CICADAS, \nTHUMP OF FROGS. Swamp-sounds.\n\nLOUIS looks frankly doubtful.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThis next bit's like the deadfall, Louis--\n\t\tyou got to walk steady and easy. Just follow\n\t\tme and don't look down.\n\n<b>EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S AND JUD'S POV  DEEP TWILIGHT\n</b>\nMysterious...awesome...scary. Dead trees poke out of the murk like \ntwisted hands. There's scummy water standing around tussocks \ncovered with long grass, most of it dead. There's a lot of choking \nunderbrush.\n\nAll of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tMicmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIs there quicksand?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tAyuh.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (nervous; joking)\n\t\tAre there ghosts?\n\nJUD looks at him expressionlessly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tAyuh.\n\nJUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment, \nLOUIS follows.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD, CU\n</b>\nHis face is set, strange.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThere's a lot of funny things down\n\t\tthis way, Louis.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND JUD\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou're telling me.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tJUD (still walking)\n\t\tThe air's heavier...more electrical...\n\t\tsomething. You might see St. Elmo's\n\t\tFire...what the sailors call 'foo-lights.'\n\t\tIt makes funny shapes, but it's nothing.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees:\n\n<b>EXT.  ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nA faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of \nthe dead trees. It looks a bit like a corpse. In fact, I think it \nlooks quite a bit like PASCOW'S corpse.\n\nAs we watch it fades...fades...is gone.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being \nscared. Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the \nsurface of the standing water toward him...and then just fades \ninto the thick mist.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIt's funny, all right.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tJust don't stop, Louis. You don't\n\t\tever want to stop down here in\n\t\tLittle God. (Pause) And you don't\n\t\tever want to look behind you,\n\t\twhatever you hear.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, LONG ANGLE  NIGHT\n</b>\nWe see them moving through the mist like wraiths, JUD with his \ndigging tools, LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin. The \nwhole swamp is glowing dimly.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  NIGHT\n</b>\nIn the extreme f.g. we can see firm ground sloping up. Ahead is a \nthick white mist. And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it \nand out of it. Both of them are wet from the knees down. They head \ninto the woods on the far side.\n\n<b>EXT.  A LOW, STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL\n</b>\nIn the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky \nhill rising out of the woods would serve just as well. We can see \nsteps cut into the side, and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling \nup them.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT\n</b>\nJUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse \nshape.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tAlmost there, Louis.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou keep saying that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThis time I mean it.\n\nHe tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, \nthe wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments \nlater LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV\n</b>\nThe top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a \nnumber of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see, \nthere are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst \napart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the \nPet Sematary: concentric circles.\n\nSOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (awed)\n\t\tWhat is this place?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThis was their burying ground, Louis.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhose burying ground?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThe Micmac Indians. I brought you here\n\t\tto bury Ellen's cat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhy? For God's sake, why?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tI had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later.\n\t\tAll right?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI guess so...but...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tYou want to rest a bit before you start?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tNo, I'm okay. Will I really be able to\n\t\tdig him a grave? The soil looks thin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tSoil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.\n\nHe hands him the pick and shovel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tI'm going to sit over yonder and have a\n\t\tsmoke. I'd help you, but you've got to\n\t\tdo it yourself. Each buries his own.\n\t\tThat's how it was done then.\n\nJUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand \nand the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out \ninto the burying ground.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE  NIGHT\n</b>\nSOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here.\n\nThe hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude \nfrom the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom, \nand flashes fire.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside \nhim we see a low pile of rocks and earth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (voice)\n\t\tShould be deep enough.\n\nHe joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYou think so?\n\nHe notices the rocks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat are those for?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tYour cairn.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nThose tumbled piles of rock are very obvious.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tDoesn't look like they last long.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tDon't worry about that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tJud, why am I doing all this?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tBecause it's right.\n\nHe walks off again.\n\nLOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG\n</b>\nHe opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tPax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You\n\t\twere a hell of a god cat. I doubt if\n\t\tyou were worth all this aggravation,\n\t\tbut you were a hell of a good cat.\n\nHe tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then \nbegins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CAIRN, CU  NIGHT\n</b>\nLOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three \nstones.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN\n</b>\nHe looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tThat's fine. You did real good.\n\nLOUIS looks at him.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT\n</b>\nThere's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence \nat first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS'S FIELD  NIGHT\n</b>\nLOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their \nlights. They are both clearly fagged out.\n\nSOUND, FAINT: The telephone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tOh, shit! Rachel!\n\nHe drops the tools and sprints.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING\n</b>\nLOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe runs to the door and inside.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD\n</b>\nHe stands there, eyes inscrutable.\n\n<b>INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE\n</b>\nIt stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up, \nalthough he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND \nof the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle, \ndisgusted.\n\nHe starts to dial a number from memory.\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (voice)\n\t\tLouis.\n\n<b>INT.  THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tWhen you talk to 'em, not one word\n\t\tabout what we done tonight. 'S'far's\n\t\tyou know, the cat's still fine.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS, BY THE PHONE\n</b>\nAfter a moment he lowers it into the cradle.\n\n<b>INT.  JUD\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tYou'll understand. In the meantime,\n\t\tkeep your peace. What we did, Louis,\n\t\twas a secret thing. Women are supposed\n\t\tto be the ones who are good at\n\t\tkeeping secrets, but any woman who\n\t\tknows anything at all would tell you\n\t\tshe's never seen into a man's heart.\n\t\tThe soil of a man's heart is stonier,\n\t\tLouis--like the soil up there in the\n\t\told Micmac burying ground. A man\n\t\tgrows what he can...and tends it.\n\nDuring this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his \nhand on LOUIS'S shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tBut--\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tNo buts! Accept what's done, Louis.\n\t\tWhat we done was right. Another time\n\t\tit might not be, but tonight it was...\n\t\tat least I hope to Christ it was. Now\n\t\tyou make your call...but not a word\n\t\tabout tonight.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH JUD\n</b>\nSOUNDS: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone. Ringing. Then:\n\n\t\t\t\tDORY GOLDMAN (voice)\n\t\tGoldman residence.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHi, Dory...it's Louis--\n\nDuring this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck. \nAs JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear \non his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for \ntonight's piece of work.\n\nA moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA \nand JUD.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT\n</b>\nHe's on the phone, smiling and happy.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (voice)\n\t\tYou want to talk to the birthday girl?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tThat'd be real fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (voice)\n\t\tHi...daddy?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (sings)\n\t\tHappy birthday to you/Happy birthday\n\t\tto you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy\n\t\tbirthday to you!\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (voice)\n\t\tThat was awful, daddy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYeah, I know...how are things out \n\t\tthere in Chicagoland?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tFine...except when Mom was airing\n\t\tGage's diaper rash, he walked away and\n\t\tgot into Grampa's study and pooped in\n\t\tGrampa's favorite chair.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (grinning broadly)\n\t\tWay to go, Gage!\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (voice)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI said that's too bad.

THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE\n</b>\nShe's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is \ncrooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\t...and a Garfield radio! How's Church,\n\t\tdad? Does he miss me?\n\n<b>INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nThe smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of \ncombined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which \nare still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWell...I guess he's just fine, Ellie.\n\t\tI haven't seen him this evening, but--\n\n<b>INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE\n</b>\nRACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\tWell, make sure you put him down\n\t\tcellar before you go to bed so he\n\t\tcan't run out in the road and get\n\t\tgreased.

ELLIE and \nRACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL \nencourages him to say a few words.\n\n<b>INT.  THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nFrom the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling. \nLOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING\n</b>\nLOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the \ntire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake \nagainst the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nIt's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates \nto the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat \nHISS. He turns.\n\n<b>INT.  CHURCH, ECU\n</b>\nHe's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't \nnotice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming \nright down our throats. He's hissing angrily.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack \non the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING \n<b>NOISE.\n</b>\n<b>INT.  ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH\n</b>\nHe jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as \nhe goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but \nwe can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright. \nHe goes to the garage door and looks out.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (calls)\n\t\tChurch?\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nGrass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU\n</b>\n<b>INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there \nshould be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living \nroom, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly \noutside. LOUIS uses this latter door now.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe puts the dish of food down and sits beside it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tFood, Church...food!\n\nSOUND: Miaow.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nCHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward \nTHE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tCome on, Church! Chow down!\n\n<b>EXT.  CHURCH\n</b>\nHe crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (to himself)\n\t\tChrist. I don't believe this.\n\nHe picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (wincing)\n\t\tGod, you stink, Church.\n\nCHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIn a second.\n\nHe tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S \nneck.\n\n<b>EXT.  CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV)\n</b>\nThere's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant\tof the crash. A \nline of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all \ngrows.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP\n</b>\nLOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes \nsomething out of CHURCH'S whiskers.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS'S HAND, ECU\n</b>\nIt's a shred of green plastic.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tChewed his way out.

LOUIS \nslowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek, \nwelling blood. He looks at the cat.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD\n</b>\nThe garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling \nslowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several \npumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a \nRamones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear \nthe Romantics doing \"What I Like About You.\" JUD is singing along \nand bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you \ncan dig it.\n\nHe sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it.\n\nHe takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets \nthe pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is \nright there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking \ntotally stunned.\n\nJUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the \nphones off JUD'S ears.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat did we do?\n\n<b>INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN\n</b>\nLOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table.

He's \ncrying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to \nkeep doing it for a long time. I mean he looks really sad.\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (voice)\n\t\tI loved my dog a lot, Louis. When Spot\n\t\tdied, I thought I was gonna die.\n\nJUD is sitting on the front stoop. It's the same house JUD lives \nin now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt \nrather than tar.\n\nAlong this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY B.'S wagon. The \nwagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap. \nStrung across the top are bells, and we can hear their CHIMING \nSOUND...but faint, like bells heard in a dream.\n\nSTANNY B. is old and drunk. Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he \ndraws up to the CRANDALL house and stops. He gets down, almost \nfalls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and \napproaches JUD.

His suit is wet from spilled water. \nHe's weeping.\n\nLOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think \nhe intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny \nlittle body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic \npose.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tIRWIN\n</b>\t\tCome on! I'm ready for ya!

THE FUNERAL CHAPEL\n</b>\nThe fight has gone out of IRWIN and STEVE has backed away--but \ncautiously. He's ready to jump back in if one or the other goes \nmad again. But IRWIN is shuffling toward LOUIS, hands out--\neveryone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel. \nAmong them is RACHEL and her mother, weeping in each others' arms.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tIRWIN\n</b>\t\tI don't know what happened to me.\n\t\tLouis, please--\n\nLOUIS brushes by him with no acknowledgement that IRWIN even \nexists.

I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed \nbundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE.\n\nb.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a \nbaby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm.\n\nc.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of \npresent-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand.

He looks both ways, then \ntosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside.\n\nLOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the \nscene.\n\n<b>EXT.

THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED\n</b>\nLOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing \nequipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then \nopens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave \nfor a long second.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (low)\n\t\tGonna bust you out, son.\n\nHe starts to shovel.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SHOVEL, CU\n</b>\nDigging...throwing...digging again.

CAMERA MOVES IN ON RACHEL, who has closed \nher eyes. I think she's praying.\n\n<b>EXT.  GAGE'S GRAVE  NIGHT\n</b>\nNow it's pretty deep. Four feet, maybe. LOUIS is standing in it. \nWe see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS  NIGHT\n</b>\nHe's sweating and dirt-streaked. He's tossing dirt on a big pile. \nSuddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND. \nHe tosses the shovel aside and squats.\n\n<b>EXT.

LOUIS\n</b>\nHe climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag. He starts to \npull out the pick.\n\nSOUND of an approaching car.\n\nLOUIS freezes.\n\n<b>EXT.

THE TOP OF THE COFFIN, CU\n</b>\nLOUIS inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and \nlevers it. CRACKING SOUND. Again. More CRACKING. Again. And the \nlock breaks.

If GAGE had a POV, this would be \nit. LOUIS'S face fills with a terrible grief.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tOh, Gage--oh, honey.\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH\n</b>\nHis chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his \n'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels. There's a \nlong round ash on his cigarette in the tray. A couple of empty \nbeer cans on the table beside him.\n\nA truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze. He jerks his \nhead up suddenly...and slaps himself. He's okay...for now.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in \nhis arms, rocking him. GAGE is back to us. We see only a small \nlimp figure in a dark suit.

THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the \ntools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the \nSOUND of another motor.

LOUIS\n</b>\nCrouching against his side of the wall and sweating.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE POLICE CAR\n</b>\nIt stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nCrouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks \ndown...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back. \nLOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat.\n\nSilence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE COP\n</b>\nAh! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the \ncemetery for a moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOP\n</b>\t\tI ain't afraid of no ghost.\n\nHe walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL\n</b>\nHe collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously \nover the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down \non the other side of the road.\n\nHe tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the \ncanvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults \nover.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by \nthe string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy \nterritory. He goes to the rear of the wagon.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No \nkeys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The \nother pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt \nfeverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope.\n\nSOUND: An approaching car.\n\n<b>EXT.  PASSING CAR\n</b>\nA civilian--not the ubiquitous cop.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere.

LOUIS\n</b>\nHe snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses \nthe key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then \nthe duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of \nthe car. He opens the driver's door and freezes.\n\nLOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes \nback to the front, gets in, and drives away.\n\n<b>INT.  A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL\n</b>\nPeople are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes \nRACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself \nincoherently.

THE CREED HOUSE\n</b>\nThe station wagon turns in and parks. LOUIS gets out. He opens the \nback, removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with \ntools. He manages to get everything together and walks to the edge \nof the path. He looks at:\n\n<b>EXT.  THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nOff it goes, glimmering in the dark.\n\n<b>EXT.

LOUIS, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP\n</b>\nThat phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced. SOUNDS of \nCRICKETS and FROGS. The water is mucky and still. Hummocks stick \nup like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen. Fog drifts \nthrough the dead trees. LOUIS doesn't want to go in there. Smart \nman. I wouldn't either.\n\nBut he does.\n\n<b>INT.

LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP\n</b>\nHe comes walking toward THE CAMERA with GAGE in his arms and the \nduffle bag over his shoulder. Mist swirls around him. The \nlandscape is weird, surreal. CRICKET SOUNDS, AMPLIFIED. In fact \nthere are a lot of swampy, marshy SOUNDS--too many. It sounds \nalmost prehistoric.\n\n<b>SOUND: HARSH, SCREAMING LAUGHTER\n</b>\nLOUIS stops. He looks slowly around at:\n\n<b>EXT.  MIST-FACE, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nA demonic face takes shape in the mist and FLOATS SLOWLY TOWARD \nTHE CAMERA. It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long.\n\nIts eyes blow out. Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the \nsockets.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe closes his eyes. After a moment he opens them.\n\n<b>EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nNothing there.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tSee? Just imagination. Just--\n\n<b>EXT.

LOUIS continues on regardless.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS\n</b>\nLOUIS comes into the frame. He's obviously tiring now, but he \nkeeps moving along.\n\nSOUND: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding ones. Something \nis coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus \nRex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder. LOUIS \nlooks plenty scared.\n\nSOUND: A falling tree.\n\n<b>EXT.  WOODS, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nThose SOUNDS keep getting closer and closer. Another tree falls--\nwe see this one. And now we see a SHAPE--just a SHAPE.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nIt is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We \ndon't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's \nflesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it \nturns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow \neyes the size of lighthouse lamps.\n\nIt makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nThe SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIt was the Wendigo.

LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE\n</b>\nIn the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no \nsmall tree, either, but a great big old fir.\n\nLOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at:\n\n<b>EXT.  THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nHere is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS \ncould swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen \nbefore. Three big claws at the end of it.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nLooks up again. His face is set and hard.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIt doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.\n\nHe starts to walk again.\n\n<b>EXT.

Panting.\n\nLOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the \ntop. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles \nover a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and \ngets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks \nat:\n\n<b>EXT.  A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nWe can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe slowly kneels down.

RACHEL\n</b>\nShe looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it \nthan just a scratch up the side.\n\nRACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been \nthrough a lot tonight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tNow what?\n\nPASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road, \nlooking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPASCOW\n</b>\t\tIt's trying to stop you. Do you\n\t\thear me? It's trying to stop you.\n\nRACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans \nthe scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tIs anyone there?\n\nAfter a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights \nappear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the \nshoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for \nthe first time in her life.\n\nThe car sweeps by her without slowing.\n\n<b>EXT.  GAGE'S CAIRN, CU\n</b>\nLOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE \nCAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is \nthe canvas tarp, now open and empty.\n\nAbsently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his \ntools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One \nhand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tCome back to me, Gage. Come back\n\t\tto us.\n\nHe turns away toward the stairs.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9\n</b>\nShe's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand. \nLights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts \nby.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (shouts)\n<b>\t\tMAY THE SEWERS OF RANGOON BACK UP\n</b><b>\t\tIN YOUR BEDROOM, ASSHOLE!\n</b>\nShe starts walking again.\n\n<b>EXT.

THE GARAGE\n</b>\nLOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the \nkitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him.\n\n<b>INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL\n</b>\nSOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view, \ndirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down \nthe hall toward the master bedroom.\n\n<b>INT.  THE BEDROOM\n</b>\nThe clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first \non the immaculate bedspread and lies still.\n\nIn this shot we should note the closet door is standing open.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, FEATURING GAGE'S CAIRN\n</b>\nTHE CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY. Holds. Nothing for a beat. Then:\n\nA small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring \nthe living shit out of us.\n\nCAMERA MOVES CLOSER as the hand begins to feel around. It takes \none of the rocks and pushes it aside. Another. Another. Another.\n\nThe SOUNDS are not encouraging. It is GRUNTING and GROWLING. There \nis nothing human here.\n\nRocks begin to tumble as GAGE starts to come out of his grave.\n\n<b>INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nFast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL\n</b>\nMy babe is still takin' a hike. But here comes another vehicle.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE DEADFALL IN THE PET SEMATARY\n</b>\nTHE CAMERA MOVES IN on that snarling face.\n\nSOUNDS: GAGE coming. Dead dry breath. Low snarling noises.\n\nNow we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the \ndeadfall.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL\n</b>\nSuddenly, as the lights appear, she does a Claudette Colbert, \npulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg.\n\nLights--it's an Orinco truck, naturally--spotlight her. The truck \nstops.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL AND THE TRUCK\n</b>\nThe driver leans over and opens the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\t\tHop in, baby.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tThank you.\n\nShe does.\n\n<b>INT.

THE KITCHEN, A NEW (LOW) ANGLE\n</b>\nGAGE'S shoes grit slowly across the linoleum, leaving dirty \ntracks. CHURCH turns to watch GAGE'S passage, and then follows.\n\n<b>INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nCAMERA HOLDS ON LOUIS as those gritting footsteps approach. Then \nwe pan to the closet. On the floor is LOUIS'S little black bag. We \nhold on this as the footfalls near. A small white hand enters the \nframe and pulls the doctor-bag out of the closet. Now another hand \nenters the frame and opens the bag. The hands search around inside \nand bring out a scalpel.\n\nThey hold it up. The GAGE-THING makes a contented SOUND.\n\n<b>EXT.

Suddenly, from inside, comes the \nsound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming \"Bang Your Head.\" It's the \nstereo, and boy, is it cranked.\n\nJUD straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. His \nhands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is \nthat it's coming from there--and then he hurries inside.\n\nCAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.\n\n<b>INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD\n</b>\nHe hurries in, turns on the light, and rushes across to his stereo \nsystem, which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying \nsaucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room. He \nshuts it off and looks around, frowning.\n\nSOUND: Todd Rundgren, singing \"Bang on the Drum All Day\" at the \ntop of his voice.\n\nJUD'S head snaps toward the SOUND.\n\n<b>INT.  A SONY RADIO, CU\n</b>\nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK as JUD hurries across the kitchen to the \ncounter, where the radio is. He turns it off, looking around, more \nbewildered than ever.\n\n\t\t\t\tJUD (sharply)\n\t\tWho's here?\n\nHe walks toward the door which gives on the hall.\n\n<b>INT.  THE HALL, WITH JUD\n</b>\nIt's dimly lit by light-spill from the living room and kitchen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tCome on, stop playing games!\n\nSOUND: Molly Hatchet, \"Flirtin' with Disaster,\" being played top \nend, from upstairs.\n\nJUD hurries up. Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology \nat work here--for the moment he's more concerned about waking the \nneighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with \nthe prowler...and he would certainly know who--or what--that \nprowler was, if he had time to think.\n\n<b>INT.  JUD'S BEDROOM\n</b>\nHe enters and turns on the light. We see a portable phonograph \nwith the record, turning. JUD rushes over and turns it off.\n\nHe looks around, and we see by his face that he knows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tGage? (Pause) Are you the one\n\t\tplaying games?\n\nHe goes to the window and looks out at:\n\n<b>INT./EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, WITH THE STATION WAGON, JUD'S POV\n</b>\n<b>INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH JUD\n</b>\nHe turns slowly and walks toward the bed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tGage? Come on out.\n\nHe reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds \nthe blade.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJUD\n</b>\t\tI want to show you something.\n\nSOUND: Miaow!\n\n<b>INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH CHURCH, JUD'S POV\n</b>\n<b>INT.  JUD, BY THE BED\n</b>\n\t\t\t\tJUD (to the cat)\n\t\tHow did you--?!\n\n<b>INT.  JUD'S FEET\n</b>\nA small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt \nof the coverlet and slashes JUD'S calf,\n\n<b>INT.  JUD\n</b>\nHe screams with pain and staggers backward.\n\n<b>INT.  JUD'S FEET\n</b>\nThe other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and \npulls.\n\n<b>INT.  JUD\n</b>\nWith a startled yell, he falls.\n\n<b>INT.  JUD AND GAGE\n</b>\nThis one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We \nfinally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not \nreally GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the \nmouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE.\n\nThere is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel. \nPerhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife.\n\nGAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds.\n\nJUD expires.\n\nGAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROUTE 9, BETWEEN THE CRANDALL AND CREED HOUSES\n</b>\nHeadlights. RACHEL'S truck has arrived. It pulls up.\n\nRACHEL opens the passenger door, which is on JUD'S side.\n\n<b>EXT.  ANGLE ON THE CAB\n</b>\nWe can see PASCOW sitting in the passenger seat where RACHEL just \nwas.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tThank you so much.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTRUCKER\n</b>\t\tI didn't get a ticket, so you're\n\t\twelcome, lady.\n\t\t\t(And, more seriously)\n\t\tWhatever your problems are, I hope\n\t\tthey work out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPASCOW\n</b>\t\tIt's the end of the line for me,\n\t\ttoo--I'm not allowed any further.\n\n\t\t\t\tRACHEL (to the trucker)\n\t\tI'm sure things will be fine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPASCOW\n</b>\t\tI'm not.\n\nShe closes the door and steps down.\n\nThe truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it \npulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when:\n\n\t\t\t\tGAGE (soft voice)\n\t\tMummy!\n\nShe stops, startled. Her face wears a \"did I hear that?\" \nexpression. She looks back toward JUD'S house.\n\n\t\t\t\tGAGE (soft voice)\n\t\tMummy!\n\nRACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at:\n\n<b>EXT.  JUD'S HOUSE, RACHEL'S POV\n</b>\nThe one place in the whole world we do not want RACHEL to go.\n\n<b>EXT.  RACHEL\n</b>\nShe goes. Up the steps to the porch. All through this she's been \ntravelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her \ninitials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and \nopens the porch door.\n\nShe looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning, \nand someone else's house. But...that voice...\n\n\t\t\t\tGAGE (voice)\n\t\tMummy, I need you!\n\nRACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tWho--\n\nThe door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes \ninto the doorway and sits down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHURCH\n</b>\t\tMiaow!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tChurch!\n\n\t\t\t\tGAGE (voice)\n\t\tMummy, I need you!\n\nShe crosses to the open door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRACHEL\n</b>\t\tGage? Gage?\n\nNo answer. RACHEL steps in.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING\n</b>\n<b>INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look. He rolls \nback and forth. Closer and closer to the edge. Finally, with a \nwild yell, he goes over onto the floor.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS, ON THE FLOOR\n</b>\nHe comes awake. Sits up. Ouch! He's aches from top to bottom and \nside to side...but his back is worst. His hands go to it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tJesus!\n\nHe starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on:\n\n<b>INT.  GAGE'S TRACKS ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nThey enter the house, go to the closet, then leave again.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tGage--?\n\nHe scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten. He \nstares in wildly.\n\n<b>INT.  THE DOCTOR-BAG\n</b>\nIt's open.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe pulls the doctor-bag out. His original hope is now tempered \nwith the first signs of fear. He begins to go through the doctor-\nbag. Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it. The case is \nempty, but the indented shape is clear. There was a scalpel in \nthis case...but not anymore.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tOh my God. (Pause) Gage!\n\n<b>INT.  THE HALL, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tGage!\n\nLOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but \nthere's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the \ndoor to GAGE'S room.\n\n<b>INT.  GAGE'S ROOM, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nEmpty.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS, ON THE STAIRS\n</b>\nHe goes downstairs, yelling GAGE'S name.\n\n<b>INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nNothing. The phone RINGS. LOUIS almost jumps out of his skin \nreaching for it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tHello!\n\n\t\t\t\tIRWIN (voice)\n\t\tHello, Louis--it's Irwin.\n\t\tI just wanted to be sure Rachel\n\t\tgot back all right.\n\nAs IRWIN says this, LOUIS'S eyes fix upon something.\n\n<b>INT.  THE FLOOR, WITH TWO SETS OF GAGE-TRACKS, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nOne set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and \nupstairs. The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the \nkitchen door giving directly on the outside.\n\n<b>INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nIn his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything...or \nalmost everything.\n\n\t\t\t\tIRWIN (voice)\n\t\tLouis...are you there?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOUIS (slowly)\n\t\tYes--I'm here.\n\n\t\t\t\tIRWIN (voice)\n\t\tDid she get there all right?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tYes, she's fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tIRWIN (voice)\n\t\tWell, put her on at that end and\n\t\tI'll put Ellie on at this one.\n\t\tEllie's very worried about her\n\t\tmother.

He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor.\n\n<b>INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE\n</b>\nTiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle. A tiny bloody finger \ndials.\n\n<b>INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN\n</b>\nThe phone starts to ring. After two or three ringy-dingys, LOUIS, \nlooking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tIrwin, you'll just have to--\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tGAGE (voice)\n\t\tI'm at Jud's, daddy.

The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling.\n\n<b>INT.  THE CREED BED, CU\n</b>\nHe puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it. He \ncomes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts \nthem aside. Then he roots around some more and comes up with \nseveral ampoules. He holds one up for inspection and we can read \nthe word MORPHINE on it very clearly.\n\n<b>INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the \nwindow. His hair has gone partially white.\n\nHe fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for \neach syringe--i.e., enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in \nthe left breast pocket of his shirt. He puts the spare ampoules in \nthe right breast pocket of his shirt.\n\nLOUIS is slowly going insane. What remains of his rationality is \nlike a rapidly fraying rope.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tWhat you buy is what you own, and\n\t\tsooner or later what you own comes\n\t\thome to you. Wasn't that what you\n\t\tsaid, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it?\n\nHe leaves the room.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE\n</b>\nLOUIS comes out the door. In one hand he's got a raw pork chop. In \nthe other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves. He walks \nto the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass. Then \nhe crosses.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CRANDALL WALK, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe walks most of the way to the house, then stops.\n\n<b>EXT.

LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again, \nand LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he \ntalks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs \nhim.\n\nCHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries \nto get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tNo, you don't!\n\n<b>EXT.  CHURCH, CU\n</b>\nThe syringe plunges into his haunch.\n\n<b>EXT.

It tries to \nget up...and then falls over again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tGo on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.\n\nHe walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nAny doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is \nerased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nTwang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted. \nHe looks back at:\n\n<b>INT.  CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nDead.\n\n<b>EXT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe climbs the steps and goes onto the porch.\n\n<b>EXT. LOUIS, ON THE PORCH\n</b>\nHe strips off the rubber gloves.

LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing.\n\nHe checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks \ndown it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a \nguest room. Shadowy and empty.\n\nDown the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a \nbunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back.\n\nDown the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in.\n\n<b>INT.  JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS\n</b>\nHe checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees:\n\n<b>INT.  THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV\n</b>\nA bloodstain.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain. \nHe sees the skirt on the bedspread. He lifts it. He is nose to \nnose with JUD, who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of \nincredible horror on his face.\n\nThe DOOR SLAMS.\n\nLOUIS bolts to his feet as GIGGLES fade down the hall.\n\nSlowly, he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread, \nwhich has mercifully fallen back into place.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLOUIS\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry, Jud.

And another GIGGLE.\n\nLOUIS starts slowly forward. He gets about halfway down the hall--\nand our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a \nSQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead.\n\n<b>INT.  CEILING TRAPDOOR\n</b>\nThis happens fast. The trap--which presumably gives on the attic \nwith a set of folding stairs--rises, and RACHEL'S body plunges \ndown through and then hangs, swinging: she has been bound around \nthe armpits and as become a grotesque parody of MISSY DANDRIDGE.\n\nHalf her face is gone. Eaten.\n\n<b>INT.  LOUIS\n</b>\nHe SCREAMS and backs against the wall. Twang! The last silver \nthread parts.\n\n<b>INT.

He grapples with the little \ncritter, and tries to get the syringe into him. No good. It's \nbatted out of his hand just before he can do it. It breaks.\n\nLOUIS and GAGE fall to the floor. LOUIS gets the other syringe out \nof his pocket, but it's also knocked out of his hand. Only \nconsolation is this one isn't broken. It rolls off along the \nfloor. LOUIS finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes \non, and plunges it into GAGE'S neck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGAGE\n</b>\t\tNo fair!
