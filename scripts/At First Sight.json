FIREHOUSE - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They run in laughing - Amy closing the door behind them as Virgil \nmoves his way into the center of the room - stands where the \nmoonlight from a high window hits the floor.

On the right, on the \ndrainpipe, it's drumming with a deeper, \nsteadier sound - - like a timpani - echoing \nacross the room - tells me the room is large \n- open. You feel it - in your chest? On the left, \nthe rain says... (he listens)\n...a fire escape, with it's own rhythm \n- ping - ping.

But only one thing at a time. But when it's raining,\nI feel everything at once.

Amy moves her head slightly with \nhis touch.

Actually, blinder 'cause they \nemit sonar all the time. I don't have a sixth sense,\nI just don't have the fifth one. I can't hear things in \nVermont, can't smell if you're mad at me, and, no \n- I don't know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy murmurs in response to Virgil's touch. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You say something?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, I just - this feels nice - too nice.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil moves his hands down her back - sensually kneading each \nmuscle. It's clear he's enjoying this as much as she is. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're very good.. at what you do.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Another breath exhales from her involuntarily as Virgil hits a \nsensitive spot. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank-you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You enjoy it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">At times. Some clients make it \nmore enjoyable than others.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil now works down her thighs - Amy's back arching slightly with \nthe movement - both of them heating to the moment. Both their \nbreaths quickening. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And this client...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is very, very...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">DING - and the spell is broken. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry - it's time.

I can tell he's sensing everything about \nme with a simple touch. He listens to my every \nword as if it's the only sound on the planet - \nI feel like even though he can't see me, he knows \neverything about me.

Virgil skates \nfast across the ice enjoying the speed - the wind using his hockey \nstick as a guide - he nears the edge of pond - feels it with the \nstick and slams to a stop. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He shuffles his body around to face in the other direction - then \nstarts skating again - passing AMY standing on the snow covered \nbank. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ON AMY - smiling, watching Virgil - enjoying his release of energy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HER POV - VIRGIL - skating well, a look of relaxation we've never \nseen on his face. He skates in an arc coming back past Amy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Finally she speaks. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wayne Gretzky, look out.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil slams to a halt in surprise - nearly toppling over. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry -- sorry. \nDidn't mean to scare you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy?!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I said I'd come back.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">How long ... how long have you been...?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Watching you?

Come on step hold of my stick.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Excuse me?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(smile) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hockey stick. Here.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He holds the stick out like a cross bar. Amy moves cautiously \nforward and takes hold of it. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK. Now hold on for balance. \nI used to do this with Jennie when we were kids.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And Virgil starts skating backwards pulling Amy with him. Amy is \napprehensive at first then starts to enjoy the movement - the \nsensation - both of them laughing out loud. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">WIDE as we see them move about the rink - Amy sliding and being \npulled by Virgil. As he picks up speed we hear Amy scream in \ndelight. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look out - we're running out of ice.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns expertly, arcing around the edge of the ice but Amy \nloses her nerve - and balance - and lets go of the stick and goes \nflying into an embankment. The momentum carries Virgil off down the \nice - both of them laughing hysterically. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You OK?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Fine. Never been dumped so fast in my life.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Me, dump you? No way. Stay where you are \n- I'll come to you - just keep talking.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What do I say?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil starts gliding across the ice searching for Amy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(hearing her voice, veering in her direction) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Anything - how'd you become an architect?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">God - let's see - I was in college - \nart school - a little aimless - and I met\nthis guy -. an architect - opened up a new \nworld to me. I liked the structure the \ncontrol - finding problems, coming up with \nsolutions - when I graduated - we started \na company together - on impulse got married\n- which was crazy - divorced a year ago - \nbut we're still partners.. which must seem\neven crazier.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And Virgil's suddenly there - going a little too far - tumbling off \nthe pond and into her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You'd think I meant to do that. \nA patented move.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They're close - in the snow together - face to face. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(Amy smiles, realizes) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is tough.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I bat my eyelashes, toss my head just \nright, and there's this very sexy thing \nI do with my eyes - then realize none of \nit matters to you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It doesn't matter. \nTell me what you look like.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I.. .1 don't know I'm...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wait. Let me.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He puts his hand out, over her face -- hesitates, then slowly feels \ndown the contours of her cheek, her eyelids, the shape of her lips - \nAmy moving with the touch, the sensuality of it - and as he \ncontinues - Amy's hand reaches up - touching his face - Virgil \nsmiles. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Eyes, mouth, chin, cheek.. \nyou are very beautiful.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank-you. So are you - more than \nI could describe.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil's hands move down her face - closing her eyes - letting her \njust experience his touch - his exploring. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And as both their hands continue, enjoying the sensation of \ndiscovering each other - Amy leans forward, her eyes still closed, \nfinding his mouth - grazing his lips with her own - softly, gently, \nthen they fold into each other's arms locked into a warm, deep kiss. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. VIRGIL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's dark - a pale moonglow highlights the two intertwined naked \nbodies. A fire burns in the background. In flowing CUTS we see them \nmake love: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil - his head tilted down - Amy - puts her hand to his chin - \nlifts his head - then kisses each of his closed eyelids in rhythm \nwith Virgil's movements. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy - now astride Virgil - she closes her eyes - feels it the way \nVirgil would - moving faster now - in total rhythm - shuddering in \nmutual release -- and she collapses on top of him - a deep breath \nand she rolls over - cuddles into his arm. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A long beat - out of breath: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So -- that's what a blind date is.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They breathe - then both start laughing - quietly - then \nhysterically together as Virgil wraps her up in his arms - holding \nher tightly. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. PINECREST - DAWN \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The horizon. The sun cresting it - bringing a new light to the day. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - EARLY MORNING Sounds of a shower in the \nbackground. Amy in Virgil's robe, pulls a juice container out of the \nfridge - pours herself a glass, putting the juice on the counter as \nshe walks into the living room - taking in the sparseness of his \nsurroundings. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSE ON - an open Braille Book. The completely white pages with \nminute bumps. Amy pulls up a chair, sits - and flips through the \nbook, running her hand across the pages - trying to understand his \nworld. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She then turns to the front cover to see what it is. Playboy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We hear the shower stop as Amy smiles, puts the book down - pushes \nthe chair aside then moves to a series of pictures on the wall: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil as a young boy - his sister Jennie a few years older - and \nhis mother and father. Then another picture next to it - Virgil in \nhis skates and Jennie older - no father - Sophie at their feet. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And a final picture - Virgil as an adult - he and Jennie on the \nfront porch - his arms wrapped around his sister like he's never \ngoing to let go. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VOICE (O.S.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy turns to see - Jennie, carrying a bag under her arm. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jennie moves towards the kitchen. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm Jennie, Virgil's sister. \nAnd you are..?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil steps out - bathrobe - drying his hair. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Jen, this is Amy Tremont.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jennie now at the kitchen - stares at the juice container - places \nit back in the fridge - just so. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I was just at the market Virgil, \npicking up a few things before \nschool - and I thought you might like some...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(smells) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Apples and bananas.\nAmy sees the fruit on the counter - impressed. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">He's being a show-off, Amy - I always bring him these. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(putting them in the fridge) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">The apples are on the bottom shelf...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">At two o'clock.

A glance to Amy and she picks it up - quietly moves it back \nto it's rightful spot. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've got parent meetings tonight - \nthere's dinner in the freezer - left corner.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(turns to Amy) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nice to have met you, Amy.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Me too - and again - I'm sorry.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And she's gone - leaving Amy and Virgil together - a moment of \nawkwardness. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">She seemed ... nice.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">She seemed jealous.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Your leg is still bleeding.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It'll stop - happens all the time. \nWelcome to my world.\nWe hold on Amy - taking this in: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Guests of the spa \nmingle about - drinks in hand - some dance on a floor set up over \nthe aerobics area. Music plays in the background. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy, carrying two trays of food, finds her way to where Virgil sits \nat a table off to the side - putting his food in front of him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let's see if I can get this right. \nChicken's at three - salad at seven - \nvegetables at ten.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(picking up his fork) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Very good - thank-you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is nice. \nThey do this every weekend?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Every Friday - for the guests leaving.

Virgil, fork poised over his food, senses her \nuncomfortableness. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You like dancing?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hmmm? Yeah - don't do it much. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(changing subject) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Chicken's good.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy resumes eating - Virgil's fork spears something on his plate - \nraising it to his mouth - both we and Amy now see it's a large pat \nof butter. Too late - it's in his mouth. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy watches him - the reaction on his face as he tastes it - then \nsurreptitiously swallows it. Then realizes Amy saw him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nothing like a good pat of fat. \nWhat do you say we dance?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, really, I'm fine...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil is up - pulling her hand. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come on\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She stands and Virgil puts his hands on the back of her shoulders. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Lead on.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And as she ushers him to the floor the music changes - a salsa - \nlively. Amy stops: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Different piece - maybe we should...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You kidding - take my hand.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And as she does - Virgil starts dancing to the music - feeling the \nbeat - in perfect rhythm but his moves are his own, something we've \nnever seen before - uninhibited, wild - a little funny, but also \nthere's something sensual in his abandonment. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">All Amy can do is hang on for the ride - enjoying Virgil enjoying \nhimself. People even clear back a little to give him some room - \nhowever he moves about the floor easily - somehow sensing where the \nother couples are. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's a whirlwind moment - a moment where the two of them get lost \nwith each other - for a second shutting out the world and it's just \nthem, the music and their movement. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Then suddenly the music is over. And they stop - the moment gone. \nVirgil turns to Amy and she applauds Virgil's wild moves \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He takes a bow with a flourish. Spins to another angle - another \nbow.

NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">DR. RICHARD AARON, wire rims, short, stylish haircut - is finishing \na high-tech examination of Virgil's eyes. Cups attached to wires sit \nover his eyes. The machine, an ELECTRORETINOGRAM, emits an \nirritating strange flat line sound. The room is very dimly lit. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine - a series of \nflashing lights hit Virgil's eyes. The doctor jots down a reading - \nthen with a flourish, spins the machine away from Virgil's face and \npops a button emitting a detailed computer print out. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">In the corner sits an older gentleman - Dr. Goldman - focused on \npapers in his hands. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK - we're done.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair back over to Virgil \nas Amy moves to join them. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Some good news.

If the disease \nto the retina is reduced as much as I think \nit is - there's a very good possibility \nwe can give you sight.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy looks to Virgil - apprehensive.

Unfortunately the \ncataracts are not allowing me to see the \nretinal wall. I can't tell how advanced \nthe retinitas pigmentosa has become.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So you're suggesting an operation \nthat may or may not be successful.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">But there is a chance he \ncould regain his sight.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON \n</p><p id=\"dia\">There have been a few cases of restored \nvision in adulthood to a patient blind since birth. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(moves near Virgil) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">The operation is delicate, I'll admit - \nbut nothing as invasive as what you went \nthrough as a child. Of course there is \nalways some risks with any operation - \ninfection, swelling - long shot stuff. \nI would do both eyes at the same time \n- it's basically out patient surgery.\nVirgil - an exhale of air. A lot to take in. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What if it doesn't work? What if I have \nthe operation - with all it's risks - \nand you remove the cataract - and it doesn't work.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Aaron looks to Amy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(somber) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It would be evident that you will \nnever be able to see.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil's head shifts slightly.

Then finally: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And Virgil reacts - a startling look of recognition mixed with fear \ncrossing his face. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What is it Virgil?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's - it's - I don't know.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And now for the first time we see Virgil's POV: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">There is light, movement, color, shadow - but somehow it is foreign \nto us.

Let's everybody just calm down \n- we'll take it slowly.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Everyone settles - takes a breath. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil.

We should\nall be happy - we've got something.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil: not happy, just very confused.

He just doesn't \nunderstand that he sees you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">But he'll overcome it - I mean - \nthis is temporary right?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON \n</p><p id=\"dia\">There's a very real possibility the \npart of his brain area allocated to \nvision is atrophied - given it's lack \nof use, Virgil has probably used it \nfor some other function.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jennie has stepped into the waiting area - has just heard Aaron. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You didn't think of this?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">This is as much an accusation of Amy as of Aaron. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON \n</p><p id=\"dia\">We had no way of knowing what his faculties \nwere until we gave him the operation. If you \nremember - we didn't know what to expect \n- though it's clear his retinal disease must \nbe in remission.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So what are we supposed to do now - \nyou saw him - it's like he's another \nperson in there.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He won't need to stay here - take him home \n- let him rest. But I will need to see him \nevery couple of days for the next month. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Isn't there some kind of therapy \nhe should be doing - someone to help him.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Aaron stares at her - hadn't thought of this. \n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK, there is a visual therapist - Ray Webster \n- a little unorthodox - that's why he's probably \nyour best bet, especially considering the unique \naspects of Virgil's condition. I'll contact \nhim for you - but there's no guarantee he can help.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(can't believe this) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No guarantees.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AARON\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Jennie, I told Amy here when we first talked - this is whole \nnew ground - for all of us.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And Jennie quietly turns and goes back into Virgil's room. Amy just \nstares at Dr. Aaron - a little overwhelmed. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CHANGE AREA - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil - starting to dress. He stares at his clothes on a hangar - \nnot comprehending what it is. He closes his eyes - his hand going \nout to feel it - then opening his eyes - he takes the shirt turns - \nand notices someone watching him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV - it's his own reflection in a mirror next to his clothes. \nVirgil stares at himself standing stock still - waiting for a \nresponse from the person staring at him. \n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is there...?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Slowly realizing that what he sees is himself. He starts moving \ntowards the mirror fascinated. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil's POV - Focusing on the image as it slowly takes shape - \nbecomes clearer to him. His hand going up to his nose - moving it \nback and forth - laughs at it's absurdity - then is taken with his \nown smile. He tries a smile - comes off awkward as he starts to \nstare at his teeth. Touching each part of his face he investigates \nhis chin, ears and finally his hair. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Then he stops - and just stares - and stares at a face that is his \nown - but so incredibly foreign to him. Who is this person? \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. VIRGIL'S ROOM - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jenny starting to pack up Virgil's things. Suddenly there is a burst \nof laughter from the other room. She looks up quizzically \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. HOSPITAL CHECK-OUT - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy in the check-in area - pacing - on a cellphone. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Duncan - I know the additions to the mall will \ncost more.. look, I can't do this on the phone \n- I'll be in tomorrow.. yes, I remembered they're \nputting the fixtures in the lobby - I'll get \nthere as well - I'm just asking for one more day.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

He opens \nhis eyes - staring blankly - trying to figure this out. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is me.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

I want to be here.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But I can't stay here - and you can't \ndo this alone--who's going to take care.. .?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She stops. Realizing. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE On Amy - outside the door - not wanting to go in. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy? She's going to look after you? \nShe doesn't know anything about the blind.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not blind anymore - and I'm not \ngoing to let someone I care about \nwalk out of my life again.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(moves to him) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's not your fault he left. \nYou can't keep blaming yourself.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm staying here.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A pause - and Jennie moves her hand out to him - touches his arm. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

HOSPITAL - LATE DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jennie and Amy stand on the curb near Jennie's car. A moment of \nuncomfortableness - then: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You alright? \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm scared to death. I've spent my whole life \nlooking for any holes he might fall in. \nI'd run up ahead and cover them. Everywhere\nI look here, I see holes.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Please believe me - I don't want him \nto get hurt anymore than you do.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy - when Virgil was very young, he couldn't \nsee those close to him - so he never learned \nto reach out. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(turns to her) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't expect him to reach out when he's in pain,\nor confused, or unhappy. If you really care \nabout him you have to just be there for him.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And before Amy can answer, she gets into her car - starts it up and \ndrives off. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT/INT AMY'S.LOFT - DUSK \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil slowly gets out of the cab, looks up at the buildings - \nimmediately gets dizzy and nearly falls over. Amy lunges to help \nhim. Virgil is laughing in spite of himself. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is just great - I don't believe this. \nWhat's that saying - stop the world I wanna get off.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ETHAN (O.S.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey Virgil, it's Ethan.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns to the familiar voice. Ethan, basketball under his arm, \ncoming out of the building with his Mom, KAREN COLVIN. Virgil scans, \ntries to focus on them. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">That you Ethan?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ETHAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's me - and this is my mom.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil - Karen.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi, Virgil - heard a lot about you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ETHAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You look funny.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You should see how I look from this side.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">AMY Let's just get you inside - \nthen you can rest. \nWe'll see you later Ethan. Karen.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And she gives Karen a small glance as she takes Virgil's arm as they \nstart towards the stairs leading into the building - Virgil suddenly \nslamming to a halt. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wait, wait, what are we doing \n<b>- WE'RE WALKING INTO A WALL!!\n</b>\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil's POV - the staircase. A flat image - a solid wall with \nhorizontal lines. Ethan, surprised, what's up here? \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's OK - it's not a wall - \nit's just a staircase. You're \ngoing to have to trust me on \nthese things.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">God, I feel like... like such a child - \nI just thought seeing would be different.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">We'll get a hold of this Ray Webster guy\n- we'll get his help.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil steps slowly forward - giant baby steps - each foot reaching \nout to feel the step before making the commitment. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV - the 'wall' of stairs changing perspective with each step. \nLike an accordion spreading itself out to us. This is all a very bad \nacid trip. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">VIRGIL'S POV - multi-colored balloons, dozens of assorted flowers, \nbowls of colorful fruit and streamers intertwined across the room. A \ncandyland of seeing. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Man. Something exploded \nin your apartment.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy laughs - pulls him into the room. Virgil trying to take it all \nin - not understanding anything. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I wanted to do something \nspecial for you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's making me a little \nbit dizzy - but it is special.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil's hands go out - Amy moves to him - he holds her shoulders. \nHe stares at her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As she turns her head slightly, Virgil is able to focus on her - her \neyes - her smile. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okay - so - this is what \nbeautiful looks like.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank-you. You want to\nsee the rest.\nFocusing on her, Virgil smiles, takes her face in his hands - leans \nin and kisses her. She pulls back a little. \n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I can't believe this \n- how nervous I am.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She kisses him then takes a step back. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What if you don't like what you see?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you want me to turn off the lights?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No - no. This is your first seeing day. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(she starts to unbutton her dress) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I want you to see everything.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And she drops the dress from her shoulders - it hits the ground - a \nbeat - and she stands there naked. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, very OK.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And she takes a step towards him and folds into his arms and as they \nkiss we slowly fade to black. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. AMY'S LOFT - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The sound of heavy New York rain. Amy awakening, and sees Virgil is \ngone, his side of the bed empty. She looks across the room - where \nshe sees silhouetted against the moonlit window - - Virgil standing \nnext to Amy's sculpture, his face and body pressed up against the \npane of glass. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(wrapping a house coat around her) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns around - half faces her - the rain on the windows \ndecorating his face. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I can't sleep - I'm afraid if I close my eyes...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It'll be black when you open them again.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil nods. A moment and his hand goes out to her sculpture. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You enjoy sculpting?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">At first. I liked the idea of molding - \ntaking the way I saw things up here- - \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(touching her head) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">- and making it take shape with my hands.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">But you never finish them.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Pieces never come out the way I wanted \n- the way I saw them. I end up working \non them forever - like this one - \nnever getting them right.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil stares out the window at the rain. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is what rain looks like?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It looks lonely. Not what I expected. \nBut I like it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy smiles - moves into him as he pulls her in close and they look \nout at the night rain. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

RAY WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A strange space, dark, as all the windows are covered. In a jar on \nthe desk - two pickled eyeballs stare back at Virgil and Amy waiting \npatiently. There are books everywhere - periodicals stacked and \noverflowing on shelves. A dead plant in the corner. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">RAY WEBSTER - 60's, almost completely bald, wearing a worn NYU \nsweatshirt, sits at the desk in front of them - flipping through a \nfile in front of him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Right - OK, Virgil - says here you went \nblind at one - before you developed a \nvisual vocabulary. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(Webster stands - moves towards a bookshelf) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You have no sense of depth of field, \nno knowledge of space, shape, size or \ndistance. Basically your eyes work but \nyour brain hasn't learned to process \nthe information. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You are mentallv blind.

I'll make a note of that.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Webster plops down a large book - flips through some pages, then \nsearching his pockets: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dammit\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Glasses, can never find 'em. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(calling out) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mrs. Fenster.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mrs. Fenster pops her head in the door - this must be a ritual they \nhave as she instantly pulls her GLASSES off and hands them to \nWebster who drops them over his nose. They are clearly woman's \nglasses - pointed in the ends - little jewels. As Mrs. Fenster \nleaves. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(referring to the book) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK.

Right - here. \nWhat's this?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He holds out the apple for Virgil - who reluctantly takes it - holds \nit in his hand, eyes closed, feels it - then opening his eyes he \nholds it out in front of him, trying to focus on it. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV - as the apple slowly takes on dimension and shape. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's an apple.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good. Good. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(holding up the photo) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK. What's this now?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil stares at the photo. HIS POV - a photo of -- an APPLE. Not \nthat different from the real apple he holds in his hand - he holds \nthe real apple up to compare - using his eyes. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's an apple.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(holding the paper out to Virgil) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good. Good. But is it an apple or \njust a picture of an apple?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And Virgil feels the paper and suddenly realizes - it's not an apple \n- just a representation of one. Virgil is visibly disappointed. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So this is a joke? Is that what you're\nsaying - your eyes lie to you? Great \n- looking forward to this.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Your eyesight can and will play tricks on \nyou Virgil. Remember that. No matter what\nI could teach you - no matter what exercises \nI could give you - they'll still play tricks on you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's all it is right now - one big trick. \nNothing makes any sense.

Red - white?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy reaches out - takes one. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Which is the red?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy looks at the waiter - then points to one. Virgil's hand reaches \nout slowly - hovering - it's clear it's confusing - trying to \nseparate out one glass. The Waiter looks to Amy like \"is he OK?\" \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil - here let me.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Her hand darts in front of his. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(quick) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No! Sorry - I mean - I'm almost \nthere - I think I got it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And she backs off as his hand wraps around a glass - pulling it \nback. At the last second knocking over two other glasses. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dammit. Sorry.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Waiter - trying not to spill on himself. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WAITER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Trust me - you're not the first - \nor probably the last. Let me get a cloth.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Waiter smiles - and as he walks off. Virgil nervously takes a \nlarge drink of wine. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WAITER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I hope you're driving.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly from the front of the room - MARSHALL, the host calls out: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARSHALL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK. He's coming up the stairs. \nEverybody get ready - kill the lights.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Excitement - a buzz - Virgil looks around then CLICK - all the \nlights go out. Virgil panics momentarily. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What - what's happening?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy moves to him in the near dark room. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's for the surprise - \nthey turned off the lights.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Surprise - yeah.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And suddenly the lights flood back on, everyone screams: SURPRISE!! \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan - at the door with Betsy - genuinely surprised - catches his \nbreath - then fakes a quick heart attack and drops to the floor. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The room explodes in laughter - Amy included. This action is even \nmore confusing to Virgil. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is he OK?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Hearing this - everyone breaks into bigger laughter - Virgil now the \nfocus of attention - good naturedly laughs - Amy smiles, \nembarrassed. Virgil takes a gulp of his wine, finishing it off. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">LATER: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Music is cranked! Many couples dance. Virgil exits the bathroom \n- glances back in the mirror again, at his hair - not sure he likes \nits style. He tries brushing it to the other side - it's OK. How \nabout the other way - not so bad - maybe. It's clear he's a little \ntipsy as he keeps playing with his hair. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WAITER (O.S.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Here ya go Virgil.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns - the Waiter stands there holding a glass of wine - \nplacing it carefully into Virgil's hand: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Cheers, Kevin.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY (O.S.)\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(over the noise)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil!!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil embarrassed, turns - can faintly hear Amy's voice over the \nmusic. Searches the room - bopping bodies - balloons being bashed \nround - lights dim. The number of drinks he's had isn't helping. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil--over here!!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy, standing with Duncan and Betsy. \n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Maybe he's blind again.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't even think it. C'mon - I want the \nboth of you to meet him - he'll never \nfind us here.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">With VIRGIL - smiling as he sees Amy, Duncan and Betsy move towards \nhim. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil - I'm sorry - I went to get \nDuncan. Duncan - Virgil. And this is \nBetsy.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey Virgil good to meet you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BETSY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Heard a lot about you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Heyyy! Yeah. Good to meet you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil thrusts his hand out - colliding it into Duncan's. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry - things still get a \nlittle cockeyed sometimes.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(holding up his drink) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Few more of these and I'll be the same.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Lemme get Kevin - my man - \nhe'll top you up. KE-VIN!!!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Uncomfortable - everyone stops. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nothing. It's ok.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy, in Atlanta tomorrow...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Duncan - I told you...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I spoke to Falk and he...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(can't hear) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan pulls Amy in close to talk - shutting Virgil and Betsy out. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BETSY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy said you had great hands. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(laughs) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">She did, did she.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil holds them up in front of his face - tries to see them. Then \nlooks past them and watches Amy and Duncan - more importantly looks \nat Duncan's hair, his clothes. It's clear he's becoming aware of \nappearances. His own especially. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As they break their tete a tete. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BETSY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know my father was blind for several \nyears, he had cataracts as well.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Somehow this comes out patronizing. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Really. I'm surprised I don't \nknow him. It's a club you know.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kevin, the African American waiter comes up. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KEVIN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil throws his arm around Kevin. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Kevin - Duncan here the birthday man \n- could use himself a drink. Kevin here \ntells me he's black - did you know that\n- I mean look at him - look at me -\nisn't that the damnedest thing. He's black. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy is mortified, Kevin laughs. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KEVIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll get you a drink.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil looks to Amy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's that look?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What look?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've never seen your face that way \nbefore. It's.. .weird. What does it mean?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Before she can answer - a dance song breaks out - Betsy wraps her \narm around Duncan's. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BETSY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come on Duncan - let's dance - \nmove those old bones.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan only acknowledges Betsy's contact with a raised eyebrow to \nAmy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What the hell it's my birthday -- nice to \nmeet you Virgil - see you at the opening.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And they're gone onto the floor. Virgil watches him - sees the ease \nwith which Duncan moves, handles things. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Opening?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">The lobby we designed. Virgil - you can't...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let's dance.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the floor. Amy - ready for \none of Virgil's wild dances takes hold of his hand. The music \nblaring, Virgil starts to get into it - Amy starting to relax - then \nVirgil slowly notices how everyone else is dancing - more \nconservative. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He's even getting some looks from people. Slowly he winds down - \ntries to mimic what everyone else is doing - ends up in just a slow \nshuffle. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy watches him - sees he's uncomfortable - moves to him - but \nVirgil turns on his heel and strides away. Amy follows after him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. LOFT - CORNER - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil stands near the glass doors leading to an outdoor balcony. \nAmy comes up to him - finds Virgil facing a wall - eyes shut. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What are you doing?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil's head cocks slightly towards her - just like when he was \nblind. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I feel like Rip Van Winkle. \nI've woken up from a thirty year sleep \n- and the world's passed me by.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's just dancing. Who cares?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil whirls on her - his hand on her shoulder to steady his look \nat her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No-no-no-no. It's not the Goddamn dancing. \nI wanted to come here tonight - show you I\ncould \"fit\" in. Like the big boys do. Big \nseeing boys. Yes. Well, I don't. Don't.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's just going to take time. \nYou weren't ready. We shouldn't have come.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No - I - me, shouldn't have come. \nYou want me to see - but you know what \n- you know what - shit - I don't belong \nin the wonderful world of seeing. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy reaches out to him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil \u0085 look \u0085.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy realizes what she just said - Virgil pulls his arm away. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, I won't. I'm tired of looking. \nFuck looking and the horse it came in on.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And he spins to get away from her and takes a step crashing right \ninto the sliding glass door which explodes in a shower of little \ncrystals. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The party slams to a halt - Amy stands stunned. Virgil shaken - tiny \ncuts on his face. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh my God, are you alright?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil slams his eyes shut. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, I'm just fine. Take me home.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. AMY'S LOFT - NEXT MORNING \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil, small nicks on his face, wakes up - rolls over - feels the \nempty bed beside him. Looks up to see Amy pulling her coat on - \nsuitcase at her side. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Didn't want to wake you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're going.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll only be a couple of days.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This isn't working.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What - we're not working - your eyes \n- what's not working?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I get up every morning - I look in the mirror \n- and I stare at a total stranger. I stare and \nI stare - and no matter how hard I look - I \ndon't see Virgil there anywhere. And the more \nI look at you...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What? You don't see me?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I saw you better when I was blind.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, you're not blind any more. \nI'm sorry if that disappoints you. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've got a plane to catch. I'm going \nto go before we say things we don't mean.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And she grabs her bag and is out the door. As we hold on Virgil's \nface. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">AT THE WINDOW - Virgil looking out - watching Amy get in the cab. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As she drives away we see Virgil watch the car recede - then his \nhand goes out. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV - his hand grasping at the tiny disappearing cab - trying to \nhold onto it like in Times Square - trying not to let it go. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. FALK BOARD ROOM - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSE ON - Amy's sketches. The Mall has been integrated into the two \nlarge trees - giving it shelter and shape. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FALK (O.S.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I love it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy and Duncan sit across from Falk, a man in his 40's - earned \neverything he's got - no bullshit kinda guy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FALK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">But we already cut those trees down.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. NYU CAMPUS - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Kids milling about. A young couple neck unabashedly against a wall. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We see this is Virgil's POV - he's watching - people together. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NYU HALLWAY - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil makes his way down the hall. Stops at an open doorway - a \nsign next to it with raised letters in Braille. As his hand feels \nacross it - he also reads the visual letters - Dr. Ray Webster. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Peering inside - he sees a Lab - full of the NEWLY BLIND - some \nTEENAGERS - a couple of ADULTS - a handful of SEEING IMPAIRED - all \nlearning to use a cane. The rapid tapping of their cane like a room \nfull of typewriters. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil watches - the Blind working their way around a small obstacle \ncourse - many of them running into desks, tables - it's tough, \nfrustrating work. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly Virgil feels someone next to him. Webster. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You want to join us.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil watches the blind. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No - no - I'll wait for you \nout here - when you're done.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As Virgil moves off to a hallway bench: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">Virgil\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns as Webster tosses his something. Virgil misses it - it \nhits the ground - he reaches down - finding it, he picks it up - \nit's an apple. He looks to Webster who smiles back at him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll be done in a minute.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. HOTEL LOBBY - ATLANTA - DUSK \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy and Duncan walk through the lobby to their rooms. A little combo \nplays music in the adjacent bar - a few people on the tiny dance \nfloor. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You'd think he would have told us. \nI mean those trees were in the photos.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">We'll just have to win him over tomorrow. \nLet me buy you a drink - get those \ncreative juices going.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(looks at her watch) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Aw - no - I really...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">But Duncan has her by the arm - and in one spin has her in a dance \nembrace. This move seems comfortable, familiar to them both. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">C'mon - listen, they're playing our song.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(laughs) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mack the Knife was our song?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. WEBSTER'S LAB - LATER \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Webster is cleaning up after class. Virgil watching some of the \nTeenage kids and Adults find their way out of the room. As the last \nof them leaves. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK - I'm just about done here - I got a place\nfor you - relax those eyes a bit.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A table front and center. Some empty beer glasses in front of them. \nTwo full ones in their hands - they're both a little in their cups. \nA STRIPPER grinds and weaves her way about the small dance floor to \nthe sounds of Talking Heads \"Burning down the House\". \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(eyeing the girl) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You want to know the truth -- God's honest truth? \nSeeing's been the shits.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You got to be kidding me son. You can say \nthat - sitting here in these prime viewing seats. \nForget fixing your eyes - we're going to get \nyour head examined.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm serious. I was better off blind. \nPeople don't have these expectations of you \nyou can't live up to. You're blind - \nfine - they deal with it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Didn't get what you expected did you?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">When I was blind - I had an image of \nwhat everything was, up here...\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(points to his head)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">now - it's all different - not at all \nwhat I'd expected - not what I'd hoped for.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil, let me explain something here. \nWhen you were blind - you dealt with things \none at a time - sequentially right? A wall \nled to a door to a tree to a car. That's \nhow you got to what you wanted - right.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Seeing people - for better or worse - \ndeal with everything all at once - taking in \nthe whole picture - which sometimes confuses \nthe hell out of what they want.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil, my advice after three beers - don't be \nafraid to take in the whole picture - just don't \nlose sight of what you want.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What I want is to make it work with Amy.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">And what does she have to say\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">She just wants me to see.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's that important is it?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know what I learned a long \ntime ago. Seeing girls like seeing guys. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not going to let her down.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 102 \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy and Duncan are dancing - they seem good together. Nothing fancy \n- but they move as one about the floor. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">See - not so bad.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not so bad.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's nice to dance together again. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You remember...?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">First time we danced - Connecticut. We \nwatched the leaves turn - so much to see \n- I'd love to go back. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So would I. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What happened to us Amy? You're so intent on \nfixing everything - why'd you give up on us?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I learned some things can't be fixed. \nWe got married for all the wrong reasons. \nI don't think I fell in love with you as \nmuch as I fell in love with architecture.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(serious) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I never fell in love with architecture - \nbut I know I fell in love with you. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now - that's bullshit.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It used to work.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They smile at each other - everything's easy right now - pause - \nthey dance - Amy looks up at Duncan - who hesitates - then leans in \nand kisses her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A moment and Amy pulls away slightly - looks down for a second - \nthen she leans back in and they kiss again.

If I couldn't get \nmy own son to see then...What difference \ndoes any of this make - you can see now \n- hell, I knew you could.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil watches his father - this stranger.

NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil standing across the street. Trying to take in the building \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Standing at the front as a security guard opens the door. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUARD \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry the building doesn't open until tonight.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know. I'm Virgil Anderson...with Roswell \nTremont. We did the lobby.

LOBBY - LATE DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The lobby is pretty, straightforward. Open - a few plants - a large \ncentral check in desk. Simple - unobtrusive - nothing exceptional or \nunique. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil moves his way about the lobby - looking at it carefully from \nevery possible angle - his hand grazing across walls, entranceways - \ndesperately committing as much as he can to memory - finally ending \nup in the middle of the room in a final attempt to absorb as much as \nhe can. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUARD (O.S.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You want to see that the thing work?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thing? What thing?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GUARD \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This thing\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Guard reaches over - hits a switch - and against one section of \nwindows a wall of water comes dripping down - causing a shower of \nindoor rain - the sound instantly echoing off of the walls. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil smiles - moves toward it - closing his eyes - listening to \nthe indoor rain - really taking in the room having total empathy \nwith what Amy has created. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. AMY'S LOFT - BATHROOM \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil, wrapped in a towel, is shaving. But he has his eyes closed. \nAmy comes in, dressed beautifully - using the mirror to put her \nearrings in. Virgil quickly opens his eyes. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You nervous?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No - not a bit. \nWhat do you think?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She pivots for him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You look great.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Really. Not too flashy? \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(she looks in the mirror, she is nervous) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm going to change.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil lets her go - calls to her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is an important night for you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">But you know what's most important... \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(she pokes her head in) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">That you're going to be there to see it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns to the mirror, stares at himself - contemplating what \nhe's up against. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The lobby is filled with business types, waiters circulating with \nchampagne, tiny hors-d'oeuvres. Virgil and Amy enter - standing at \nthe top of the stairs leading to the party. Virgil immediately going \ninto a performance for Amy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy, it's good - very good. \nI'm proud of you. I love the detail \n- planted pots in the corners, \nthe moldings... \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's got genuine lines.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(excited) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look around - do you see it?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He looks about the room - then turns towards the indoor rain. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV - clear - then slight haziness - a momentary flash of black \n- then back in focus. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He turns to Amy. Puts his arm around her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Our rain. \n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Your rain.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey Virgil.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He extends his hand. Virgil, obliged slowly extends his - having \ntrouble focusing - but Duncan helps him - taking hold of it and \nshaking it. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Still working on that hand shake \nyou'll get it don't worry.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Congratulations - the place looks great.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks - here's the genius though - \nI just get the gigs. Can I steal her \naway Falks' over there and I can't \ntell if he's impressed with our work \nor just has gas from the pate.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Go - do your thing.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll be right back. There's food \nand drinks down on the floor.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan and Amy start down the stairs as Virgil tries to find a safe \nplace to stand. His eyesight fading in and out - he looks around - \ndecides to negotiate the steps: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He takes one step on the stairs - looks down - is able to see Amy \nwith Falk and Duncan, looking up at him - she smiles - he does his \nbest - smiles back - lets go of the handrail - takes another step - \nfinally reaching the bottom floor. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He stands there for a long moment - lost as to where to move. A \nglimpse towards the rain sculpture and he starts towards it using \nthe sound to help guide him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy looks over - sees Virgil moving across the floor - gives him a \nlittle wave - he doesn't notice her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">At the rain Virgil stands taking in the sound. A FIGURE comes up \nnext to him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Quite a party. Love the detail of the building.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sometimes the detail doesn't matter.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil stops - turns to Webster. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ray. What are you doing here?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Aaron called me. He was worried. \nI've been trying to find you - \nAmy's office told me you were \nhere. It's bad?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's almost gone. Last few days \nhave been pretty bad.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Obviously Amy doesn't know.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's going to break her heart. \nThis is her big night - I didn't \nwant to ruin it. Thought I could \npull it off.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You can't avoid this forever.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns back towards the rain. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So Ray? Is it better to have seen and \nlost than never to have seen at all?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I thought it was loved and lost.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy comes up to them. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dr. Webster - this is a surprise.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil invited me - wanted to show \nyou off I think. The place is terrific \n- he's got every right to be proud.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank-you. I need Virgil for a \nmoment - schmoozing time.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WEBSTER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Shmooze away.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(as he's led away) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thanks Ray. I'll call you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON - Duncan standing anxiously with Falk and his wife Donna as \nthey arrive. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil - I'd like you to meet Jack \nFalk and his wife Donna up from Atlanta.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Pleased to meet you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DONNA \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy tells us you were blind.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy spurts out a glass of wine. Virgil deflects the comment. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's OK - nice to see someone so honest.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FALK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy tells us you're her inspiration. \nAny help you can give us with our project?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm a little biased but I kind of \nliked Amy's original design.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FALK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">But could we do better.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy jumps in with. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">We could do better, Mr. Falk - a lot better.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FALK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Good, I like that attitude. \nLet's keep trying for perfection.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Everyone smiles - Amy wraps her arm around Virgil. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's right - that's \nwhy I've got Virgil.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Pleasant laughter all around - and as Amy and the others continue - \nwe push in on Virgil as he takes in this thought. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. NEW BUILDING - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil and Amy out front. People leaving - Duncan getting into a \ntown car with Falk and his wife - he looks back - gives the thumbs \nup and climbs in after them. The car pulls away into the night. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You wanna walk - I feel like some air.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">See what we see? Sure.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Can I take your arm - eyes a little tired.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As they walk. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You really made the place \ncome alive with that fountain.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank-you. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know I've been thinking - you're doing \nso great now - and if we get this new \ndesign job we'd have some extra money\n- I think we should go on a big seeing\ncelebration.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(taken aback) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">A seeing celebration?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, maybe in a couple of months. \nI looked into Egypt - we could see \nthe pyramids - we could see it \ntogether for the first time. \nWhat do you say?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know - there is something \nI'd like to see.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Of course, anything.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">The Rangers play tomorrow. Season'll \nbe over before we know it - could be\nour last chance.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">The Rangers. Sure, why not?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">BLACK \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead - one that grows increasingly \nlarger as we move towards a SOUND. A hum that grows in intensity \nuntil the light fills the frame and BAM - we exit the tunnel and we \nare: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">That glorious first view - people - the white ice shining below like \na giant jewel- and the players - in bright colors scurrying about \nthe playing surface below. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is amazing - isn't it?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She looks to Virgil who is awed by what he is seeing. Then suddenly \non his face - a flash - one of those moments of darkness. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Should we find our seats. Looks \nlike the game's already started.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah - I - I'll follow you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. GARDEN - SEATS - LATER \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil and Amy in the loge seats - on the aisle - up behind the \ngoal. Amy looking at the stadium while Virgil next to her, watches \nthe game best he can. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I love the stadium the \nway it's structure...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy - the game...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Right - the game.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">SMASH - a hard check into the boards deep in the Rangers end of the \nice. The puck squirts out Gretzky picks it up - fires it across ice \n- one, two it's back to him and he has a wide open break from center \nice - the crowd is out of their seats - Virgil included - Amy \nquickly getting caught up in the enthusiasm. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">On Virgil's face - watching Gretzky skate towards him - excited - \nthen losing him - another flash of blackness - like a blow to the \nhead - and we hear the crowd suddenly explode - and as Virgil's \nvision regains we see the players mobbing Wayne after his goal - the \nlittle red light behind the net the only evidence of it happening. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We see the frustration as Virgil realizes he'll never see it. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">He scored, he scored - you see \nthat - it was amazing.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As the players make their way to center ice - the crowd sits and Amy \nsees the expression again on his face. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What? That was good right?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah - it was great - I was just...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly Virgil becomes transfixed. Walking down the aisle, away \nfrom him: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A VENDOR - carrying a tray of PINK COTTON CANDY. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil stares at it a moment - transfixed - then like in a trance - \nhe stands - stepping out into the aisle - a man on a mission. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil, where are you going?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And he's on the stairs - carefully moving down the stairs toward the \nvendor. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Then she sees the Vendor - handing Virgil a large cotton candy - \nround and puffy like a cloud - but something he can hold in his \nhand. Amy can't believe it - watching Virgil - his fascination at \nfinding this long lost memory. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">The puffy thing.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Angle on Virgil turning - admiring his prize - then looking up, \ntrying to find Amy - who waves to him excited. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV - scanning the crowd - it's hazy - then flashes of dark. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy's face - suddenly drops - it's clear, even though she is only \nfour rows up - he doesn't see her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

What's going on?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nothing. I see almost nothing.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy: she feels like she's about to explode. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh God.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's OK.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK?!!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's OK for you to cry.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(recovering) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, no - I'm not going to cry. \nSolve the problem. We made it \nthrough one operation - we'll \nmake it through another. We won't\ngive up. We'll get this right \n- we just need to...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I saw Dr. Aaron. \nThere's nothing they can do.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Then we'll find another Doctor. \nThere's got to be someone else. \nWe'll find something that works.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't you get it - \nI can't go through this again.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So just like that - we just forget it - \ngive up? Why the hell haven't you told\nme what was going on?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(whirls on her) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Because of this!!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What this?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You!

You want to \nlive in your own little world - this perfect \nworld that your sister built for you \n- where no one can touch you ... where no \none can reach you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you know the reason why I remembered the \ncotton candy all those years? Because I went \nto the game with my father. And it's the \nonly good thing I can remember about him. \nThe rest is him pushing me to be something\nI'm not - then turning his back on me the \nminute his plans fail.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I am not turning my back on you. \nYou want me to give up on you \n- you love the self pity.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't want you to give up on ME. \nBut you won't give up on me seeing.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Because there must be other options.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not anymore.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil, avoiding her, sidesteps quickly past her - straight into the \nlamp, which crashes to the ground and breaks. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">DARKNESS. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dammit.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A short few steps then a much larger crash - the sound of a large \nheavier thing breaking. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil!!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy feels her way to the lights - and turns them on.

He sits among \nthe pieces on the floor. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil - feeling the damage. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(going to him) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is anything broken?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No - no bones are broken.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil uses the wall to stand - then - with his hands out in front \nof him he finds his way to the bed. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's finished - can't you see that! \nWe both didn't get what we wanted.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(quietly) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I never meant to hurt you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">When you asked me to come here - \ndid you ever think this wasn't going \nto work - that for one minute I may \nnot be able to see. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Did you ever think it would be OK \nto have a relationship with a blind man?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy - a pause.. Too long. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">There's my answer.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And he grabs his duffel and pack - throws the last few things in - \nand moving to the door - leaves. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. BUS - NIGHT - RAINING \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil riding - crossing the George Washington Bridge - going home. \nHe looks out the window - sees the receding city - and he closes his \neyes - listens to the rain. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. PINECREST - MAIN STREET - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Bus comes down the main street of Pinecrest. Stopping - the bus \ndoor opens and Virgil gets out - and turns to face up the street - \nthe street he knew so well that is so foreign to him right now. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. VIRGIL AND JENNIE'S - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The door opens.

HOME - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil and Jennie entering his place - to be greeted immediately by: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">SOPHIE bounding across the floor towards them - tail wagging - \ntongue hanging out. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sophie!?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And he bends down to hug her. Sophie laps at his face. Virgil holds \nher back to get a good look at her. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let me look at you. \nYou're so beautiful.. yes.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jennie watches her brother - happy to have him home. Hoping to get \nhim back to 'normal'. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - LATER \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil walks around, touching things, seeing the simplicity of his \nlife. Nothing on the walls - no decorations - no plants. Everything \nfunctional. He realizes this is a home designed by his sister. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He moves over to the photo of the family. He on his dad's shoulders. \nStares at it - at his father and mother for the first time. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mom and dad. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil just stares. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Everything's as you left it. \nNothing's changed.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Jen - I'm pretty tired - \nI'd like to be alone.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The PHONE rings. Rings again. Virgil doesn't move - his apprehension \nis clear - he knows who it is. Jennie sees this and moves toward the \nphone. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil turns and walks out onto the front porch - followed by \nSophie, as his sister picks up the phone in the background. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. VIRGIL'S PORCH - NIGHT \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He sits down - looks into the night as we hear Jennie faintly on the \nphone. A beat and she hangs up. We hold on Virgil: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. PINECREST STREET - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil walks down Main street. Seeing his town - a town he grew up \nin but now seems so foreign. Virgil seems oddly disturbed by what he \nsees. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The yellow bus drives by - full of kids - Carl at the helm. Somehow \nit's not what he expected. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. ROSWELL-TRRMONT DESIGN FIRM - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy organizing all her work on the Atlanta project - - the original \ndesigns - the new design with the trees - then she sees: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The sketch she made of the \"dancing trees\". Her eyes hold - and she \nslowly shuts them - and with them tightly closed - her hand reaches \nout and runs along the drawings. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. PINECREST - END OF MAIN STREET - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We find Virgil standing - looking out at the end of the street where \nhe stood with Amy. In front of him he sees: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The \"dancing trees\". \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">VIRGIL'S POV - a retinal spark - a quick glimpse of the intertwined \ntrees - one lover choosing between two others. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. FIREHOUSE - LATE DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil - stands in the middle of the room. Looks about at what was \nat one time so special to him. Now it just seems old and dingy - the \nmagic is gone. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He closes his eyes for a moment - listens - cocks his head to the \nleft - the right - but there is nothing there. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. TOWN LIBRARY - LATE DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil standing outside - staring at a building he's never seen - \nnever been inside. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV: flickering a moment. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. LIBRARY - SUNSET \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil now sits at a table. Stacks and stacks of LIFE magazine \nsplayed out in front of him. He is flipping through them at a rapid \nrate - like a drowning man searching for air. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">IMAGES - cars, JFK, the pyramids, Martin Luther King, houses, \nflowers, Marilyn Monroe, that Napalm burned little girl in Viet Nam, \nAfrican masks, Dachau prisoners, Nixon, Warhol paintings, the Mona \nLisa, that vulture watching over the little baby, the Eiffel tower, \nFirst Man on the moon, the Venus De Milo, that guy in front of the \ntank in Tianaman square .. and the Pyramids. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The pictures go by fast and furious - Virgil soaking them up like a \nsponge - life, beauty, horror, great people, great events... \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And we move in on his face - absorbing these images for the last \ntime - a face filled with anguish at a world disappearing. And we \ncut to: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. AMY'S ROOF - SUNSET \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Golden rays of the late afternoon sun. Amy on the roof - leaning on \nthe parapet - watching the horizon. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Then a thought comes to her. And mimicking what Virgil had done - \nshe walks back to the other end of the roof, turns and looks out \ntowards the skyline again ... then starts slowly walking towards the \nparapet till she reaches the wall again. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The reaction on her face - she doesn't \"see\" it - not like Virgil \ndid. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. VIRGIL'S HOME - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil is shifting furniture in his house. A table - moves it to the \nwindow - moves a chair to join it - stands back to have a look at \nit. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIS POV - a moment of clear - then haze - then dark - then haze. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil rubs his head - these last days of sight have been painful \nand exhausting for him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE (O.S.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello! \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She's at the door. Virgil cocks his head in her direction. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I picked up some things at the store - \nT-shirts, I'm sure you're out, some socks...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Jennie, what's at the \nend of Main Street?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well - I think it's Vivian's little stationery...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Beyond all the stores - past firehouse. \nWhat happens when this is no more Main Street?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well - there's nothing really - you know that. ~ \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No! You told me that's all there was. \nThat's wrong. There's a helluva lot out there.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Jennie surprised at where this is going. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I told you what you needed to know.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What was within my reach.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What more do vou want?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Isn't there anything more that vou want?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is this about our father -\nhe called told me...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. This isn't about him. Jennie - \nyou've spent your whole life as \nblind as I was. The world doesn't \nstop within our reach.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil, please. This is your home. \nStop thinking about what's out there \n- things that will never matter to you. \nYou're safe here where everyone...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Where everyone what!?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Knows you.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Can protect me?! (beat) \nJennie, this place was a wonderful safe \nhaven for me growing up. I know that. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(looking around) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">And I can only imagine what you gave up \nto keep this world for me. I thank you \nand love you from the bottom of my soul. \nBut now I want to give you your life back.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JENNIE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virgil, I - I can't...\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You can\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil reaches out his arms for her to join him. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm reaching out, Jennie.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">This gets Jennie and she goes to him, really hugging him for the \nfirst time as tears flow from her eyes. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. AMY'S LOFT - LATE DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Amy, dressed in sweat pants and tee shirt sitting on the ground, \ntrying to piece the sculpture back together. It's a difficult fix. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">KNOCK KNOCK \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy - you in there.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Go away.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She scrapes some plaster into a dust pan. We hear enters a key in \nthe door - and the door opens. Duncan \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I knew keeping this key would come in \nhandy one day. What a mess - what happened?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">It broke - I'm trying to fix it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So - guess what?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not in the mood for games.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">We got it.

Everything. \nNothing is right thank-you very much.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know what the problem is - you're \nthe problem - you met a blind guy you \nthought was cool and spent the first \ntwo months trying to change him.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Are you finished?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not even close. Let me tell you something \n- you can't change people to solve you. \nYou tried to do it with me - you tried \nto do it with Virgil. You ever think \nsome of the things you try to fix \n- ain't broke.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And he's gone - as Amy slumps into a chair - confused, tired - then \nslowly she starts to hear: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">TAP - TAP - TAP...TAPTAP - TAP \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The SOUND of a CANE in the stairwell! Amy's heart starts racing - \nshe takes a breath - jumps up quickly and moves her way over to the \ndoor - unlocking it and swinging it open: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(excitedly) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Virg .......\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The CANE - being held by Ethan - as he taps his way down the stairs. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ETHAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey Amy.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi, Ethan.

PINECREST - SUNSET \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil walks the path, Sophie following close behind. By the way he \nwalks, counting steps, touching landmarks, we realize he is using \nsight very little. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. HIDDEN VALLEY - SUNSET \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Coming through the clearing, to the plateau where he took Amy, the \nleaves now starting to turn golden colors - he stops - stands over \ntop of the pond. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">VIRGIL'S POV - A retinal spark. The view across the valley, with \nwhite clouds against the bluest sky. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">His hand reaches out - to touch the edge of the world - to touch the \nhorizon. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And as he drops his hand, we see the clouds start to race by - while \nthe blue sky goes golden then drifts into darkness. Virgil doesn't \nmove from the spot. The screen goes almost black - then slowly the \nsun starts to rise in the east. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil makes no movement. A long beat - then - as the sun moves \nacross him - he realizes it's day. He stands and unfolds his cane. \nIt's clear he has returned to being completely blind. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As he turns and starts his way down the hill we hear: \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Growing up blind - I had two dreams. \nOne was to see. The other - to play \nfor the New York Rangers.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. LECTURE HALL - N.Y.

WEBSTER'S LAB - NYU \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL (V.O.)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But I realized that our eyes aren't what \nmake us see. We only live in darkness \nwhen we don't look - look at what is \ngenuine about ourselves - genuine \nabout others - you don't need eyes for that.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil sitting with three young blind children - working through \nBraille with them. Webster watches from the corner of the room. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.

WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil - taking in the sun - finishing off the last of his sandwich. \nBalling up his paper bag - he taps his cane out - finds the garbage \ncan nearby - and tosses the bag - rim shot - it misses, hits the \nground. A hand reaches into frame and puts the bag in the garbage. \nVirgil looks up - senses the presence. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Did I miss?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VOICE (O.S.) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">By a mile.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Amy?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON Amy: watching Virgil - realizing his sight is gone. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AMY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ray told me you were living in town \n- said I could find you here. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(beat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I rushed, didn't I?

Just see what we see.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil smiles, nods. As he stands - he takes her arm - and as they \nwalk off into the park, we slowly FADE to BLACK and just LISTEN, \nlisten to the SOUNDS of the day - the percussion of the city. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE END\n\n\n</p></div>\n\n<b>\n</b><b>\n</b>\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>At First Sight</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Oliver Sacks\" title=\"Scripts by Oliver Sacks\">Oliver Sacks</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Steve Levitt\" title=\"Scripts by Steve Levitt\">Steve Levitt</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Irwin Winkler\" title=\"Scripts by Irwin Winkler\">Irwin Winkler</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Rob Cowan\" title=\"Scripts by Rob Cowan\">Rob Cowan</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/At First Sight Script.html#comments\" title=\"At First Sight comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:59:10.710081"}
