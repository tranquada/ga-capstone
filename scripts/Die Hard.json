Passengers rise, start to take down overhead\n        luggage.

Balancing\n        this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat\n        and an overnighter.

THE NAKATOMI BUILDING (LOS ANGELES) - EVENING     4 \n\n        CLOSE ON A bottle of Dom Perignon as the cork explodes across\n        a large office floor decorated for Christmas.  A Japanese man,\n        mid-fifties standing on a desk holds up the bottle triumphantly\n        and looks out at an adoring audience of junior executives and\n        office personnel.  He is JOSEPH TAKAGI, Sr V.P. of Sales for\n        Nakatomi, a multinational corporation.\n\n                                 TAKAGI\n                  Ladies and gentlemen...I congratulate\n                  each and every one of you for making\n                  this one of the greatest days in the\n                  history of the Nakatomi corporation...\n\n        In the b.g., obviously still at work, an attractive BUSINESSWOMAN\n        in her mid-thirties, studying a computer printout, heads toward\n        her office.

He moves to the elevators, and as he\n        does his experienced eye takes in:\n\n13-E    ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD                                 13-E  \n\n        Patrolling a different area.\n\n13-F    SEVERAL HI-TECH CAMERAS AND SENSORS                    13-F  \n\n        which are cleverly worked into the decor of the lobby.\n\n13-G    BACK TO SCENE                                          13-G  \n\n        McClane reacts with bored professionalism, NODS to the guard.\n\n                                 MCCLANE\n                  Lots of hardware...\n\n        The guard shrugs.

He rotates his head, getting out the travel\n        cricks.\n\n        As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING,\n        THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he\n        realizes -- it's the party.  As the doors open the noise\n        ATTACKS us.\n\n15      30TH FLOOR - SAME                                      15 \n\n        McClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually\n        spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch\n        from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in\n        an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even\n        burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through\n        the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers over\n        him.\n\n        A WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him.\n\n                                 MCCLANE\n                         (to himself, shaking\n                         his head)\n                  California...\n\n        Finally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out their\n        words but she nods, points off in some generic direction.\n\n        McClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses\n        his bearings.  He sees:\n\n15-A    TAKAGI                                                 15-A \n\n        who has an air of authority.

McClane stares at a PRETTY GIRL in her bedroom.  She's\n        wearing drop dead underwear right out of the Victoria's Secret\n        catalog.  As we watch, she flops down on her bed, and with\n        one long leg in the air, effortlessly dials\n        a call on her high-tech phone.

My Captain keeps telling\n                 me the same thing.\n\n        McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony\n        REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.\n\n                                MCCLANE\n                 Let's go.\n\n        Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the\n        big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends\n        his pistol into the hall.\n\n        Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk.\n\n        He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that\n        sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they\n        slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen\n        across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash\n        into:\n\n85      STAIRWELL LANDING                                     85  \n\n        then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below.\n        For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto\n        Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly\n        to the side.\n\n        For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly,\n        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets\n        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very\n        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on\n        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND\n        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.\n\n        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.\n\n85-A    NEW ANGLE                                             85-A  \n\n        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during\n        the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan.\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n86      INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                               86  \n\n        PAN FROM Tony's now shoeless feet TO McClane, who sits on the\n        floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's\n        boots on his own feet.  He ties the last lace and tries to take\n        a couple of steps.\n\n        He winces in pain, goes off balance.  Quickly he starts taking\n        the boots off.\n\n                                MCCLANE\n                 A million terrorists in the world\n                 and I kill the one with feet\n                 smaller than my sister.\n\n        He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage.  Then\n        he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair.\n        He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to:\n\n86-A    A DESK                                                86-A\n\n        Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper.\n        Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby.

(NOTE:  WE CANNOT SEE TONY'S HEAD)\n        CAMERA ADJUSTS as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and\n        30th floors.\n\n        We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden\n        desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket.\n\n        The elevator doors close and the car starts down.  After it's\n        dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with\n        his fingers -- stopping the car between floors.\n\n        Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the\n        outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and\n        pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof\n        of the car.  Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the\n        edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting\n        the car in motion again.\n\n86-C    HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         86-C  \n\n        The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center\n        of the open floor, guards flanking them.  The elevators are\n        barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny\n        and Holly are sitting.  Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor.\n        Holly soothes her.  Hans stands in front of them like a stern\n        camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk.\n\n                                HANS\n                 I wanted this to be professional,\n                 efficient, adult, cooperative.

Already his clothes\n        are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the\n        dirt and sweat.  The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car\n        bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the\n        machine floor.  The doors open and McClane hears them roll the\n        chair with the body off the car.  McClane looks up.\n\n89      MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                      89  \n\n        A metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft.\n\n90      MCCLANE                                               90  \n\n        pulls himself up onto it.

Suddenly\n        McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.  The big man fires a\n        burst and McClane ducks back stopping at the exterior door\n        to the pump room he used before.  It is locked from the inside.\n\n        He BLOWS the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and\n        slips into the darkness of the:\n\n109     ELEVATOR SHAFT NEAR PUMP ROOM                         109  \n\n        Coming quickly out of the pump room, McClane picks his way\n        over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the door\n        to the elevator shaft.  The dimly lit shaft yawns before him.\n        He starts down the ladder back to the catwalk, moves along\n        it -- STOPS.\n\n        The catwalk ends, and the elevator is gone.\n\n109-A   INT.

Three quarter-size\n        holes inches from his face show how close Karl came to nailing\n        him.  Sweat covers his face, drips silently onto the aluminum.\n\n136     MACHINE ROOM                                          136\n\n        Karl listens patiently for sound.

Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly\n        under his weight.  Karl stops and looks up at the matrix of\n        aluminum duct work, trying to single out the source of the\n        sound.  He steps back into the room and raises his rifle.\n        Holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly\n        of McClane's air duct, feeling for weight -- the weight of a\n        body.\n\n137     INSIDE THE AIR DUCT                                   137\n\n        McClane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the\n        aluminum fifteen feet away.  There is a pause and another\n        three feet closer.  He can hear Karl's footsteps on the\n        concrete -- moving slowly below the duct.\n\n138     ON KARL                                               138  \n\n        His eyes are fixed above him on the air duct.

CENTURY CITY - AVENUE OF THE STARS - NIGHT       143\n\n        The street is empty, quiet.  A lone police black-and-white\n        pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow\n        cruise toward the Nakatomi building.\n\n144     ON POWELL                                             144\n\n        Driving, alone.  He starts up at the tower.  It seems calm,\n        its glowing lights matching the warmth of the holiday\n        decorations on the streets.  Powell slows to a stop and\n        scans the premises.  In the lobby we SEE Eddie, sitting behind\n        the desk.  Powell reports to his radio.\n\n                                POWELL\n                 Guard inside.

For a moment he stands, listening for sounds\n        of movement.  The floor is quiet.  He goes to the stairwell.\n\n146     EXT.

They      *\n        step out onto the darkened floor.  We SEE large number \"3\"\n        painted on the doors of this floor.\n\n        They move quickly toward the windows on the Avenue of the Stars\n        side where a terrorist, ALEXANDER, with a BAR rifle has set up\n        a machine gun nest under a half-opened window.  Directly below\n        him we SEE Powell's car.\n\n        Alexander PANS the police car with his weapon, finger on the\n        trigger.  This is clearly a man hungry for action.\n\n148     30TH FLOOR (HANS' OFFICE) - SAME                      148  \n\n        Hans watches from above.

But orders\n        are orders.\n\n150     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF NAKATOMI - SAME                    150  \n\n        Powell tries the front doors.  Locked.

He lifts one of the big chairs and\n        swings it at the window.  The tempered glass whitens on the\n        first blow.\n\n153-B   EXT.

Both men react, but Marco already\n        has his gun up.  He FIRES a round at McClane.  The bullets rip\n        into the table top and the chair, and McClane goes down behind\n        the table.\n\n156-    OUT                                             OUT  156-\n156-A                                                        156-A\n\n157     INT. 34th FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                         157\n\n        Marco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table,\n        but finds no one.

It's okay.\n\n        He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband\n        he's still holding.\n\n                                MCCLANE\n                 You got a warranty on this?\n\n        She laughs through her tears, holds onto him.\n\n                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\n\n398     EXT.

We\n        SEE McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by\n        SWAT men.  As REPORTERS start shouting questions, McClane\n        breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into\n        the crowd.\n\n                                MCCLANE\n                        (calling out)\n                 Al?  Al, you here -- ?\n\n        The crowd eddys and surges...suddenly Powell is there, and\n        McClane knows it's him.  They stare at each other, ten feet\n        apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands.  But\n        somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other\n        like men who've lived through combat together...which, in fact,\n        is the truth.\n\n                                MCCLANE\n                        (emotional)\n                 Al.

BUILDING                                         401\n\n        As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with\n        McClane and levels his gun.  McClane throws Holly to the\n        ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm.\n\n        But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl --\n        knocking him back through the doorway.  McClane looks back to\n        see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his .38.\n\n        His hand is rock steady.  He sees McClane's look.\n\n                                POWELL\n                        (shrugging)\n                 You were right.  You couldn't have\n                 made it without me.\n\n        They smile.  Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan\n        onto them.  Thornburg pushes his way forward, mike extended\n        like a weapon.\n\n                                THORNBURG\n                 Mr. McClane...Mrs. McClane...any\n                 comment on your incredible ordeal?\n                 What are your feelings now that it's\n                 all over?\n\n        Without a beat, Holly PUNCHES HIM in the chops.  He FALLS,\n        dropping the mike with an electronic SQUEAL.  McClane looks at\n        his wife, amazed.  Behind them, Thornburg sits on the ground, *\n        nurses his lip, turns to his camerman.\n\n                                THORNBURG\n                        (eager)                                       *\n                 Did you get that?\n\n        McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:                  *\n\n402     ARGYLE'S LIMO                                         402\n\n        It's a little smashed up, but still running.  Argyle is\n        standing beside the open door.  McClane and Holly get in and\n        Argyle closes the door.\n\n                                ARGYLE\n                        (getting in the\n                        front)\n                 If this is their idea of Christmas\n                 I gotta be there for New Year's.\n\n        CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW the read window where McClane and\n        Holly are kissing.
