It is empty.  As\n        the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another\n        SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near\n        the cubicles.\n\n        Tony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past\n        each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches\n        the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the\n        partition.

Then, slowly,\n        methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets\n        inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very\n        hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on\n        it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND\n        coming from somewhere attracts his attention.\n\n        He rises, moves cautiously to the source.\n\n<b>85-A    NEW ANGLE                                             85-A  \n</b>\n        It's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during\n        the struggle.
