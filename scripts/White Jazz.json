HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                                 1\n\n    Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks\n    occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white\n    tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch\n    over what was my left eye.\n\n                        ME (V.O.)\n              I'm old. And all I have left is the\n              will to remember...\n\n    I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &\n    white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below\n    me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of\n    Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires.\n\n    The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            *\n\n                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n              ...and the fear I'll forget...\n\n    Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30\n    years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection.\n\n                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n              I killed innocent men. I betrayed\n              sacred oaths. I reaped profit from\n              horror. The names are dead or too\n              guilty to tell. The events so\n              brutal they beg to be re-told...\n\n    Legend: Los Angeles, Fall 1958\n\n\n2   INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - FIGHT NIGHT                         2\n\n    The battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab\n    bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the\n    `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar.\n\n                        ME (V.O.)\n              Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice\n              Division. LAPD. That's what my face\n              looked like before.\n\n    My point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this\n    bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD\n    \"JUNIOR\" STEMMONS. Twenty-six.\n\n                                                             2.\n\n\n\n                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n              Junior Stemmons. A partner I never\n              asked for. The scowl meant to hide\n              a shit-scared kid who'd been\n              teaching evidence classes three\n              months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD\n              lifer who never got past Sergeant.\n\n                        JUNIOR STEMMONS\n              We should make our move now.\n\n                        ME\n              Mid-fight?

LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              3\n\n    The Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double\n    doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping\n    jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight-\n    taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big:\n\n                        ME\n              Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of\n              the LAPD and a real big fan-\n\n                        JUNIOR STEMMONS\n              -you're under arrest.\n\n    Sanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees\n    the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to\n    Sanderline again:\n\n                                                             3.\n\n\n\n                        ME\n              No you're not.

OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER                        4\n\n    Me, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit.\n    Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes,\n    hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer:\n\n                        RING ANNOUNCER\n              Ladies and Gentleman...due to\n              circumstances beyond our control,\n              Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-\n\n    -BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer.\n    Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three\n    exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows-\n    out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel.\n\n                        ME (V.O.)\n              Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy\n              League Crimefighter.

(CONT'D)\n              Unaware the LAPD was walking away\n              with his two big witnesses.\n\n    As we near the side exit I stop. Junior pauses, less than a\n    foot from my face, pointing up at Noonan, pure panic.\n\n                                                             4.\n\n\n\n                        JUNIOR STEMMONS\n              C'MON-JESUS-HE'S RIGHT THERE!\n\n    My P.O.V.: second row, washed-up gangster Mickey Cohen with a\n    Blonde far too beautiful for his world, a woman you've seen\n    before, but only in a yellowed B&W picture 30 years in the\n    future.

I see him squint.\n\n                        ME\n              Then you can stop pointing at him.\n\n    Double-time out the double-doors.\n\n\n5   INT.

My Hamilton says\n     11:04 PM. Streets deserted. Pete walking in Diskant's\n     direction now as I continue to roll toward both.

Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter...\n\n     Glance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm\n     shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my\n     head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out.

Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of\ngouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting\naway: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   *\nfinger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     *\nleft hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim:\n\nPOP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight:\na red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the\nblock, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      *\nPeeper fighting for balance, keeps running.\n\nI sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail,\npanting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the\nPeeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard.\nNeighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street-\n\n-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    *\nlook down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel.\nI bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands\npick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm\nswinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    *\n\nWelles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick.\nPunches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to\nwrite home about.

I don't want to see what I know is\n     there. Turn the corner:\n\n     Club Alabam songbird Tilly Hopwell. Three breaths from death.\n     A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm.

Kick my driver's        *\n     side door open firing. Tommy cuts loose with that Grease-Gun,     *\n     sprays wild. Crouch-move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz\n     by overhead. More sirens approach. Tuck behind the front end\n     of the mangled `Deuce.'\n\n     Another salvo from the Grease-Gun skips up off the pavement       *\n     in front of me. The six-packs have regrouped, start laying        *\n     down fire on Tommy.

Some beach flop he fled to\n               after his wife put him out.\n\n     Check my Hamilton: 7:32 AM. A car pulls into the parking lot.\n     Two suits step out, ramrod straight, starched officious:\n     Process Servers if ever I've seen them. One of them bears a\n     sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock. No\n     answer. They knock rude. I roll down my window.\n\n     Dan Wilhite answers in a robe: Groggy-pissed-hungover. Before\n     he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the\n     pair depart. Wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope\n     and reading what's inside...then rereading it.\n\n     Gauge his reaction: ruined.\n\n     He puts his hand on top of his head...like he's trying to\n     protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him.\n     Another big pause staring at nothing...then he just calmly\n     walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him.\n\n\n65   EXT. SANTA MONICA HOTEL - NEXT MOMENT                     65\n\n     Out of my car. Quietly hustling up to Wilhite's door: Reach\n     it and hear a distinct POP -- see the flash-snap from behind\n     the curtains: Gunshot. I know what it is. Hit the door.\n\n\n66   INT. WILHITE'S ROOM - NEXT MOMENT                         66\n\n     Wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet\n     of paper still gripped in the other. Body half onto the bed,\n     half off. Blood drains from a round wound in his temple.\n\n     Check behind me, nobody coming- close the hotel door. Pick up\n     the sheet of paper/contents of the envelope.

PARKING LOT - LATER                                      67\n\n     A quick check of the lot. Empty. A housekeeping cart sits\n     nearby. Swipe a bottle of bleach from it. Walk to Wilhite's\n     Studebaker Powerhawk. Pop the trunk, return to his room.\n\n     Move quick. Fireman's carry, dump Wilhite's body in the\n     trunk. Toss his service .38 too. Pour the bottle of bleach to\n     stanch the inevitable rot smell.\n\n                         ME (V.O.)\n               Swap my car for Wilhite's. The\n               former head of the LAPD's Narcotics\n               division dead in the trunk. Call it\n               the leverage I was looking for --\n               his body can buy me out of bad spot-\n\n     -and that's when I see it: a bandage poking out from under         *\n     Wilhite's collar...undo a couple buttons, lift the bandage.        *\n\n                                                      FLASH TO:\n\n\n68   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - NIGHT                              68   *\n\n     BAM: me hit from behind by the Peeper.

Think he's living\n               outta that car. After he left, I\n               tried to get inside his place: The\n               front door is triple pad-locked.\n\n                                                             89.\n\n\n\n                         ME\n                   (out loud)\n               That knife is in there-\n\n                            PETE\n               -the what?\n\n     Shit.

He was fucking around with\n               his front door before he left. I\n               don't know what he was doing.\n\n                         ME\n               Two honks if he shows.

JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          75\n\n     Up three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver\n     hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a\n     shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine\n     stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig-\n     sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine\n     stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it.\n\n     Stand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges.\n\n\n76   INT. APT. 303 - NEXT MOMENT                               76\n\n     Move slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry-\n     rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger\n     of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level.\n\n     Continue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching\n     Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom.\n\n                         ME (V.O.)\n               Junior the Insane: You couldn't\n               hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA,\n               and not have it rot your mind.\n\n     Bear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished\n     with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his\n     shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed\n     jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag.\n\n     Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it.\n     Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine.\n\n                         ME (V.O.)\n               Junior stealing evidence from the\n               Magdalena crime scene.\n\n                                                                      91.\n\n\n\nThen I see the bookcase. Top shelf: Police manuals. Bottom\ntwo shelves: wall-to-wall red steno-pads, all exactly the\nsame brand. Shock. Step over. Flip through them: tiny,\narchitect-neat script covers every page. The running dialogue\nof a functional fucking freak:\n\nMAGDALENA RESIDENCE. 1284 S. TREMAINE. RECOVERED: MAGDALENA FINANCIAL\nRECORDS/LEDGERS. SOME ENTRIES REDACTED.

Thinks bootlicking will\n            buy him a Bureau gig.\n\nNow, rifle for that knife. Systemically destroy the place.\nDump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike,\nwatch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random\npaperwork, sift -- Junior's cock-obsessed doodles scribbled\nby the dozen.\n\nUnder the bed now, carpet covered in rat-traps. Spring them,\nclear a space. A Box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay\nclassified ads. First-person perspective Polaroids of\nJunior's stomach being kissed by the Diskant Quiff and vice-\nversa.\n\nOpen a massive steamer trunk against a far wall. Arsenal:\nhandguns, shotguns, a surplus M-1.

Check the freezer even though\n     Junior is smarter than that: amyl-nitrate poppers, vodka,\n     benzedrine, cocaine. Close it. Look down. STOP: indents in\n     the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit.\n\n     Pull to see what's behind. Eyes catch the bear-trap near the\n     bed as I tug: ugly-rusted-waiting. STOP part II: Contort,\n     peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple-shaped hand grenade\n     duct-taped to the wall, next to a built-in safe.\n\n                         MY NARRATOR VOICE (V.O.)\n               The safe scared me more than all of\n               it because a safe doesn't get\n               installed overnight...he'd been\n               working on something, planning\n               something...\n\n     Twine leads from the grenade's pin to the back of the\n     refrigerator. My bolt-cutters snap it. Pull the refrigerator\n     out now. The safe bolted into the drywall.

Back into the kitchen. Exhale. BEGIN BLASTING. Massive\n     noise. Six shots. Reload fast: nothing can muffle this\n     clatter. SECOND VOLLEY. Eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall\n     out. Gagging on gunsmoke. Rip at the safe -- something gives.\n     THIRD VOLLEY. The Safe hits the floor, leaves a hole.\n\n     Through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like\n     honks. Quick peek: Pete gone. A Black Buick with two white-\n     walled FEDS up front. Then Junior gets out of the backseat...\n\n     Scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man-porn, the\n     snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front\n     of Junior's door. Grab the green-banded evidence bag and tuck\n     it under my arm. Back into the kitchenette. Turn on the gas\n     but don't light the burners. Pull the grenade off the wall.\n     Drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape.\n\n\n77   EXT.

Shoot him twice. He goes down\ngargling `fuck'. Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as\nI slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. Feel blood\nflow saturate my pant leg.

An old gun you know you've seen before.\n      Movements slow and steady in my advancing age...\n\n                           ME (V.O.)\n                My will to remember. My confession\n                complete. Still not enough.\n                    (beat)\n                Post-scripts.\n                           (MORE)\n\n                                                       127.\n\n                     ME (V.O.) (cont'd)\n          Me: gringo exile rich off funds\n          from Stadium Parking lots. Meg and\n          Pete: still married. Three boys.\n          Boyce Bradley: Lt. Governor, then a\n          Gubernatorial primary loser to some\n          chump who acted in Chimp movies.\n          Welles Noonan, convicted of jury\n          tampering in `64. Prison suicide in\n          `66. Howard Hughes: a shut-in\n          shitting in coffee-cans at the\n          Vegas Hilton.\n              (beat)\n          George Ainge: body found, murder\n          unsolved. Madge Magdalena, liver\n          failure in `68. Lucille Magdalena:\n          Mother of five.\n\nLook back down at HER picture.\n\n                      ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n          Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding\n          her name. Only a photograph,\n          yellowed with years-passed,\n          reminding me of everything I never\n          was.\n               (beat)\n          Then a week-old Times at the place\n          I buy coffee. Her picture sees me\n          before I realize she's looking. Her\n          Face eternal-beautiful...\n\nPut her photo in my chest pocket. Push the week-old Times\ninto a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to LA underneath.\n\n                    ME (V.O.)\n          ...and it asked me to revoke our\n          time apart, redeem it...tell her\n          anything...tell her everything...\n\nI stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long. And\nas I step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my\nMGM-handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards.\n\n\n\n                                                WHITE JAZZ\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Jazz\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Joe Carnahan\u00a0\u00a0Matthew Michael Carnahan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:38:46.962760"}
