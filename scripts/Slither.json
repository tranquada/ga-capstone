Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for\n          the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Get back.\n          \n          The other cops step away.

Nobody's\n                    gonna hurt you.\n          \n          The doe looks at him, settling a bit.   His voice seems to\n          be soothing her.

Bill scoops close past\n          her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.\n          \n          Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking\n          Bill over, and streaks out the back door.\n          \n          Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway\n          and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond,\n          dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Hell, she took a phone.

GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - LATER\n          \n          Starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her\n          hair. She uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling.\n          \n                                  GRANT (O.S.)\n                    Sugarplum, you coming into bed?\n          \n          Starla turns toward the door.       She doesn't say anything\n          for a moment.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                    Just a second.\n          \n          Starla sets her brush down on the counter. She arranges\n          it neatly beside the others. And walks into the bedroom.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Grant turns off the TV as Starla gets into bed with him.\n          It's almost completely dark in here.\n          \n          Grant crawls on top of Starla. He kisses her and grabs\n          her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without\n          grace.\n          \n                                                                  8.\n          \n          After doing this for a few moments, Starla starts to push\n          him off her.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just --\n                    I'm not in the mood.\n          \n          Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy.\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    Come on, baby, it's --\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    I'm sorry.

He sits on the edge of\n          the bed for a moment, in silence. Starla looks afraid.\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    When are you in the mood, exactly?\n                    Seems to me that mood's as rare as\n                    winnin' the Goddamn lotto.\n          \n          Grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting\n          them on.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    Where are you going?\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    I'm just some big clown to you,\n                    ain't I?\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    That's not true -- Where are you-?\n          \n                                   GRANT\n                    Out.\n          \n                                                                9.\n          \n          INT. HENENLOTTER'S SPORTS BAR - LATER\n          \n          Grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila.\n          He's getting drunk. He taps his glass.\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    Hit me again there, killer.\n          \n          The BARKEEP fills his drink.\n          \n                                  BARKEEP\n                    Hey, Grant, how's it you come to\n                    have the same last name as first?\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    Parents thought it sounded pleasant,\n                    I s'pose. Joke on me, ain't it?\n          \n          Grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup -- BRENDA\n          GUTIERREZ -- staring at him from across the bar, smoking\n          a cigarette. Grant stares at her, trying to figure out\n          who she is. She slides off her stool.\n          \n          She sashays toward him. She props herself on the stool\n          beside him, leans drunkenly in toward him.\n          \n                                  BRENDA\n                    Megan Halesy' little sister.\n          \n                                   GRANT\n                    Shit.

SHADED CREEK - LATER\n          \n          Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable,\n          downing a six pack.\n          \n          He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances\n          down and sees particles flowing down the river.\n          \n          Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the\n          particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down\n          between the trees.\n          \n          Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are\n          coming.\n          \n                                                                  11.\n          \n          He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water\n          splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill.\n          \n          He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on\n          the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater,\n          but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost\n          organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of\n          the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing\n          downstream.\n          \n          Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some\n          sort of goo inside it. It's sticky.\n          \n          He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the\n          crater itself and into the woods.\n          \n          Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail.\n          \n          He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something\n          is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in\n          closer.\n          \n          A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between\n          the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high,\n          gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around\n          it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts\n          and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret\n          that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.\n          \n                                   GRANT\n                    What the...?\n          \n          Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even\n          frightened. He looks around for someone else.\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    Hey, anybody 'round here?   'Lo?\n          \n          No one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure.\n          He picks up a tree branch.\n          \n          Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of\n          the branch.\n          \n          Nothing happens.\n          \n          He does it again.   The thing pulses a little, and surges\n          toward Grant.\n          \n          Grand pokes it again.\n          \n          A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity\n          in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering\n          and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as\n          well.\n          \n          Grant slowly bends down to look at it when --\n          \n                                                                12.\n          \n          The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.   It strikes Grant in the\n          stomach.\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    Ow!   Fuck!\n          \n          Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his\n          abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears\n          inside him.\n          \n          He clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back\n          into the colorful flowers. His body convulses.\n          \n                                                        MATCH CUT TO:\n          \n          \n          CAT SCAN SHOT - INT. GRANT'S BODY\n          \n          We see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half.\n          We ZOOM IN on the little spore, which is jittering up\n          through his body, and into his neck.\n          \n          The spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and\n          his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY.\n          \n          \n          BACK TO SCENE\n          \n          Grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front\n          of him, silent. He's utterly still, a wax corpse.\n          \n          A hippie CAMPING COUPLE run into the area, looking for\n          the source of the screams. The man looks down at the\n          frozen Grant.\n          \n                                  CAMPER\n                    Over here!\n          \n          The Camper crouches down beside him.\n          \n                                 CAMPER\n                    Hey, man. You all right?...\n                    Dude?... Oh shit.\n          \n          The Camper turns from Grant to his girlfriend.\n          \n                                  CAMPER\n                    I think he's d --\n          \n          Grant GASPS suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man,\n          like a drowning man popping up above water. The Camper\n          YELPS and jumps back. Grant sweats and heaves, trying to\n          speak, but hardly can --\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    It's taking... my... brain.\n          \n                                                                  13.\n          \n                                  CAMPER\n                    Buddy?\n          \n          Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves\n          there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if\n          seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands.\n          \n                                  CAMPER\n                    You all right, man?\n          \n          Grant looks down curiously at the camper.

GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING\n          \n          Grant creeps into the bedroom, looking around.   We can\n          hear the SHOWER RUNNING.\n          \n          Grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser. He\n          moves in close to the mirror, and stares at his own image.\n          \n                                                                  14.\n          \n          He pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with\n          excitement. He smiles at himself.\n          \n          Grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears\n          the running shower. He creeps toward it.\n          \n          Grant peeks around the doorway. Starla is in the shower,\n          soaping herself. She looks beautiful there. Grant tilts\n          his head to the side like a dog. He watches her,\n          mesmerized, even moved.\n          \n          \n          INT.   GRANT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair\n          in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears Air Supply's\n          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD coming from the bedroom. She's\n          struck by it.\n          \n          She moves toward the door.   Opens it.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MORNING\n          \n          The shades are drawn, darkening the room. A few candles\n          have been lit. Grant is standing there, mostly in\n          silhouette. He's silent, and he doesn't move.\n          \n                                   GRANT\n                     Hey there, sugarplum.\n          \n          Starla looks at him, stirred.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                     Haven't heard this for a while.\n          \n          Grant walks toward her. He takes her hand in his own,\n          lifting it beside him. He wraps his other arm around her\n          waist. And he slow dances with her. Starla dances too,\n          a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                     I never danced in a towel before.\n          \n                                   GRANT\n                     Wearing white, just like on our...\n                     wedding day.

He runs his\n          hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock,\n          with as much fascination as lust. He pushes Starla back\n          onto the bed.\n          \n          He lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little,\n          scrapes his teeth on it. Starla is surprised by this,\n          but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's\n          had in years.\n          \n          Grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her\n          breasts, her face. Starla's hand moves over Grant's back,\n          and to his stomach. When she stops, startled.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    Grant, what's that?\n          \n          She gazes down at the wound between them, on Grant's bare\n          abdomen, where the spore entered him. The wound is\n          yellowish, and surrounded by veins.\n          \n          Grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    Just a little bug bite is all.\n          \n          Grant kisses and munches on Starla as she lies back on\n          the bed, enjoying it.\n          \n          O.S.

GRANT BATHROOM - DAY\n          \n          Grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso.\n          The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is\n          starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy\n          bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout.\n          A pus oozes out.\n          \n          Grant looks concerned. He squirts some Neosporin onto\n          his fingers. He massages it slowly into the wound.\n          \n          \n          INT.   GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around\n          inside. He pulls out some bread. Some cheese.\n          \n          He opens the meat drawer. It's replete with cold cuts.\n          He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney. Turkey. Pastrami\n          and salami. He grabs every type of meat there is.\n          \n          \n          MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Grant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of\n          bread and some cheese. He starts putting the meat on.\n          But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a\n          little sandwich tower.\n          \n                                                                  17.\n          \n          He looks at it. Something seems off about it. He removes\n          the cheese. Better. And then the bread. Even better.\n          He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.\n          \n                                     GRANT\n                    Meat.\n          \n          After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and\n          carries off the pile of meat.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Grant enters the garage through a door from the FOYER.\n          He flips the lights on with his shoulder. He looks around.\n          \n          Grant spots an old file cabinet. He sets the tower of\n          meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. It's\n          filled with files. He closes that drawer, and opens\n          another. It has manila file folders, but no files.\n          \n          Grant takes out the folders. He uses a Sharpie to write\n          out \"BALONEY\" on a folder. Then he stuffs all the baloney\n          into the folder and files it away.\n          \n          He starts writing out \"PASTRAMI\".\n          \n          \n          LATER\n          \n          Grant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from\n          \"BALONEY\" through \"TURKEY.\" But he doesn't look satisfied.\n          \n          \n          INT.

She watches as the tubule twitches,\n          feeling its way like a blind snake.\n          \n          The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream\n          down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.\n          \n          Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid --\n          pumps through the tubule and into Brenda.\n          \n          Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms\n          there beside him.\n          \n                                                                27.\n          \n          Then she falls back, unconscious.

I'm gonna go get my...\n                       prescription filled.\n          \n          Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his\n          pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.\n          \n                                                                      31.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    I'll get if for you.\n          \n                                       GRANT\n                    No!   No.   Heh.     I'll be right back.\n          \n          He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT GARAGE - DAY\n          \n          It's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant\n          putting meat into a garbage bag.\n          \n          \n          EXT. GRANT HOUSE - DAY\n          \n          Grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he\n          places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes\n          it.\n          \n          \n          EXT. OLD BARN - EVENING\n          \n          Grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging\n          the garbage bag.\n          \n          Grant comes upon the old wooden barn.\n          \n          \n          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT\n          \n          Grant enters. It is almost completely dark.          He hears\n          WEEPING. CHAINS RATTLE.\n          \n          Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting\n          on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS\n          through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is\n          horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous\n          pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.\n          \n                                  BRENDA\n                    Grant? Grant, I'm hungry.

I think I gotta -- I think\n                    I should go to a hospital!\n          \n          Grant doesn't respond.    Brenda's eyes trail back down to\n          the meat.\n          \n          Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested\n          pork chop, pulling it toward her.\n          \n          We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the\n          raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT'S TRUCK - LATER\n          \n          Grant gets into his pickup; he trembles and YELPS as his\n          body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform\n          even more.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT\n          \n          There's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it\n          open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried.\n          \n          Wally tries to see inside.\n          \n                                     WALLY\n                    Grant around?\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    No.   He went to the pharmacy.\n          \n                                     WALLY\n                    Pharmacy?\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    He's got a... rash.\n          \n          Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means\n          something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across\n          the street, talking to another neighbor.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?\n          \n          Starla shakes her head.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Maybe she's ever called the house,\n                    or -- ?\n          \n                                                                  33.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                    No.   What...?\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    She disappeared Friday night. We\n                    got reason to believe foul play\n                    might be involved.\n          \n                                  WALLY\n                    Some kids found her necklace near\n                    Tipper Creek, as well as what might\n                    be her blood on a rock.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    The problem, Starla, is, the last\n                    person anyone saw her talking to\n                    was Grant.\n          \n          Starla looks at him, surprised.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    The Deer Cheer.

Bill tries to smile kindly before\n          he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors'\n          homes.\n          \n          Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked.\n          \n          She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage.\n          Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what\n          appears to be blood drop stains near the door.\n          \n          She gains courage, and moves off toward --\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Starla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused\n          sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the\n          door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then\n          she swings the bat at the lock on the door.\n          \n          She swings it again, GRUNTING.\n          \n                                                                 34.\n          \n          And again.\n          \n          Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door.\n          \n          Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to\n          the floor.\n          \n          Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door\n          into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench\n          hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand,\n          and enters.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of\n          rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly\n          divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground\n          Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily\n          insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She\n          looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle,\n          his tongue dangling out.\n          \n          Starla starts to CRY.\n          \n          She moves quickly back inside.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Starla runs to the front picture window, and looks out\n          onto the street. She can't see any of the cops.\n          \n          She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone.\n          She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number.\n          The phone RINGS, and:\n          \n                                     SHERRY (O.S.)\n                       You've reached Chief Pardy at the\n                       Wheelsy Police Department.

They stare at each other for a moment.\n          \n          And then Grant lets out a FURIOUS WAIL.\n          \n          Starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house.\n          \n          Grant disappears from the window.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT\n          \n          As Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the\n          front door to make sure Grant isn't following.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT HALL - NIGHT\n          \n          She runs past a wall of family photos.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to\n          the backyard.\n          \n          She arrives at it, and flings it open --\n          \n          Grant is there.\n          \n          He lunges onto her. Starla SCREAMS and drops the cordless\n          phone, just as it starts RINGING. Grant crawls on top of\n          her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he\n          pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes.\n          He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy.\n          \n                                  GRANT\n                    Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                    Grant, no!\n          \n                                     GRANT\n                    I loved you.

The tubule\n          feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it.\n          It starts to poke into her skin.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    Noooo!\n          \n          Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She\n          SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and\n          surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from\n          under him.\n          \n          Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer\n          ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1.\n          \n          Grant thrusts the couch aside.\n          \n          Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from\n          behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her\n          back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as\n          his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her\n          like a snake.\n          \n          Starla gasps for air.

He has various\n          tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown\n          eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease,\n          he now seems to BE the disease itself.\n          \n                                    STARLA\n                    Grant?\n          \n          \n          EXT.

They duck below\n          the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart\n          attacks.\n          \n          Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of\n          protest when he gets too close, and steps back.\n          \n          The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into\n          the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking.\n          Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over.\n          \n                                                                49.\n          \n          INT.

He sees, in a\n          wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up,\n          their guns at the ready.\n          \n          Starla moves even closer.   Bill and Wally are coming in\n          close behind her.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    Grant?   It's okay.\n          \n          As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost\n          scared.

For\n                    better or worse. Remember?\n          \n                                                                 50.\n          \n          Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                     Okay?\n          \n          The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle.\n          \n          Grant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest.    All of the\n          posse stop, terrified.\n          \n          Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross\n          breathing. Deep: In, out.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                     Okay, Grant?    It's gonna be all\n                     right.\n          \n          Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla\n          to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.\n          \n          Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away.\n          His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again\n          drags it toward the forest.\n          \n          While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy\n          nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at\n          him.\n          \n                                   GOOD OL' BOY\n                     You stop right there, you son of a\n                     bitch.

Now you can make this\n                     peaceful, or you can make it hard.\n          \n          Pause.   Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other.\n          \n          And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up\n          the front of the man's body, and back.\n          \n          The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly\n          in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two\n          different sides of his split head look down in disbelief\n          as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he\n          topples over.\n          \n                                     BILL\n                     Fire!   Fire!\n          \n          The posse SHOOT at Grant.    Starla covers her head.\n          \n          Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the\n          cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the\n          forest.\n          \n          Bill and the other posse members take off after him like\n          hounds on the heel of their prey.

KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Kylie is running a bath.    She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the\n          distance.\n          \n          She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to\n          see where the shots are coming from.\n          \n          \n          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT\n          \n          The posse run through this very dark forest after Grant,\n          leaping over brush and rocks. They're nervous, but also\n          excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. Their\n          eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust.\n          \n          They're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses --\n          a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing\n          around brush.\n          \n                                     WALLY\n                    There he is!     Over there!\n          \n          They FIRE at the creature, taking chunks out of trees,\n          but missing. He's too fast.\n          \n          \n          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT\n          \n          Grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek,\n          and into the plentiful trees beyond. He rustles thick\n          fronds as he moves up alongside the creek.\n          \n          The posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to\n          peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant.\n          \n          Jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek.\n          He cuts his knee on a sharp rock. He stands, and keeps\n          going.\n          \n          They come to --\n          \n          \n          EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT\n          \n          The posse come up out of the creek. They've completely\n          lost track of the diseased man-beast.\n          \n          They stop, out-of-breath and looking around.   They whisper:\n          \n                                                                 52.\n          \n                                     TREVOR\n                    Where'd he go?\n          \n                                  MARGARET\n                    We ain't never gonna find that\n                    girl now.\n          \n          The Redneck is WEEPING with rage.\n          \n                                  REDNECK\n                    I'll kill that asshole what he did\n                    to Charlie.\n          \n          Bill sees Starla run up behind them.

She\n          watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around,\n          searching for some trail of Grant.\n          \n          Margaret looks down into the bubbling creek. She sees\n          it's turning red. She looks up the trail of red, which\n          is rippling downhill in the water. The red flow starts\n          somewhere near a boulder.\n          \n          Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder.\n          Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up\n          on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a\n          shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed,\n          lifts a tentacle.\n          \n                                     MARGARET\n                    Bill!!\n          \n          Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He\n          falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.\n          \n          Bill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already\n          slithering swiftly back into the thick brush.\n          \n          The posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following.\n          \n          \n          EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT\n          \n          The posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to\n          be confronted by a terrible odor. They cover their noses\n          and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust.\n          \n                                  TREVOR\n                    What the hell's that smell?\n          \n                                  WALLY\n                    It's something dead.\n          \n                                                                 53.\n          \n          The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant\n          had brought Brenda.\n          \n                                  JACK\n                    It's coming from in there, ain't\n                    it?\n          \n          Margaret looks at Bill.\n          \n                                  MARGARET\n                    Think he's inside?\n          \n          Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn.\n          \n          The posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they\n          get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes.\n          Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't\n          react to the stench at all.\n          \n          Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens.\n          Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and\n          Wally exchange a look.\n          \n          Bill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the\n          door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to\n          open it. Starla watches all this from the rear.\n          \n          Margaret swings open the door.\n          \n          \n          INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside.   But\n          they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.\n          \n                                    BILL\n                    Oh...\n          \n          It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little\n          head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is\n          what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is\n          nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from\n          the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes,\n          slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be\n          slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The\n          woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin\n          are stained with blood.\n          \n          The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are\n          equally astounded.\n          \n                                    OLDER COP\n                    Oh, shit!\n          \n          They see the source of the awful stench:\n          \n                                                                 54.\n          \n          Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and\n          horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as\n          they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with\n          flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces\n          with the bottom of their shirts.\n          \n          The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.\n          \n                                  BRENDA\n                    Something's wrong with me.\n          \n                                    WALLY\n                    Uh, yeah.\n          \n          Bill and Wally get in a little closer.\n          \n                                    BILL\n                    Brenda, um...\n          \n                                  BRENDA\n                    I didn't want no one to be seeing\n                    me like this.\n          \n          As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly\n          LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is\n          trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in\n          agony.\n          \n          The posse jump back.    They stare as she recomposes herself.\n          \n                                  BRENDA\n                    How are my boys, Bill?

His body,\n          too, convulses, and he spits up blood.\n          \n          Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of\n          the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their\n          eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood.

Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.\n          \n          Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the\n          parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls\n          back onto the floor.\n          \n          A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when,\n          suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to\n          the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla.\n          \n          Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand\n          firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites\n          away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his\n          free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies\n          and faces as closely together as possible so the things\n          don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them,\n          flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight\n          their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to\n          himself and Starla.\n          \n                                                                 57.\n          \n          Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and\n          begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off\n          the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.\n          \n          Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from\n          Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.\n          \n          She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering,\n          holding her shirt over her mouth.

STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE/INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT\n          \n          Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are\n          clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as\n          they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in\n          the car, trembling, afraid to leave.\n          \n          She HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her\n          sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home.\n          They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts\n          are stained with the blood they spit up.\n          \n                                  KYLIE'S DAD\n                    Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on\n                    out.\n          \n          Her family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with\n          their milky eyes.

This\n                    is family fun day, isn't it?\n          \n          They continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over.\n          They SLAP the windows.\n          \n          Kylie SOBS.   Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice:\n          \n                                                                    68.\n          \n                                  KYLIE'S SISTER 1\n                    Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-\n                    ance.\n          \n          Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries\n          it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield.\n          \n          Kylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield\n          CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again.\n          \n          \n          EXT.

STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or\n          six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the\n          field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked.\n          Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.\n          \n          Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased\n          Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now,\n          smashing the pickup's windows.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Hey!\n          \n          The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing.

He yanks the trigger.\n          \n          The BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot.    He buckles.\n          \n          Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased\n          folks rush toward them through the fields.\n          \n                                   BILL\n                    Come on.\n          \n          Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the\n          diseased chase them.\n          \n          \n          EXT.

The glob SPLASHES\n          on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol.\n          \n                                  MARGARET\n                    It burns!!\n          \n          Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into\n          her skin. The hand is swelling monstrously. It's soft.\n          Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone.\n          \n                                  MARGARET\n                    What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!\n          \n          Jack opens his mouth and GLEEKS too -- shooting the stream-\n          glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again,\n          grabbing onto her neck.\n          \n          Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe,\n          as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.\n          \n                                  OLDER COP\n                    Meat.\n          \n          The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy\n          flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. He\n          stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.\n          \n          As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members\n          turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor. The Redneck\n          opens his mouth at him, when --\n          \n                                  STARLA (O.S.)\n                    Let him go!\n          \n          The posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over\n          to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing\n          the rifle at the posse, trembling.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    Trevor, come on.\n          \n          Surprised, they release Trevor.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    What'd you do to her?!\n          \n                                                                      71.\n          \n            Jack stares at Starla.

Starla is CRYING. The posse\n            makes a COLLECTIVE SCREECHING sound, then speaks again:\n          \n                                    WALLY\n                      'Cause I am Grant!\n          \n                  WALLY                           REDNECK\n          I'm you husband --              I'm you husband, Goddammit --\n          \n                                    JACK\n                      You swore to honor and obey --\n          \n                  OLDER COP                       REDNECK\n          Obey me --                      Obey me, so put that Goddamn\n                                          gun down.\n          \n                                    STARLA\n                      Don't come any closer.

The driver's\n          side door is open. The headlights are still on.\n          \n          They look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off\n          his belt and aims it in front of him.

The keys are\n          still there, but no one's inside.\n          \n          Trevor looks at the grill of the car.

He turns, aiming\n          the flashlight downward.\n          \n          A DISEASED DEER is lapping a thick purple tongue on the\n          wound of a dead man. The sick creature is mostly hairless\n          and pink and covered in veins. Bulbous black eyes hang\n          on the sides of its head like a goldfish's.\n          \n          The diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low\n          growl.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Fuck me.\n          \n          The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's\n          chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping\n          his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings\n          his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head\n          against the hard road.\n          \n          Kylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at\n          them from different directions. The deer SCREECH like\n          dying rabbits.\n          \n                                  TREVOR\n                    Bambi-rats!\n          \n          Trevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He\n          SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps\n          his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost\n          like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve\n          with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting\n          go of his gun.\n          \n          Kylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a\n          rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's\n          going on from there.\n          \n          Starla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside\n          her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED\n          BUCK, careening toward her.\n          \n          She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can.\n          \n          A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder\n          and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him.\n          Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able\n          to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun\n          above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being\n          battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of\n          his fingers barely graze the muzzle.\n          \n          Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the\n          front seat.\n          \n          But the horned buck is upon her.   He bites into Starla's\n          ankle. She SCREAMS.\n          \n                                                                 83.\n          \n          He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road.\n          But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her\n          might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power.\n          \n          The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him\n          down the road as he HOLLERS.\n          \n          Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to\n          scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just\n          a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly\n          starts to crawl out toward him.\n          \n          As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on\n          her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able\n          to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition;\n          the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the\n          floorboard, pressing on the gas.\n          \n          The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the\n          horned buck's mouth.\n          \n          Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too\n          far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the\n          rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into\n          Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat,\n          and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him,\n          knocking the beast back.\n          \n          The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole\n          head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over,\n          dead.\n          \n          Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs\n          the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg.\n          The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face\n          and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the\n          telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.\n          \n          Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.\n          \n          He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It\n          has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill\n          SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight\n          on.\n          \n          Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running\n          through the fields toward them.\n          \n          Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up\n          alongside her friends.

And\n          SCREAMS. Starla, Bill, and Trevor turn to see --\n          \n          An SUV barreling straight towards them.\n          \n          It SLAMS hard into the side of the Buick.\n          \n          And SMASHES the car back, across a short lot, and through\n          the glass storefront of a flower store.\n          \n          \n          INT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT\n          \n          The Buick and SUV are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this\n          store. Shattered vases and flowers surround them. Glass\n          fragments dangle from the window frame. Some fall and\n          CLINK to the floor.\n          \n                                                                   85.\n          \n          Starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. She looks\n          beside her to see Bill and Trevor, seemingly unconscious.\n          \n          She looks back at Kylie. The impact has killed her. Her\n          neck is bent at an ungodly angle. Bone juts up out of\n          her skin.\n          \n          Starla looks out her rear window and sees the SUV door\n          open, and the DISEASED DRIVER stumble out. His body is\n          battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her.\n          He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a MUMBLY\n          MOAN comes out.\n          \n          Starla struggles to get out of the car. Eventually, she\n          does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass\n          from the shattered window, and the water all over the\n          floor from the broken vases.\n          \n          She sees the moaning driver limping toward her.   He's\n          still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible.\n          \n          The driver gets close, ready to grab her. Starla sees a\n          metal bar. She grabs it. And SLAMS it into the diseased\n          man's shin.\n          \n          He topples over.\n          \n          She crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal\n          bar down into his head, again and again, SHOUTING and\n          CRYING with fury.\n          \n          Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead.\n          \n          Starla looks up to see dozens of DISEASED TOWNSFOLK coming\n          at her, from down the street, between buildings. They\n          see Starla there.\n          \n                                  DISEASED TOWNSFOLK\n                    Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!\n          \n          Bill and Trevor limp up behind Starla, pulling her toward\n          a door on the back wall.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Come on.\n          \n          \n          INT.

FLOWER STORE - NIGHT\n          \n          The diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all\n          sides. They SCREECH.\n          \n                                                                 86.\n          \n          INT.

But still,\n          she helps.\n          \n          The storeroom has two doors.    They start nailing anything\n          over them they can.\n          \n          Trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a\n          crack in the upper corner of the room.\n          \n                                  TREVOR\n                    Goddamn snakes!!\n          \n          Trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting\n          wildly at them, BLASTING up the whole room.\n          \n          Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from\n          other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at\n          them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.\n          \n          Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and\n          Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts\n          jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting\n          big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.\n          \n          \n          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT\n          \n          The diseased townsfolk WAIL and SLAP their hands on the\n          walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual.\n          Some push on the doors.\n          \n          \n          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill hears something POP behind him. He turns to see a\n          little hole in one of the doors. Three diseased fingers\n          slip inside, trying to pull away more.\n          \n          Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers.\n          \n          An arm pops through the door.    Bill slams the circular\n          saw into that. Blood spurts.     Bone grinds.\n          \n                                                               87.\n          \n          A man's eye peeks through another crack.

FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door\n          across from him. He runs over to the space, when the\n          circular saw stops turning. Bill turns to see he's\n          accidentally unplugged it.\n          \n          \n          EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT\n          \n          The diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of\n          the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing\n          down one door. Some have even climbed onto the roof above\n          it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead.\n          \n          \n          INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his\n          shotgun. Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have\n          almost torn down one of the doors.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    This is stupid.\n          \n          Starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away\n          the planks they nailed there.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    What are you doing?!\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    We can't make it.

A\n            DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see\n            it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor\n            looks down, in shock.\n          \n            And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The\n            Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over\n            him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor\n            starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab\n            him.\n          \n                                     BILL\n                      Nooo!\n          \n            Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him\n            away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid\n            has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart\n            like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.\n          \n            Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.\n          \n            Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door.\n            She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this\n            side of the building anymore. She moves outside.\n          \n          \n            EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT\n          \n            Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING\n            and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he\n            makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across\n            the street.\n          \n            He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But\n            she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground.\n            Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head\n            for Bill to go. Bill is confused.\n          \n            The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the\n            sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to\n            Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily\n            at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in\n            their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.\n          \n                  DISEASED WOMAN                 DISEASED KID\n          Starlaaaaaaa!

Ain't no way outta here!\n          \n            Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill\n            looks up toward the next street -- he can see the hoard\n            moving Starla across that street.\n          \n            He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.\n          \n          \n            EXT. GRANT STREET - LATER\n          \n            One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls\n            to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She\n            stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost\n            hyperventilating.\n          \n          \n            EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n            Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop. She\n            looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front\n            yard. Starla gazes up at her home:\n          \n            The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the\n            front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive\n            thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been\n            partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,\n            the roof is caved-in and sloping.\n          \n            Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of\n            the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.\n          \n          \n            EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT\n          \n            Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can\n            see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind\n            some shrubs.\n          \n                                                                   91.\n          \n          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT\n          \n          The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to\n          the front door.\n          \n          Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house.\n          It's pitch black inside. She looks back at the rotting\n          faces behind her. And then slowly enters.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla balks at the smell. She looks beside her at the\n          garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become\n          Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some\n          bodies, in a pile.\n          \n          Starla steps slowly forward, looking around.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                    Grant?\n          \n          Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here.\n          \n          \n          EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home.\n          They seem impossible to get through.\n          \n          Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet\n          from the Grants'. He makes sure no one's paying attention\n          for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked\n          car. The diseased don't see him. Bill gazes down the\n          street beside him.\n          \n          The sun is just barely beginning to rise.   They don't\n          have much time to move in the darkness.\n          \n          Bill makes a break for the house next door.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT KITCHEN - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla walks into the kitchen. Cooking supplies and\n          condiments are scattered over the floor. She spots a\n          meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils.\n          \n          She glances out the rear window. Diseased people are\n          guarding the backyard, looking away from the home.\n          \n          She grabs the meat thermometer. She snaps the thermometer\n          part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal\n          spike into the seam of her skirt.\n          \n                                                                  92.\n          \n          Suddenly, Starla hears EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD, the song\n          she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through\n          tinny speakers.\n          \n          Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she\n          can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    Grant?   We should talk.\n          \n          \n          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over\n          at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard\n          could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back\n          door, but it's locked.\n          \n          Bill notices a window slightly open.    He starts to push\n          it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY.\n          \n          He peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws\n          the window up further, and crawls inside the home.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla stands at the base of the stairwell.    The SONG is\n          louder.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                    Grant?\n          \n          She starts to ascend the stairs.     They CREAK beneath her\n          feet.\n          \n          \n          INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the\n          diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in\n          the home next door, walking up the stairs.\n          \n          Bill runs toward the stairwell here.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla looks down the hall.    Most of the walls have been\n          torn away.\n          \n          Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome\n          mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom.\n          \n          In front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts\n          into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his\n          crusty tentacles to push the back button.\n          \n                                                                  93.\n          \n          EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD starts over.\n          \n          Starla walks toward him.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Grant keeps his back to her. Starla takes in the room.\n          Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls:\n          photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family\n          parties.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                    Hey, Grant.\n          \n          Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    You did some real interesting\n                    decorating here.\n          \n          Grant watches her from the corner of his sad, purulent\n          eye.\n          \n                                     STARLA\n                    Hey.\n          \n          Starla walks by a window.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    Look, the sun's starting to come\n                    up.\n          \n          Starla starts to open the drapes.\n          \n          \n          INT. NEIGHBOR'S UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom\n          and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling\n          the drapes away from the window. She sees Bill there.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Grant SCREECHES angrily at Starla. She quickly closes\n          the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know\n                    you wanted it dark.\n          \n          \n          INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Bill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with\n          airplanes and sports memorabilia.\n          \n                                                                   94.\n          \n          He peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom\n          window, now closed to him. He makes sure his shotgun is\n          loaded.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall\n          with the photos.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    You like these memories, huh, Grant?\n          \n          Grant looks away from her.   Starla moves toward him, almost\n          seductively.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    You like being called Grant, don't\n                    you?\n          \n          Grant is silent.   She gets closer.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    I think you do. You really do.\n                    You like being Grant. Like when\n                    we danced. And when you... made\n                    love to me here on the bed.\n                    Remember that?\n          \n          Grant looks embarrassed.   Starla becomes more brazen.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    I know you've been alone, Grant.\n                    Almost forever. From here to there\n                    to there to here, there's never\n                    been another one for you.\n          \n          Starla almost looks as if she's about to cry, out of\n          compassion for him.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    Grant. Grant, I could help you.\n                    Be with you the way you want.\n                    See, I want to live.

He moves it\n          back, and GROWLS a little.\n          \n          Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again. She\n          sets them on his tentacle once more. He glares at her\n          distrustfully, breathing his deep, sick breath.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    You don't trust me, I know.

GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla moves slowly in toward Grant, as if to kiss him.\n          Grant looks, well, joyful.\n          \n          And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and\n          JABS it into Grant's eye.\n          \n          Grant SCREECHES, blind and bucking.   Starla SLAMS the\n          spike into his other eye.\n          \n          And she STABS him again, shoving the spike into his\n          forehead, where it stays.\n          \n          Starla leaps to the window.   She throws open the drapes.\n          \n                                                               96.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    Now, Bill!!

He\n          SCREECHES, swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the\n          room in fury.\n          \n          One tentacle SLAMS Starla against the wall, probably\n          breaking a rib or two. Another tentacle SMASHES the CD\n          player, squelching the song.\n          \n          \n          EXT.

She tries to catch it, but\n          misses it. It lands on the carpet. She see Grant's\n          tentacles slipping away.

He\n          grabs a .38, and stands beside the window on Grant's house.\n          \n          Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs.\n          \n          Bill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass.\n          \n          He UNLOADS the clip into him.\n          \n          The diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him. Grant,\n          using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward,\n          wrapping it around Bill's neck, raising him up. Grant\n          SCREECHES.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla appears at the top of the stairs, clutching her\n          bloody side. She has the pin in one hand and the grenade\n          in the other.\n          \n          With all her remaining effort, she lobs the grenade behind\n          Grant.\n          \n                                     GRANT\n                    Er...?\n          \n          It EXPLODES.\n          \n          \n          EXT.

GRANT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n          \n          Starla is thrown back.\n          \n          \n          EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT\n          \n          Around the house, the diseased's eyes gaze lifelessly\n          upward as they each plummet to the grass.\n          \n                                                            FADE TO:\n          \n          \n          EXT. GRANT HOME - MORNING\n          \n          Bill unwraps what's left of the tentacle from his bruised\n          neck, and looks around at the dead diseased. Grant's\n          splattered flesh is around him.\n          \n                                                               98.\n          \n          Bill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him.\n          And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a\n          distorted piece of Grant's cerebellum. Sticking out of a\n          new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill-like spore.\n          It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs\n          popping out.\n          \n          \n          INT. GRANT HALLWAY - MORNING\n          \n          Starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke:\n          most of the second floor has been blown away. Her mutated\n          husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs.\n          \n          \n          EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Starla comes around the side of the house, holding a paper\n          towel roll to the slice on her ribs. She sees Bill\n          standing there. She smiles.\n          \n                                   STARLA\n                    Hey.\n          \n          Bill smiles too.\n          \n                                   BILL\n                    Hey.\n          \n          \n          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY\n          \n          Bill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather\n          bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around\n          them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as\n          well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but\n          no life remains.\n          \n          \n          EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Bill finds an abandoned Nissan Maxima in the middle of\n          the street, with the keys still in it.\n          \n                                  BILL\n                    Starla, over here.\n          \n          \n          EXT. WHEELSY EXIT - LATER\n          \n          In the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled\n          ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant, and out\n          onto --\n          \n                                                                  99.\n          \n          EXT. ROAD BEYOND WHEELSY - DAY\n          \n          The sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car.\n          Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as\n          they head up this long, barren road outside the city.\n          \n          \n          EXT. CLUSTER OF STORES - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Bill and Starla pass through a small block of stores.\n          \n          Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual,\n          HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going\n          about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.\n          \n          Bill grabs Starla's hand.   She clenches his tightly.\n          \n                                  STARLA\n                    We can probably get some first aid\n                    and food at this gas station up\n                    here.\n          \n                                    BILL\n                    Yeah.

GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Starla and Bill pile stuff up on the cashier's counter --\n          Band-Aids, gauze, alcohol; Power Bars and Gatorade. The\n          CASHIER rings it up, staring at them because of their\n          wounds.\n          \n                                  CASHIER\n                    Comes to 32.87.\n          \n          Bill pulls money out of his pants pocket. As he does,\n          Starla glances down. His arm pulls up his shirt, and\n          Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his\n          stomach. She turns away, looking around, confused.\n          \n          Bill pays, smiles at the cashier.\n          \n                                    BILL\n                    There you go.\n          \n          \n          EXT.
