A human head protrudes from one\r\n     end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep\r\n     its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the\r\n     pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest\r\n     to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.\r\n<b>                                   2A.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>                     MARK (V.O.)\r\n</b>          Breathing\r\n          Look you\r\n          This most excellent canopy, the\r\n          air,\r\n          Presses down upon me\r\n          At 15 pounds per square inch\r\n          A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean.\r\n          Teasing me with its nearness and\r\n          immensity.\r\n          And all I get is a thin stream of\r\n          it.\r\n          A finger's width of the rope that\r\n          ties me to life.\r\n\r\nHaving now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then\r\nwanders over to the iron lung.\r\n<b>                                        3.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n    It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head\r\n    and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the\r\n    other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its\r\n    length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of\r\n    Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.\r\n    He opens his eyes and grimaces.\r\n\r\n<b>                           MARK\r\n</b>              Shit!\r\n\r\n    His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the\r\n    terrible itching.

It seems\r\n    to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the\r\n    cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the\r\n    only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints\r\n    of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They\r\n    illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging\r\n    on the wall.

It was\r\n                Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,\r\n                that gave Mary the courage she was\r\n                lacking, and she gave thanks\r\n                saying: \"My soul doth magnify the\r\n                Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced\r\n                in God my Saviour\".\r\n\r\n                May the spirit of the Lord be\r\n                amongst you and remain with you\r\n                always.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mass is over.
