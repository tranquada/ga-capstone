A strange,\r\n    self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes\r\n    its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK\r\n    O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up.\r\n    The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the\r\n    gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned\r\n    around his head.\r\n\r\n                          NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)\r\n               Mark O'Brien has been going to UC\r\n               Berkeley since 1978. That's O'Brien\r\n               in the motorized gurney heading for\r\n               class last week.\r\n\r\n    The gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus.\r\n    Passers-by just go about their normal business.\r\n\r\n                         NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)\r\n               He had polio when he was 6 years\r\n               old. The disease left his body\r\n               crippled but his mind remained\r\n               sharp and alert, and since he\r\n               wanted to be a writer, Mark O'Brien\r\n               entered Cal to major in English and\r\n               learn his trade.\r\n\r\n    We hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow Mark\r\n    in his contraption.\r\n\r\n                          MARK (V.O.)\r\n               Graduation\r\n               Today I hear the crowd's applause\r\n               Receive congratulations from my\r\n               friends\r\n               Today I ask if I've found a place\r\n               among the rest\r\n               I hope you see a man upon this\r\n               stage\r\n               Who studied...read..wrote, and\r\n               passed the test\r\n               In cap and gown, diploma on my\r\n               chair\r\n\r\n    THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A\r\n    graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in\r\n    the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS,\r\n    rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the\r\n    stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.\r\n                 1A.\r\n\r\n          NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)\r\nAnd so, Mark O'Brien graduates from\r\nCal, one of 250 English majors to\r\nreceive degrees today.\r\n                                            2.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The DEAN steps forward, congratulates Mark and places a\r\n     diploma on his blanket. The gurney makes its way across the\r\n     rest of the stage to thunderous applause.\r\n\r\n     THE SCENE CHANGES BACK to the campus exterior.

We follow a mean-looking\r\n     alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment.\r\n     It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in\r\n     through a partially-opened window.\r\n\r\n     INT.

As it settles down to its meal, we\r\n     become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's\r\n     pump, coming from somewhere close-by.\r\n\r\n     In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop\r\n     from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one\r\n     end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep\r\n     its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the\r\n     pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest\r\n     to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.\r\n                                   2A.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MARK (V.O.)\r\n          Breathing\r\n          Look you\r\n          This most excellent canopy, the\r\n          air,\r\n          Presses down upon me\r\n          At 15 pounds per square inch\r\n          A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean.\r\n          Teasing me with its nearness and\r\n          immensity.\r\n          And all I get is a thin stream of\r\n          it.\r\n          A finger's width of the rope that\r\n          ties me to life.\r\n\r\nHaving now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then\r\nwanders over to the iron lung.\r\n                                        3.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head\r\n    and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the\r\n    other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its\r\n    length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of\r\n    Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.\r\n    He opens his eyes and grimaces.\r\n\r\n                           MARK\r\n              Shit!\r\n\r\n    His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the\r\n    terrible itching.  He shakes his head violently, then stops\r\n    suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.\r\n\r\n                        MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n              Okay, just focus. Now, scratch\r\n              with your mind, okay, your mind,\r\n              scratch with your mind...\r\n\r\n    After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems\r\n    to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the\r\n    cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the\r\n    only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints\r\n    of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They\r\n    illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging\r\n    on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it.\r\n\r\n                        MARK (CONT'D)\r\n              Good morning.\r\n\r\n    Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred.\r\n\r\n    EXT.

He is frail and helpless.\r\n                                        4.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently\r\n    unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least\r\n    temporarily.\r\n\r\n                        MARK (V.O.)\r\n              Joan\r\n              I swear this was one crazy bitch\r\n              Who'd swing me about enough to\r\n              scare me,\r\n              But careful enough so she could\r\n              say:\r\n              \"Now what was all the yelling\r\n              about? You polios are screamers.\r\n              Always were.\"\r\n              I didn't say a word, but typed my\r\n              skinny novel in my head,\r\n              And thought about revenge.\r\n\r\n    In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an\r\n    involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He\r\n    feels belittled and humiliated.\r\n    A LITTLE LATER\r\n\r\n    Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning\r\n    up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it\r\n    in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.\r\n\r\n    EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE.

There are no mirrors\r\n    and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece\r\n    just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a\r\n    colorful blanket.

That's not a big ask, is\r\n              it?\r\n\r\n    Mark looks rightfully shocked.\r\n\r\n                        MARK\r\n              What if you don't last another two\r\n              weeks?\r\n                                      4A.\r\n\r\nHe gives her a look, and means it.

It had caused a couple of\r\n          spectacular accidents.\r\n\r\nThey turn a corner and approach a church.\r\n                                        5.\r\n\r\n                           MARK (V.O.)

There are not many others there.\r\n\r\n                           FATHER BRENDAN\r\n                The Apostle Luke tells us that when\r\n                Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby\r\n                in her womb leapt - \"For lo, as\r\n                soon as the voice of thy salutation\r\n                sounded in mine ears, the babe\r\n                leaped in my womb for joy\". So\r\n                Mary's fear and apprehension slowly\r\n                gave way to pride and purpose.\r\n                Elizabeth saw the greatness in\r\n                Mary. \"Blessed art thou among\r\n                women\". Elizabeth, pregnant herself\r\n                with St. John, felt the power of\r\n                this wondrous woman. It was\r\n                Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,\r\n                that gave Mary the courage she was\r\n                lacking, and she gave thanks\r\n                saying: \"My soul doth magnify the\r\n                Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced\r\n                in God my Saviour\".\r\n\r\n                May the spirit of the Lord be\r\n                amongst you and remain with you\r\n                always.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on his\r\n     head or chest and say, \"God bless you.\" In the background we\r\n     can also hear Father Brendan.\r\n\r\n                          FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n                May the peace of the Lord be with\r\n                you.\r\n\r\n                          PARISHIONERS\r\n                And also with you.\r\n\r\n     A LITTLE LATER\r\n                                        5A.\r\n\r\n\r\n7A   INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY                                     7A\r\n\r\n     Mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the\r\n     church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of\r\n     his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive\r\n     stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that\r\n     of a true believer.\r\n\r\n                         MARK (V.O.)\r\n               I'm definitely a true believer. But\r\n               I believe in a God with a sense of\r\n               humor. A wicked sense of humor. One\r\n               who created me in His own image.\r\n\r\n     Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when\r\n     he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake\r\n     hands. For no good reason, he nods instead.\r\n\r\n                         FATHER BRENDAN\r\n               Hello. I'm Father Brendan.

I\r\n          knew Father Seamus very well. I'm\r\n          sorry that he's not here any more.\r\n\r\n                     FATHER BRENDAN\r\n          As are many others. I'm going to do\r\n          my best to fill his shoes. I\r\n          understand you'd like me to hear\r\n          your confession.\r\n\r\n                    MARK\r\n          Yes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed\r\n          Mass. I liked your tone.\r\n\r\nFather Brendan is not sure how to take this.\r\n\r\n                       FATHER BRENDAN\r\n          Thank you.\r\n\r\n                     MARK\r\n          You don't believe absolute privacy\r\n          is an essential part of the\r\n          confessional, do you?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BRENDAN\r\n          No, I do not.

TONY, an\r\n     adolescent with a pony tail picks up the phone.\r\n\r\n                          TONY\r\n                Hey, this is Tony.\r\n\r\n     He listens, then looks away from the phone and shouts.\r\n\r\n                          TONY (CONT'D)\r\n                Cheryl!\r\n\r\n                          CHERYL (V.O.)\r\n                What is it?\r\n\r\n                          TONY\r\n                Phone!\r\n\r\n     He talks into the mouthpiece.\r\n\r\n                          TONY (CONT'D)\r\n                She's coming.\r\n\r\n     CHERYL arrives.

The only\r\n          bedroom furniture I have at my\r\n          place is an iron lung.

The MIKVAH LADY gets up from\r\n      her chair and approaches her.\r\n\r\n                           MIKVAH LADY\r\n                 Is this your first time?\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL\r\n                 Yes, it is. I'm converting.\r\n\r\n      She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, who\r\n      does not fail to notice Cheryl's body.\r\n\r\n                           MIKVAH LADY\r\n                 So, what do you do?\r\n\r\n      Cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment.\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL\r\n                 I don't think you'd understand.\r\n\r\n                           MIKVAH LADY\r\n                 You can try me.\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL\r\n                 Okay. I'm a housewife.\r\n\r\n                           MIKVAH LADY\r\n                 Why shouldn't I understand?\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL\r\n                 I guess I was mistaken.\r\n\r\n      Cheryl steps towards the pool.\r\n\r\n                           MIKVAH LADY\r\n                 I see you're very comfortable with\r\n                 being naked.\r\n\r\n      She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water.\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL\r\n                 That has never been one of my\r\n                 problems.\r\n\r\n                            MIKVAH LADY\r\n                 Sometimes new brides come with\r\n                 their mothers. Do I have to take\r\n                 this off? Can I please leave this\r\n                 on? They've never been naked\r\n                 before. No honey, it all has to\r\n                 come off.\r\n                                         84.\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL\r\n                 And it does?\r\n\r\n      Cheryl takes another step into the water.\r\n\r\n                           MIKVAH LADY\r\n                 And it does. They stand on the edge\r\n                 of that pool without anything to\r\n                 cling to but themselves. Nothing to\r\n                 hide behind. This is your body.\r\n                 This is the body that God crafted\r\n                 for you.\r\n\r\n      Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest.\r\n\r\n                           MIKVAH LADY (CONT'D)\r\n                 Immerse completely. Go completely\r\n                 under the water, without touching\r\n                 the walls or anything.\r\n\r\n      She immerses completely. We see her under the water. She\r\n      hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same\r\n      time, there is a look of elation in her eyes.\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL (V.O.)\r\n                 Okay Mark, you can open your eyes\r\n                 now.\r\n\r\n      INT.

He opens his eyes.\r\n\r\n                           CHERYL (V.O.)\r\n                 This is your body.\r\n\r\n      A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length\r\n      mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He\r\n      is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the\r\n      mirror flicker over his face.\r\n\r\n                           MARK (V.O.)\r\n                 So this is the body that someone\r\n                 was able to love.

We also hear the sound of\r\n      rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice.\r\n\r\n                           VOICE\r\n                 Mark, can you hear me?

I'd love to hear it.\r\n                89A.\r\n\r\n          FATHER BRENDAN\r\nOkay, but I'll try and keep it\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n          MARK\r\nDon't make it too short.\r\n\r\n          FATHER BRENDAN\r\nOkay, fine. Here goes. The meaning\r\nof love. Love is a journey.\r\n                                          90.\r\n\r\n                              MARK\r\n                    I already like it.\r\n\r\n       There is a pause.\r\n\r\n                              FATHER BRENDAN\r\n                    That's it. That's all of I've got.\r\n                    I told you it's short. Love is a\r\n                    journey.\r\n\r\n       Mark laughs.\r\n\r\n163A   OMITTED                                                 163A\r\n       EXT. MARK'S PLACE.

There is definitely a smile on his face.\r\n\r\n       INT.      MARK'S PLACE.

At least I was\r\n                    able to see the cup-of-life\r\n                    metaphor as a useful tool. Of\r\n                    course, the two halves were never\r\n                    even. Not in my case, that's for\r\n                    sure. Look at all the years of\r\n                    unendurable crap I've had to put up\r\n                    with. That fills most of the cup.\r\n                    But in the little bit that's left,\r\n                    what do I have to show for myself?\r\n                    Journalism? Poetry? At the very\r\n                    least, three beautiful women who\r\n                    all loved me and will all show up\r\n                    at my funeral.\r\n\r\n       EXT.

We see members of Mark's\r\n      FAMILY, all teary-eyed.\r\n\r\n                           FATHER BRENDAN (TO MARK)\r\n                 Mark, I know you're watching. I'm\r\n                 sorry, my friend, but we have to do\r\n                 this. Just bear with me, and I\r\n                 think you might like it.\r\n\r\n                             FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)\r\n                             (CONT'D)\r\n                 I've been branching out lately,\r\n                 reading Native American stories\r\n                 about the character of the\r\n                 trickster. Sometimes he shows up\r\n                 as a coyote, sometimes as a raven,\r\n                 but he always does the unexpected.\r\n                 The trickster breaks the rules.\r\n                 Mark O'Brien, whose life we're\r\n                 celebrating today, was very much\r\n                 the trickster -- anyone who knew\r\n                 him knew that.\r\n                           (MORE)\r\n                       90B.\r\n\r\n          FATHER BRENDAN (TO THE CONGREGATION)\r\nBesides his irreverent humor and\r\nalarming honesty, he always did the\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every aspect of his life,\r\nMark did the unexpected. His was a\r\ndynamic voice in a paralyzed body,\r\na full life lived long after he\r\nshould have been dead. He\r\ngraduated from college, wrote and\r\npublished articles and poems, and --\r\nagainst all odds, by his own\r\nadmission -- entered into the fully\r\nhuman experience of physical love.\r\n\r\nIn this way, Mark lived from day to\r\nday to day, from breath to breath\r\nto breath, for 49 years. He loved,\r\nand he was loved and in his quiet\r\nvoice, he spoke loud truths.\r\n                                         91.\r\n\r\n\r\n      We see Rod, Vera and Laura the therapist in various rows.\r\n      Also Amanda, holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next\r\n      to a tall, boring-looking HUSBAND.\r\n\r\n                          FATHER BRENDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n                Susan Fernbach will now read one of\r\n                Mark's favorite poems.\r\n\r\n                          SUSAN (V.O.)\r\n                This is called Love Poem for No One\r\n                in Particular.\r\n\r\n      We see SUSAN at the lectern, reading from a book.\r\n\r\n                           SUSAN\r\n                Let me touch you with my words.\r\n                For my hands lie limp as empty\r\n                gloves.\r\n                Let my words stroke your hair,\r\n                Slide down your back and tickle\r\n                your belly.\r\n                For my hands, light and free-flying\r\n                as bricks,\r\n                Ignore my wishes and stubbornly\r\n                refuse to carry out my quietest\r\n                desires.\r\n\r\n      We see Cheryl, as deeply touched by the words as she was the\r\n      first time.\r\n\r\n                          SUSAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n                Let my words enter your mind,\r\n                bearing torches.\r\n                Admit them willingly into your\r\n                being\r\n                So they may caress you gently\r\n                within.\r\n\r\n      INT.
