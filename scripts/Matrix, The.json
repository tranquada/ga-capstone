Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs\n\tand cover his genitals.\n\n\tHe is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the\n\tJell-O but does not break the surface.\n\n\tPressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red\n\trubber coccon.\n\n\tUnable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at\n\tthe thinning elastic shroud --\n\n\tUntil it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he\n\tsucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the\n\tcell.\n\n\tIt is Neo.\n\n\tHe is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.\n\tDizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.\n\n\tHe is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled\n\twith red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified\n\tlike curdled milk.\n\n\tThe IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear\n\tto be grafted to his flesh.\n\n\tHe feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the\n\tback of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial\n\tplugged and locked into the base of his skull.\n\n\tHe tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull\n\toff a finger.\n\n\tTo either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with\n\tred gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and\n\tmotionless, he sees other human beings.\n\n\tFanning out in a circle, there are more.

But sometime at the\n\t\t\tend of the twenty-first century\n\t\t\tthe battle was joined.\n\n\tWe MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe war raged for generations and\n\t\t\tturned the face of our planet from\n\t\t\tgreen and blue to black and red.\n\n\tAt last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are\n\tat once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic\n\tarchitecture like a microbiotic organism, that is\n\tperpetually in motion.\n\n\tThe Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,\n\tsplitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS\n\t\t\tIt scorched and burned the sky.\n\t\t\tWithout the sun, the machines\n\t\t\tsought out a new energy source to\n\t\t\tsurvive.\n\n\tThe Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink\n\tbursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud\n\tof stain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThey discovered a new form of\n\t\t\tfusion.  All that was required to\n\t\t\tinitiate the reaction was a small\n\t\t\telectric charge.  Throughout human\n\t\t\thistory we have been dependent on\n\t\t\tmachines to survive.  Fate, it\n\t\t\tseems, is not without a sense of\n\t\t\tirony.\n\n\tWe return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where\n\twe see human beings looking almost blissful in their\n\tgelatin cocoons.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS\n\t\t\tThe human body generates more bio-\n\t\t\telectricity than a 120-volt\n\t\t\tbattery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s\n\t\t\tof body heat.\n\n\tOutside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a\n\tbreathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS\n\t\t\tWe are, as an energy source,\n\t\t\teasily renewable and completely\n\t\t\trecyclable, the dead liquified and\n\t\t\tfed intravenously to the living.\n\n\tHuge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMORPHEUS\n\t\t\tAll they needed to control this\n\t\t\tnew battery was something to\n\t\t\toccupy our mind.\n\n\tWe see inside a clear tubular husk.
