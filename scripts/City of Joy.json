BIHAR - DAY (DAWN, SUMMER, MID-1980)\n</b>Heat that has mass. That rises off the parched earth in\nshimmering waves. After a moment, we see what appear to\nbe figures coming out of the haze, one by one. A family\nwith their few belongings: HASARI PAL, 33, his wife,\nALOKA, 28, and their children, daughter, AMRITA, 13,\nsons MANOOJ and SHAMBU, 11 and 9; HASARI'S MOTHER and\nFATHER. They embark toward the night, the rising sun\nbehind them.\n\n\n<b>EXT. ROADSIDE - BUS STOP - DAY (DAWN)\n</b>Hasari's Father passes a gourd of precious water. Hasari\nserves the children first. Shambu gulps entirely too\nmuch, the others forcing him to stop by a unified force\nof will. Embarrassed, he passes the cup to his brother,\nwho sips, as does his sister. Aloka barely wets her\nlips, insisting on leaving the last drops for Hasari.\nAnd now, a rooster tail of dust rises up behind the\napproaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their\nson's family. There is an intense sadness at leaving\nthe land and Hasari's Mother clings to him...\n<b>                         HASARI\n</b>           I'll send money soon.\nHis Mother nods, as Hasari erupts in a small cough which,\nby habit, he suppresses. His Mother crushes Aloka to\nher.\n<b>                         HASARI'S MOTHER\n</b>           Don't let the children out of your\n           sight. Not for a moment.\nNow the children. She wants to keep them here even as\nthe old man touches her, reminding her she must let them\ngo.\n<b>                         HASARI'S MOTHER\n</b>           Help your parents. Don't fight\n           with each other. And, Manooj,\n           stay away from the cinema, do you\n           hear?\nShambu, his eyes big as saucers, whispers to his\ngrandma...\n<b>                                            (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                      2.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b><b>                         SHAMBU\n</b>           I don't want to go. There are bad\n           men with long knives who steal\n           children.\nThat does it: Hasari's   Mother dissolves in tears, but\nthe old man nevertheless  unlooses her insistently from\nthe children. Aloka and   the children get on the bus as\nthe old man embraces his  son.\n<b>                         HASARI'S FATHER\n</b>           A man's journey to the end of his\n           obligations is a very long road.\n           Yours begins here.\n\n\n<b>EXT. ROADSIDE/INT. BUS - DAY\n</b>There's not an empty inch inside the little vehicle or\non top.  The passengers are silent. A woman breast feeds\na baby.  Several passengers fan themselves. Many sleep.\nThe Pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat.\n<b>                         MANOOJ\n</b>                  (to his neighbor)\n           Our farm has died, so we are\n           moving to Calcutta to become rich!\nHasari and Aloka look  at each other: If only it were the\npursuit of wealth and  not survival. The woman under-\nstands. And now the   BUS GRINDS forward and the Pals look\nback. Hasari coughs,   suppresses it... as silence falls.\nThe elder Pals stand huddled   together in the dust and we\nsee, nestled behind a boulder   at the roadside, a tiny,\nblue flower -- beautiful and   fragile, but like all things\nalive, determined to live...   and we hear the sound of a\nDOZEN VOICES CHANTING a quiet   mantra in unison as we --\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. ASHRAM - ANOTHER FLOWER - DAY\n</b>This flower floats gently in a bowl of water. The TITLES\nEND as we PULL BACK SLOWLY to reveal a dozen Anglos,\nseveral Indians, and one Kenyan seated cross-legged\nbefore an aging Yogi, who's quietly urging the suppli-\ncants to find \"their light, allow your white light to\nfill your spirit's eye.\" Above, ceiling fans move the\nair.\n<b>                                            (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                    3.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b>As we PAN the group, we see that everyone has his/her\neyes closed in earnest meditation... until we COME TO an\nAmerican, MAX LOEB, 29, who pops open first his right eye\n-- looks to his right and left -- closes his right eye\nand opens his left eye -- looks left and right... and\nthen, instead of continuing the mantra and the search for\nhis white light, expels a stream of air through his\npursed lips, making a vibrating, flatulent sound, one\nindicative of sizeable frustration and dismissal.\n<b>                         MAX\n</b>         Get serious.\nAround him, other single eyes pop open, searching for the\nsource of this unmeditative sound. Max nods and smiles\na wry smile as if to say: This just ain't doin' it for\nme, folks.\n\n<b>INT. SPARTAN ROOM - TRUMPET - DAY\n</b>Max closes the trumpet case and starts chucking his\nclothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise. We\nnotice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his\nneck. His girl friend, BETSY KAHN, overdressed somewhat\nin an Indian style, endeavors to exercise the inner peace\nshe's been pursuing...\n<b>                       BETSY\n</b>         I swear to God, you never give\n         anything enough time!

E.S.T., they\n         do you in    a weekend.\n<b>                       BETSY\n</b>         I would really appreciate it if\n         you wouldn't be terribly glib just\n         now, Max.\nThat's okay with Max, who's willing to eschew communica-\ntion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in\nthe valise.\n<b>                       BETSY\n</b>         Am I to assume you'll be at the\n         airport in Calcutta a week from\n         tomorrow?\n<b>                                           (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                     4.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b><b>                       MAX\n</b>         Impossible to predict, Betsy Ilene\n         Kahn.

He catches her hand hard in his\nfist.\n<b>                       MAX\n</b>         One slap is romantic. Two would\n         call for retaliation... Lend me a\n         hundred dollars.\nShe yanks free, begins to chant her mantra as he grabs\nhis knapsack and valise and goes out the door.  Now,\nshe's silent and, in the simplest sense, deeply hurt.\nShe can't help herself; she cares. We STAY WITH  her\na moment as we --\n<b>                                           DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT. COUNTRY AIRPORT (ASSAM) - WINDING ROAD - DAY\n</b>Cool, lush hills. A little pack of single-engine two-\nand four-seaters. Max, in shorts and University of\nMiami T-shirt, hot, sweaty, appears around a bend in the\napproach road.\n\n<b>INT. AIRPORT - WAITING ROOM\n</b>A small service desk. A CLERK, who doubles as Ground\nControl on the microphone, passing on the prevailing wind\nand the active runway. We hear the STATIC-BACKED VOICE\nof a PILOT, giving his call numbers, then announcing\nhe's clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway.\nThe Clerk CLICKS off and finds Max.\n<b>                                           (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                    5.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b><b>                       MAX\n</b>         How you doin'?\nThe Clerk gives Max a warm smile.\n<b>                       CLERK\n</b>         Hello.\n<b>                       MAX\n</b>         I've always wanted to walk into a\n         little airport just about like\n         this one and ask the guy at the\n         counter the following question.\n         Ready?\n\nThe Clerk nods; he's at Max's ervice.\n<b>                       MAX\n</b>         When's the next flight to anywhere?\n<b>                       CLERK\n</b>         To Bombay. Tomorrow, at one\n         o'clock in the afternoon.\nA beat --- the Clerk with his smile, Max with his, one\nsimply warm, the other giving off simmering heat.\n\n<b>EXT. AIRPORT - LOW ANGLE - DAY\n</b>Max sits on the ground, up against the building, playing\na jazz line quietly and rather well on his trumpet. A\npair of well-shod feet ENTER the FRAME. Max looks up.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nThe rubicund face of VEEJAY CHATTERGEE, 50, and more\nBritish than Churchill. Behind him, his cherubic wife,\nRAVI... and making her way toward the enclave of small\nplanes, their daughter, MANUBAI, 26.\n<b>                       VEEJAY\n</b>         I say, are you looking for a way\n         out of here? We have an extra\n         seat. Where are you wanting to\n         go?\nMax's eyes flick from Veejay to the back view of Manubai\nas she continues on and back to Veejay.\n<b>                       MAX\n</b>         I'm wanting to go wherever you're\n         wanting to take me.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                        6.\n</b><b>INT. 180 FOUR-SEATER - DAY\n</b>Max is crammed into the back seat with the plump Ravi.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>We see now that, contrary to our assumption that Veejay\nwould be in the left seat, it's Manubai who's flying the\nplane. The NOISE of the ENGINE forces them to speak\nsomewhat loudly.\n<b>                       VEEJAY\n</b>         We were among the fortunate back\n         in '48.  We got out of East Bengal\n         before partition destroyed so many.\n         We make mattresses. The Rajah\n         Double Spring.\nVeejay has an old flask out.\n<b>                       VEEJAY\n</b>         We don't have a flight attendant\n         on this flight...\n                (passing the flask)\n         Are you a musician, Mr. Loeb?\n<b>                       MAX\n</b>         Unattached trumpet player and\n         recently-certified associate guru.\nAs he takes a hit   on   the flask, Max's eye focuses on the\nlittle mirror on   the   dash. In it he can see Manubai's\neyes. If we  were   to   judge by what he sees in them, she\ndoesn't find him   the   least bit amusing. He smiles his\nsmile at her.\n\n\n<b>EXT. HOWRAH STATION (CALCUTTA) - DAY (EARLY MORNING)\n</b>A huge bridge dominates the skyline. The train     trundles\nto a stop, its WHISTLE clearing the way. People     hang on\nits sides, sit on the roof... and now flood the    platform,\nflowing into the station, clearing a view for us    of the\nPals, clinging to their baggage in the middle of    this\nhuman anthill.\n\n<b>CLOSE ON THEM (MOVING)\n</b>Hands reach out with sweets to sell, with tea, asking for\nmoney.\n<b>                       MANOOJ\n</b>         Daddy, I'm scared.\n<b>                                              (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                       7.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b><b>                       HASARI\n</b>         Scared? No -- why? This is very\n         exciting. As soon as we get to\n         our friend's house, everything\n         will be fine.\nBut, despite Hasari's charade of confidence, they (and\nwe) are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the\ndesperate energy of the humanity around them. As they\npress on, a small beggar woman huddled on the platform\nturns her eyes eerily on Manooj... as a deformed hand\nstretches INTO the FRAME. Aloka senses someone: A\nbeggar, face half-hidden and eaten away by leprosy. This\nterrifying image presses the boys tightly to their\nmother and moves Hasari to encircle Armita with one hand\nand attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of\nhis other hand. It does not seem possible that he can\nprotect all of them against the predatory eyes watching\nthem. He moves them quickly to a wall...\n<b>                       HASARI\n</b>         Wait right here. Don't move.\n\n<b>WITH HASARI\n</b>He moves to a line of VENDORS, shows a piece of paper to\none, as he digs out his precious screw of money to make a\npurchase of sweets from the Vendor.\n<b>                       HASARI\n</b>         Please, can you direct me to my\n         friend at this address? We are\n         to stay with him.\nThe Vendor gives the address a look, shows it to the\nVendor next to him. Both look at Hasari.\n<b>                       VENDOR #1\n</b>         There's no such address as this in\n         Calcutta.\n<b>                       HASARI\n</b>         But that's not possible.\n<b>                          VENDOR #1\n</b>         Of course    it is possible! I have\n         lived here    all my life. You are\n         new. Who     would know if a place\n         exists or    does not?\n<b>                       VENDOR #2\n</b>         Bombay, perhaps. Delhi.     Look\n         there.\n<b>                                            (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                       8.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b>Dear God, what now? Stunned, Hasari hands Vendor #1 a\nrupee and, with the sweets, turns back to his family, his\nface going through a magical transformation as he\nprepares to suggest to the family that all is well.\n\n<b>EXT. CHOWRINGHEE LANE - DAY (MIDDAY SUN)\n</b>A few clean and cared-for Ambassador cars sweep into the\ngateway of the Grand Hotel, past a gateman.\n<b>                                           RACK FOCUS TO:\n</b>\n<b>FEET - MAIDAN\n</b>\nFeet tramping the pulsating tarmac, sending up dust.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>The Pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by the\ncrowd. They've been walking a long  time. Shambu cries;\nAloka tries to ease his fear. They  stop numbly at the\nedge of the park, put their bundles down against a long\nwall.\nAcross the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette with\na group of traders. There is a deeply fearful look in\nHasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controlling\nnow. He needs to revive the family's confidence. He\ntakes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to\nManooj. Manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema across\nthe street. Hasari indicates a stall just across the\nmain road.\n\n<b>                       HASARI\n</b>         Manooj, go and get some fruit.\n         Come straight back.\nDelighted with his task, Manooj sets off, his eyes on the\nmarquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of\nKumar Kapur, starring in Hot Gun. Hasari calls out to\nhim to watch where he's going; the mere crossing of the\nstreet is a potential parental nightmare. A hand ruffles\nManooj's head and a TALL MAN with dark eyes and a sweet\nsmile comes at the boy's anxious parents.\n<b>                       GANGOOLY (TALL MAN)\n</b>         Yes, hello, brother.

Which,   blessedly,\n         it is.\nAnd now a smile as full as the sky above.\n\n<b>EXT. SMALL BUILDING IN BACK STREET - DAY\n</b>A brick slides out of the wall.\nWe're BEHIND the brick and see Gangooly's soft face as he\nreaches in and pulls out a key.\nThe street is small and empty.  Though the houses are\nnothing much, to the Pals, they look like palaces.\nManooj and Shambu run about in delight. Gangooly motions\nfor quiet. With a flourish, he  opens the door.\n\n\n<b>INT. SMALL ROOM - DAY\n</b>Gangooly enters, glances around, waves the Pals in.\nThey're amazed. There's a cage occupied by two parrots.\nIn one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddess\nLakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind a\ntorn, plastic curtain in a corner, part kitchen, part\nwash place, containing a tap with running water.\n<b>                       GANGOOLY\n</b>         Be free -- look around.\nOn the faces of the family is one thought: Is it\npossible?

One and two...\nHe turns on the tap and a stream of brown WATER GURGLES\nout.

The Goonda has a bruise under one\neye from his altercation in the City of Joy yesterday.\nThe air is filled with the MUFFLED SOUNDS OF the STREET.\nFROM here, we can see the evermore enfeebled godfather\nin his \"throne room,\" wrapped in a cashmere, listening\nto the radio. Ashoka looks up, stares impassively at\nsomeone.\n<b>                            ASHOKA\n</b>            Well.

I have to\n            speak to Mr. Ghatak!\nHasari starts for the house. The Goonda stops him and,\nquickly, has Hasari on his knees, his arm twisted pain-\nfully behind his back. Ashoka jumps at Hasari, grabs\nhis ear.\n<b>                          ASHOKA\n</b>            My father's ill!

GODFATHER'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>The side gate opens and Hasari is shoved   out. Stumbling,\nhe runs to the fence, peers through. Two    men are pulling\nhis rickshaw into the courtyard. Hasari    watches as a\nsteel shutter is pulled down, cutting his   livelihood from\nsight.\n\n<b>ANGLE THROUGH BAR - HASARI\n</b>Numb, compromised, defeated.

Instinctively, Manooj moves to his side, takes\nhold of the rickshaw so Hasari can slip the wheel on.\nHasari nods and goes for the other wheel. Manooj moves\naround to the other side, hefts the carcass. Hasari\nslips on the second wheel. Hasari looks at Max.

He shouts for the kids\nto get out of the way, shoving the kids closest to him\ninto a doorway. He turns to Shambu, who's behind him,\ncalls to him.\nBut in a panic, Shambu doesn't move into the shelter   of\nthe building on his right... but tries to run across   the\nstreet.

Simultaneously, they bend to pick\nit up and bang heads.\n\n<b>LOW ANGLE\n</b>The first   impulse of each is to touch the other's head.\nBut almost   simultaneously, their hands freeze short of\ntouching.
