BIHAR - DAY (DAWN, SUMMER, MID-1980)\nHeat that has mass. That rises off the parched earth in\nshimmering waves. After a moment, we see what appear to\nbe figures coming out of the haze, one by one. A family\nwith their few belongings: HASARI PAL, 33, his wife,\nALOKA, 28, and their children, daughter, AMRITA, 13,\nsons MANOOJ and SHAMBU, 11 and 9; HASARI'S MOTHER and\nFATHER. They embark toward the night, the rising sun\nbehind them.\n\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE - BUS STOP - DAY (DAWN)\nHasari's Father passes a gourd of precious water. Hasari\nserves the children first. Shambu gulps entirely too\nmuch, the others forcing him to stop by a unified force\nof will. Embarrassed, he passes the cup to his brother,\nwho sips, as does his sister. Aloka barely wets her\nlips, insisting on leaving the last drops for Hasari.\nAnd now, a rooster tail of dust rises up behind the\napproaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their\nson's family. There is an intense sadness at leaving\nthe land and Hasari's Mother clings to him...\n                         HASARI\n           I'll send money soon.\nHis Mother nods, as Hasari erupts in a small cough which,\nby habit, he suppresses. His Mother crushes Aloka to\nher.\n                         HASARI'S MOTHER\n           Don't let the children out of your\n           sight. Not for a moment.\nNow the children. She wants to keep them here even as\nthe old man touches her, reminding her she must let them\ngo.\n                         HASARI'S MOTHER\n           Help your parents. Don't fight\n           with each other. And, Manooj,\n           stay away from the cinema, do you\n           hear?\nShambu, his eyes big as saucers, whispers to his\ngrandma...\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                      2.\nCONTINUED:\n                         SHAMBU\n           I don't want to go. There are bad\n           men with long knives who steal\n           children.\nThat does it: Hasari's   Mother dissolves in tears, but\nthe old man nevertheless  unlooses her insistently from\nthe children. Aloka and   the children get on the bus as\nthe old man embraces his  son.\n                         HASARI'S FATHER\n           A man's journey to the end of his\n           obligations is a very long road.\n           Yours begins here.\n\n\nEXT. ROADSIDE/INT. BUS - DAY\nThere's not an empty inch inside the little vehicle or\non top.  The passengers are silent. A woman breast feeds\na baby.  Several passengers fan themselves. Many sleep.\nThe Pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat.\n                         MANOOJ\n                  (to his neighbor)\n           Our farm has died, so we are\n           moving to Calcutta to become rich!\nHasari and Aloka look  at each other: If only it were the\npursuit of wealth and  not survival. The woman under-\nstands. And now the   BUS GRINDS forward and the Pals look\nback. Hasari coughs,   suppresses it... as silence falls.\nThe elder Pals stand huddled   together in the dust and we\nsee, nestled behind a boulder   at the roadside, a tiny,\nblue flower -- beautiful and   fragile, but like all things\nalive, determined to live...   and we hear the sound of a\nDOZEN VOICES CHANTING a quiet   mantra in unison as we --\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. ASHRAM - ANOTHER FLOWER - DAY\nThis flower floats gently in a bowl of water. The TITLES\nEND as we PULL BACK SLOWLY to reveal a dozen Anglos,\nseveral Indians, and one Kenyan seated cross-legged\nbefore an aging Yogi, who's quietly urging the suppli-\ncants to find \"their light, allow your white light to\nfill your spirit's eye.\" Above, ceiling fans move the\nair.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                    3.\nCONTINUED:\nAs we PAN the group, we see that everyone has his/her\neyes closed in earnest meditation... until we COME TO an\nAmerican, MAX LOEB, 29, who pops open first his right eye\n-- looks to his right and left -- closes his right eye\nand opens his left eye -- looks left and right... and\nthen, instead of continuing the mantra and the search for\nhis white light, expels a stream of air through his\npursed lips, making a vibrating, flatulent sound, one\nindicative of sizeable frustration and dismissal.\n                         MAX\n         Get serious.\nAround him, other single eyes pop open, searching for the\nsource of this unmeditative sound. Max nods and smiles\na wry smile as if to say: This just ain't doin' it for\nme, folks.\n\nINT. SPARTAN ROOM - TRUMPET - DAY\nMax closes the trumpet case and starts chucking his\nclothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise. We\nnotice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his\nneck. His girl friend, BETSY KAHN, overdressed somewhat\nin an Indian style, endeavors to exercise the inner peace\nshe's been pursuing...\n                       BETSY\n         I swear to God, you never give\n         anything enough time! What did\n         you expect in five days, Max?\n                          MAX\n         Only what    they promise in the\n         brochure:     Inner peace, serenity,\n         and a nice    chant that gets rid of\n         this rock    in my gut. E.S.T., they\n         do you in    a weekend.\n                       BETSY\n         I would really appreciate it if\n         you wouldn't be terribly glib just\n         now, Max.\nThat's okay with Max, who's willing to eschew communica-\ntion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in\nthe valise.\n                       BETSY\n         Am I to assume you'll be at the\n         airport in Calcutta a week from\n         tomorrow?\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     4.\nCONTINUED:\n                       MAX\n         Impossible to predict, Betsy Ilene\n         Kahn. Maybe you better give me my\n         ticket.\n                       BETSY\n         Screw you, Max -- I paid for it!\n         How many times am I going to let\n         you walk out on me and come back?\n                       MAX\n         I think only you can answer that,\n         Betsy Ilene Kahn.\nShe slaps him.\n\n                       MAX\n         Do you really think that's an\n         appropriate way to get rid of your\n         Western rage, Bets?\nShe swings at him again.   He catches her hand hard in his\nfist.\n                       MAX\n         One slap is romantic. Two would\n         call for retaliation... Lend me a\n         hundred dollars.\nShe yanks free, begins to chant her mantra as he grabs\nhis knapsack and valise and goes out the door.  Now,\nshe's silent and, in the simplest sense, deeply hurt.\nShe can't help herself; she cares. We STAY WITH  her\na moment as we --\n                                           DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT. COUNTRY AIRPORT (ASSAM) - WINDING ROAD - DAY\nCool, lush hills. A little pack of single-engine two-\nand four-seaters. Max, in shorts and University of\nMiami T-shirt, hot, sweaty, appears around a bend in the\napproach road.\n\nINT. AIRPORT - WAITING ROOM\nA small service desk. A CLERK, who doubles as Ground\nControl on the microphone, passing on the prevailing wind\nand the active runway. We hear the STATIC-BACKED VOICE\nof a PILOT, giving his call numbers, then announcing\nhe's clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway.\nThe Clerk CLICKS off and finds Max.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                    5.\nCONTINUED:\n                       MAX\n         How you doin'?\nThe Clerk gives Max a warm smile.\n                       CLERK\n         Hello.\n                       MAX\n         I've always wanted to walk into a\n         little airport just about like\n         this one and ask the guy at the\n         counter the following question.\n         Ready?\n\nThe Clerk nods; he's at Max's ervice.\n                       MAX\n         When's the next flight to anywhere?\n                       CLERK\n         To Bombay. Tomorrow, at one\n         o'clock in the afternoon.\nA beat --- the Clerk with his smile, Max with his, one\nsimply warm, the other giving off simmering heat.\n\nEXT. AIRPORT - LOW ANGLE - DAY\nMax sits on the ground, up against the building, playing\na jazz line quietly and rather well on his trumpet. A\npair of well-shod feet ENTER the FRAME. Max looks up.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe rubicund face of VEEJAY CHATTERGEE, 50, and more\nBritish than Churchill. Behind him, his cherubic wife,\nRAVI... and making her way toward the enclave of small\nplanes, their daughter, MANUBAI, 26.\n                       VEEJAY\n         I say, are you looking for a way\n         out of here? We have an extra\n         seat. Where are you wanting to\n         go?\nMax's eyes flick from Veejay to the back view of Manubai\nas she continues on and back to Veejay.\n                       MAX\n         I'm wanting to go wherever you're\n         wanting to take me.\n\n                                                        6.\nINT. 180 FOUR-SEATER - DAY\nMax is crammed into the back seat with the plump Ravi.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\nWe see now that, contrary to our assumption that Veejay\nwould be in the left seat, it's Manubai who's flying the\nplane. The NOISE of the ENGINE forces them to speak\nsomewhat loudly.\n                       VEEJAY\n         We were among the fortunate back\n         in '48.  We got out of East Bengal\n         before partition destroyed so many.\n         We make mattresses. The Rajah\n         Double Spring.\nVeejay has an old flask out.\n                       VEEJAY\n         We don't have a flight attendant\n         on this flight...\n                (passing the flask)\n         Are you a musician, Mr. Loeb?\n                       MAX\n         Unattached trumpet player and\n         recently-certified associate guru.\nAs he takes a hit   on   the flask, Max's eye focuses on the\nlittle mirror on   the   dash. In it he can see Manubai's\neyes. If we  were   to   judge by what he sees in them, she\ndoesn't find him   the   least bit amusing. He smiles his\nsmile at her.\n\n\nEXT. HOWRAH STATION (CALCUTTA) - DAY (EARLY MORNING)\nA huge bridge dominates the skyline. The train     trundles\nto a stop, its WHISTLE clearing the way. People     hang on\nits sides, sit on the roof... and now flood the    platform,\nflowing into the station, clearing a view for us    of the\nPals, clinging to their baggage in the middle of    this\nhuman anthill.\n\nCLOSE ON THEM (MOVING)\nHands reach out with sweets to sell, with tea, asking for\nmoney.\n                       MANOOJ\n         Daddy, I'm scared.\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       7.\nCONTINUED:\n                       HASARI\n         Scared? No -- why? This is very\n         exciting. As soon as we get to\n         our friend's house, everything\n         will be fine.\nBut, despite Hasari's charade of confidence, they (and\nwe) are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the\ndesperate energy of the humanity around them. As they\npress on, a small beggar woman huddled on the platform\nturns her eyes eerily on Manooj... as a deformed hand\nstretches INTO the FRAME. Aloka senses someone: A\nbeggar, face half-hidden and eaten away by leprosy. This\nterrifying image presses the boys tightly to their\nmother and moves Hasari to encircle Armita with one hand\nand attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of\nhis other hand. It does not seem possible that he can\nprotect all of them against the predatory eyes watching\nthem. He moves them quickly to a wall...\n                       HASARI\n         Wait right here. Don't move.\n\nWITH HASARI\nHe moves to a line of VENDORS, shows a piece of paper to\none, as he digs out his precious screw of money to make a\npurchase of sweets from the Vendor.\n                       HASARI\n         Please, can you direct me to my\n         friend at this address? We are\n         to stay with him.\nThe Vendor gives the address a look, shows it to the\nVendor next to him. Both look at Hasari.\n                       VENDOR #1\n         There's no such address as this in\n         Calcutta.\n                       HASARI\n         But that's not possible.\n                          VENDOR #1\n         Of course    it is possible! I have\n         lived here    all my life. You are\n         new. Who     would know if a place\n         exists or    does not?\n                       VENDOR #2\n         Bombay, perhaps. Delhi.     Look\n         there.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       8.\nCONTINUED:\nDear God, what now? Stunned, Hasari hands Vendor #1 a\nrupee and, with the sweets, turns back to his family, his\nface going through a magical transformation as he\nprepares to suggest to the family that all is well.\n\nEXT. CHOWRINGHEE LANE - DAY (MIDDAY SUN)\nA few clean and cared-for Ambassador cars sweep into the\ngateway of the Grand Hotel, past a gateman.\n                                           RACK FOCUS TO:\n\nFEET - MAIDAN\n\nFeet tramping the pulsating tarmac, sending up dust.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\nThe Pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by the\ncrowd. They've been walking a long  time. Shambu cries;\nAloka tries to ease his fear. They  stop numbly at the\nedge of the park, put their bundles down against a long\nwall.\nAcross the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette with\na group of traders. There is a deeply fearful look in\nHasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controlling\nnow. He needs to revive the family's confidence. He\ntakes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to\nManooj. Manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema across\nthe street. Hasari indicates a stall just across the\nmain road.\n\n                       HASARI\n         Manooj, go and get some fruit.\n         Come straight back.\nDelighted with his task, Manooj sets off, his eyes on the\nmarquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of\nKumar Kapur, starring in Hot Gun. Hasari calls out to\nhim to watch where he's going; the mere crossing of the\nstreet is a potential parental nightmare. A hand ruffles\nManooj's head and a TALL MAN with dark eyes and a sweet\nsmile comes at the boy's anxious parents.\n                       GANGOOLY (TALL MAN)\n         Yes, hello, brother. Bihar, am I\n         correct?\n                       HASARI\n         Yes, how did you know?\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     9.\nCONTINUED:\nHasari is torn between speaking to the man and watching\nhis son's incredible journey across the street.\n                       GANGOOLY\n         Let me say only that the terrible\n         malevolence that has visited your\n         part of the country affects us all.\n                       HASARI\n         Three years without rain. Nothing\n         came out of the earth but debts.\n                       GANGOOLY\n         Terrible. And now, the    family on\n         the street. It is not    acceptable.\n                (smile widens)\n         And if I can't help, my   name is not\n         Mr. Gangooly... Which,   blessedly,\n         it is.\nAnd now a smile as full as the sky above.\n\nEXT. SMALL BUILDING IN BACK STREET - DAY\nA brick slides out of the wall.\nWe're BEHIND the brick and see Gangooly's soft face as he\nreaches in and pulls out a key.\nThe street is small and empty.  Though the houses are\nnothing much, to the Pals, they look like palaces.\nManooj and Shambu run about in delight. Gangooly motions\nfor quiet. With a flourish, he  opens the door.\n\n\nINT. SMALL ROOM - DAY\nGangooly enters, glances around, waves the Pals in.\nThey're amazed. There's a cage occupied by two parrots.\nIn one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddess\nLakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind a\ntorn, plastic curtain in a corner, part kitchen, part\nwash place, containing a tap with running water.\n                       GANGOOLY\n         Be free -- look around.\nOn the faces of the family is one thought: Is it\npossible? Amrita goes right to the parrots.\n                       GANGOOLY\n         They'll need feeding. Give them\n         seed. But don't spoil them.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                      10.\nCONTINUED:\nHe bows briefly before the altar as he moves to the\nwashing area.\n                       GANGOOLY\n         And now, one of the miracles of\n         life in the city. One and two...\nHe turns on the tap and a stream of brown WATER GURGLES\nout. The Pals are hypnotized, the fists around their\nhearts begin to ease.\n                       GANGOOLY\n         Holy water from the Ganges! Flows\n         out forever. Come -- touch it.\n\nManooj and Shambu put their hands under the tap.\n                       GANGOOLY\n         Drink! It's as pure as the dew on\n         Shiva's lips.\nThey drink. Gangooly claps in delight... and beckons\nHasari aside.\n\nFAVORING GANGOOLY AND HASARI\n                       GANGOOLY\n         Now, this place is yours for two\n         weeks. My cousin, Moti, is away,\n         traveling. Normally, the rent\n         takes fifty rupees for a week, but\n         for a brother, forty. No, don't\n         thank me.\nHasari pulls out his little screw of money.\n\n                       HASARI\n         I have only seventy-five, but as\n         soon as I have work...\n                       GANGOOLY\n         Give me the fifty, pay the rest\n         next week. You'll find work, I\n         trust you. Aren't I from Bihar,\n         too?  Yes.\nAnd the money is in his hand.

GUEST ROOM - DAY\nRavi leads the way into a lovely guest bedroom.\n\n                        RAVI\n          I hope this is all right.

There's LAUGHTER from Aloka\nand Amrita. Joyful SHOUTS from the boys. Hasari is\nalone in the main room, on his knees, in front of the\npile of their baggage and bundles. He turns his atten-\ntion from the laughter to a just-opened, old suitcase.\nHe takes out a small tea box. Opens it delicately.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     12.\nCONTINUED:\nIt's full of something brown. He  pushes his fingers in\nand feels this bit of earth with a tenderness that's\nalmost religious, puts a pinch to his nose and breathes\nit in. The LAUGHTER and SHOUTING  from the bathing area\nis GROWING.\n\nINT. BATHING AREA\nShambu is paddling near the tap. Aloka is bending over\nthe drain and Amrita is rinsing her heavy, dark hair\nwith a pot. Manooj is nearby, rubbing himself with an\nold towel. Hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the\ngroup with tenderness... and with gratitude for their\ngood fortune.\n\nA MAN, red with anger, yanks the curtain aside, stares.\nThe family freezes. Aloka's hair drips unnoticed on her\nsari.\n                       MAN\n         What are you doing here?   Who are\n         you?\n                       HASARI\n         My name is Pal, Hasari.

A small crowd has been attracted\nby the noise.\n                       HASARI\n         But this is true. We paid him a\n         deposit of fifty --\n                       BINAL\n         A man goes out because he has to\n         work, and some beggar tries to\n         move in while his back is turned.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                    13.\nCONTINUED:\nThis while Binal has begun to throw things out onto the\nstreet, though this cleansing of his home doesn't stop\nhim from picking up a stick.

They collect\nthe remainder of their possessions and hurry out the\ndoor.\n\nEXT. SMALL STREET - DAY\nFull of neighbors. There's a suppressed violence in the\nair. A man pushes Aloka. Sweat streaming down his face,\nHasari confronts the man. A WOMAN pushes the men apart.\n                       WOMAN\n         Go to the river. Try to squeeze\n         in there.\n\nEXT. VICTORIA MONUMENT - STREET - NIGHT (DUSK)\nCalcutta broiling: Buses, vendors, carts, rickshaws,\nchildren beg at car windows. The Pals stand, uncertain,\nand for the first time a rickshaw fills Hasari's eye,\ncarrying two passengers. But now he shoulders his burden\nand leads the family toward the river. We HOLD until\nthey grow small against the setting sun, gleaming red\nagainst the white domes of the Victoria Monument.\n\nINT. CHATTERGEE'S LIBRARY - TORSO - NIGHT\nMoving through the dark, a figure, touching things,\nlooking at photographs of the Chattergees.

Come with me, we'll\n         wake up the cook, she'll fix you\n         something proper.\n\nEXT.

RIVER BANK - HOWRAH BRIDGE - DAY\nThe bridge etched against the dawn sky. The corpse of\nan indigent is collected and put on a cart.\n\nMANOOJ\nWith his eyes open, watching the dead man being removed.\n\nFAMILY\nAfter their humiliating flight, they found refuge here.\nTiny figures huddled together with their baggage and\nbundles, near a tree, not far from the steps that dip\ndown to the smooth water. Hasari's eyes, too, are on\nthe dead man, that warning. He kneels beside Manooj,\nstrokes him. The boy's eyes turns to the man's,\nwondering if the man can provide for them.\n                       HASARI\n         Don't let it frighten you. You\n         have to be brave. I know we'll\n         find work today.\nFear and doubt fill Manooj's eyes.   He nods.\n\nEXT. DOCKS - DAY\nHasari at the gates, the family huddled together in\nthe b.g.

Hasari\nis on the edge of panic, but when he turns to the family,\nhe's wearing his confident smile. As before, he gathers\nthe family into the protectorate of his arms and guides\nthem onward. As he pushes off into the sea of humanity,\nwe PULL BACK AND UP, FILLING the FRAME WITH street upon\nstreet, disappearing Hasari.\n\nFROM STREET - INTO WORKSHOP - HASARI AND OWNER\nTwo plump men in shirt sleeves look coolly at Hasari.\nThe elder shakes his head. The younger shows Hasari\nthe door.\n\nOutside, an increasingly desperate Hasari finds\nAloka before a small shrine, saying a prayer.\n\nEXT. BARA BAZAR - DAY\nAloka huddled with Manooj and Amrita. Hasari talking\nto the owner of a small market stall. Shambu is peering\ninto a shop with male mannequins in the window.\n\nINT. MEN'S SHOP - MOVING MIRROR\nIn the moving mirror we see counters and shelves of men's\nclothing.\nThe mirror stops at Max slipping into a kurta before an\naudience of Ravi, Manubai, and a salesman.\n                       RAVI\n         It's not extravagant at all. You\n         can't go around all week in your\n         tribal garb.\nMax sees a boy's face pressed to the glass: he indicates\nthe shirt, for the boy's approval. The boy smiles a\nwonderful smile.\n                       RAVI\n         Now he looks civilized, doesn't\n         he, Manubai?\n                        MANUBAI\n         Almost.\nMax looks at her.

We're not beggars.\nShambu is devastated. Out of his own desperation,\nHasari feels he's been a little rough on the boy. He\nholds him close.\n\n                       HASARI\n         Go back to the river. Wait for me\n         by the tree. Don't go anywhere.\n         Do you understand?\nAloka, the boys nod. We WATCH them as Hasari heads\noff, quickly becoming a small figure disappearing into\nthe sea.\n\nEXT. JUTE MILL DAY - LATE AFTERNOON SUN\nStarting to sink.

JUTE MILL - DAY\nA flaking gray wall, half-obscured with moldering files.\nThe grilled window lets in a little light and the quiet\nsupplications of those outside.\nAn old CLERK at a desk. A voice calls out.       The Clerk\nlooks up, crosses to the grill.\nHasari's tense face through the bars. A TRUCK RUMBLES\npast, drowning out the words... except these: \"...trade\nunion.\" The Clerk shakes his head sadly. On the verge\nof panic, Hasari hangs onto the window...\n                       CLERK\n         Do you have family?\n\n                       HASARI\n         Yes, yes of course.

He bends to kiss her. She doesn't\npull away... but after a moment he realizes she isn't\nresponding. He continues the kiss, but he opens his\neyes... to find her staring at him.

How long are you here?\n         Perhaps I could recruit you for --\n                       MAX\n         Forget it. You've got your non-\n         practicing Catholics. I'm a non-\n         practicing doctor.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        34.\nCONTINUED:\n                       JOAN\n         How very distressing.     Why's that?\n                       MAX\n         Found out I just really don't like\n         sick people. Well, I'm outta\n         here. I owe you one.\n                       JOAN\n         I can't imagine ever divining how\n         to collect, but there are a few of\n         us Indians, you know, who believe\n         the tourist trade ought to be\n         encouraged.\n\nMax turns to Hasari. Hasari is incredibly shy, can\nbarely meet Max's eyes.\n                       MAX\n         Thank you very much.     Let me...\nHe goes for his money.\n                         HASARI\n         No, please.\nMax finds his pockets empty. Then reaches for his wrist\n-- his watch is gone -- and then his throat -- his chai\nis gone, too.\n                       JOAN\n         I'm afraid they cleaned you out.\n         Ram, here's your first rider.\n                (to Max)\n         Take this.\n\nShe holds out several rupees toward him.      All eyes on\nthem.\n                       JOAN\n         Go on, it's all right.     You'll owe\n         me two.\n\nEXT. STREET - FLYING FEET - DAY\nMax in the rickshaw, Hasari running alongside Ram, an\nexuberant smile slashed across his face.\n                       HASARI\n         You see, I can keep up.\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                    35.\nCONTINUED:\n                       RAM\n         Keep up, of course. Anyone can\n         run at this pace. But you think\n         it's easy to run and to pull?\n                        HASARI\n         I can do it.   I could pull it.\n                       MAX\n         Come on, give him a shot. He's as\n         fast as you and looks twice as\n         strong.\n                       RAM\n         Will you still pay me when he runs\n         you into a ditch?\n                         MAX\n         Absolutely.    I trust the man.\nSuddenly, Ram comes to a stop.\n                       RAM\n         All right, you, come, step in here.\nHasari looks on Max with enormous gratitude. Ram puts\nthe shafts down, has a short coughing fit, spits some\nphlegm, looks at Max.\n                       MAX\n         I hope you're taking something for\n         that.\nRam waves him off as Hasari lifts the shafts to his hips.\n                       RAM\n         Now, fine, pull, go.\nHasari tries to pull, but the center of gravity isn't\neasy to find. This is enormously difficult and Hasari's\nvery clumsy at it. The street is crowded. The traffic\nis beginning to back up behind them. The driver and\nconductor of the tram let fly a tirade of insults.\n                       RAM\n         See, mister! What did I tell\n         you? Come on! What do you think\n         this is -- some village street?\n         You've got to move quickly.\nHe turns to Max.\n                       RAM\n         You see, it takes a gift.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       36.\nCONTINUED:\n                       MAX\n         I say he can do it. I'll bet you\n         the fare he can do it.\n                (play by play)\n         What do you think, rickshaw fans,\n         can he do it?\nThe crowd isn't in for fun. Hasari strains forward.\nThe rickshaw moves with him. Ram moves alongside,\nshouting instructions and oaths. A cop comes on the run,\nscreaming at Hasai... which makes Ram importune more\nstrongly and Max joke more vociferously.\nEven under this incredible pressue, Hasari gains\nconfidence and begins to move quicker, earning shouts\nof approval from Max and Ram, who now has trouble\nkeeping up as they make their way through the maelstrom,\nan avalanche of oaths following them.\n\nINT. GODFATHER'S HOUSE - DAY\nAt first all we see are feet on a marble floor. The\nGoonda's in his running shoes, then Ram and Hasari's\nbare feet.\nThis is the partitioned splendor of an old house\nsprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past.\nEverything is baroque, rotting and somehow impressive.\nHasari has never been anywhere like this, and is caught\nbetween curiosity and fear of breathing.\n\nINT. \"THRONE ROOM\"\nThe three men enter a large room shuttered from the sun-\nlight -- dusty and packed with a ramshackle assortment\nof furniture. Two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next\nto ambitious plaster portrait of Napolean.\nSitting behind a desk is Ashoka, leaning over a mirror,\nsqueezing a balky pimple.\nNear a large window, his 60-year-old father, GHATAK, in\na European jacket and dhoti, works with intense concen-\ntration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with a\ntwist of fine wire.\nThe three new arrivals stand silent and respectful\nbefore the desk. At last, without raising his head...\n                       ASHOKA\n         Not a tongue between you then?\n                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                    37.\nCONTINUED:\n                       RAM\n         Yes, yes, I am wondering, sir,\n         we are, is it possible you might\n         have something for my friend?\nRam indicates Hasari, as if there might be some question\nto whom he's referring. Ashoka attacks the pimple.\n                       RAM\n         Let me explain it for your ears,\n         sir. My cousin from Bihar has\n         just arrived in our city --\n                       GOONDA\n         They've brought a small present\n         -- of respect.\nThe Goonda places a small bundle of rupees on the desk.\nAshoka allows himself a disinterested glance at\nHasari.\n                       ASHOKA\n         So, you want to be a human horse?\n                       RAM\n         Oh yes! I have personally witnessed\n         his excellence -- yes.\n                       ASHOKA\n         He doesn't talk? Can he neigh at\n         least?\n                (to Hasari)\n         You -- do your ears function?\n                         HASARI\n         Oh yes, Babu.    Can I... uhm...?\n\n                        ASHOKA\n         Neigh!   Like a horse.\nAshoka pulls back his lips, shows his teeth and imitates\na neigh: \"Ne-igh! Ne-igh!\"\n                       HASARI\n         Well, yes, Babu, I can do that.\n         Would you like me to imitate a\n         horse?\nFinished with the pimple, Ashoka wipes a finger on his\nshirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakes\nas...\n\n                                                      38.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nBehind him, The Godfather walks up to the desk, putting\nhis glasses on. He barely glances at his son, but\nwaves him out of the chair.\nAshoka doesn't like it, but he steps aside. As he does,\nhe turns a look of hatred on Hasari. Through no fault of\nhis own, Hasari has made an enemy. Ghatak chews on a pan\nand casts a benevolent eye on Hasari.\n                       GHATAK\n         Lift your longhi.\nHasari does.    The Godfather looks at his legs and thighs.\n                       GHATAK\n         The wise men of our nation say that\n         nirvana is the attainment of a\n         state of supreme detachment. For\n         me, nirvana is counting each\n         evening, one by one, the rupees\n         earned by my two thousand and\n         forty-six rickshaws.\nHasari doesn't know whether to respond. A glance at\nRam tells him not to. Ghatak gestures for Hasari to\nlower his longhi.\n                       GHATAK\n         You are with family?\n                       HASARI\n         I have a wife and three children,\n         Babu.\n                       GHATAK\n         And they must eat, heh. The\n         world is full of open mouths.\nHe chews on this a moment, then opens a drawer... and\nholds a small, tinkling rickshaw bell toward Hasari.\nHasari understands that, incredibly, he has a job. His\nbreath is so shallow, he can barely utter his gratitude.\nHe takes the bell.\n                       HASARI\n         I shall be eternally grateful to\n         you. From now on, I shall be as\n         the youngest of your brothers.\n                       GHATAK\n         Stay loyal. These days, it's a\n         crop nobody plants.\nThe Godfather turns his beatific and Godlike smile on\nHasari Pal.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     39.\nEXT. MATTRESS SIGN - DAY (EARLY EVENING)\nTransitor MUSIC. The Pals load the rickshaw that stands\nat the road with Ram in it. There are embraces with the\nbruised Arun and his family.\n\nEXT. SQUARE - NIGHT (EARLY EVENING)\nWe hear the BELL TINKLING as the rickshaw, pulled by\nHasari, carrying Ram and Aloka (holding Shambu) arrives\n(Amrita and Manooj trotting beside their father). Surya,\nSelima, other neighbors greet them as they come. The\nPals glance into the school at Joan, who's teaching\nan evening class.\n\n\nWITH PALS\nReverentially, they follow Ram inside as Joan watches.\n\nINT. RAM'S HUT - NIGHT\nA door opens. Moonlight. Faces peer through the door.\nRam lights an oil lamp. In the glow, the family looks\naround their tiny space. Hardly able to suppress smiles.\n                          HASARI\n            Someone has blessed us. A job, a\n            roof, a school. Soon I'll be able\n            to send money home...\n                   (looking at Amrita)\n            ... and put away a little bit for\n            your dowry.\nIn their excitement, the boys run.\n\n\nOUTSIDE\nand up to the roof, under the stars.

SQUARE AND STREET (CITY OF JOY) - DAY\nAbout twenty tattered street kids faces shining with en-\njoyment. They run and shout as they pursue something\njust out of frame.\n\nWIDE SHOT\nThe cause of the excitement is Hasari running TOWARD us,\nfeet flying, as he pulls the rickshaw, loaded with a huge\nsack. Manooj and Shambu are clinging to the sides of the\nmachine.\nRam stands   in the center of the square. He shouts a\ncommand and   Hasari struggles to bring the rickshaw to a\nstop. It's    not easy and Sunil -- who's arriving -- has to\njump out of   the way to the accompaniment of apologies from\nHasari and   Ram and hoots of laughter from the children.\nOutside the clinic, a line of perhaps seventy-five wait\npatiently, watching as Hasari takes off again. The wheels\nof the rickshaw hit a rut. Hasari loses control, the sack\ntips back and Hasari is lifted into the air, feet kicking\nas he tries to regain his balance. Aloka and Amrita,\nsitting near the bawling Ram, can't hold back their\nlaughter.\n\nEXT. SQUARE - HIGH ANGLE - DAY\nThe square is set with obstacles. As Ram shouts instruc-\ntion, we see Hasari negotiate them with much increased\nskill. He stops in front of a small group. It's his\nfamily, plus Joan and Surya. With an exhausted smile, he\nsigns to Aloka and Amrita to get in. They do, and Hasari\ntakes them triumphantly around the circuit.\n\nHIGH ANGLE\nHasari's triumphant ride continues and we:\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. PARK STREET - DAY\nHasari rubs the moonstone in his ring on the shafts, then\ntouches his heart and his forehead. A SCHOOL GIRL in\nuniform, approaches the rickshaw stand. We also see\nseveral other pullers, Rassoul, Chomotkar, Ramatullah.\n                          SCHOOL GIRL\n            Rickshaw wallah!\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     41.\nCONTINUED:\n                       RAM\n         Let Hasari go!\nThe line of rickshaw pullers  turns to Hasari. The other\npullers wish him well as he  comes forward. His heart\npounds; ever so politely, he  helps the School Girl into\nhis carriage. She gives him   the address of the St. Pius\nSchool.\n                       HASARI\n         I'm sorry, I don't know where that\n         is. You're my very first passenger.\n                        SCHOOL GIRL\n         Really.   Well, I hope I bring you\n         luck.\nShe gives him a sweet smile.\n                       SCHOOL GIRL\n         That way, and then to the right.\nHis moment has arrived. He looks at Ram... and thrusts\nhis hips forward, setting off into the insanity of the\ntraffic, eyes flicking left and right. A HORN RAILS at\nhim and a taxi tries to run him down, calling and laugh-\ning as Hasari jumps in terror.\n                       RAM\n                (calling)\n         Feed the police!\nOther pullers laugh,  call after Hasari... and as he\napproaches the first  corner, he manages to pull out a\nrupee and deposit it  into the hand of the impassive\ntraffic policeman and  then turn right.\n\n\nEXT. ST. PIUS - DAY\nThe School Girl hands him a slip of paper.\n                       SCHOOL GIRL\n         This is my home address. Pick me\n         up promptly at seven each morning.\n                       HASARI\n         Yes, thank you, you can depend on\n         me.\nThe girl runs into the school  yard, met immediately by\nfriends. Hasari looks around   at the clean, bustling\nschool, at all the children in  their crisp uniforms and\na look of great yearning comes  over his face.\n\n                                                       42.\nINT. SMALL RESTAURANT - DAY\nMax is trying to explain to the waiter what he wants.\n                       MAX\n         Beef. You know -- cow? Minced,\n         little salt, pepper, slap it flat\n         like this, throw it on the grill,\n         flip it.\nNow, though, he just glimpses the shiny gas tank and\nengine of a motorcycle around the hip of the waiter.\nHe leans out.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nAshoka, astride his motorcycle, GUNNING the ENGINE as a\nboy runs out of a store with an armload of cassettes.\n\nWITH MAX AND WAITER\n                       MAX\n         Put it on the grill, I'll be right\n         back.\n\nWITH ASHOKA\nHe pulls the boy's ear, REVS the ENGINE to go... and\nsenses someone close. He turns to find an American\nhovering at his shoulder.\n                       MAX\n         You know, I have to say you\n         really don't look Jewish. I\n         believe that's mine.\n\nHe reaches for the necklace with the Hebrew letter.\nAshoka recognizes Max. Looks around for help. There is\nnone.\n                       ASHOKA\n         Don't touch me. No one touches me.\n                       MAX\n         Really?\nMax grabs Ashoka... who breaks free, and GUNS the CYCLE\ndown a side street. Max gives chase, his aching ribs\nslowing him a bit.\n\n                                                        43.\nSEVERAL CUTS\nAshoka, glancing back, begins to open up some distance.\nYet, Max hangs tough, weaving like a broken field runner\nthrough the mass of bodies and vehicles. Now, suddenly,\nhe loses Ashoka. He has to make a choice about this\ncorner or that one. He chooses.\n\nEXT. CITY OF JOY - AROUND CORNER - DAY (EARLY EVENING)\nA COP steps into his path.   He sees Ashoka up ahead.    He's\nhopelessly out of breath.\n                       MAX\n         Oh... great... good...good timing\n         ...him!\n\nHe can't talk and breathe. He points desperately. The\nCop glances where Max points, but he makes no move to\ngive chase.\n                       COP\n         May I see your passport?\n                       MAX\n         Passport?

Max\nstarts around the Cop. The Cop, however, sticks his club\nin Max's face; there's fire in Max's eyes... but a hand\ntakes the Cop's stick before Max can make a big mistake.\n\n                                                       44.\nANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING OWNER OF HAND\nThe girls with the cricket equipment (and Margareta,\nthe teacher).

SQUARE (CITY OF JOY) - TEA SHOP - DAY (DUSK)\nSurya plays his zither. Max and Joan sit at a table.

HUT - NIGHT\nThe only light is the feeble waver from a candle. The\nblind Meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground. Her\nragged sari is pulled up to her middle.

Anouar pours tea from a pot on\nthe small fire, offers the cup to Hasari. Hasari stares\nat the cup, doesn't want to be impolite, but more than\nthat, doesn't want to touch the cup. He shakes his head,\nsmiles. Anouar drinks off the tea.\n\nINSIDE\nSweat pours down Max's face into his eyes. He shakes it\nout.

Shambu holds a match to it.\nEveryone watches as if this were a major event. Manooj\ntakes a puff, chokes, offers the cigar to Mehboub, who\ntakes it, puffs, passes it.

CITY OF JOY - DAY\n\nAloka comes TOWARD us leading a group of lepers.     And\nstops. Her hand goes to her mouth.\n\nTHEIR POV - CLINIC - FROM DISTANCE\nTwo hundred normal people lined up outside the gaily be-\ndecked dispensary -- many mothers with small children in\ntheir arms. Shanta sees Aloka, gestures to indicate the\nincredible turn-out.

Behind the thugs a short distance is the\npoliceman who harassed Max earlier and another cop.\nJoan hurries forward.\n                       GOONDA\n         Good morning, Sister to the poor.\n                       JOAN\n         Yes, Mr. Bhose?\n\n                       GOONDA\n         Those people aren't coming into\n         this neighborhood.\n                       JOAN\n         They are going to be treated at\n         the dispensary.

Said growls and pushes\nforward. Several thugs turn, step in to neutralize him.\nJoan elbows the Goonda and tires to westle free of him.\nAs a reflex he raises his hand. And as he does, it's\nseized.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\nMax (with Hasari in the b.g., confused, conficted).   Max\nslings the Goonda against the side of a truck.\n                       GOONDA\n         That was a mistake, Doctor.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                      79.\nCONTINUED:\n                       MAX\n         The mistake's yours, putz.\n                (to Aloka)\n         Get these people inside.\nAloka starts forward, leading the lepers. She's stopped\nby a sudden blow from the Goonda's stick across her\nshoulders, knocking her to the ground, bleeding from the\nneck.\nHasari bolts for his wife, gets caught up in the melee.\nMax swings   around on the Goonda and for the first time we\nrealize how   strong he is, and that he knows how to box.\nThe Goonda   goes down and violence erupts. Anouar is\nchopping at   the legs of one of the thugs working on Said.\nThe massive   Said tears free and starts to beat the crap\nout of the   two thugs holding him.\nThe noise brings everyone out of the square, those lined\nup at the clinic, the children from the school.\nSunil comes flying out of the clinic.\nA stampede of those waiting outside the dispensary and\nthose normally in the crowded alley ensues. Shanta runs\ninside for help. Shopkeepers barricade their shop\nwindows.\nOne of the thugs pours gasoline over Anouar and  lights a\nmatch. Hasari kneels beside Aloka when he sees   the\nmatch ignite the tiny leper. Without thinking,   Hasari\nhurls himself on top of Anouar, rolling him in  the dirt\nand against his own body to put out the flames.\nJoan shouts, demanding the violence stop. She's hit\nfrom behind; she decides talk isn't going to do it. She\ngrabs a piece of lumber and starts to fight.\n\nANGLE ON DISPENSARY\nAn EXPLOSION in the doorway, scattering anyone who remains\nin the area of the dispensary doorway, badly wounding\nMehboub.\nMore people with sticks. Hasari goes down under    several\nbodies. Max reaches Aloka, helps her up, sends    her toward\nthe clinic. He tears an attacker off of Hasari    and they\nfight back to back a moment. A SECOND EXPLOSION    near\nthem... and through the smoke Max sees...\n\n                                                      80.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nAshoka astride his motorcycle, behind his dark glasses,\nwith more thugs, these with Molotov cocktails and pick-\naxes, ready to raze the clinic and school and the\nsurrounding neighborhood.\nSunil drags Mehboub inside.\nPeople chant: \"White Monkeys, go home! White Monkeys,\ngo home! No lepers here! No lepers here!\" The thugs\ncock their iron bars and bricks and Molotov cocktails.\nMax picks up an iron bar of his own and starts for\nAshoka. Suddenly, there's a DETONATION followed by a\nBLAST of air so fierce, Max is thrown to the ground.\nA bottle of GASOLINE has EXPLODED just behind him. He's\nenveloped in smoke.\n\nAn assailant bears down on Joan with a cutlass. As the\nassailant is about to strike, Hasari seizes the attacker\nand hurls him backward. Ashish steps in and slashes the\nassailant with his own weapon, startling, even repelling\nHasari.\nFrom all over   the lane, young fighters have come and joined\nthe fray, not   bothering to choose sides but merely enjoying\nthe release.    Hasari lunges for a woman under attack by a\nboy, arriving   too late to stop the boy from plunging his\nknife into the   woman's belly. Hasari fights his way to\nthe woman, but   she staggers into the mob.\nMax knocks down one of the thugs only to have  another hand\ngrasp his shoulder. He turns, fist cocked to   find Poomina,\nher hands holding her face together. Slowly,   she takes\nhands away. The sides of her face have been   laid open.\nMax sweeps her up in his arms, heads for the  clinic.\n                       MAX\n         Oh, little girl, little girl...\nJoan is suddenly beside Ashoka.\n                       JOAN\n         We'll pay!

EXAMINING ROOM - MAX, ALOKA, POOMINA\nMax, blood crusted on her face, sutures Poomina's awful\nfacial wound as Aloka prepares a compress.\n                       ALOKA\n         Will she...

The Goonda is slouched near the table, smoking\na cigarette and fiddling with a thin switch. (It's dif-\nficult for him to show Ashoka the respect his inherited\nposition gives him.) The Goonda has a bruise under one\neye from his altercation in the City of Joy yesterday.\nThe air is filled with the MUFFLED SOUNDS OF the STREET.\nFROM here, we can see the evermore enfeebled godfather\nin his \"throne room,\" wrapped in a cashmere, listening\nto the radio.

CLINIC - COURTYARD - DAY\nThe street children's school now takes up two rooms.\nChildren peer out of one room now as, to the accompani-\nment of Surya's zither, twenty or so girls are doing some\nIndian classical dancing, under the eye of a young Indian\nteacher.\nAcross the way, in the other room, some children are\ntranslating Bengali words into English. A boy is writing\non the board. It's Manooj. We see that Shambu is in the\nsame class.\n\nINT. EXAMINING ROOM\nFROM BEHIND, we watch Max take a wrapping off of\nPoomina's wound, Joan assisting him. Indeed, Ashoka\nextended Poomina's smile on either side of her mouth.\nThe scars are healing as nicely as could be expected.\nMax did a fine job.\n                       MAX\n         You must have had a good doctor.\n         Still no running, jumping, picking\n         up anything heavy. And you stay\n         here. You're going to help Sister\n         Joan and you're going to school.\n         Do you understand?\nA beat, Poomina nods.    But now a look of abject fear\ncomes over her face.\nThe Goonda stands in the doorway. Max begins singing\n\"Sweet Little Sixteen.\" The Goodna stares impassively\nat Max.\n                       THE GOONDA\n         Time to collect the rent, Sister.\n\n                          JOAN\n         Of course.     Come with me, please.\nJoan leaves, followed by The Goonda. Max works care-\nfully at the fine line of scabbing on Poomina's scar...\nbut then something takes his attention.\n\nACROSS THE COURTYARD\nManooj, with a small tin of food, looks this way and\nthat... and then sneaks into the shed.\n\nEXT. SHED - DAY\nWe hear a, TAP, TAP, TAP. The door is half open. The\npadlock is hanging on its chain. Max opens the door.\n\n                                                       97.\nINT. STORAGE ROOM\nStartled, frightened, Hasari presses himself against the\nwall, as does Manooj. Hasari is wearing a wet dhoti,\ncaught in the middle of straightening the wheel rim of\nthe old rickshaw.\n                       HASARI\n         Close the door!\nMax is very surprised but, needless to say, pleased.      He\nlooks at the rickshaw, looks at Hasari.\n                       HASARI\n         Close the door. The Godfather\n         has more eyes than a pineapple.\n\nMax quickly closes the door. The half light is broken\nby thin beams of light that dance with dust.\nHasari studies Max a moment, then moves to put the first\nwheel on. Instinctively, Manooj moves to his side, takes\nhold of the rickshaw so Hasari can slip the wheel on.\nHasari nods and goes for the other wheel. Manooj moves\naround to the other side, hefts the carcass. Hasari\nslips on the second wheel. Hasari looks at Max. Max\nbrings his hands together and starts to go.\n                       HASARI\n         I was saying to Manooj that if a\n         man bows down too many times,\n         there will come a day when he will\n         no longer be able to stand upright.\nThe two men look at each other... and then Hasari gets\non with his work.\n                       MAX\n         I promised Manooj and Shambu I'd\n         take them to the movies. Is it\n         all right?\n                       HASARI\n                (a beat)\n         If a man makes a promise...\nMax brins his hands together and starts for the door.\nHasari picks up one of the worn seat boards.\n\nINT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT\nWe're TRACKING WITH a moving bag of peanuts behind a row\nof boy's heads. On the screen in front of them, a \"medi-\neval era\" sword battle between the great Kumar Kapur and\na legion of bad guys.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       98.\nCONTINUED:\nWe hear the sound of CRACKING NUTS as we MOVE FROM Manooj\nto three kids we've seen in the neighborhood (two boys\nManooj's age and Shoba, who's Shambu's age) and then to\nShambu, each kid dipping into the bag in his turn.\nFinally: Max's (and on the other side of him, Amrita\nand Poomina.) The bag arrives... empty.\n                       MAX\n                (whispering)\n         Thanks, guys. Who wants to go for\n         more peanuts?\nNo one. We're talking about rapt attention.   We hear\nNUTS CRACKING. Max smiles.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - NEAR CITY OF JOY - NIGHT\nMax and the boys walking home after the movie, the boys\ndancing around each other, acting out the fight sequences,\nall of the sword-fighting against Max, who battles them\nall over the street, in and around cars, Poomina and Amrita\nlooking on shyly, as El Max fights to save their honor.\n                       MANOOJ\n         I can't decide if I want to be\n         Kumar Kapur or a doctor.\n                       MAX\n         Ha ha! You can be both! Manooj\n         Pal, swashbuckling physician!\n                       MANOOJ\n         You're so much fun, El Max. I\n         wish my daddy were as much fun as\n         you.\n\nMax stops the fight, takes Manooj by the shoulders.\n                       MAX\n         I wish my father loved me like\n         your father loves you. Your dad's\n         a very special man. And now, en\n         garde!\nAs the battle continues, the bright beams of a truck\ncome at them.\n                       MAX\n         Time out, men. Off the street\n         till this truck passes.\n                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       99.\nCONTINUED:\nThe kids move toward the wall of the building they're\npassing, but the truck seems to turn toward them, seem-\ning not to intend to pass, but to hit them.\nThe look on Max's face lets us know he senses something\nterrible is in the offing here. He shouts for the kids\nto get out of the way, shoving the kids closest to him\ninto a doorway. He turns to Shambu, who's behind him,\ncalls to him.\nBut in a panic, Shambu doesn't move into the shelter   of\nthe building on his right... but tries to run across   the\nstreet. Max leaps for the little boy too late... as    the\ntruck just misses Max and clips Shambu hard, sending   the\nlittle boy flying.\n\n\nEXT. SQUARE - NIGHT\nManooj runs   ahead of everyone as he charges into Ram's\nhut, crying   for his father. Behind Manooj come the\nothers, Max   carrying Shambu in his arms. Hasari and\nAloka, Ram,   Joan, others in the square hurtle out of\ntheir huts.\n                       MAX\n         I can't do anything here. He's\n         got a compound fracture, he\n         hemorrhaging. We've got to get\n         to a hospital -- now!\n                       JOAN\n         You'll never get a taxi at this\n         hour.\n\n\nEXT STREET - HASARI'S FEET - DAY (EARLY EVENING)\nHe pounds along,  the wheels wobbling and squeaking,\nurging people out  of his way. Max runs alongside Hasari.\nAloka sits on the  seat with Shambu, whose quiet moaning\nfills her ears.   Blood drips down the rickshaw.\n\nEXT. PARK STREET - FROM THE RICKSHAW - DAY\nSeveral taxis waiting for clients outside a row of\nrestaurants. Hasari and Aloka watch as Max argues with\nthe drivers. They won't take a bleeding passenger.\n\nSAME STREET - MOMENTS LATER\nThe race to the hospital continues.\n\n                                                       100.\nEXT. MEDWAR PINE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT\nThe arrive at the gates of the huge, Victorian hospital.\nPeople sleep outside the gates.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - SIDE ROOM - DAY\nThe wards are full, as are the corridors. Patients on\nbeds and stretchers everywhere. Most have at least one\nmember of their family to look over them. In a side\nroom, Max is arguing with a porter who tells him he can't\nhelp him.  Max slaps some rupees into the porter's hand,\ntells him to take him to the person in charge.\nShambu is fading. Aloka smooths the sweat from his brow,\ntrying to keep Shambu alive by force of will and love.\nThen Max is back, standing over her with another man. It\nmay take a moment before we recognize the ATTENDANT from\nthe Blood Bank.\n                          MAX\n            They'll admit him, but we have to\n            pay for the blood. I gave him all\n            I had. He wants more. Do you have\n            anything?\n                          ALOKA\n            Sister Joan gave me this.\nAloka holds out a fistful of rupees. The Attendant blows\nthrough his lips, indicating it's a paltry sum. Max\ngrabs the money and shoves it at the Attendant.\n                          MAX\n            We haven't got any more!\nThe Attendant doesn't move... until he sees Max is about\nto explode.\n                          MAX\n            If this child dies while you\n            stand here, I'll kill you.\nThe Attendant is smart enough not to push any further.\n                          MAX\n            Now, I need an X-ray room and I\n            need an O.R. nurse.\n                          ATTENDANT\n            Not possible. You can't give\n            care, you're an American. You\n            must be an Indian doctor.\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       101.\nCONTINUED:\n                       MAX\n         Then take me to one!\nAs Max takes flight with the Attendant, Aloka strokes\nShambu and Hasari hovers. We CLOSE IN ON Shambu's\ninanimate face and HOLD a moment.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\nMax hurtles down the corridor with a young INTERN in\ntow. Almost a kid, he's been up for days. But he's\ngoing to help.\n                       INTERN\n         This way, please.\nMax scoops Shambu up and rushes down the corridor behind\nthe Intern, leaving Hasari and Aloka looking after him.\nHis arm comes around her shoulders.\n\nEXT. HOSPTIAL - DAY (DAWN)\nHasari and Aloka wait.   People are starting to move about.\n                       HASARI\n         You're my wife, Aloka, you and my\n         children are all my wealth. But\n         if Max Daddah and Big Sister Joan\n         have need of you, you may go to\n         them.\nMax comes out of the hospital.   The two Pals stare at\nhim.\n\n                       MAX\n         We pinned his leg. Couple of\n         months, he'll be better than\n         ever. They want to keep him\n         today. We're a good team.\n         Gimme five.\nHe smiles, holds out a palm for them to slap. They\nlook at the palm, unsure what this means. Yet, each\ntakes Max's hand.\nEXT.

SHED - CLOSE ON TWO PAINTBRUSHES - NIGHT\ndip into a little box of paints. The boys look on as the\ntwo men paint an intricate design on the shafts. Shambu\nsits in the rickshaw seat. He wears an ankle to hip\ncast. Manooj is spelling words and urging Shambu to\nfollow suit. Aloka is putting out a tray of food. Ram,\nRamatullah, and Chomotkar slip in, quickly close the\ndoor.

MAX'S ROOM - NIGHT (SEVERAL HOURS LATER)\nA thin stream of dawn light coming through the half-\nclosed shutters.\n\n\nFROM HERE - THE BALCONY\nThrough the open door, we can just see Joan, praying\nquietly. Close around her, Anouar, Meeta, Surya, Marga-\nreta, Poomina...\n\nTHE ROOM\nBeneath \"The Raft of the Medusa,\" Hasari Pal speaks to\nhis family and Max, Aloka sitting close to the bed, the\nChildren on the bed beside their father, and Max standing\nclose.\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     128.\nCONTINUED:\n                        HASARI\n          A man's journey to the end of his\n          obligations is a very long road.\n          And you have to remember that you\n          can never give up. We pray that\n          life will bless us, that we will\n          be kings, with possessions and\n          money that we can rule over all\n          around us. But it's a mist; the\n          only thing that makes it possible\n          to endure life is our love, one\n          for the other.\nA beat, the family and Max tightly bound together.   And\nnow we hear the dim sounds of RICKSHAW BELLS.\n\n                        HASARI\n          I was dreaming the sound of\n          rickshaw bells, and now I hear\n          them.\nMax opens the windows.   Manooj helps his father sit up.\n\nCOURTYARD - THEIR POV\nOutside, there are rickshaw pullers filling the courtyard\nand spilling out into the street. When the window opens,\nall the Pullers start ringing their bells and the room is\nfull of their music.\n                        HASARI\n          Are they here for me?\nUnquestionably, they are.\n\n                        HASARI\n          A city so big. When we arrived,\n          we didn't have a place to live, a\n          friend.\nHe smiles.\n\nOUTSIDE\nThe many hands with their ringing bells.\n\nCLOSE ON WINDOW\nThe tiny figure of Shambu joins Max in the window.   Max\nbends close.\n                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     129.\nCONTINUED:\n                       SHAMBU\n                (whispering)\n         Is my father going to die?\nMax makes the same sound he made in the ashram at the\nbeginning of the movie, though this sound of dismissal\ndifferent.\n                        MAX\n         Get serious.\n\nINT. RAM'S HUT - HASARI'S FACE - DAY\nHasari mirrors Max's expression of dismissal!\n\n                       HASARI\n         Get serious! I've agreed to the\n         bicycle, I've agreed to the 1000\n         rupees! I can go no further. I\n         have nothing more to give!\n\nOUTSIDE THE HUT\nEveryone crowded around the door. From within, we DIMLY\nHEAR the negotiations continue. Max approaches from the\nclinic. Shambu slips down the steps from above as...\n                       MAX\n         How's it going?\n                       RAM\n         All that stands between them now\n         is the ounce of gold.

She said my wife writes\n         that irrigation has come to our\n         village.\n                       MAX\n         But that's great.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        130.\nCONTINUED:\n                          RAM\n            But it means I should go home to\n            my wife.\n                          MAX\n            I thought that's why we've been\n            writing all these letters.\n                          RAM\n            Yes, of course, I love her from\n            here, yes; but, what if I go home\n            and find I don't love her from\n            there.\nShambu takes him by the hand and tugs him quickly to the\nedge of the tea shop. The little boy indicates Max\nshould bend close. Max leans down.\n                          SHAMBU\n            Daddy needs gold, right?\nMax nods.    And Shambu brings his fist up from under the\ntable.\n\nCLOSE ON SHAMBU'S HAND\nHe opens his hand to disclose what he scooped off the\nground during the fight: Max's necklace and Hebrew\nletter.\n                          SHAMBU\n            Do you think this is pretend gold\n            or real?\n\n\nMAX AND SHAMBU\nMax stares at the little boy's hopeful face.\n\nINT. PAL'S ROOM - FLOWER\nWe see the fully blossomed flower in the tea caddy and\nthen Hasari's fingers come INTO THE FRAME. He carefully\nsnips the flower free of its stalk.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\nAmrita is dressed in the beautiful sari her father bought\nher. Father and daughter are alone. He hands her the\nflower and adjusts her veil tenderly.\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                      131.\nCONTINUED:\n                       HASARI\n         You never did belong to me. You\n         were only lent to me by God until\n         you marry and continue the wheel\n         of life.\nAmrita stares at her loving father and slowly her arms\ncome up around his neck, the flower against his curved\nback. Tears fill Hasari's eyes, but a smile graces his\nlips.\n\nEXT. SQUARE - DAY - EARLY EVENING\nThe procession to the courtyard begins when a BRASS BAND\nstrikes up, accompanied by singing and shouting. Tiny\nlights have been strung over the street. We see Max and\nManubai. Margareta and a group of children. Joan with\nPoomina. Anour, Meeta, Said. Everyone who's become part\nof the family is present.\n\nEXT. CLINIC COURTYARD - DAY (DUSK)\nThe procession arrives and enters. Smoke from the chu-\nlas. Light from a half dozen lamps.\nSubash and his procession make their entrance. A ritual\nveil is fixed to Subash's face. The Pujari waves for\nHasari to come to his place. Hasari turns to Max.\n                       HASARI\n         I would be pleased if you would\n         stand with me in the place of\n         honor to the right of my daughter.\n\nDeeply touched, Max nods... and the two men step for-\nward... as Subash is motioned forward by the Pujari.\nSubash sits beside Amrita.\n\nTHE CEREMONY\nA flame. The    shyness of bride and groom as the ceremony\nproceeds with   the winding of the red thread. Hasari\nlooks on with   unspeakable pride, Max beside him. We see\nthe faces of   all our family again: Aloka, Manooj and\nShambu, Joan,   Poomina, Surya, Selima, Aristotle John,\netc.\n\n                                                      132.\nTHE WHEEL\nTurning. As Amrita and Subash, joined by the thread,\ncircle the flame... as we PULL BACK AND UP. Now we see\nthe clinic and school and the surrounding area, the\nalleys full of people and activity. As we continue to\nPULL BACK, we see the entirety of the City of Joy and\nthen beyond -- Calcutta, its teeming streets -- life con-\ntinuing as the sun sets against an infinite sky and we\nROLL END CREDITS.\n                                          FADE OUT.\n\n\n                        THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nCity of Joy\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Gerald Brach\u00a0\u00a0Roland Joffe\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:38.495738"}
