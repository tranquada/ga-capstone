Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and        \r\n    has an air of maturity about her.\r\n\r\n                        LAUREN\r\n              Gabby, stop...you're never going to                      \r\n              fit all this in... you can come                          \r\n              back for the rest tomorrow.\r\n\r\n                        GABBY                                          \r\n              I can't come back t---\r\n\r\n    Gabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt        \r\n    and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down\r\n    the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest.                \r\n                        GABBY                                          \r\n              Oh, God...that's all my clothes.\r\n\r\n                        HARLEY\r\n                  (sets the suitcase down as\r\n                   he sees an SUV heading to\r\n                   the house)\r\n                        (MORE)\r\n                                                           6.\r\n                    HARLEY(cont'd)\r\n          Okay, your Mom is home.

THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY                             7    \r\n    This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling\r\n    BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in\r\n    Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au          \r\n    chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get\r\n    in.\r\n\r\n    A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving\r\n    between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and           \r\n    friendly.\r\n\r\n    Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside\r\n    the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with\r\n    powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-\r\n    through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.\r\n\r\n                        JANE\r\n              Reynaldo...\r\n                  (nods to the muffins)\r\n\r\n                        REYNALDO\r\n              Too much sugar.\r\n\r\n                        JANE\r\n              Little bit.                                              \r\n    Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.                          \r\n    Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.\r\n    Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of\r\n    coffee with lids.\r\n\r\n                        JANE\r\n              Who wants coffee while they're\r\n              waiting?\r\n\r\n    Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.\r\n\r\n    JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n    refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.               \r\n                        JANE\r\n                  (quietly to a Young                                  \r\n                   Employee)\r\n              Check on table five, will you?                           \r\n                                                             10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on         \r\n    the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos         \r\n    when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.       \r\n                        JANE\r\n                  (all smiles)                                         \r\n              Peter!\r\n\r\n    PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam        \r\n    is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's                \r\n    something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor.

He notices.\r\n\r\n                    JAKE\r\n              (indicating his belly)\r\n          See what happens when you're not\r\n          looking out for me.\r\n              (pats it)\r\n          She lets me eat everything.. pasta,\r\n          cream cheese...\r\n\r\n                    JANE\r\n          Can you hand me my robe?\r\n\r\nJake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her.   She indicates\r\nJake should turn around.\r\n\r\n                    JAKE\r\n          Why do I have to..?\r\n                                                 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JANE\r\n          -- Because the last time you saw me\r\n          standing up naked I was in my\r\n          forties.\r\n              (Jake can't believe this)\r\n          Things look different lying down.\r\n          Just...\r\n\r\nJake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.\r\n\r\n                    JAKE\r\n          You've gotten a little nuts.\r\n\r\n                    JANE\r\n              (slipping into her robe)\r\n          Jake, I think it would be really\r\n          good for us to not talk for a few\r\n          days.

I'd say our\r\n          problems actually went away.\r\n\r\n                    JANE                               \r\n          What..?                                      \r\n                    JAKE                               \r\n          Didn't you always say you felt you\r\n          weren't being heard? Wasn't that\r\n          our big issue -- both of us always\r\n          feeling rejected and unappreciated.\r\n          Look at us now. You're so much\r\n          more together, you're not exhausted\r\n          all the time, you're not catering\r\n          every weekend and busy all day with\r\n          the kids and I'm calmer, less\r\n          obsessed about work. I'm a partner.\r\n          I'm there. We grew into the people           \r\n          we wanted each other to be! And I            \r\n          don't know...

They're totally into         \r\n     it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends         \r\n     and The Beach Boys \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" begins. Jake              \r\n     follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby      \r\n     on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her.\r\n     Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their            \r\n     parents.\r\n\r\n                         LAUREN\r\n               They must be hammered.\r\n\r\n                         HARLEY\r\n               Or something like that.\r\n\r\n     Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake.\r\n\r\n                         ADAM\r\n                   (to Agness)\r\n               Sweetest divorced couple in the\r\n               world..!\r\n\r\n     Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n                   (spotting Adam)\r\n               Hey..!\r\n                   (to Jake)\r\n               Jake, I'm gonna....                                      \r\n     Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little\r\n     as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice\r\n     Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks        \r\n     from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look\r\n     back at Jake again.\r\n\r\n     Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away.\r\n     Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n90   INT.
