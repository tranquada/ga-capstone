Staggered, Pollux falls --\n\n     Castor catches him before he hits the floor --\n     simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter.\n\n     Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar.\n\n     Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his\n     anger building.

Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to\n     dive off.  The forklift careens on -- driving apart the\n     brothers.\n\n     The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning\n     Pollux.

He\n     draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on.\n\n     Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy\n     movements mirroring Castor's.\n\n     Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze\n     trying to penetrate the darkness...

He FIRES -- Archer dives away.\n     The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two\n     huge turbine engines.

Dubov drops another over the catwalk.\n\n     They continue their desperate race for the door --\n     reaching the landing.  As BULLETS PING around them --\n     hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel.

The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's\n     craft.\n\n     Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other.  EXPLOSION!\n     Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the\n     water.\n\n     The boat lands right next to Castor's.\n\n     Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching\n     a --\n\n\n<b>     TUG\n</b>\n     pulling a barge.\n\n     Castor forces Archer into its path.

Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which\n<b>     EXPLODES.\n</b>\n\n<b>     CASTOR\n</b>\n     swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off.\n\n     Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip.\n\n     But the boat hits a wave...\n\n     Castor loses the gun -- which skids away.  Archer slips,\n     his head hanging over the side.  Castor tries to ram\n     Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time.\n\n     Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it.  WHUNK!  It sinks\n     into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around\n     his neck.\n\n     As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts\n     Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain.\n     Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water.\n\n     Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds\n     toward --\n\n\n<b>     PIER\n</b>\n     Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT\n     BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings.

You're right, I won't shoot\n               you.  Not in the face anyway.\n\n     BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!  He jerks and\n     reels -- dropping to his knees.  He looks at Archer in\n     total disbelief.  Then he sinks to the ground and lies\n     still.\n\n     Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop.  Then he turns\n     and sees an FBI chopper heading his way.  Relieved, he\n     turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone!\n\n     Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning\n     stabilizing screw.  Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the\n     leg.  He buckles... but keeps going.\n\n     Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to\n     bury his face on the spinning blade.\n\n<b>                             CASTOR\n</b>               It'll never be over, Jon... every\n               time you look in the mirror...\n               you'll see my face...\n\n     They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer,\n     closer -- slicing into \"Archer's\" cheek.  At the last\n     instant...\n\n     Archer reaches the anchor-chain.  He wraps it around the\n     screw -- stopping the whirling blades.\n\n     Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer\n     moves.\n\n     Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his\n     wedding ring.  Just when he almost has it off -- Castor\n     suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight.\n\n     Eye contact between the two men.  Castor smirks, his\n     grasp slackening... as he finally fades away.  Archer\n     lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own\n     finger.\n\n\n<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\n     The chopper lands.
