Young Edward ducks between trees,\n               under branches, not stopping for anything, GASPING for\n               breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him.

He looks out the back\n                windshield. A few cars back, Pinkerton's taxi follows them.\n          \n                Carnby takes a burlap sack out of his trench-coat pocket.\n                Inside the sack is a stone carving of a demonic-looking head.\n          \n          \n          \n                                                                  (CONTINUED)\n          \n                \n          \n                                                                            6.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          The edges are soft, worn-down, the detail roughed away.

The taxi's GRIND against one another.\n          \n               Carnby's taxi SCREECHES around a corner, speeding into a side\n               street that leads to the Market Street.\n          \n              \n          \n                                                                            7.\n          \n          \n          \n                EXT.

The momentum pushes Carnby's taxi around\n                sideways.\n          \n                Pinkerton's taxi then SLAMS Carnby's sideways taxi into a\n                parked car with a CRUSH of metal and SHATTERING glass.\n          \n                There's a moment as Carnby, trapped inside the CRUSHED taxi\n                and Pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure,\n                exchange a look. Pinkerton's expression is fierce.\n          \n                Pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to\n                smash into Carnby's taxi again.\n          \n                The Cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. His\n                face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. The Cabbie\n                struggles to get loose.\n          \n                                      CABBIE\n                            I'm trapped, man!\n          \n                                      CARNBY\n                            I'll draw him away...\n          \n                As Pinkerton's taxi backs up, it CRASHES into a Van driving\n                by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents\n                of the Van onto the street.\n          \n                This gives Carnby the brief moment he needs to extract\n                himself from the crushed taxi. He wrenches himself out the\n                window, just in time to see Pinkerton's taxi accelerating\n                towards him.\n          \n                Carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped\n                Cabbie.\n          \n                Pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for\n                the running Carnby. Pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him.\n          \n          \n                                                                  (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                            8.\n                CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n                Carnby leaps out of the way as Pinkerton's taxi CRASHES into\n                the side of a Building, narrowly missing him. Pinkerton's\n                taxi is CRUMPLED in a CRASH of metal and glass.\n          \n                Carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the\n                building. With fluid grace, Carnby rolls to safety, landing\n                on his feet. With a quick look back over his shoulder at\n                Pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, Carnby runs.\n          \n                Pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the\n                crash. He looks around, but can't see Carnby anywhere on the\n                street.\n          \n                Pinkerton runs for an iron-wrought staircase that leads up to\n                a Pedestrian Bridge that hangs over the Street.\n          \n                At the top of the Pedestrian Bridge, Pinkerton looks up and\n                down the street.\n          \n                He spots Carnby, running through the crowd of Pedestrians.\n          \n                Pinkerton leaps off the Pedestrian Bridge, arcing through the\n                air with superhuman force.\n          \n                Pinkerton TACKLES the running Carnby to the ground, SLAMMING\n                into him with a tremendous impact.\n          \n                But Carnby is quick. He takes the hit and spins Pinkerton\n                around with a martial-arts kick. The kick sends Pinkerton\n                CRASHING through the front window of a Bakery.\n          \n                INT.

He grabs Carnby's head\n                and SMASHES it against the floor once, then twice.\n          \n                Pinkerton tears open Carnby's trench-coat. He pulls out the\n                burlap sack. He opens the sack, confirming the stone carving\n                is inside it.\n          \n                While Pinkerton inspects the stone carving, Carnby's hand\n                quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them.\n          \n                Carnby SMASHES the glass jar over Pinkerton's face.\n          \n                He grabs the stone carving out of Pinkerton's hand, scrambles\n                to his feet, and runs.\n          \n                EXT.

It is.\n          \n                Carnby stops, sensing something.\n          \n                In one fluid motion, Carnby suddenly spins, turning in the\n                other direction and FIRING the gun.\n          \n                We follow the bullet as it rockets through the Ice Factory.\n                It WHIZZES along, until we see Carnby's intended target.\n          \n                Pinkerton comes through the Ice Factory, running at Carnby.\n                The bullet flies directly at him.\n          \n                The bullet hits Pinkerton in the shoulder. But it only seems\n                to anger Pinkerton further. He keeps running at Carnby.\n          \n          \n          \n                                                                    (CONTINUED)\n          \n            \n          \n               CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n               Pinkerton leaps at Carnby. Carnby FIRES again. But Pinkerton\n               dodges the bullet and it hits a block of ice, SHATTERING it\n               in a hail of ice shards.\n          \n               Pinkerton rolls with his dodge and races off into the stacks\n               of ice blocks.\n          \n               Carnby tries to track Pinkerton's movements through the ice\n               stacks. He hears the sound of Pinkerton MOVING, but can't see\n               him. His gun is ready. He searches around.\n          \n               Suddenly, there's a RUSH of movement behind him. Carnby\n               dodges just as Pinkerton's fist comes flying out. Pinkerton\n               connects with an ice block, SHATTERING it.\n          \n               Carnby is backed into a dead end in the Ice Factory. He turns\n               to face Pinkerton, gun ready.\n          \n               But Pinkerton is on him too quickly. He lunges at Carnby,\n               hoisting him over his head and SLAMMING him down on a\n               conveyer belt.\n          \n               Pinkerton drags Carnby along the conveyer belt. But Carnby\n               grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. With a quick kick,\n               Carnby uses the momentum to flip Pinkerton over him.\n          \n               Pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick\n               wedged into the wall. The sharp point of the ice pick punches\n               right through Pinkerton's torso, impaling him. He is\n               immediately killed.\n          \n               Carnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. He pulls\n               the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. In the\n               fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces.\n          \n               But the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a\n               small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving.\n          \n               The artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom,\n               its thick round side engraved with intricate Abkani symbols.\n               This is the lynchpin artifact, the piece which connects the\n               other artifacts together.\n          \n                SCENES 14, 15, AND 16 OMITTED \n          \n               EXT.

But the Female\n          Orphans has disappeared.\n          \n          Aline runs over to Carnby.

The other two are from the\n                    orphanage as well.\n          \n          Carnby pumps the shotgun. Carnby and Aline creep forward into\n          the darkness of the Loft.

But\n          John keeps coming, SLAMMING him against the wall. Carnby\n          breaks John's hold and swivel-kicks him out of the way. John\n          skitters off into the shadows.\n          \n          The Female Orphan leaps out at Aline, trying to tear into her\n          with her teeth.\n          \n          Carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for\n          Aline.\n          \n          The Male Orphan lunges out at Carnby. He SMASHES the Male\n          Orphan across the face with the pipe.\n          \n          Aline struggles with the Female Orphan. Carnby turns to see\n          John rising up behind her, about to strike.\n          C\n           arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the\n          chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead.\n          \n          The Male Orphan jumps out at Carnby. Now working on instinct,\n          Carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him.\n          The Male Orphan stumbles to the ground and dies.\n          \n          Aline gets away from the Female Orphan. As the Female Orphan\n          lunges at her again, Aline FIRES, shooting her three times in\n          the chest.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n          \n                    \n          \n          \n                                                                             62.\n          CONTINUED: (3)\n          \n          \n          But it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the Female\n          Orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down.

The Orphans are fast and deadly,\n          but they have no organization.
