He was in\n     the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking\n     down rather than up at the color he had always felt was\n     nature's finest.\n\n     Swimming pools.  Hundreds of them.  Pockmarking the landscape\n     like miniature lakes.  A flat landscape of straight streets\n     and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite\n     green enough.\n\n     As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven\n     or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been\n     public ones.  Here everyone had their own.  Marvellous.\n\n     There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had\n     enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour\n     bus.  And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to\n     once or twice when he was younger.  He was most familiar,\n     though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time\n     in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years\n     -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in\n     a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of\n     his daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     WHOOSH!

A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.  He\n     wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before.\n     After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.  Or seen\n     cops wearing guns on their belts.  Or black cops, for that\n     matter, with guns on their belts.  Or seen people as fat as\n     Americans on their home turf.

The one he has his eye on.  The\n     target.  It's across the street.  A kind of flat windowless\n     warehouse with adjoining loading yard.  Loading yard\n     surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire.\n\n     The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to\n     this building.  Safely around the corner.  And how he might\n     practically get back to it, either this same way or via a\n     more circuitous route round another block.\n\n     The sense you get in downtown L.A. on a lazy Saturday\n     afternoon that you're in a ghost town.  Particularly in this\n     shabby kind of industrial section.\n\n     <u>EXT. THE BUILDING.</u>\n\n     Wilson crosses over to it now.  From sunny to shade.\n\n     Walks past the chain-link fence.  The padlocked gate, big\n     enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within\n     the compound.\n\n     Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be\n     the building's main entrance.\n\n     Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as\n     well.\n\n     Comes around this block again.  Looking surreptitiously around\n     now.  Streets here utterly deserted.  Not even a passing car.\n     Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH\n     MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a\n     direct view on the loading yard fence on this side.  Wilson\n     nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.  One of\n     the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.  Snaps his\n     wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.  Wire cutters.\n\n     He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have\n     thought.  He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the\n     fence meets the adjoining building.  SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP,\n     SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face\n     grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each\n     application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he\n     knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll\n     under.  Whole thing accomplished in seconds.\n\n<b>     LOADING YARD\n</b>\n     Walks fast to the cover of the trucks.  Passes.  Looks\n     around.  Cement loading docks and bays.  Shuttered doors.  He\n     jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal.  Listens awhile.\n\n<b>     WILSON\n</b>\n     Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything.\n     Then cocks an ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP to show us\n     what he hears:  an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away.  Which\n     means someone must be inside.\n\n     Wilson looks back at his entry options.  Not the loading\n     doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a\n     conventional lock his eye zeroes in on.  Gets out his tools,\n     going over.\n\n     <u>INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY.</u>\n\n     A SCRATCHING at the door.  It opens.  He's in.\n\n     Waits.  Cautious.  Nothing.  He starts along the hallway.\n\n     <u>INT.

The Meat Puppets move a little in\n     anticipation.  Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's\n     going to leave.\n\n<b>                         SUPERVISOR\n</b>               Jesus, you really want your ass kicked,\n               don't you?\n\n     He pushes Wilson again, hard.\n\n<b>                         SUPERVISOR\n</b>               Go on, get outta here.\n\n     He pushes Wilson again.

She advances slowly, not entirely\n     sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do.\n     At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at\n     the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine.  He looks\n     her up and down, more from reflex than anything.\n\n     She continues on.  Eventually she emerges through sliding\n     glass doors and on to a patio.\n\n<b>     HER POV\n</b>\n     A figure by the pool, talking on the phone.  His back to us.\n     The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed.\n\n<b>     ADHARA\n</b>\n     Approaches, then sits beside him.

Casually scanning them as he passes slowly\n     by, he's caught up short by one.\n\n<b>     POV\n</b>\n     A framed photo of JENNY, his daughter.\n\n<b>     WILSON\n</b>\n     A series of emotions play over his face.

Perhaps he\n     even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around.\n     He notices a video camera on a tripod, a cord running to the\n     television.

What Wilson can't belleve when he SEES\n     it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a\n     high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon.  On the other\n     side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less\n     than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss.\n\n                         WILSON (cont'd)\n                   (jumps back with only slightly\n                    affected vertigo)\n               Flipping heck.\n\n     Ed, a little more accustomed to L.A. architecture, nods in\n     agreement.\n\n<b>                         ED\n</b>               If you could afford a house like this you\n               would buy a house like this.\n\n     Wilson edges forward to the rail again.\n\n<b>                         WILSON\n</b>               What are we standing on?\n\n<b>                         ED\n</b>               Faith.\n\n     They stand there looking out.

About to speak.\n\n     But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.  In\n     quick succession:  Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering his\n     nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for\n     leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over\n     the railing!\n\n     It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they\n     probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp what\n     they saw.\n\n     <u>INT.

But intellectually younger.\n     Physically, much bigger.  The man is huge.  Nevertheless, the\n     safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise.

Falls.\n\n     Lands on the crumpled, dead body of LARRY, the bodyguard, who\n     was thrown off the cliff.  Valentine recoils.  When Wilson\n     appears, Valentine FIRES at him.  A wild shot that only makes\n     Wilson duck momentarily.  Valentine scrambles to his feet,\n     runs on.\n\n<b>     WILSON\n</b>\n     Jumps down from the steps.

Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the\n     point at the other end.  But he can't see very far ahead.\n     And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely\n     difficult.  He tries to scramble over some rocks.  They're\n     wet, slippery.  He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an\n     ankle.\n\n<b>     WILSON\n</b>\n     A dark figure.  Coming into focus.  Walking inexorably this\n     way.\n\n<b>     VALENTINE\n</b>\n     Painfully rights himself.  A small bone protrudes from his\n     broken ankle.  He FIRES at Wilson, gun in one hand, other\n     hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it.  Doing his best\n     to aim.  But the SHOTS miss their mark.\n\n<b>     WILSON\n</b>\n     Steadily coming.\n\n<b>     VALENTINE\n</b>\n     Out of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.
