WET STREET - A GRAY TRANS AM\n</b>\nTUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by\nslowly heads down the residential street, cruises past\nthe Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The\nmusic stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car.\n\nThey move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in\nhand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger\nhurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the\ncar, another man methodically waits.\n\n<b>INT.

Next to a digital clock that reads\n3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side.\n\nA poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.\nPre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes\nscattered on his tiny desk. A stereo in the corner.\n\nThe off-screen sound of breaking glass grabs Danny's\nattention. He sits up and looks through the blinds.\n\n<b>EXT.

He then walks towards the car and fires shot\nafter shot at it until it disappears.\n\n<b>INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - DARKNESS\n</b>\nDavina and Doris Vinyard yell in the background like they\nwere in Vietnam. They meet in the hallway, still not\nable to place the direction of the gunfire.\n\n<b>DAVINA\n</b>\n<b>MOM!!!!\n</b>\n<b>                 DORIS\n</b><b>STAY DOWN, HONEY!

Middle-aged\nwith slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a\nthought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly\nreaches for a file.\n\n<b>RASMUSSEN\n</b>All right. Moving on--\n(acknowledging)\nGood Morning, Doctor.\n\nThe group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare.\n\n<b>                 SWEENEY\n</b>Good morning.\n\n<b>          RASMUSSEN\n</b>Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney.\nHe's Principal over at Venice High and\nfor some time now he's done a load of\noutreach work with gangs...in and out\nof the can.\n\nSweeney nods as Rasmussen cough.

Very few, if any. It was\nmostly just black and Mexican. But it\nwas tiny. They hit it off though...\nand Alexander hit the jackpot with\nDerek.\n\nRasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.\n\n<b>          RASMUSSEN\n</b>We got some uncut footage here.\nCourtesy of NBC.\n\n<b>ON THE TELEVISION--\n</b>\n<b>          REPORTER\n</b>Earlier this evening...LA County\nFirefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot\nand killed while putting out a fire in\na suspected Compton drug den.\n\n<b>          RASMUSSEN\n</b>       (to the group)\nThis being February of '90.\n\n<b>EXT.

And he got killed by some drug\ndealer who still collects a fucking\nwelfare check.\n\nDerek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER\nDORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as\nhe puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside\ntheir Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to\nthe reporter who just stands there, speechless.\n\n<b>INT.
