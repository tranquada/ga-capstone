Danny continues to skate ahead of him.\nSensing danger, Derek looks back behind him. With no one\nin sight, he walks into a doughnut shop.\n\nINT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DEREK'S POV\n\nHe takes a guarded look outside. Everything seems\nnormal. A bus drives by. A group of Mexican laborers,\ndressed for work and smiling, walk past in the other\ndirection.\n\nInside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a\nshort Korean.man behind the counter. Her young daughter\ngrabs her leg. Danny sits down and reads Derek's paper.\n\n                 DEREK\nWhat do you want?\n\n              DANNY\nMaple bar and a...large milk.\n\nDerek smiles at the little girl while he waits.

Derek smiles.\n\n         BLACK MOTHER\n         (staring at Derek)\nCome here, Tisha.\n\nTisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit. Derek\nwatches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they\nmake their way down the street.\n\nOutside, a BLUE FORD screeches out front. Rasmussen and\nthe Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and\nwait. Dr. Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk\ninside.\n\n                 DEREK\nWhat's goin' on?\n\n              SWEENEY\nWe need to talk, Derek.\n\n              DEREK\nHow'd you find out I was here?\n\n              SWEENEY\nWe were just at your apartment.\n\n          RASMUSSEN\nCammeron and Seth are in the ICU at\nSt. Johns, Derek.

Okay?\n\nDerek senses the danger in his voice.\n\n       SWEENEY\nOkay?  Before it explodes.\n\nSweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.\n\n                 SWEENEY\nAnd watch your back.\n\nDerek nods.\n\n          SWEENEY\n(back to Danny)\nYou showing up today?\n\nDanny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes.\n\nSWEENEY\n\nGood.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

Derek wants to say one\nthing but something else comes out.\n\n              DEREK\nI'll see you at home.\n\nDanny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear\nphones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother\nthrough the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy\nand they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns\nand walks down the street.\n\n          COP #1\nYou need a lift anywhere?\n\nDEREK\nNope.\n\nDerek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence,\nand stares at the school.\n\nINT.

Henry?\n\nTHE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol.\nIt discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest.\nHe SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The\nforce of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two\nkids who just entered bolt for help.\n\nDanny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The\ntwo stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED\nPAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass\nis raking his lungs.\n\n              LITTLE HENRY\n         (terrified)\nDanny?\n\nDanny's breathing slows to a choked whisper.  He blinks,\ncoughs, twitches.
