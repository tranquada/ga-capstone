They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for\n          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting\n          it is to meet a real live German war hero.

Very advantageous for marksmen.\n\n<b>          SHOSANNA\n</b>          How many Russian's did you kill?\n\n<b>          FREDRICK\n</b>          Sixty-eight.\n\n<b>          (BEAT)\n</b>          The first day.

Thirty-two, the third day.\n          On the forth day, they exited the city.\n          Naturally my war story received alot of\n          attention in Germany, that's why they\n          all recognize me. They call me the\n          German Sgt.York.\n\n<b>          SHOSANNA\n</b>          Maybe they'll make a film about\n          your exploits.\n\n<b>          FREDRICK\n</b>          Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels\n          thought. So he did. It's called \"Nation's\n          Pride\", and guess what, they wanted me to\n          play myself, so I did. They have posters\n          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's\n          another reason for all the attention.\n\n<b>          SHOSANNA\n</b>          \"Nation's Pride\" is about you? \"Nation's\n          Pride\" is starring you?\n\n<b>          FREDRICK\n</b>          I know, comical, huh?\n\n<b>          SHOSANNA\n</b>          Not so comical.

Goebbels wants the\n          film to premier in Paris, so I've been\n          helping them in the planning.\n          Joseph is very keen on this film.\n          He's telling anybody who will listen,\n          when \"Nation's Pride\" is released,\n          I'll be the German Van Johnson.\n          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.\n          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't\n          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as \"Joseph\",\n          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side\n          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital \"T\", and\n          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.\n          She abruptly rises, and says;\n\n<b>          SHOSANNA\n</b>          Well, good luck with your premier\n          Private.
