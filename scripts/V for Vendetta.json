Guy Fawkes, a dangerous\n          man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow\n          stacked with barrels of gunpowder.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to\n                    blow up the Houses of Parliament.\n          \n          The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the\n          cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of\n          dogs.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    He was caught in the cellars with\n                    enough gunpowder to level most of\n                    London.\n          \n          Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as\n          the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens\n          of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    Sometimes I wonder where we would\n                    be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder\n                    if it would have mattered.\n          \n          In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    I suppose the answer is in the\n                    rhyme.  More than the man, what we\n                    must remember is the plot itself.\n          \n          The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He\n          looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,\n          staring up at him.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    For in the plot we find more than\n                    just a man, we find the idea of\n                    that man, the spirit of that man,\n                    and that is what we must never\n                    forget.\n          \n          The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling\n          down her face.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    This, then, is the story of that\n                    idea, of that spirit that began\n                    with an anarchist's plot four\n                    hundred years ago.\n          \n          Guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red\n          morning sun.\n          \n                                                          FADE OUT.\n          \n          FADE IN:\n          \n          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE\n          \n          A young Evey sits on her father's lap, combing her Barbie's\n          hair.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    I was born near the end of the\n                    millennium, the year 1997.  My\n                    father used to say that people were\n                    so afraid that the world was going\n                    to end that they were willing it to\n                    happen.\n          \n          Her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch,\n          watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is\n          bad.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    I don't remember much of the\n                    century's turn.  I don't remember\n                    the market crash or the plague or\n                    any of the Trafalgar riots.\n          \n          The television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers\n          fighting in a shelled city.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    I've read about them since but I\n                    don't recall how any of them\n                    impacted my life except for the\n                    fear.  They would hide it from me,\n                    like a secret between them.\n          \n          Little Evey sees her father staring at her mother.  They\n          take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    But I could feel it.\n          \n          EXT.  CITY STREET\n          \n          It is a new day.  People are gathered along the street as if\n          they were waiting for a parade.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    Of the chaos that seemed to swallow\n                    the beginning of the 21st century,\n                    there is one thing I do remember.\n          \n          Evey holds her father's hand.  Unable to see what is coming,\n          she can hear it.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    Very clearly, I can remember that\n                    sound.\n          \n          We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    And I remember those boots, black\n                    leather that gleamed bright in the\n                    morning sun.  I had never seen such\n                    boots.  All moving in perfect\n                    unison.\n          \n          Little Evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her\n          father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with\n          military precision.\n          \n          EXT.  CITY STREET\n          \n          In the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party\n          calling itself Norsefire, we find little Evey now on her\n          father's shoulders.\n          \n          Dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.\n          \n                              DASCOMBE\n                    The time has come, London, to\n                    return to a bygone age, an age of\n                    tradition, an age of values that\n                    have been disparaged and all but\n                    forgotten.  What this country needs\n                    is a leader!  A true leader to\n                    remind us of that age.  A righteous\n                    leader with the strength of his\n                    moral convictions to do what must\n                    be done.  I give you that man!  I\n                    give you our leader!  Adam Susan!\n          \n          Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.  Evey's father looks\n          at her mother and again they clasp hands.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    It must have seemed so easy to\n                    them.  They offered such a simple\n                    deal; give up control and we will\n                    restore order.\n          \n          INT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE\n          \n          Little Evey is asleep in her bedroom.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    At first, the arrests were\n                    political.  Dissidents.  Radicals. \n                    Liberals.\n          \n          A loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    When my parents were younger, they\n                    had been activists.  They had\n                    marched with Labor in the great\n                    train strike.\n          \n          The sound of heavy boots swarms through the house.\n          \n                              LITTLE EVEY\n                    Mommy?\n          \n          Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier\n          scoops her up.\n          \n          She is carried through the dark house which is filled with\n          soldiers.  On the floor of the living room, she sees her\n          parents being bound with plastic zip-ties.\n          \n                              MOTHER\n                    My daughter!

Evey!\n          \n                              LITTLE EVEY\n                    Mommy!  Daddy!\n          \n          A heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parent's heads\n          as Evey is carried out of the house.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    I never saw them again.  Overnight,\n                    my life, my entire world was\n                    erased.\n          \n          INT.  BATHROOM\n          \n          A nun with a switch in her crossed arms watches as Evey and\n          several other little girls scrub the floor of a dormitory\n          bathroom.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    It was done so quickly and\n                    violently, so completely, that it\n                    began to seem that it had never\n                    even existed.\n          \n          A tear rolls down Little Evey's cheek.\n          \n          EXT.  HOUSE\n          \n          A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home. \n          Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    The homosexuals were next.  What\n                    God had started with AIDS had to be\n                    finished by man.  It was God's\n                    work.  That's what we were told.\n          \n          He reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and\n          bloody.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    But once they were gone, there was\n                    someone else.  Someone different.\n          \n          In another neighborhood, we see the police arresting\n          Pakistanis.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    Someone dangerous.\n          \n          In a different area, young black men are packed into a caged\n          van so tightly they are unable to move.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    There were those who understood\n                    what was happening, who knew it was\n                    wrong but who kept silent.\n          \n          A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls\n          away.  When he looks up, another man in a military uniform\n          whose name is Almond is watching him.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    And in the vacuum of that silence,\n                    order was imposed.\n          \n          Finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.\n          \n          EXT.  STREET\n          \n          Again, we see the marching boots.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    Order that was like those boots,\n                    order that required rigorous\n                    discipline.  Order that is exactly\n                    the same, where each single step\n                    falls with every step.  The order\n                    of the many shaped into one.\n          \n          We move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall\n          where a poster has been plastered up.

We also\n                    are currently monitoring a lot of\n                    phone surveillance indicating a\n                    high percentage of conversation\n                    concerned with the explosions.

These\n                    appear to be individually weighted\n                    flares and we have found traces of\n                    the same chemicals at both of the\n                    detonation sites which leads us to\n                    conclude that, despite a level of\n                    sophistication, these devices are\n                    all home-made with over the counter\n                    chemicals, making them impossible\n                    to trace.

The\n                    smile was still the same. \n                    It made me want to tear it off so I\n                    could see the face, so I could see\n                    that he was dead.\n          \n          Her fingers stop.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    But I had promised.\n          \n                              V (V.O.)\n                    You will discover the face under\n                    this mask but you will never look\n                    beneath it.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    I began to try to imagine his face. \n                    Of course, I had long pictured my\n                    father behind that smile but I knew\n                    in my heart that V was not my\n                    father.\n          \n          Evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    Yet every time I pictured another\n                    face, any face, something was lost,\n                    something important was somehow\n                    diminished.  V was more than a\n                    face.  V was V.\n          \n          Her expression changes.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    And then, quite suddenly, quite\n                    naturally, I realized whose face\n                    must be beneath that mask.  It was\n                    the only face that mattered.\n          \n                              EVEY\n                    I won't let you die.\n          \n                              V (V.O.)\n                    I know you won't... I know.\n          \n          A small smile creeps across her face.\n          \n          EXT.  CITY STREET\n          \n          Midnight approaches and the crowd feels it.  Spilling\n          everywhere, they fill the streets like a flood.\n          \n          INT.  TRAIN CAR\n          \n          Evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V.  He is\n          lying on a bed made of gelignite, covered in roses.\n          \n          Touching his mask, she bends over him.\n          \n                              EVEY\n                    Goodbye, my love.\n          \n          Tenderly, she presses her lips to the smile, her eyes\n          closing, her final tears blinking free.\n          \n          She backs away and V smiles, his lips wet with her kiss, his\n          cheek wet with her tears.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    \"Ave Atque vale.\"\n          \n          On the train platform, Evey reaches through the window and\n          starts the train.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    I looked it up the next morning.\n          \n          The wheels churn as the train lurches forward.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    \"Hail and farewell.\"\n          \n                              V (V.O.)\n                    \"Make them remember...\"\n          \n          She watches the train disappear into the tunnel.\n          \n                              EVEY\n                    They will, my love.

CITY STREET\n          \n          The crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out\n          across the city echoing through the megaphone on every\n          corner.\n          \n                              EVEY (V.O.)\n                    \"Remember, remember, the fifth of\n                    November!\"\n          \n          High above the gathered mass, a masked figure steps out onto\n          a roof parapet.\n          \n          The crowd explodes.\n          \n          INT.
