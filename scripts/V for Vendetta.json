The\n                    smile was still the same. \n                    It made me want to tear it off so I\n                    could see the face, so I could see\n                    that he was dead.\n<b>          \n</b>          Her fingers stop.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)\n</b>                    But I had promised.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              V (V.O.)\n</b>                    You will discover the face under\n                    this mask but you will never look\n                    beneath it.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)\n</b>                    I began to try to imagine his face. \n                    Of course, I had long pictured my\n                    father behind that smile but I knew\n                    in my heart that V was not my\n                    father.\n<b>          \n</b>          Evey stares into the eyes, the dark, empty eyes.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              EVEY (V.O.)\n</b>                    Yet every time I pictured another\n                    face, any face, something was lost,\n                    something important was somehow\n                    diminished.

It was\n                    the only face that mattered.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              EVEY\n</b>                    I won't let you die.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              V (V.O.)\n</b>                    I know you won't...
