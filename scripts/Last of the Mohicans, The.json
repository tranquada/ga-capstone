It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some \n\tdistant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of \n\tsunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The \n\twhisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant \n\trustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. \n\tWe're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. \n\n\tSUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT\n\t\n\trockets through the frame scaring us and ... \n\n\tEXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE\n\trunning hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's \n\ttwenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later \n\tthis man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. \n\n\tPROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS\n\n\tflash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A \n\tcalico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads \n\tover a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled \n\ttomahawk is stuffed in his belt. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - MASSIVE WAR CLUB - DAY\n\n\tin the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... \n\t\n\tCHEST\n\n\tA green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over \n\this left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is \n\tshaved into a scalp-lock. It says: \"Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you \n\tcan ...\" That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK.\n\n\tThe French call him \"Le Gros Serpent,\" the Great Snake, because \n\t\"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly \n\tblow.\" \n\n\tWIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\truns, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel \n\tto Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's \n\tvery little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate \n\tmotes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes \n\tthere's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. \n\tThese men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into \n\travines as if they own them. They do. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY\n\n\trocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a \n\twampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is \n\tcarved the name \"Killdeer\" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. \n\tHis name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and \tthe French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other \n\tfrontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes \n\tknow him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree \n\tbranches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN\n\n\ttwo hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... \n\n\tSUDDENLY HE STOPS\n\n\tKilldeer's at his shoulder ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S THUMB\n\n\tcocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tstops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tslips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this \n\tan ambush? \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT\n\n\tFive feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, \n\toff target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver. \n\n\tKILLDEER'S TRIGGER\n\n\ttighter ... \n\n\tTHE COCK\n\n\tholding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the \n\tpan of priming powder which flashes and ... \n\n\tTAN\n\tis a huge elk that leaps at the sound. \n\n\tKILLDEER'S MUZZLE\n\n\tCRACKS like lightning. \n\n\tAN ELK\n\n\tleaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment \n\tof impact ... \n\n\tWIDE\n\n\tthree men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting \n\ttogether. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and \n\tangles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. \n\tThe two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. \n\tHawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's \n\tmore the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner \n\tand in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). \n\tAs Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...] \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK \n\t\t\t\t(low Mohican; sub-titled)\n\t\t\tWe're sorry to kill you, Brother. \n\t\t\tForgive us.

Just before he's going to collide into \n\tUncas, he leaps into the air and Uncas snatches him with one hand and swings him \n\tup onto his shoulders.

In the background are\n\tsixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors. \n\tWe've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids\n\tmill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. \n\tMost but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, \n\teight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are \n\tan English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in\n\tAlbany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHENRI\n\t\t\t\t(O.S. in French)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARTIN\n\t\t\t\t(translates) \n\t\t\tMy father says he was driven out of France by \n\t\t\tthe black robe priests and he would fight them \n\t\t\tnow but he lost his arm and so I will go in his \n\t\t\tplace. \n\n\tMeanwhile ... \n\n\tONGEWASGONE\n\n\tis an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He\n\tsays something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an\n\touter grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is\n\ttattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tONGEWASGONE\n\t\t\tJohn Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... \n\t\t\tTwin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les \n\t\t\tFrancais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les \n\t\t\tFrancais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... \n\n\tThese people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot\n\t\"mechanics\" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The\n\tMohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been\n\tacculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.\n\tTheir heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and\n\tcommercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a\n\thundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations\n\twith working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of \n\tco-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA\n\t mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former\n\tindentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier\n\thunters and trappers ... working people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tONGEWASGONE\n\t\t\t\t(continues) \n\t\t\tNow Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. \n\t\t\tMy brothers have asked me to lead them in this \n\t\t\twar so I speak for the Twin River Council. \n\n\tThe importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tHis Majesty King George II is very grateful for \n\t\t\tyour support. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tIAN\n\t\t\tHow far up the valley? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tTo Fort William Henry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLONIAL #1\n\t\t\t... two days from here. \n\n\tSome don't like this.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tIt should be enough to remind you France is \n\t\t\tthe enemy. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYour enemy ... \n\n\tHeads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tWhat did you say? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(loud)\n\t\t\tI said ...

Webb slides a glass across to Heyward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tI didn't experience anything so surprising from \n\t\t\tBristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tAnd what is that? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThe Crown \"negotiating\" the terms of service? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tI know.\n\t\t\t\t(assuming a co-commiserator)\n\t\t\tOne has to give Americans \"reasons\" and make \n\t\t\tagreements to get them to do anything at all. \n\t\t\tTiring, isn't it? \n\t\t\t\t(throws up his hands)\n\t\t\tBut that's the way of it here. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(tight)\n\t\t\tI thought British policy is 'Make the \n\t\t\tWorld ... England', sir. \n\n\tA chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tYou will take command of the 62nd Regiment \n\t\t\tof Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel \n\t\t\tMunro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tSir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard \n\t\t\tfrom Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to \n\t\t\trendezvous with them in Albany and escort them \n\t\t\tto the fort. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tYes. You may.\n\t\t\t\t(to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)\n\t\t\tYou there. What does Munro call you?\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward) \n\t\t\tThe \"Scotsman\" has sent one of his Indian allies \n\t\t\tto guide you. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\trises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is\n\tshaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a\n\tshawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long\n\ttomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tThe Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's \n\t\t\thouse. A company of the 33rd will accompany \n\t\t\tyou and Magua will show you the way. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tBy your leave, sir. \n\n\tWebb holds Heyward a moment\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\t\t(to Adjutants)\n\t\t\tExplain to the Major we care little about toying \n\t\t\twith colonial militia because we have little to \n\t\t\tfear from the French. They have not the nature \n\t\t\tfor war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with \n\t\t\ttheir Gallic laziness and the result is: they would\n\t\t\trather make love with their faces than fight. \n\n\tWebb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's\n\tbeen made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French.\n\tWebb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\t\t(continuing) \n\t\t\tDismissed. \n\n\tHeyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in\n\treturn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(to Magua)\n\t\t\tDawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See \n\t\t\tto it you're there.\n\n\tBeneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace. None of \tthese Brits see it. We do. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE - DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY\n\n\tbrushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and\n\tsword and his cavalry boots, walks through the gate after knocking. He enters a small\n\tcourtyard. Suddenly he hears ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.)\n\t\t\tHeyward! Duncan Heyward. \n\n\tHeyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could\n\tlike. \n\n\tREVERSE: CORA MUNRO\n\n\tenters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's\n\teducated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and \n\tthen pushes him away to look at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMy God it's good to see you. \n\n\tHe takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and lit up. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA & HEYWARD - DAY\n\n\tA vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal\n\tgarden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the\n\tbackground a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea\n\tsetting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's\n\tjacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so \n\t\t\tlong apart and after you've traveled so far ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAnd by sea! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYou still have an aversion to the water? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAversion? No. ... \"Hatred\" ... \"Loathing\" ... \n\n\tCora laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tBut it was worth it all to end in a garden by \n\t\t\tyour side.\n\n\tShe looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(difficult)\n\t\t\tDear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest \n\t\t\tfriend. Alice and I depend on you and respect \n\t\t\tyou immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings \n\t\t\tdon't go beyond that. Do you see? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tIsn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis \n\t\t\tfor a man and woman to be joined? And all \n\t\t\telse may grow in time ...? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tSome say that's the way of it. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\"Some\"? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tCousin Eugenie, my father, but ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(interrupts)\n\t\t\tCora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, \n\t\t\twe'll be the happiest couple in England.

In view of your \n\t\t\tindecision, why not rely on their advice and \n\t\t\tjudgment as well as mine? \n\n\tCora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something\n\tsubterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWill you consider that? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(pause; smiles)\n\t\t\tYes. Yes, I will. \n\n\tShe's still unsettled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.)\n\t\t\tDuncan! \n\n\tREVERSE: ALICE MUNRO\n\n\teighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes. She's effervescent and runs \n\tto hug him. Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMy God, you've grown up. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tWe leave in the morning?! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(rises)\n\t\t\tYes, miss. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tI won't sleep tonight.

MARCH!! \n\n\tTHE MEN\n\n\tmarch in perfect drill into two groups, each three across and three deep. \n\n\tMILITARY HQ, ENTRANCE - MAJOR DUNCAN HEYWARD\n\n\tsteps out. Rigid salutes. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tclimbs onto his white military charger. It's spirited. Cora & Alice are in riding dresses\n\t and veils. The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the\n\tflush of her complexion. They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts. The tight\n\t traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more\n\tmature. All three ride to the front of the column. The baggage horses and mule are in\n\tthe gap between the two companies. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tcradling his musket. \n\n\tREAR SHOT: THE COLUMN\n\n\tdown the path that leads into the wall of forest looks impressive. \n\n\tWIDER: THE COLUMN\n\n\tmarching. Now they look brave but smaller. The forest - with all its mysteries and\n\tdangers - now impresses us as a towering dark, sinister, and it's immensity swallows up\n\tthe living mass which slowly enters its bosom.\n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR FOREST\n\n\tTRACKING the Redcoats, their faces now filmed with dust, cut with lines of\n\tperspiration. They march in perfect formation. \n\n\tWe TRACK PAST the pack horses, the first company, Sgt. Major Ambrose and on to\n\tCora & Alice. Alice seems fatigued. Cora's turned, looking up into the forest canopy,\n\tastonished at the deep beauty of the place. \n\n\tCORA'S POV: FOREST CANOPY\n\n\tof trees is dark, except for spots where leaves are sparse, and there the light is golden.\n\tIt's the forest of childhood. \n\n\tIn a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.)\n\t\t\tAlice, did you see that ...? \n\n\tCORA'S\n\n\treverie's broken by Heyward entering the frame. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAlice? \n\n\tAlice rouses from fatigue.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAre you alright? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tCan we rest soon? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAbsolutely. \n\n\tHeyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty to thirty yards ahead\n\tof everybody else.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tYou there, Scout! \n\n\tMagua slowly turns towards Heyward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(overly articulated) \n\t\t\tWe must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired. \n\t\t\tYou ... understand? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(perfect English)\n\t\t\tI understand. This is not good place to stop. \n\t\t\tTwo leagues from here. No water 'til then. \n\t\t\tThat where we stop. Better place. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tNo. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the \n\t\t\tladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you \n\t\t\tunderstand? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(in Huron: English subtitle)\n\t\t\t\"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.\n\t\t\tWhen his women want to eat, he lay aside his \n\t\t\ttomahawk to feed their laziness.\" \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tExcuse me. What did you say? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tMagua say: \"Yes. Good idea.\" \n\n\tAs they begin to stop ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR MOUNTAINS & FOREST - WIDE - DAY\n\n\tSilently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed by Hawkeye and\n\tUncas. Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a degree of alertness. They're\n\teighteenth century Viet Cong moving through the rain forest. The Maxfield\n\tParrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All\n\tthree cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. \n\n\tFRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\t- in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks.\n\tChingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ... \n\n\tROCK\n\n\tunder the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds\n\tanother. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees,\n\tsearches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\thas headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas\n\tand Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest\n\tninety degrees from their previous path. \n\n\tTRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tmoving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass. The impression:\n\texpertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST, TRAIL - MAGUA - DAY \n\n\ton point. The trail cuts the side of a hill. The ground on one side rises into a forest\n\tacclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. Magua walking towards\n\tcamera. \n\n\tCLOSER - MAGUA'S\n\n\tslid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft\n\tdrop into his hand. He shrugs off his blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure\n\twe didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. \n\tTRACK WITH Magua.\n\tHeyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching\n\tin advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. \n\tWe see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.\n\n\tREDCOAT\n\n\tis curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is\n\ttwo steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the\n\tspike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the\n\tneck of the center man in the first row. \n\n\tSIMULTANEOUSLY\n\n\tthirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. \n\n\tFIVE REDCOATS\n\n\tare blown off the path, two others are wounded ... \n\n\tAMBROSE\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\tForm company! Left face! March! \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tshrieks. Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tpulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for the women ... \n\n\tCORA'S HORSE\n\n\tbucking. \n\n\tALICE'S HORSE\n\n\tbolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth. \n\n\tAMBROSE\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\tCompany make ready! \n\n\tThe regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades. All\n\tthirteen face the incline. \n\n\tFORESTED RISE - HURONS\n\n\tflash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares\n\tand fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires\n\tcovering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast\n\tand rapidly closing.\n\tEven though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their\n\ttactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\tPresent!! \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tcovers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tfrom horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... \n\n\tAN ATTACKING HURON\n\n\tleaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. \n\n\tMULE\n\n\twith baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats drop. Nine left.\n\tThen eight. \n\n\tAMBROSE\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\tFire!! \n\n\tA musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot, sending a lead scythe through\n\tleaves. But ... \n\n\tREVERSE:\n\n\tHurons were behind cover. Only one was exposed and hit. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tLoad! Prime! \n\n\tThe English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tPresent! Present! \n\n\tSuddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks,\n\twar clubs and point-blank musket fire. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\ton the ground, screaming insanely, covered by Cora who's protecting her little sister,\n\tand ... \n\n\tHEYWARD'S\n\n\thorse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight to the earth, and ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tshoots Ambrose in the chest, and ... \n\n \tHEYWARD\n\n\tby the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, upending one Huron\n\tand lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another. But this Huron easily slips the\n\tthrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt. \n\n\tBRITISH\n\n\tdead and dying. \n\n\tAMBROSE\n\n\tblood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a\n\tsecond with his sword. Then he's chopped down. Hurons begin scalping the British\n\twhile four race towards Heyward and the two women. \n\n\tHEYWARD & CORA & ALICE\n\n\tready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ... \n\n\tTHREE LOUD SHOTS\n\n\tBLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise. \n\n\tREVERSE: THREE MEN\n\n\tbarely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. In parts, we recognize\n\tNathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas. \n\n\tHURON'S\n\n\tnot sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into\n\tthe ravine with the war club. He didn't even slow down. \n\n\tHURON\n\n\twarrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings downwards. Uncas\n\tducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, sending him downhill into CAMERA \n\tas ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S\n\n\tmomentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple of wounded\n\tRedcoats who fight on ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tcalmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. He commits a very\n\trevealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will\n\tremember it. He raises his musket and aims at ... \n\n\tCORA MUNRO\n\n\twho's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill? \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tsees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ... \n\n\tTIME SLOWS: MAGUA\n\n\tsenses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The moment is frozen.\n \tTheir eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ... \n\n\tTIME UNFREEZES\n\n\tMagua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tshifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing\n\tKilldeer's trigger as ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE\n\n\tfrom Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, it happened\n\tso quickly. It's nearly mystical. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlowers Killdeer, impressed. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tglances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at her. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tpursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him the first man, who he\n\thamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill ... as ... \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tin the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian. We recognize that\n\the's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tNo, Duncan! \n\n\tDuncan ignores her. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S MUSKET\n\n\tis jerked from his hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. \n\n\tHe's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's\n\tpointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind\n\tHeyward. As Heyward spins ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB\n\n\tflashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook\n\tretrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tscalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung. \n\n\tWIDE\n\n\tSudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the\n\tsavages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tCora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean\n\tand demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their\n\tbaggage is gone. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S\n\n\tcrossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British\n\tmilitary power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G. \ttwo of the wounded start to rise ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.)\n\t\t\tStop it! \n\n\tHeyward spins. \n\n \tUNCAS\n\n\tjust cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks\n\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tWe need them to get out of here! \n\n\tUncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the \"savage\".\n\tHeyward runs in to protect the women ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(to Nathaniel)\n\t\t\t... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! \n\n\tUncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUNCAS\n\t\t\t\t(matter of fact) \n\t\t\t... too easy to track ... they can be heard for \n\t\t\tmiles ... find yourself a musket ... \n\n\tCora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward)\n\t\t\tYour wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. \n\t\t\tThey'll never make a passage north. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(breathless)\n\t\t\tWe were headed ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(appropriating a knife)\n\t\t\t... Fort William Henry. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tto Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's\n\tChingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts\n\toff.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t... take you as far as the fort. \n\n\tHawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at\n\tthem: the women are totally terrified and do not move.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tIf we are goin' to take you, we need to move. \n\t\t\tFast ... And the fort is well off our course. \n\t\t\tSo if you all rather wait for the next Huron \n\t\t\twar party to come by, we'll be on our way. \n\n\tHeyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and\n\tChingachgook. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY\n\n\tmoves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left flank. Cora, Alice &\n\tDuncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S FEET\n\n\twalking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others\n\tfollow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tconforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian\n\tfrontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tHow far is it, scout? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tDay and a half \n\t\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\t\tWhere did you get ... the guide? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tColonel Munro sent him. He was one of our \n\t\t\tMohawk allies. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tHe is Huron and nothing else. \n\t\t\t\t(checking the Munro girls are \n\t\t\t\tnot too close)\n\t\t\tWhy would he want to murder the girl? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWhat?! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tDark haired ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMiss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on \n\t\t\ther before today. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tNo blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tOf course not! \n\t\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\t\tAnd how is it you were nearby? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tCame across the war party, tracked 'em. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThen you're assigned to Fort William Henry? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tNo. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tFort Edward, then? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tNo. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tI thought all our colonial scouts were in \n\t\t\tthe militia? \n\n\tOff to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tI ain't your \"scout\". And I am in no damn \n\t\t\tmilitia. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(stops) \n\t\t\tThen you are one of those who would allow \n\t\t\tEngland to fight alone while she protects \n\t\t\tyou from France? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tEngland does not protect me and does not \n\t\t\twar against France on our account. She uses \n\t\t\tus to war against France on her own account ... \n\t\t\tof greed for land and furs. \n\n\tCORA'S\n\n\tappalled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(turns) \n\t\t\tClear it up any? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(loud) \n\t\t\tI owe you gratitude or I'd call you out! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\tDo not let gratitude get in the way ... \n\n\tCora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms\n\tover him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\t\t(to Hawkeye) \n\t\t\tYengeese no good in woods. Make more \n\t\t\tnoise, I kill him. \n\n\tHeyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with\n\tHeyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tstops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tis already moving out front, low and fast ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY\n\n\tAfter we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas\n\tjoin him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees. \n\tHawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY\n\n\tBurned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the\n\tdoorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred\n\tand smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the\n\tcollapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and\n\tare seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tapproaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but\n\tconfronts it directly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.) \n\t\t\tAnything to be done? \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\treturns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are. We know the\n\tdegree of their inner pain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUNCAS\n\t\t\tAll dead ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tbends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They look at each other\n\tgrimly. Heyward joins them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWho were these people? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(re: print) \n\t\t\tOttawa! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tExcuse me ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\t\t(to Hawkeye) \n\t\t\tOttawa. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tenters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay\n\twhere he is: on the periphery with the women.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUNCAS\n\t\t\tMirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Chingachgook)\n\t\t\tMovin' fast, not able to carry much ... \n\t\t\tthis was a war party? \n\n\tChingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance\n\tis very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tLet us look after them ... \n\n\tHe starts approaching the bodies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\tLeave them. \n\n\tHeyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(hasn't moved)\n\t\t\tThough they are strangers, they are at \n\t\t\tleast entitled to a Christian burial! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(shaking his head) \n\t\t\tLet us go, miss. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI will not. I have seen the face of war \n\t\t\tbefore, Mr. Poe, but never war made on\n\t\t\twomen and children. And almost as \n\t\t\tcruel is your indifference. \n\n\tHawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(contained)\n\t\t\tMiss Munro.\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tThey are not strangers .... \n\t\t\tAnd they stay as they lay ...! \n\n\tCORA\n\n\trealizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the\n\tfirst time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and\n\trhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a\n\tmoment. \n\n\tWIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE\n\n\tas Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks,\n\twalk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward\n\thelping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.\n\n\tThe ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT\n\n\tmoves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and\n\tsome thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others\n\tavoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tmutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch,\n\tsoundlessly. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tthrows Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound\n\tand - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. \n\n\tALICE'S HEAD\n\n\thits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on\n\twatch.\n\tHawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped\n\tmound.\n\tCora has sought him out. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tdoesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. \n\tThey whisper ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhy didn't you bury those people? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tAnyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would \n\t\t\tsee it as a sign of our passing ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYou knew them. \n\n\tHawkeye looks at her and nods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(stiffly)\n\t\t\tYou were acting for our benefit. And I \n\t\t\tapologize. I misunderstood you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWell that is to be expected. My father ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYour \"father\"? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tChingachgook. He warned me about \n\t\t\tpeople like you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tHe did? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYes. He said ... \"do not try to make them \n\t\t\tunderstand you.\" \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhat?! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYes. And \"do not try to understand them. \n\t\t\tThat is because they are a breed apart and \n\t\t\tthey make no sense ...\" \n\n\tCora's indignation is cut off because ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tmoving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas\n\tdisappears around the mound. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT\n\n\tNothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the\n\twhite birch. \n\n\tRED-PAINTED FACE\n\n\twhite eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. \n\tSlit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by\n\tothers. Wary, silently, they hunt. \n\n\tDEEPER: MORE OTTAWA\n\n\tTowards the rear are two French Rangers (\"Coureurs des Bois\") from Le Regiment de\n\tla Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and\n\tbreechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're\n\tthe 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the\n\tOttawa find our people, it's all over. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tseeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and\n\tinvoluntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and\n\tsilences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,\n\tlooking towards the advancing Ottawa. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\ton his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. \n\n\tOTTAWA & FRENCH\n\n\tare fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist\n\tenvelops them ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tHis massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\twaiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's\n\timpressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop\n\tof moccasined feet ... \n\n\tOTTAWA\n\n\tthrough the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader\n\tgestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent.\n\tThe Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers\n\tsomething inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, \"Non. Pas possible ...\" \n\tAnd means it. They retreat. \n\n\tSEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA\n\n\ttensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. \n\n\tUNCAS & ALICE\n\n\tHe slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up,\n\tcatches his eyes. Then she averts her face. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tsees all of it; doesn't like it. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tThe Ottawa are gone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\t\tWhy did they turn back? \n\n\tIn answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head.\n\n\tCORA\n\n\tturns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted\n\tagainst the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial\n\tplace. \n\n\tCORA & HAWKEYE\n\n\tShe thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the\n\tdanger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost\n\ttouch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(still pissed off)\n\t\t\t\"We're a breed apart and we make no \n\t\t\tsense\" ...? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(smiles) \n\t\t\tIn your particular case, miss, I would \n\t\t\tmake some allowance ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastic)\n\t\t\tThank you so much. \n\n\tCora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him.\n\tHer mood changes. Then ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYou called Chingachgook your \"father\"?\n\t\t\tWhere is your real family? \n\n\tHawkeye's surprised by her question.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThey buried my ma & pa and my sisters.\n\t\t\tAnd Chingachgook - who found me with \n\t\t\ttwo French trappers - raised me up as his \n\t\t\town. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI'm sorry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tI do not remember them. I was one or two. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tHow did you learn English? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tMy father sent Uncas & I to Reverend \n\t\t\tWheelock's school when I was ten. So\n\t\t\twe would know both worlds ... though \n\t\t\twe were told only bother learning readin' &\n\t\t\tarithmetic from yous. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAnd what were the consequentialities of \n\t\t\tEuropean culture you didn't bother with? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThe Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas \n\t\t\tabout the government of men. My father's \n\t\t\tpeople already know each man is his own \n\t\t\tnation. And only he can have dominion \n\t\t\tover himself. Not kings. No man is better \n\t\t\tthan any other man. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tIn London those radical ideas could land \n\t\t\tyou in Newgate prison. \n\t\t\t\t(changing the subject)\n\t\t\tWhy were those people living in this \n\t\t\tdefenseless place ...? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable\n\t\t\tto poor people. So after seven years \n\t\t\tindentured service in Virginia, they headed\n\t\t\tout here where they are beholden to none\n\t\t\tand not livin' by another's leave ... \n\t\t\tTheir name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.\n\n\tCora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at \tHawkeye; then again up at the night sky. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(continuing; looking up)\n\t\t\tMy father's people say ... at the birth of the \n\t\t\tsun and of his brother, the moon, their \n\t\t\tmother died ... so the sun gave to the earth \n\t\t\ther body, from which was to spring all life.\n\t\t\tAnd he drew forth from her breast the stars.\n\t\t\tThe stars he threw into the night sky to \n\t\t\tremind him of her soul. \n\t\t\t\t(the sky)\n\t\t\tSo there is the Camerons' monument ... \n\t\t\tmy folks', too, I guess. \n\n\tCORA'S\n\n\tpensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\tYou are right, Mr. Poe. We do not \n\t\t\tunderstand what is happening here.\n\t\t\tAnd it is not as I imagined it would be, \n\t\t\tthinking of it in Boston and London ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tSorry to disappoint you ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(eyes downcast)\n\t\t\tOn the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... \n\t\t\tto my blood ...\n\t\t\t\t(then up into his eyes)\n\t\t\t... than any imagining could possibly have \n\t\t\tbeen ... \n\n\tShe closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring\n\tinto the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were \n\twrong ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n\tDeep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a\n\tbranch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is\n\tHawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tMuch further? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tTop of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are \n\t\t\tdownhill of it. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tRe-energized, her spirits pick up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tWill we be able to bathe? \n\n\tBefore Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. Alice is alarmed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tThunder ... Papa will arrange something. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tlooks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and\n\tChingachgook. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS\n\n\tand the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who have now split into\n\ttwo groups, are still on their trail. Meanwhile, oblivious ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThe men of the regiment will fetch water from \n\t\t\tthe lake, build fires and provide every comfort \n\t\t\tyou desire, Alice ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tDuncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora \n\t\t\tdoesn't marry you, I shall. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAlice! \n\n\tHeyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, including\n\tCora, shed their frontier experience?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tI can't wait to see Papa ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAnd you, Duncan? What are you looking \n\t\t\tforward to? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tPosting to a different continent. \n\n\tHe and Alice laugh. Cora does not.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI think it's very important and exciting. \n\n\tHeyward looks at her. She's not kidding. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD\n\n\thelps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to\n\tHawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark\n\tthoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER. \n\n\tWIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE\n\n\tdrops and pulls Cora to the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tLightning? \n\n\tHawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to\n\tthe top of the ridge. \n\n\tCLOSER ANGLES: CORA & ALICE\n\n\tjoin them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the\n\twilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. \n\n\tTHEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY\n\n\tis none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense\n\tsmoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red\n\tglare. Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tlooks over his shoulder. \n\n\tHIS POV: OTTAWA\n\n\tpursuing them. There's no way back. They're propelled forward. \n\n\tDISSOLVE TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR BATTLEFIELD, FRENCH BATTERY #1 - CLOSE SHOTS - DUSK\n\n\tFrench cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame. \n\n\tTRENCH\n\n\tdug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two\n\tpoles and fascis on the sides. \n\n\tENGLISH GUN CREW\n\n\tsearching the night. \n\n\tPOV: BATTLEFIELD\n\n\tis black. \n\n\tENGLISH ROCKETS\n\n\tlight the battlefield revealing the French trenches. \n\n\tENGLISH GUN CREW\n\n\texcited. Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles. The British gun crew\n\tscrambles to adjust their 18 pounders. \n\n\tFRENCH BATTERY #1 \n\n\tFIRES. \n\n\tFRENCH BATTERY #2\n\n\tFIRES. \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT, WEST BATTERY\n\n\tTRACKING. French cannon FIRE rips into the fortifications, exploding wood and\n\tearth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister. The English fight stubbornly, but\n\twe feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile ... \n\n\tWIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER\n\n\tA new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the\n\tfire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark\n\tshape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a\n\tbirch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake. \n\n\tEXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS\n\n\tBehind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts. \n\n\tLOW & WIDE: SNIPERS\n\n\tBehind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook,\n\tfollowed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and\n\tthe forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron\n\tsenses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife\n\tflashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto\n\tthe debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks\n\thim forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, NORTH WALL - SALLY-PORT TUNNEL\n\t- NIGHT\n\n\tAmidst the cannonade roar, ad-libbed shouts from Hawkeye and Heyward convince\n\tbattle begrimed soldiers to open the sally-port.

Webb has no idea. And he certainly does \n\t\t\tnot know to send reinforcements! \n\n\tMunro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55,\n\tthe British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers\n\tlike Webb would disdain his Scots origins. \n\tFrom under his fury: \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(flat)\n\t\t\tWhat happened to you? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(suddenly tired) \n\t\t\tAmbush ... on the George Road.

Munro holds her\n\ttighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her.\n\tThey exit. \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\tis moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward over table map)\n\t\t\tWhat a place for them ... \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMight I enquire after the situation, sir, given \n\t\t\tthat I've seen of the French engineering from \n\t\t\tthe ridge above? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(perfunctory)\n\t\t\t Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine \n\t\t\tand he has more of them. They keep our heads \n\t\t\tdown while his sappers make thirty yards of \n\t\t\ttrench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a \n\t\t\ttwo hundred yard range, so when they're close \n\t\t\tenough, they'll move them in, lob explosive \n\t\t\trounds over our walls and pound us to dust. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThey look to be three hundred yards out. \n\t\t\tYou have three days. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tBloody murderers. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tA man, here, can make a run straight through \n\t\t\tto Webb. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t... not enough time to get to Albany and back \n\t\t\twith reinforcements ... \n\n\tA Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWebb's not in Albany.

He could be here day \n\t\t\tafter tomorrow. \n\t\t\t\t(to Hawkeye)\n\t\t\tFind your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you \n\t\t\tthe message. \n\n\tBeams nods. Munro turns back to the map. Hawkeye has something else to say.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tJohn Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last \n\t\t\tnight. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And \n\t\t\tit was Ottawa.

It means they're on the \n\t\t\tattack up and down the frontier. \n\n\tMunro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must\n\tbe to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(cold)\n\t\t\tThank you. \n\n\tHawkeye's dismissed, frozen out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tMany men here, their homes are in the path. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tThat's all, sir. \n\n\tHawkeye is furious. Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out. He leaves Munro's quarters\n\talmost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook\n\tpass.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThings were done. Nobody was spared ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tTerrible feature of war in the Americas. \n\t\t\t\t(beat; a mantra)\n\t\t\tBest to keep your sight fixed on our duty. \n\t\t\tOur duty is to defeat France. That hangs \n\t\t\ton a courier to Webb. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR MONTCALM'S MARQUEE - CHORAL GROUP - NIGHT\n\n\tof three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the Te Deum in the Iroquois\n\tlanguage. This is a large tent that could sleep twenty. Montcalm's four personal guards\n\tare at the entrance as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a facial wound and a\n\tbraceful of pistols on a sash. Inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot\n\tbattle standard and flag of France. \n\n\tMONTCALM\n\n\tstands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed Seneca chief in a silk\n\tturban ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENECA CHIEF\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\t... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left \n\t\t\tus no time to put our cabins in order before telling \n\t\t\tus our French father had need of our aid. We rolled \n\t\t\tour blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we \n\t\t\tare not the first and closest to my father's campfire. \n\n\tThe Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his\n\twaistcoat. He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner. He is more aristocratic than\n\tMunro, but a consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm\n\tsees and nods to ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tentering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw on the trail. In his scalp\n\tlock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat\n\tblanket drapes his left shoulder. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(to Seneca Chief)\n\t\t\tFor my children and the children of the true \n\t\t\tfaith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ... \n\t\t\tI will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow \n\t\t\tI, myself, will sing the war song with you in the \n\t\t\tgreat council house. \n\n\tThe Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit. The look on Magua's\n\tface and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is\n\tbased on realpolitik.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tLe Renard Subtil, how are things with your \n\t\t\tEnglish friends? \n\n\tMagua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European\n\tstyle ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(over his shoulder)\n\t\t\tLouis Antoine, join us. \n\n\tLOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange of\n\tIndian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tHear what le Subtil has to tell us ... \n\n\tBougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a\n\tsecretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he\n\twas elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight\n\the's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, he\n\tbrought \"bougainvillea\" from Tahiti to Europe to America.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tEnglish war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward \n\t\t\twith 33rd Regiment. He does not know my \n\t\t\tfather's army attacks Fort William Henry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOUGAINVILLE\n\t\t\tBut by now Munro knows his couriers didn't \n\t\t\tget through. He'll send another. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tThe Grey Hair will try. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOUGAINVILLE\n\t\t\tFour or five, including two women entered the \n\t\t\tfort ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tThe Grey Hair's children were under Magua's \n\t\t\tknife but escaped. They'll be under it again. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tWhy do hate the Grey Hair, Magua? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tWhen the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat \n\t\t\this heart. Before he dies Magua will put his \n\t\t\tchildren under the knife so the Grey Hair will \n\t\t\tsee his seed is wiped out forever. \n\n\tMontcalm won't get a direct answer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy sappeurs are advancing the trenches through \n\t\t\tthe night, now. You may have your opportunity \n\t\t\tsoon. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR SURGERY, ENTRANCE - PHELPS - NIGHT\n\n\texhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE (O.S.)\n\t\t\t\tShe know what she's doin'? \n\n\tPhelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at Cora.

I would say she does ... \n\n\tHer apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's\n\tnot her first military campaign. Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's\n\tnevertheless falling for Cora.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tShe does not shy away from much ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPHELPS\n\t\t\t\t(elsewhere) \n\t\t\tWhat's that? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tNothin'. \n\n\tAlice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the surgery where a casement\n\tmeets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. A catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to\n\ther.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPHELPS (O.S.)\n\t\t\tMiss Cora?

Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress\n\tthat she now uses to bandage Uncas. We don't know why; neither does Cora.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Uncas) \n\t\t\tYou 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro? \n\n\tUncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to\n\ttend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora\n\tturns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhat are you looking at, Mr. Poe? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWhy, I am looking at you, Miss. \n\n\tCora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner. It's not insolent, only unsettling.\n\tFeeling foolish; she turns. He leaves. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FRENCH TRENCHES - SAPPEURS & ENGINEERS - \tNIGHT\n\n\thaving worked through the night, are still digging the diagonally-advancing trench.

More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they\n\tneed to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have.

Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on\n\tfiddle & drums. It's stirring. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN\n\n\tlaundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers. A few\n\tpeople lit by the firelight are solemn. Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while. \n\n\tTHEIR FACES\n\n\tunderlit by the red firelight. They are a disposable people, a diverse plurality stuck in a\n\tpostage stamp-size fort in an ocean of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict\n\t because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs. \n\n\tA PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE FIRE\n\n\tWe can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs, crates and\n\tnew wreckage from the day's bombardment. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\t... got no kin in the settlements.

He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. \n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tSomehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves\n\trolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people. \n\n\tCORA & HAWKEYE\n\n\tHawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing\n\tthrough a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful\n\tman with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.\n\tTheir shoulders touch. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tTo her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the\n\tpassions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to\n\twhat stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlooks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his\n\tarms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation\n\tshe can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the\n\thuddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a\n\twild continent. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW & WIDE - DAY\n\n\tdoor CRASHES inwards.

Munro bows coldly. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tColonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant \n\t\t\tantagonist. I am happy to make your \n\t\t\tacquaintance as a friend. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tAnd I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tPlease accept my compliments for the strong \n\t\t\tand skillful defense of your fortress. Under \n\t\t\tthe command of a lesser man it would have \n\t\t\tfallen long ago given the superior numbers and \n\t\t\tmaterial ... mere chance has allowed me to \n\t\t\tarray against you ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tMonsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a \n\t\t\tdiplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tYou have already done everything which is \n\t\t\tnecessary for the honor of your Prince. I \n\t\t\twill forever bear testimony that your resistance \n\t\t\thas been gallant and was continued as long as \n\t\t\tthere was hope. But now, I beg you to listen \n\t\t\tto the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to \n\t\t\tconsider my terms for your surrender. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tHowever I may apprise such testimony from \n\t\t\tMonsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is \n\t\t\tstrong and stands. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tHonor that is freely accorded to courage, may \n\t\t\tbe refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to \n\t\t\tus every opportunity to reconnoiter your \n\t\t\tworks and I am possibly as well acquainted \n\t\t\twith your weak condition as you are yourselves. \n\n\tIs Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British\n\treinforcements arrive? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tPerhaps the General's glasses can reach to the \n\t\t\tHudson and he knows the size and imminence \n\t\t\tof the army of Webb ...? \n\n\tMontcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\t\tMy scouts intercepted this dispatch intended \n\t\t\tfor you. \n\n\tMunro is puzzled, suspicious. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(to Bougainville)\n\t\t\tRead the dispatch. \n\n\tHEYWARD & MUNRO]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOUGAINVILLE \n\t\t\t\t(O.S. - reading)\n\t\t\t\"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have \n\t\t\tno men available to send to your rescue. It is \n\t\t\timpossible. I  advise you to seek terms for \n\t\t\tsurrender. Signed Webb.\" \n\n\tMunro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(confirming)\n\t\t\tThis is the signature of Webb. \n\t\t\t\t(to Munro)\n\t\t\tAnd I know the temper of our men. Rather \n\t\t\tthan spend the war in a French prison hulk \n\t\t\tin Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(to Montcalm)\n\t\t\t You have heard your answer, Monsieur le \n\t\t\tMarquis. \n\t\t\t\t(salutes) \n\n\tMunro starts off. Montcalm stops him. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tSir. \n\t\t\t\t(challengingly)\n\t\t\tI am incapable of mistreating brave men. \n\t\t\tI beg you not to sign the death warrant \n\t\t\tof so many until you have listened to my \n\t\t\tterms. \n\n\tMunro turns. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tSuch as ...? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy master requires the fort be destroyed. \n\t\t\tBut, for you and your comrades, there is \n\t\t\tno privilege that will be denied. None of \n\t\t\tyour men will see the inside of a prison\n\t\t\tbarge. They're free to go so long as they \n\t\t\treturn to England and fight no more on this\n\t\t\tcontinent, and the civilian militia return to \n\t\t\ttheir farms. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tTheir arms? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tThey may leave the fortress fully armed, but \n\t\t\twith no ammunition ... Other than that, ask \n\t\t\twhat you wish. \n\n\tMunro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tThe honors of war? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tGranted. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tMy colors? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tCarry them to England to your King with pride. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tAllow me to consult with my officers. \n\n\tAs he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put\n\tback together. As the men move away from the French ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tI have lived to see two things I never expected. \n\t\t\tAn Englishman afraid to support a friend. And \n\t\t\ta Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tGeneral Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back \n\t\t\tand dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our \n\t\t\tmission is to fight. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(flares)\n\t\t\tDeath and honor are sometimes thought to be \n\t\t\tthe same. Today I have learned that they are not. \n\n\tMunro looks at the fortress behind him. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tSir! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(stops him with his eyes)\n\t\t\tThe decision is final. \n\n\tA beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned,\n\tscarred earth of the battlefield. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tI am deeply touched by such unusual and \n\t\t\tunexpected generosity ... The fort is yours \n\t\t\tunder the condition that we be given until \n\t\t\tdawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and \n\t\t\twomen for their march and turn our wounded \n\t\t\tover to your surgeon. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tGranted, Monsieur. \n\n\tAnd Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - CLOAKED MAN - NIGHT\n\n\tpasses away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards\n\tWilliam Henry. He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the\n\tfort. As he approaches a sentry: \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTRY\n\t\t\tQui vive? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tFrance. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTRY\n\t\t\tLe mot d'ordre? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tLa victoire. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTRY\n\t\t\tC'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, \n\t\t\tmonsieur! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tIl est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. \n\n\tThe cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and\n\tthe soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues\n\twalking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM\n\n\tThe moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the\n\tfront of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tIs the hatchet buried between the English \n\t\t\tand my French father? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tYes. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tNot a warrior has a scalp and the white men \n\t\t\tbecome friends. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy master owns these lands and your father \n\t\t\thas been ordered to drive off the English \n\t\t\tsquatters. They have consented to go. So \n\t\t\tnow he calls them enemies no longer. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tMagua took the hatchet to color it with blood. \n\t\t\tIt is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will \n\t\t\tbe buried. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tBut so many suns have set since Le Renard \n\t\t\tstruck the war post. Is he not tired? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tWhere is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. \n\t\t\tIt is dark and cold. It has set on his people, \n\t\t\tthey are fooled and kill all the animals and sell \n\t\t\tall of their lands to enrich the European masters \n\t\t\twho are always greedy for more than they need. \n\t\t\t\t(threatening)\n\t\t\tAnd Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have \n\t\t\tbeen many clouds and many mountains. But now\n\t\t\the has come to lead his nation. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tThat Le Renard has the power to lead his people \n\t\t\tinto the light, I know well. \n\n\tMagua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's\n\teyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tDoes my father know that? \n\n\tMAGUA'S CHEST\n\n\tA deep indentation and scar. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tThat's where a lead bullet has torn you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tAnd this? \n\n\tMagua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ... \tdeep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy son has been sadly injured. Who did \n\t\t\tthis? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(laughs; sardonic)\n\t\t\tMagua slept hard in the English wigwams. \n\t\t\tAnd the sticks left their mark ... \n\t\t\t\t(pause; for real)\n\t\t\tMagua's village and lodges were burnt. \n\t\t\tMagua's children were killed by the English. \n\t\t\tMagua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks \n\t\t\twho fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife \n\t\t\tbelieved he was dead and became the wife of \n\t\t\tanother. The Grey Hair was the father of all \n\t\t\tthis. \n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tIn time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk \n\t\t\tto become free. In his heart he always was Huron. \n\t\t\tAnd his heart will be whole again on the day \n\t\t\twhen the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy son Magua's pain is my pain. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tDoes the chief of the Canadas believe the \n\t\t\tEnglish will keep the terms? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMunro would. But General Webb will not\n\t\t\tsend their soldiers across the salt lake. \n\t\t\tHaving let them go, I fear I will only fight \n\t\t\tthe same men again when I move south.\n\t\t\t\t(pause; shrugs)\n\t\t\tAnd yet, I cannot break the terms of the \n\t\t\tcapitulation and sully the lilies of France ... \n\n\tLong pause, wheels turn. Then: \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tMany things my French father cannot do, \n\t\t\tMagua can. \n\n\tMontcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tAs the English march away, our soldiers \n\t\t\tand the Canadiens will be drawn to the \n\t\t\tlooting of the fort ... except for a small \n\t\t\tguard ... \n\n\tMagua abruptly leaves Montcalm. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT\n\n\twalking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods,\n\twaiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)\n\t\t\tI wonder at the blindness and pride of the \n\t\t\twhite man. He believes only he knows \n\t\t\thow to speak falsely to make other men do \n\t\t\this bidding. \n\n\tMagua exhales in derision. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY\n\n\tat the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with\n\tarmed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just\n\toutside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as \n\tis - at the head - Montcalm. \n\n\tCLOSER: MUNRO\n\n\ttrots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. \n\n\tMONTCALM\n\n\tsalutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. \n\n\tCLOSER: MUNRO\n\n\tsalutes Montcalm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(eyes forward)\n\t\t\tMonsieur, the fort is yours. \n\n\tMID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD\n\n\tmarching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have\n\tthinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The\n\t33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes\n\tHeyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. \n\n\tFRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE\n\n\ton the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under\n\tthe arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is\n\tseen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column,\n\tsheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. \n\n\tCORA'S POV: THE COLUMN\n\n\tThe 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a\n\tnumber of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and\n\tmany Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.\n\tNo Hawkeye. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tstraining to see. \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS\n\n\tbeing assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands\n\terect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior.\n\tHawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... \n\n\tUNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\ton the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own\n\tmusket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye.\n\tTheir eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. \n\n\tRANK AND FILE FRENCH\n\n\tA few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. \n\n\tEXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE\n\n\tHis eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts\n\tthrough the forested hills ahead. He sees ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA\n\n\triding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and\n\tcurious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. \n\n\tPROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE\n\n\tas it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're\n\tshooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both\n\tslopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out\n\tand don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. \n\tSLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man\n\twearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He\n\tis heavily war-painted ... \n\n\tFRONTAL - MAGUA\n\n\tand the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much\n\tsilver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right\n\tfist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. \n\n\tMAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE\n\n\tat the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. \n\n\tWIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS\n\n\tCora turns again to look for Hawkeye. \n\n\tCLOSER: CORA\n\n\tdoesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. \n\n\tYOUNG HURON\n\n\trunning toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like\n\ta dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? \n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tthe Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a\n\tBritish trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off\n\tagain ... \n\n\tCORA\n\n\thorrified, holds Alice tighter. \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\thas seen it too. And now he sees ... \n\n\t62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT\n\n\tfixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons\n\tand other Indians ... \n\n\tTROOPERS\n\n\tof the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks\n\tare cocked. There's the answer. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tSteady! No one fires! \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES\n\n\tare watching what happens. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tscanning them. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(to Sergeant Major)\n\t\t\tMen are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSERGEANT MAJOR\n\t\t\tYes sir! \n\n\tDrums beat the cadence.\n\n\tTROOPERS\n\n\tstep over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... \n\n\tEND OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\twatching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer\n\tand his own musket. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES\n\n\tHold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed\n\tto the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest. \n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tMany Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to\n\tthe column, stalking it. Waiting ... \n\n\tANOTHER BRAVE\n\n\tracing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. \n\n\tTWO SOLDIERS\n\n\tlook at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both\n\tbayonet the Indian. He's dead. \n\n\tEXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON & OTTAWA\n\n\tsaw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. \n\n\tMOHAWKS\n\n\tamong the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are\n\tcocking flintlocks. \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\tgallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We\n\thear him from the distance ordering ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tDo not break ranks! I want these ranks \n\t\t\tto hold ...! \n\n\tCora's frightened.\n\n\tHAWKEYE'S\n\n\tfrustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's\n\taccelerating. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS\n\n\tmove next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as ... \n\n\tWOMEN\n\n\twith children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are\n\tisolated incidents. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tdraws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA\n\n\tHis eyes see Munro. \n\n\tWIDER & LOWER: MAGUA\n\n\traises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have\n\tbeen stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ... \n\n\tWIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE\n\n\tFIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive\n\tambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR\n\tof musket fire, war whoops and screams as ... \n\n\tSOLDIERS & CIVILIANS\n\n\tdropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tis being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where\n\tChingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye\n\tshrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the\n\tcolumn ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA\n\n\tcharging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the\n\tarea in which he saw Munro. \n\n\tCORA & ALICE\n\n\tat the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom,\n\tcovering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tshouting orders. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSERGEANT MAJOR\n\t\t\tRight - about face! March! First rank present! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tFire! \n\n\tREVERSE:\n\n\tThe volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking Hurons. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSERGEANT MAJOR\n\t\t\tPrime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! \n\t\t\tPresent! \n\n\tHurons are twenty yards away and closing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tFire! \n\n\tAs the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ... \n\n\tWIDE: THE HILLS & PATH\n\n\tWe're shooting into the \"v\" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down\n\tfrom both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and\n\tMohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off\n\tviews, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.\n\n\tBRITISH TROOPERS\n\n\tusing their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog\n\tswirls among the men - fighting for their lives ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tglides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him.\n\tHe sees ... \n\n\tBLONDE WOMAN\n\n\thugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman\n\tprotecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of the braves behind Magua raise his\n\ttomahawk. On his downswing ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\trunning through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tCora! \n\n\tChingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club. \n\n\tCORA & ALICE\n\n\trunning through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in\n\tstruggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in\n\tCora's hand. \n\n\tONE HURON\n\n\tscalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tshoots him in the face. \n\n\tEXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE\n\n\tand her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her\n\texpression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her\n\thead. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlocked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and\n\tcomes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand\n\tfires Killdeer at ... \n\n\tHURON\n\n\tsix feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tfree for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. Everything is death in\n\tstrange tableaux. Meanwhile: \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\thollering\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tCora! Alice! \n\n\tHe cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. An\n\tOsage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to\n\tstab down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in\n\tan iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires\n\tbackward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse. \n\n\tWIDER\n\n\tJust then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tshouting orders over the deafening noise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tSecond rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! \n\t\t\tLoad! Third rank! Present! \n\n\tA well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. They're getting\n\tcut off. They close ranks automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect\n\torder. \n\n\tHURON WARRIOR\n\n\tabout to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua. \n\n\tCLOSER: MAGUA\n\n\tHis eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet. \n\n\tOVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO\n\n\this lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in towards him. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tGrey Hair. I will cut your heart from your \n\t\t\tliving chest in front of your eyes. As you die, \n\t\t\tknow that I will put under the knife your \n\t\t\tchildren and wipe your seed from this earth \n\t\t\tforever ... \n\n\tMagua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ... \n\n\tMOHAWK & HURON\n\n\tspin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. The Huron goes down\n\tand then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with\n\ttomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers\n\tfighting back to back. They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst\n\tbodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image. \n\n\tCORA & ALICE\n\n\tin a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot down. The third engages a\n\tFox warrior. Cora & Alice run. \n\n\tMUNRO'S FACE\n\n\tfrozen in agony by shock. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\treaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into\n\tthe air. But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood. \n\n\tLONG SHOT: MAGUA\n\n\tseen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro. \n\n\tREVERSE: HAWKEYE\n\n\tsaw him and fights his way to attack when ... \n\n\tWHITE HORSE\n\n\tcrazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tprotecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm\n\tand his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an\n\tOttawa who's behind him. Then ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S\n\n\tup, looking wildly ... \n\n\tCAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:\n\n\t33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward. They FIRE into our face. \n\n\tCLOSER: HEYWARD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tSix paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, \n\t\t\tpresent! Rank two, hold! \n\n\tHe grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. They're taking fire.\n\tMen are dying. They're being pushed back. \n\n\tAN ABNAKI\n\n\twearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, Heyward fires the\n\tmusket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in\n\tthe thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.\n\tDazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tRank two, six paces back! Rank one, \n\t\t\tpresent! \n\n\tRank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see\n\twhat's wrong. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT\n\n\tare standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last\n\tstand. Heyward straightens. \n\n\tTWO FRENCH OFFICERS\n\n\ton horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot\n\tby a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.\n\tThen his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ... \n\n\tJESUIT\n\n\tpleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers\n\this cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tsees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling\n\tchaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ... \n\n\tALICE\n\n\ton her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take\n\ther life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases\n\thim. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... \n\n\tOTTAWA WARRIOR\n\n\tis spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and\n\tCora ... \n\n\tTWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR\n\n\tfrom the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out\n\t with bayonets and tomahawks. \n\n\tHAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &\n\tMUNRO'S DAUGHTERS\n\n\tback through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the\n\tside by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The\n\tMohawk supports the wounded Ranger. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tshields Cora as they back up. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tsmashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and\n\tshoots another. Then he sees ... \n\n\tSMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER\n\n\tIt's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes. \n\n\tTHE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE,\n\tTHE RANGER & THE MOHAWK\n\n\tback into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to\n\tthe canoes. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\theld up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. \n\n\tANGLE\n\n\tsomething underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the\n\tshallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES. \n\n\tWOUNDED RANGER\n\n\thas shoved a large birch canoe at them. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tSuddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands\n\trest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries\n\tto rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring\n\tinto Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float\n\taway. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY\n\n\tThe bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers\n\ttendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of\n\ta war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us. \n\n\tHAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS\n\n\tCora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. \n\n\tCLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA\n\n\tCora looks left. Her eyes go wide. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tNo! \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tspins. \n\n\tHEYWARD & TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE\n\n\thave emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at\n\tHawkeye. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tis non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYou got nothin' better to do today on \n\t\t\tLake George than shoot me, Major,\n\t\t\tthen go ahead ... \n\n\tHeyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and\n\trounds come in. \n\n\tWIDE\n\n\tThey're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tis indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays\n\tHeyward no heed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tStop it!! \n\n\tHeyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied\n\taround his leg. He lowers the gun. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWhen you fall into British hands again, \n\t\t\tNathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged. \n\n\tHURON CANOES\n\n\tpaddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. \n\n\tHAWKEYE & HEYWARD'S CANOES\n\n\twith less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlooks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas &\n\tChingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The others match the doubled pace. They're\n\tsprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting. \n\n\tHURON CANOES\n\n\tmaintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S CANOE\n\n\tMusket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole through the bow.\n\tHawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tREDCOAT #1\n\t\t\tCan't ... keep it up ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tPull! \n\n\tHe renews the attack on the water with the paddle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\t\tHow long? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\t\tOnly chance we got is ... \n\t\t\t\t(breathless)\n\t\t\t ... to get more distance on 'em and go \n\t\t\tto ground! \n\n\tHeyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound. A new hail\n\tof musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls\n\toverboard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\t\tPull!!\n\n\tHAWKEYE CANOE\n\n\tsprints forward. \n\n\tCLOSE: HAWKEYE\n\n\tlooks over his shoulder. \n\n\tTHE HURON CANOES\n\n\tThey're pulling away from them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tPull ...! \n\n\tMore Huron musket balls hit water nearby. \n\n\tREDCOAT\n\n\tin Heyward's boat is shot. BUT ... the .65 caliber ball didn't penetrate his skin. The\n\tRedcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor of the canoe. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tREDCOAT #2\n\t\t\tSpent. \n\n\tDistance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics. They're out of smoothbore\n\tmusket range. \n\n\tHAWKEYE CANOE]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward)\n\t\t\tHead for ... for the white water. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tDo you hear me, sir! \n\t\t\t\t(exhausted)\n\t\t\tIf you ever fall ... into British hands ...\n\t\t\t\t(breathes)\n\t\t\tWhat white water? \n\n\tHEYWARD & REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE\n\n\tdivided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids. \n\n\tHAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE\n\n\tpaddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way\n\tahead of the Hurons. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tleaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes\n\tcontrol. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling. He and\n\tHawkeye will pilot the two canoes. \n\n\tEXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY\n\n\tThe canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled. \n\n\tCANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE\n\n\tracing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and\n\tthey're drenched by two waves coming from the sides. \n\n\tHAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tpaddle like fiends to get momentum and control. \n\n\tUNCAS' CANOE\n\n\tSame thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to \"pull\" and they do.\n\tAs soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe\n\trevolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through \n\tstern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way\n\tthrough a hazard of ... \n\n\tEXPOSED ROCKS\n\n\tjutting out of the water. \n\n\tWIDE - BOTH CANOES\n\n\tHawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to\n\tshove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks,\n\tUncas swings it back around while ... \n\n\tWHITE WATER\n\n\tsmashes into the camera. \n\n\tALICE & CORA\n\n\tas the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly it's through and\n\tthe water is miraculously smooth. \n\n\tCANOES\n\n\tThe Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride. That's\n\tbecause they think they're home free.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tHere's where it gets tricky ... \n\n\tHeyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's\n\ttalking about. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD\n\n\tlooks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. Then Heyward realizes:\n\tsomething's wrong with this picture. \n\n\tCLOSER: HEYWARD\n\n\tThe look on his face starts to change. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER\n\n\tThe glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world. The\n\triver just ends ... \n\n\tBOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER\n\n\trealize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a couple of outcroppings of\n\trock in the center at the very edge. We are at Glen Falls.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tDon't move ... \n\n\tAERIAL SHOT\n\n\tfrom the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract.\n\tThe canoes - slightly above us - will go right over. \n\n\tTWO CANOES\n\n\tAt the last moment, Hawkeye & Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock\n\toutcropping. It is literally at the lip of the falls. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tgrabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. The canoe rockets for\n\tthe edge. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tlurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the canoe to earth. The bow,\n\twith Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to\n\tthe rock. He gestures to Heyward. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tcrawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally Uncas. The canoe\n\trockets over the falls. Meanwhile ... \n\n\tTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND\n\n\tHawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush. As\n\tthey clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into\n\ta crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps\n\tAlice ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT\n\n\tThe irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of\n\tHawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWhere do we go from here? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWe don't. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tI don't understand! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThis is it, as far as we can go ... If we're \n\t\t\tlucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have \n\t\t\tcome this way and must've beached our \n\t\t\tcanoes and headed cross land. If we're \n\t\t\tvery lucky, they'll figure we went over \n\t\t\tthe falls. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThen what? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThen we take the south rim down the \n\t\t\tmountain and it's 12 miles cross country \n\t\t\tto Fort Edward. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAnd if we're unlucky? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYou will have to forego the pleasure of \n\t\t\thangin' me. \n\n\tREVERSE: WIDE\n\n\tHawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries Alice, down the\n\trockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating off the walls. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS\n\n\tare scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At an earlier time the\n\tformation was part of the falls. \n\n\tHAWKEYE & CORA\n\n\treach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder. \n\n\tWIDEN TO REVEAL\n\n\ta curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down\n\tits height. Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence. They're\n\texhausted. The others join them. They almost have to shout to be heard. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tfollowed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their powder. They have\n\talmost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked,\n\tthe paper cartridges a soggy mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In\n\tMohican, Chingachgook decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward\n\tapproaches Hawkeye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAny powder? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE:\n\t\t\t\t(crossing to Cora)\n\t\t\tOnly one or two loads. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tis soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out.\n\tCora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAre we safe? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tMaybe ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tOur father? Did you see my father? \n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE\n\n\tThe look on his face tells it all \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tTell me! \n\n\tTWO SHOT\n\n\tHawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers\n\tto her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over\n\ther eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tLeads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries\n\tsoftly into his shoulder. \n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA\n\n\tsays into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tSay nothing to Alice ...! \n\n\tHawkeye nods.\n\n\tALICE\n\n\tstands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer. She's\n\toblivious to all the events and everything going on around her ... \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tsees Cora & Hawkeye together and turns away. \n\n\tGROUP\n\n\tUncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The Redcoat is\n\texhausted. Hawkeye & Cora against the wall. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST & RED SKY -\n\tTWILIGHT\n\n\tA landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the\n\tmountains. The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white\n\thighlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the\n\tsurface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and\n\tmuscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera.\n\tHe's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen\n\tFalls island. \n\n\tHURON\n\n\tlooks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously ... \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON & FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT\n\n\twatches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. \n\n\tOVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES\n\n\tjoin him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up & howls as\n\this eyes go white reflecting the new moon. \n\n\tINTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT\n\n\thears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling\n\twater. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances\n\twith Uncas & Chingachgook. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\timmediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves\n\tcarefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tHis countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He\n\ttouches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tsensing new danger, slips away on her own. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tcrosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do\n\ta thing except hold his hand and think of her father. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tINTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tbelow the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... \n\n\tNORTH FISSURE - UNCAS\n\n\tagainst one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tlooks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight\n\tpull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.\n\tSuddenly ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tyanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the\n\tedge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she\n\twas seen. \n\n\tUNCAS & ALICE\n\n\tHe relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent.\n\tLanguorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up,\n\tas if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. \n\n\tALICE'S\n\n\teyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto\n\tUncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his\n\tchest. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tUncas ... \n\n\tHer body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let\n\thim. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life,\n\tshe holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name\n\tand he responds. He loves her in the half-light. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\this hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some\n\temotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and\n\tholds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He\n\treaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her\n\tface to him, but her expression has completely flattened. \n\n\tWIDER ANGLE\n\n\tShe's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT\n\n\tbeaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His war paint is fresh:\n\tgreen handprints on his chest and black and green on his face. Black plumes are affixed\n\tto his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his\n\tmusket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks towards us\n\tapproaching the island, two hundred yards away ... \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tINTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE - NIGHT\n\n\tchecks his powder horn. Nearly empty. He looks at Chingachgook. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tINTERIOR GLEN FALLS ISLAND, CAVE - CORA - NIGHT\n\n\twith the Ranger, looks up. Hawkeye enters. The look on his face. Then hers.

Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen\n\ton Hawkeye's face. All his experience & craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora.\n\tBack to Chingachgook. Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye\n\tagrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking about.

Then ... \n\n\tANCIENT SACHEM\n\n\tis led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch\n\tbark lodges. Many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence. He sits on the\n\traised platform. He looks to be in his nineties. His dark wrinkled face is contrasted by\n\this long white hair. His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat. He\n\twears numerous silver & gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors.\n\tMost startling is his face. His dark & lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of\n\ttatooing.

Because the \n\t\t\tHurons are mislead by the words of the \n\t\t\twolf who's never spoken the truth.\n\n\tSachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on\n\tHawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's\n\tEnglish.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tLet the children of the dead Colonel Munro \n\t\t\tgo free and take the fire out of the English \n\t\t\tanger over the murder of their helpless ones. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tOur father, Montcalm, is greater than the \n\t\t\tYengeese in the arts of war. The Huron \n\t\t\tdo not fear English anger. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tWise one, the French fathers made peace \n\t\t\tand swore to their honor not to break the \n\t\t\tfriendship. Magua broke it. It is false that \n\t\t\tthe French would not be friends, still, to \n\t\t\tthe Huron. \n\n\tSachem reacts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\t\tIt made our French father happy to never \n\t\t\thave to fight the same Yengeese again. \n\t\t\tHe told me this without telling me this. \n\n\tHawkeye realizes this is true.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tSo the Huron are the servants of the French? \n\t\t\tTo do what the French are shamed to do? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tNo. \n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tHuron serve no one. The French father \n\t\t\tbelieves he fooled Magua because he is so \n\t\t\tproud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it \n\t\t\tis the Huron path that Magua walks down, \n\t\t\tnot the French one ... Now, Les Francais, \n\t\t\talso, fear Huron. That is good. When the \n\t\t\tHuron is strong from their fear, we will make \n\t\t\tthe terms of trade with Les Francais. And we \n\t\t\twill trade as the white man trades. Take land \n\t\t\tfrom the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk \n\t\t\t& Fox. And make the Huron great. Over \n\t\t\tother tribes. No less than the whites, as strong \n\t\t\tas the whites. \n\n\tHawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tMagua would use the ways of Les Francais \n\t\t\tand the Yengeese ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tThe red man put down the bow, picked up \n\t\t\tthe fire stick and became the best warrior \n\t\t\tin the forest. Yes. It is the only way. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWould the Huron make his Algonquin brothers \n\t\t\tfoolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell \n\t\t\tthem for gold to the white man? Would the \n\t\t\tHuron have greed for more land than a man \n\t\t\tcan use? Like Francais Black Robes do? \n\t\t\tWould Huron kill tribes with disease? Would \n\t\t\tthe Huron fool Seneca into taking all the \n\t\t\tanimals in the forest for beads & brandy? But \n\t\t\tsell the fur to the white man for gold? ... \n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\t Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les \n\t\t\tFrancais masters. Are they the ways of Huron \n\t\t\tmen who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? \n\t\t\t... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make \n\t\t\thimself into what twisted him. A Dog, become \n\t\t\tMaster of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? \n\t\t\t... Magua's way is false. It is like the white \n\t\t\tsickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness \n\t\t\tand shame. Is there another way? I don't know. \n\t\t\t\t(pauses)\n\t\t\tI am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, \n\t\t\tadopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican \n\t\t\tpeople ... Let the children of the dead Munro go \n\t\t\tfree ... I speak the truth. \n\n\tMagua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem\n\twhispers to the older men on either side of him. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\twaits for the decision. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tlooks to Alice, then to Hawkeye. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\texchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him\n\tfrom the perspective of nearly a century of laws & judgments.

Cora looks around wildly.\n\tInstead of taking Hawkeye, two warriors grab Heyward. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tis immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse. He gasps.

But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat. \n\n\tCORA'S POV: ALICE\n\n\twith Magua's group crosses the path. He drags Alice behind him like baggage. She\n\tregains her feet.

His fingers find a diagonal crevice and ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tswings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. His features are\n\tdistorted with determination. Nothing will stop him. His right hand grabs another rock.\n\tHis arms snap him up. Then push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ... \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY\n\n\ton point are approaching the path above the promontory. Five warriors are ahead of\n\tMagua. One behind him drags Alice. \n\n\tFIRST\n\n\tHuron starts up the narrow path. Suddenly ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tslams him off the rock with the butt of his musket. \n\n\tWIDE ANGLE\n\n\tTwo's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets\n\tThree. \n\n\tFOURTH\n\n\tFIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas'\n\tmusket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the\n\tedge ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\trunning forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast. \n\n\tUNCAS'\n\n\tthree tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver\n\tflashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open\n\thand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.\n\tGoing with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas'\n\tright arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like\n\tMagua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough. \n\n\tEXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tfreezes. \n\n\tEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS\n\n\tclosing, swings. Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns him to face the edge,\n\tripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat. \n\n\tCLOSE: MAGUA'S\n\n\tknife arm punches forward. \n\n\tWIDE: PROMONTORY\n\n\tUncas falls down the face onto to the rocks. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tseeing his boy killed, CRIES out and is charging up the path, Hawkeye following. \n\n\tEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - ALICE\n\n\tbacks to the edge. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tmoves on Alice. His knife is low, about to strike. She stares at him. Her eyes are like\n\tpools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tinexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of\n\tsomething else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his\n\tother hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tlooks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with\n\tenigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge. She falls to her\n\tdeath next to Uncas ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR MEADOW - CORA\n\n\tcollapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands ... \n\n\tHURON WARRIORS\n\n\tare running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging uphill, fueled by a\n\tfather's rage, and Hawkeye. One Huron aims at the center of Chingachgook's chest ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tFIRES past his father's side. The Huron's blown off the path. Hawkeye races to reload\n\ton the run ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA\n\n\tsees the approach of Chingachgook. \n\n\tTO CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tHuron warriors are an irrelevance. He slams one aside with his musket. \n\n\tHAWKEYE FIRES. \n\n\tHURON\n\n\twith tomahawk, about to blindside Chingachgook, is SHOT DOWN. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tcharging Chingachgook. \n\n\tVERY WIDE\n\n\tTwo men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory. Now the others fall\n\tback... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... \n\n\tCOMBATANTS\n\n\tMagua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his\n\tright, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to\n\tgut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's dead. Except ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tisn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.\n\tThe massive war club crashes into Magua's back. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tstunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tnow up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,\n\t breaking Magua's right arm. And ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\t... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left\n\tside and crushes part of his chest. \n\n\tANOTHER BLOW\n\n\tdestroys Magua's collar and shoulder. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tamazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of\n\tthe last warrior of the Mohicans. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\tUNCAS!!! \n\n\tAnd he spins and swings. The blade side of the war club punches into Magua's chest,\n\tcaving him in two. \n\n\tWIDE\n\n\tMagua dies in the dust. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\twatching Chingachgook's heaving back. It's over. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\talone, kneeling in the meadow. Her eyes downcast ... \n\n\tFADE OUT ...\n\n\tFADE IN \n\n\tEXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN TOP - WIDE REAR SHOT - NEXT DAY\n\n\tChingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests to the west. A haze of\n\tsunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds. Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tspeaks to the sky.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\t\t(Mohican)\n\t\t\tGreat Spirit and the Maker of all Life ... \n\n\tON HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tWe HEAR Hawkeye's English translation in VOICE OVER: \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK/\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE (V.O.): \n\t\t\t\t(in English)\n\t\t\t... a warrior goes to you swift and straight \n\t\t\tas an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him \n\t\t\tand let him take his place at the council fire \n\t\t\tof my people. \n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tHe is Uncas, my son. \n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tBid them patience and ask death for speed; \n\t\t\tfor they are all there but one\n\t\t\t- I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. \n\n\tChingachgook's hands drop to his sides. He lets out his breath with a weariness. His\n\teyes seek Hawkeye's. They hold ... \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tis standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave with a wooden cross. Next\n\tto it is Uncas' burial platform. Cora [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses\n\therself. Her emotions are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes her hand. \n\n\tHAWKEYE & CORA]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWill you go back to England? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI have nothing to go back for. \n\n\tLong pause. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThen will you stay in America? \n\n\tShe turns to face him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tAnd will you be my wife? \n\n\tPause. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYes. \n\n\tThey hold each other's eyes. She searches his face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhere will we go? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWinter with the Delaware, my father's \n\t\t\tcousins. And in the spring, cross the \n\t\t\tOhio and look for land to settle with my \n\t\t\tfather in a new place called Can-tuck-ee. \n\n\tThey move next to Chingachgook. He senses they're beside him. Hawkeye's arm is\n\taround her shoulders.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\tThe frontier moves with the sun and pushes \n\t\t\tthe red man of the wilderness forests in front \n\t\t\tof it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. \n\t\t\tThen our race will be no more, or be not us ... \n\t\t\tThe frontier place is for people like my white \n\t\t\tson and his woman and their children. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThat's my father's sadness talking. \n\n\tHawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\tNo. It is true ... One day ... there will be no \n\t\t\tmore frontier. Then men like you will go, too. \n\t\t\tLike the Mohicans. \n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tAnd new people will come. Work. Struggle \n\t\t\tto make their light ... One mystery remains. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWhat is that? \n\n\tCora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\tWill there be anything left to show the world \n\t\t\tthat we ever did exist? \n\n\tREAR SHOT\n\n\tCora stands next to her man.
