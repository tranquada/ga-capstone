A SENTRY TOWER --\n\n               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.\n\n               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower \n               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable \n               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very \n               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, \n               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible \n               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the \n               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure \n               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT \n               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.\n\n               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding \n               a rifle and staring straight out.\n\n               The drum cadence has been building slightly.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE.

A MARINE BARRACKS\n\n               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR\n\n               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, \n               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop \n               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still \n               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it \n               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into\n\n               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in \n               his bunk.\n\n               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S \n               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks \n               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --\n\n               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out \n               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and \n               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come \n               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.\n\n               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision \n               and professionalism.\n\n               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto \n               his mouth and eyes --\n\n               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.\n\n                                     DOWNEY\n                              (quietly)\n                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.\n\n               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking \n               him, just holding his head still --\n\n               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo.

Incredible precision is the name of the game. \n               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were \n               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same \n               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM \n               that can't possibly be human.

Santiago \n                         died at the base hospital \n                         approximately an hour later.

At the moment \n               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread \n               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 \n               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own \n               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.\n\n               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law \n               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous \n               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, \n               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                              (calling out to the \n                              team)\n                         Alright, let's get two!\n\n               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE.

It's hot as hell and it looks like \n               he's gonna pass out.\n\n               He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him \n               down the hill.

Yes I suppose \n                         you're right. I suppose that's the \n                         thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a \n                         better idea. Let's transfer the whole \n                         squad off the base. Let's -- on second \n                         thought -- Windward. The whole \n                         Windward division, let's transfer \n                         'em off the base. Jon, go on out \n                         there and get those boys down off \n                         the fence, they're packing their \n                         bags.\n                              (calling out)\n                         Tom!\n\n               The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office.\n\n                                     ORDERLY\n                         Sir!\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                         Got me the President on the phone, \n                         we're surrendering our position in \n                         Cuba.\n\n                                     ORDERLY\n                         Yes sir!\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                         Wait a minute, Tom.\n\n               The ORDERLY stops.\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                              (continuing)\n                         Don't call the President just yet. \n                         Maybe we should consider this for a \n                         second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit \n                         balling here -- but maybe we as \n                         officers have a responsibility to \n                         train Santiago. Maybe we as officers \n                         have a responsibility to this country \n                         to see that the men and women charged \n                         with its security are trained \n                         professionals. Yes. I'm certain I \n                         once read that somewhere. And now \n                         I'm thinking that your suggestion of \n                         transferring Santiago, while \n                         expeditious, and certainly painless, \n                         might not be in a manner of speaking, \n                         the American way. Santiago stays \n                         where he is. We're gonna train the \n                         lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago \n                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness \n                         report, I'm gonna blame you. Then \n                         I'm gonna kill you.\n\n                                     KENDRICK\n                         Yes sir.\n\n                                     MARKINSON\n                         I think that's a mistake, Colonel.\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                         Matthew, I believe I will have that \n                         word in private with you now.

Daniel AlliStair \n                         Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston \n                         Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel \n                         Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate \n                         and Attorney General, of the United \n                         States, died 1985. You went to Harvard \n                         Law on a Navy scholarship, probably \n                         because that's what your father wanted \n                         you to do, and now you're just \n                         treading water for the three years \n                         you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, \n                         just kinda layin' low til you can \n                         get out and get a real job. And if \n                         that's the situation, that's fine, I \n                         won't tell anyone. But my feeling is \n                         that if this case is handled in the \n                         same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian \n                         Bazaar manner with which you seem to \n                         handle everything else, something's \n                         gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be \n                         doing my job if I allowed Dawson and \n                         Downey to spend any more time in \n                         prison than absolutely necessary, \n                         because their attorney had pre-\n                         determined the path of least \n                         resistance.\n\n               KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Wow.\n                              (beat)\n                         I'm sexually aroused, Commander.\n\n                                     JO\n                         I don't think your clients murdered \n                         anybody.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         What are you basing this on?\n\n                                     JO\n                         There was no intent.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         The doctor's report says that Santiago \n                         died of asphyxiation brought on by \n                         acute lactic acidosis, and that the \n                         nature of the acidosis strongly \n                         suggests poisoning.\n                              (beat)\n                         Now, I don't know what any of that \n                         means, but it sounds pretty bad.\n\n                                     JO\n                         Santiago died at one a.m. At three \n                         the doctor was unable to determine \n                         the cause of death, but two hours \n                         later he said it was poison.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Oh, now I see what you're saying.  \n                         It had to be Professor Plum in the \n                         library with the candlestick.\n\n                                     JO\n                         I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Okay.

A few minutes later, \n                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's \n                         body called lactic acidosis caused \n                         his lungs to begin bleeding.

Furthermore, \n                         the Government will also demonstrate \n                         that the defendants soaked the rag \n                         with poison, and entered Santiago's \n                         room with motive and intent to kill.\n                              (beat)\n                         Now, Lt.

Zero. Nobody. \n                         Not one call to his parents saying \n                         he was coming home.

He was asleep in his \n                         bed at midnight, and according to \n                         you he was getting on a plane in six \n                         hours, yet everything he owned was \n                         hanging neatly in his closet and \n                         folded neatly in his footlocker.

Santiago was leaving for the \n                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called \n                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. \n                         Can you explain that? The fact is \n                         there was no transfer order. Santiago \n                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that \n                         right, Colonel.\n\n                                     ROSS\n                         Object.

My answer is I don't \n                         have the first damn clue. Maybe he \n                         was an early morning riser and he \n                         liked to pack in the nq. And maybe \n                         he didn't have any friends. I'm an \n                         educated man, but I'm afraid I can't \n                         speak intelligently about the travel \n                         habits of William Santiago.  What I \n                         do know is that he was set to leave \n                         the base at 0600. Now are these really \n                         the questions I was called here to \n                         answer?

SAM and JO stand as well.\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                              (reading)\n                         On the charge of Murder, the Members \n                         find the defendants Not Guilty.\n\n               It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but \n               they do.\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                              (continuing; reading)\n                         On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit \n                         Murder, the Members find the \n                         defendants Not Guilty.\n\n               RANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper.\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                              (continuing)\n                         On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming \n                         a United States Marine, the members \n                         find the defendants Guilty as Charged.\n\n               A little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH \n               continues reading.\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                              (continuing; reading)\n                         The defendants are hereby sentenced \n                         by this court to time already served, \n                         and are ordered...\n\n               RANDOLPH clears his throat.\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                              (continuing)\n                         ...And are ordered to be dishonorably \n                         discharged from the marine corps.\n                              (pause)\n                         This Court-Martial is adjourned.\n\n               RANDOLPH raps his gavel.\n\n                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS\n                         Ten hut.\n\n               All rise.\n\n               RANDOLPH's gone.\n\n                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS\n                              (continuing)\n                         Dismissed.\n\n               The M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their \n               handcuffs.

His stare moves \n               slowly to the floor.\n\n                                     DAWSON\n                              (continuing)\n                         I never meant to hurt Willy.\n\n               DAWSON looks up at HIS PARENTS.

But before \n               they get to the door, KAFFEE turns around and calls\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Harold!\n\n               They stop and turn around.\n\n                                     DAWSON\n                         Sir!\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                              (pause)\n                         You don't need to wear a patch on \n                         your arm to have honor.\n\n               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE for a long moment.\n\n                                     DAWSON\n                         Ten-hut.\n\n               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention.\n\n                                     DAWSON\n                              (continuing)\n                         There's an officer on deck.\n\n               DAWSON snaps a salute and holds it.\n\n               KAFFEE stares back.
