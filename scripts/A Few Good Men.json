SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks \n               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --\n\n               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror.

In one flash DAWSON and \n               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come \n               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.\n\n               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision \n               and professionalism.\n\n               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto \n               his mouth and eyes --\n\n               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.\n\n<b>                                     DOWNEY\n</b>                              (quietly)\n                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.\n\n               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking \n               him, just holding his head still --\n\n               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo.

Maybe we as officers \n                         have a responsibility to this country \n                         to see that the men and women charged \n                         with its security are trained \n                         professionals.

Your father's Lionel \n                         Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate \n                         and Attorney General, of the United \n                         States, died 1985. You went to Harvard \n                         Law on a Navy scholarship, probably \n                         because that's what your father wanted \n                         you to do, and now you're just \n                         treading water for the three years \n                         you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, \n                         just kinda layin' low til you can \n                         get out and get a real job.

But my feeling is \n                         that if this case is handled in the \n                         same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian \n                         Bazaar manner with which you seem to \n                         handle everything else, something's \n                         gonna get missed.

The story I just told you is \n                         the exact same story you're going to \n                         hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's \n                         the exact same story you're going to \n                         hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, \n                         the Government will also demonstrate \n                         that the defendants soaked the rag \n                         with poison, and entered Santiago's \n                         room with motive and intent to kill.\n                              (beat)\n                         Now, Lt.

The second call \n                         was to set up a meeting with \n                         Congressman Ramond of the House Armed \n                         Services Committee, and the third \n                         call was to my sister Elizabeth.\n\n<b>                                     KAFFEE\n</b>                         Why did you make that call, sir?\n\n<b>                                     JESSEP\n</b>                         I thought she might like to have \n                         dinner tonight.\n\n<b>                                     ROSS\n</b>                         Judge --\n\n<b>                                     RANDOLPH\n</b>                         I'm gonna put a stop to this now.\n\n               Jo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters.\n\n<b>                                     KAFFEE\n</b>                         Your honor, these are the telephone \n                         records from GITMO for August 6th.  \n                         And these are 14 letters that Santiago \n                         wrote in nine months requesting, in \n                         fact begging, for a transfer.\n                              (to JESSEP)\n                         Upon hearing the news that he was \n                         finally getting his transfer, Santiago \n                         was so excited, that do you know how \n                         many people he called? Zero. Nobody. \n                         Not one call to his parents saying \n                         he was coming home. Not one call to \n                         a friend saying can you pick me up \n                         at the airport. He was asleep in his \n                         bed at midnight, and according to \n                         you he was getting on a plane in six \n                         hours, yet everything he owned was \n                         hanging neatly in his closet and \n                         folded neatly in his footlocker. You \n                         were leaving for one day and you \n                         packed a bag and made three phone \n                         calls. Santiago was leaving for the \n                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called \n                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. \n                         Can you explain that? The fact is \n                         there was no transfer order. Santiago \n                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that \n                         right, Colonel.\n\n<b>                                     ROSS\n</b>                         Object. Your Honor, it's obvious \n                         that Lt.

My answer is I don't \n                         have the first damn clue. Maybe he \n                         was an early morning riser and he \n                         liked to pack in the nq. And maybe \n                         he didn't have any friends.
