I can talk to her, you cant quit on such short notice.\n<br/>\n<br/>Smeal: oh, well I\u0092m sorry sir.

First it was Mrs Larkburg.\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: a woman deeply and hygienically disturbed. Her hair smelled.\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: but then it was Mrs Piltz.\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: Piltz, the answers in the question. Let\u0092s face it Benjamin, hiring house keepers is not your forte.\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: Oh yeah, well until I do find another house keeper, you are going to stick close to the house, you understand?

Montgomery and Smeal, Smeals and Roebuck, Smeals \u0091r\u0092 us\u0085\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: Joon. You got a roommate? When did you get a roommate?\n<br/>\n<br/>Mike: since last week. My cousin landed in town and my life has gone from heaven to hell in 7 days.\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: Just like the good lord intended\n<br/>\n<br/>Mike: yeah, 20 years old and he can\u0092t even read. He spends all day polishing my plastic forks.\n<br/>\n<br/>Eric: what do you mean when you say he can\u0092t read? You mean words?\n<br/>\n<br/>Mike: yeah, and he keeps me up all night watching stupid old movies. My works starting to suffer.\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: you installed cable TV.\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: Joon, would you please glue your sequins\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: have we an internal sequin issue to deal with Benjamin?\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: can we make this the last hand?

She goes outside and holds up the traffic.\n<br/>\n<br/>In the social workers officeSW: she really knows how to rattle the day help\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: you know, I think we need to find someone more understanding than Mrs Smeal\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: now let me tell you something. How are you two getting along?\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: us? Fine, normal, you know fine. Why?\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: I\u0092ll level with you.

She has already quit the two day centres to prove it. Look all we need right now is a new housekeeper\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: well I know of no one else. You\u0092ve been up and down the list. Now you might want to entertain the possibilities that there are some people more capable of handling these episodes than you. I am beginning to that that you living together may not be the best thing any more\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: I\u0092m her brother and her only family. And we\u0092ve done just fine the two of us for 12 years.\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: yes but her stress level is always a factor in her display of symptoms. Her agitation should be kept to a minimum\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: everybody gets agitated sometimes it\u0092s the only option\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: Benny, don\u0092t get me wrong I\u0092m impressed that you\u0092ve managed this long. But a group home would give her a chance to develop other relationships. Also we don\u0092t know this but what if she was capable of a part time job? They would encourage her in that direction. These are very nice place\u0092s, nurturing, supportive\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: I\u0092m not farming her outJoon has held up the traffic and the drivers are getting angry and shouting at her.

You\u0092re the one who\u0092s cheating\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: You\u0092re all trying to cheat me, you\u0092re trying to cheat. Joon throws the racket and smashes a lamp.

He takes it to the bathroom and flushes it down the toilet.\n<br/>\n<br/>Outside Eric\u0092s houseBenny: I mean I cant even keep a goldfish alive. What chance do I have with Joon? If something bad happened to her I\u0092d, I\u0092d never ever be able to forgive myself\n<br/>\n<br/>Eric: a group home is the right thing for her Benny.\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: yeah, this is defiantly for her own good\n<br/>\n<br/>Eric: hey, it\u0092s for both your own good. How much longer can you do this to your self? You\u0092re life is literally passing you by\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: you\u0092re right. You\u0092re right. What am I doing with myself? I spend my life working on cars and taking care of my sister. I cant even have a relationship without having to worry how Joon is going to fit in.\n<br/>\n<br/>Eric: you know, once you get settled in you can actually take a vacation. Travel a little. I can hold down the fort no problem.\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: travel?

I hope you\u0092re happy with what you have done to her.\n<br/>\n<br/>He grabs Sam\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: you just stay the hell away from my sister\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: no, no\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: want to know why everybody laughs at you Sam? Because you\u0092re an idiot. You\u0092re a first class moron\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: you\u0092re scared\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: I\u0092m what?\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam you\u0092re scared. I can see it. And you know why? I used to look up to you but know I cant look at you at all.\n<br/>\n<br/>It flashes to Joon in bed and Benny walking by the trains. It shows Joon again but awake by the window and Sam at Ruthie\u0092s. Benny is playing with a jack-in-the-box back at the house and Sam is outside the hospital.\n<br/>\n<br/>At the video store\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: I think that Fred Astatine is the way to go\n<br/>\n<br/>Lady: yeah?\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: that\u0092s a good choice\n<br/>\n<br/>Lady: who\u0092s that woman who starred in the roman\u0085\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam looks up and sees Benny\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: Audrey hepburn\n<br/>\n<br/>Lady: yeah Sam. Thanks a lot\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: have a nice day. Can I help you?\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: yeah I hope so.\n<br/>\n<br/>At the mental hospital\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam and Benny are in a room. Thomas walks in\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: Thomas, how is she? Tell me the truth\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: she\u0092s been better Benny\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: well you\u0092ve got to tell me what room number she\u0092s in\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: 335. But don\u0092t even think about it Benny. it\u0092s a closed ward. No visitors\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: no we\u0092ve got to find Joon. Please\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: Thomas you\u0092ve got to get us in there, to see her\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: its impossible Benny\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: what do you mean its impossible?

My hands are tied. My hands are tied!\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas leaves\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: what room did he say?\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: 335\n<br/>\n<br/>At the waiting room they sit down. The door opens to the closed ward and Sam throws his hat in the way of the door do it doesn\u0092t close. They go through and as they are walking through the corridors they hear some men coming the other way.\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: shit. What are you doing?\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam slides down the hall towards the men\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: Mommy?\n<br/>\n<br/>Man1: what are you doing here?\n<br/>\n<br/>Man2: I don\u0092t think you are supposed to be here\n<br/>\n<br/>Man3: what room did you come out of?\n<br/>\n<br/>The pick him up and carry him back through the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>Man1: get the door\n<br/>\n<br/>Man3: how did he get past security?\n<br/>\n<br/>Man1: hey, watch the door\n<br/>\n<br/>The coast is clear so Benny continues until he find Joon\u0092s room.\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: Joon, look, I know you want to be left alone but you do not belong in here. Not how would you like to try living in you\u0092re own apartment?\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: an apartment?\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: yeah!

I\u0092m through making those decisions for you. Listen I\u0085 I\u0092m sorry I was such a jerk. And about Sam.

Why do you hate me so much?\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: I don\u0092t hate you\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: you just need me to be sick\n<br/>\n<br/>The social worker enters the waiting room and goes over to the desk.\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: Juniper Pearl\u0092s chart please.

By now Joon would be in a caring and controlled environment. Isn\u0092t it obvious that you two need some distance?\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: what don\u0092t we ask Joon what she wants?\n<br/>\n<br/>Outside\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam is climbing up the building\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: Sam what are you doing?

I\u0092m begging you.\n<br/>\n<br/>In Joon\u0092s room\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: Joon, we want what\u0092s best for you\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: I know that\n<br/>\n<br/>She sees Sam swinging across the window\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: I\u0085\n<br/>\n<br/>Outside\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: Sam come down now. Sam you\u0092re going to get in trouble\n<br/>\n<br/>Inside\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: I think I want to try living in my own apartment\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny looks outside and sees Sam. The social worker looks outside but doesn\u0092t see anything\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: hmm, I don\u0092t know\n<br/>\n<br/>Outside\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: Sam stop swinging\n<br/>\n<br/>The line of the hoist starts to come loose\n<br/>\n<br/>Inside\n<br/>\n<br/>SW: but I\u0092m willing to let you try. I\u0092ll prepare the papers for her release\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: thanks doctor Garvey\n<br/>\n<br/>Outside\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: come down Sam!\n<br/>\n<br/>The hoist breaks and Sam falls down\n<br/>\n<br/>Thomas: whoa! Whoa! Are you ok?\n<br/>\n<br/>Sam: ouch, ouch\n<br/>\n<br/>In the hospital\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon tries to say something but cant get the word out\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: I know, me too. I\u0092m going to go and check you out. Ok?\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon: ok\n<br/>\n<br/>Joon goes out and Sam is waiting for her in a wheel chair. He gets up and they hug\n<br/>\n<br/>At Joon\u0092s apartment\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny pulls up outside and Ruthie is sat on her porch. He hands her some white roses\n<br/>\n<br/>Ruthie: haven\u0092t we tried this before\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: yeah but my life\u0092s a lot less complicated now. Is Joon inside?\n<br/>\n<br/>Ruthie: yeah\n<br/>\n<br/>Benny: ok\n<br/>\n<br/>He looks in her room and sees Sam and Joon making grilled cheese with an iron. He leaves her some roses at her door.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>THE END\n<br/></b><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Benny &amp; Joon</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Barry Berman\" title=\"Scripts by Barry Berman\">Barry Berman</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Lesley McNeil\" title=\"Scripts by Lesley McNeil\">Lesley McNeil</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Benny &amp; Joon Script.html#comments\" title=\"Benny &amp; Joon comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:00:19.991714"}
