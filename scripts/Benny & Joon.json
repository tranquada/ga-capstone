How are you two getting along?\n\nBenny: us? Fine, normal, you know fine. Why?\n\nSW: I\u0092ll level with you. I think its time you gave serious consideration into a group home\n\nBenny: she already has a home\n\nSW: Benny, she needs to be with her peers\n\nBenny: yeah, she hates her peers. She has already quit the two day centres to prove it. Look all we need right now is a new housekeeper\n\nSW: well I know of no one else. You\u0092ve been up and down the list. Now you might want to entertain the possibilities that there are some people more capable of handling these episodes than you. I am beginning to that that you living together may not be the best thing any more\n\nBenny: I\u0092m her brother and her only family. And we\u0092ve done just fine the two of us for 12 years.\n\nSW: yes but her stress level is always a factor in her display of symptoms. Her agitation should be kept to a minimum\n\nBenny: everybody gets agitated sometimes it\u0092s the only option\n\nSW: Benny, don\u0092t get me wrong I\u0092m impressed that you\u0092ve managed this long. But a group home would give her a chance to develop other relationships. Also we don\u0092t know this but what if she was capable of a part time job? They would encourage her in that direction. These are very nice place\u0092s, nurturing, supportive\n\nBenny: I\u0092m not farming her outJoon has held up the traffic and the drivers are getting angry and shouting at her.

Ok. Anything on it?\n\nJoon: raisins\n\nBenny: ok\n\nHe goes downstairs and checks the fridge. There is none left so he goes out to get some. Sam is sat in the tree outside and Joon burns a picture of her and benny when they were children. Sam goes to the door and Joon goes out to him\n\nJoon: Hi\n\nBenny arrives at Ruthie\u0092s house\n\nBenny: hi. How you doin\u0092?\n\nRuthie: you\u0092re out late\n\nBenny: yeah.

Come on\n\nJoon: no its not all in my head\n\nSam: sir? Sir! Stop the bus! Please stop the bus!\n\nBenny is driving back fromRuthie\u0092s and he sees the bus stopped. An ambulance arrives and the crew climb aboard the bus\n\nJoon: I don\u0092t want to talk to you\n\nSam: Joon\n\nAM1: all righty. You want to step out?\n\nSam: yeah ok, ok\n\nAM1: how you doin\u0092 hon.?\n\nJoon: you think I don\u0092t know who you are. I know just who you are. So just leave, leave. Leave! don\u0092t touch me! don\u0092t touch me!\n\nThey grab her and put her in the ambulance. Benny runs to the front of the crowd of people\n\nBenny: Joon, Joon!\n\nHe sees Sam sat in the ambulance\n\nAt the mental hospital\n\nBenny: look I a going to see my sister. Would you please tell me her room number?\n\nWoman: please sir, just come back in the morning\n\nBenny: let me talk to her god damn doctor\n\nIn the social workers room\n\nSW: I\u0092m sorry.

I hope you\u0092re happy with what you have done to her.\n\nHe grabs Sam\n\nBenny: you just stay the hell away from my sister\n\nSam: no, no\n\nBenny: want to know why everybody laughs at you Sam? Because you\u0092re an idiot. You\u0092re a first class moron\n\nSam: you\u0092re scared\n\nBenny: I\u0092m what?\n\nSam you\u0092re scared. I can see it. And you know why? I used to look up to you but know I cant look at you at all.\n\nIt flashes to Joon in bed and Benny walking by the trains. It shows Joon again but awake by the window and Sam at Ruthie\u0092s. Benny is playing with a jack-in-the-box back at the house and Sam is outside the hospital.\n\nAt the video store\n\nSam: I think that Fred Astatine is the way to go\n\nLady: yeah?\n\nSam: that\u0092s a good choice\n\nLady: who\u0092s that woman who starred in the roman\u0085\n\nSam looks up and sees Benny\n\nSam: Audrey hepburn\n\nLady: yeah Sam.

My hands are tied. My hands are tied!\n\nThomas leaves\n\nBenny: what room did he say?\n\nSam: 335\n\nAt the waiting room they sit down. The door opens to the closed ward and Sam throws his hat in the way of the door do it doesn\u0092t close. They go through and as they are walking through the corridors they hear some men coming the other way.\n\nBenny: shit. What are you doing?\n\nSam slides down the hall towards the men\n\nSam: Mommy?\n\nMan1: what are you doing here?\n\nMan2: I don\u0092t think you are supposed to be here\n\nMan3: what room did you come out of?\n\nThe pick him up and carry him back through the door.\n\nMan1: get the door\n\nMan3: how did he get past security?\n\nMan1: hey, watch the door\n\nThe coast is clear so Benny continues until he find Joon\u0092s room.\n\nBenny: Joon, look, I know you want to be left alone but you do not belong in here. Not how would you like to try living in you\u0092re own apartment?\n\nJoon: an apartment?\n\nBenny: yeah! There\u0092s an apartment available in Ruthie\u0092s building\n\nJoon: you\u0092d let me live in an apartment?\n\nBenny: that\u0092s up to you. I\u0092m through making those decisions for you.

He got me in here. He\u0092s somewhere in the building.\n\nJoon: he is not. You\u0092d never let me have him. God. Why do you hate me so much?\n\nBenny: I don\u0092t hate you\n\nJoon: you just need me to be sick\n\nThe social worker enters the waiting room and goes over to the desk.\n\nSW: Juniper Pearl\u0092s chart please. Thank you\n\nThomas sees the men carrying Sam away\n\nThomas: hey wait! Wally! Wait! Wait! Wally put him down. He\u0092s mine. I\u0092ve been looking for him\n\nMan1: you sure?\n\nThomas: yeah I\u0092ll take care of him.

By now Joon would be in a caring and controlled environment. Isn\u0092t it obvious that you two need some distance?\n\nBenny: what don\u0092t we ask Joon what she wants?\n\nOutside\n\nSam is climbing up the building\n\nThomas: Sam what are you doing? Hey Sam come on! Get down right now!\n\nIn Joon\u0092s room\n\nJoon: I don\u0092t know exactly what I want. I do know\u0085 that I am tired of everyone telling me what to do\n\n\n\nOutside\n\nThomas: Sam come down. don\u0092t touch that\n\nSam winds up the window cleaners hoist\n\nThomas: Sam leave that. I\u0092m begging you.\n\nIn Joon\u0092s room\n\nSW: Joon, we want what\u0092s best for you\n\nJoon: I know that\n\nShe sees Sam swinging across the window\n\nJoon: I\u0085\n\nOutside\n\nThomas: Sam come down now. Sam you\u0092re going to get in trouble\n\nInside\n\nJoon: I think I want to try living in my own apartment\n\nBenny looks outside and sees Sam. The social worker looks outside but doesn\u0092t see anything\n\nSW: hmm, I don\u0092t know\n\nOutside\n\nThomas: Sam stop swinging\n\nThe line of the hoist starts to come loose\n\nInside\n\nSW: but I\u0092m willing to let you try. I\u0092ll prepare the papers for her release\n\nBenny: thanks doctor Garvey\n\nOutside\n\nThomas: come down Sam!\n\nThe hoist breaks and Sam falls down\n\nThomas: whoa! Whoa! Are you ok?\n\nSam: ouch, ouch\n\nIn the hospital\n\nJoon tries to say something but cant get the word out\n\nBenny: I know, me too. I\u0092m going to go and check you out. Ok?\n\nJoon: ok\n\nJoon goes out and Sam is waiting for her in a wheel chair. He gets up and they hug\n\nAt Joon\u0092s apartment\n\nBenny pulls up outside and Ruthie is sat on her porch. He hands her some white roses\n\nRuthie: haven\u0092t we tried this before\n\nBenny: yeah but my life\u0092s a lot less complicated now. Is Joon inside?\n\nRuthie: yeah\n\nBenny: ok\n\nHe looks in her room and sees Sam and Joon making grilled cheese with an iron. He leaves her some roses at her door.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nBenny & Joon\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Barry Berman\u00a0\u00a0Lesley McNeil\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:20:43.144150"}
