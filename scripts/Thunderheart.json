Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN\n\n               Something is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light, \n               too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating \n               in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to \n               the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa \n               sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular.\n\n               The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. \n               Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and \n               foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as \n               the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. \n               And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it. \n               Slowly.\n\n               BEGIN CREDITS.\n\n               Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan \n               Tanka - The Great Mystery.\n\n               And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head \n               comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly SLOW \n               MOTION, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN \n               MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his \n               neck.\n\n               Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, \n               backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. Running... his \n               heart pounding. SONG RISING... DRUM POUNDING... FIVE MORE \n               VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song.\n\n               And then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, \n               airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it \n               would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, \n               mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly \n               overtaken by LIVE SPEED, revealing the brutal force of gunfire \n               which has slammed the Indian into the air, throwing him. \n               Slamming him hard into the grass. And it is over as quickly \n               and violently as a deer shot dead.\n\n               LAKOTA SONG ends abruptly.\n\n               LONG SHOT - THE GREAT PLAINS\n\n               the sun burns like lava at the horizon. DRUM beats like a \n               heart. And Somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an OWL. \n               Then Silence. Deep, disturbing stillness.\n\n               EXT.

Superhighway. And off behind it, in the distance, \n               Capital Hill holds imposing vigil, the massive cast iron \n               dome of The Capital, catching the sun. But everything is \n               soon smothered by a METRO BUS, hogging the far lane of the \n               Beltway, leaning on its HORN.\n\n               Good morning.\n\n               And the rock n'roll is everybody's radio, everybody's tempo.\n\n               CARBON MONOXIDE WAVE\n\n               shimmers across the beltway hugging then releasing a solitary \n               vehicle that we stay with... move with... A black Nissan 240 \n               SX, hard-waxed.\n\n               INT. 240 SX - TRAVELING\n\n               Behind the wheel -- an intense young man with close-cropped \n               black hair, eyes hidden by sunglasses. Whatever he does for \n               a living, he does in a suit (not expensive but well-fit. But \n               we might also note that any extra suit cash has gone instead \n               into the silver-plated watch on his left wrist). Lean as a \n               rake, sallow in the cheeks, there is something insatiable \n               about him -- a hungry energy that won't let him go.\n\n               RAY LEVOI, late 20's, early 30's, pulls out of a threatening \n               traffic jam and races on the narrow right between thirty \n               cars and a cement girder.\n\n               EXT. T STREET - OUTSIDE WEST-CENTRAL\n\n               The black SX has jumped off an exit and has entered the light-\n               industrial section of Washington. It pulls up near a loading \n               dock behind an old gray building and several parked cars and \n               vans. Ray steps out, smooths his jacket, locks and SETS HIS \n               CAR ALARM.\n\n               Another young man -- chubby, clean-shaven; in a nicer suit \n               than Ray's -- steps out from a parked Miata, and approaches \n               Ray. CARL PODJWICK balances a coffee, a U.S.A. Today and a \n               black eel-skin briefcase.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Hey.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Hey.

Four, nice, deep ones.\n\n               They stop at the door of a service elevator and Carl breathes. \n               Expanding his chest, exhaling. Ray adjusts Carl's tie for \n               him, his collar. He speaks quietly. Quickly.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Anyone stops us going in, we're with \n                         the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. \n                         We have rug samples.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Rug samples.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         We are one-dimensional, boring \n                         peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.\n\n               Carl nods. Ray hesitates, adjusts his own collar and enters \n               the service elevator. Carl follows. Door closes.\n\n               BEGIN CREDITS END.\n\n               INT. GRAY BUILDING - FENCING OPERATION\n\n               Carl follows Ray into the big sparse room of unfinished \n               sheetrock walls. There is nothing in here but cardboard boxes, \n               and two people; a bearded HISPANIC MAN standing behind a \n               counter, writing on a clipboard. The other is a middle-aged \n               BLACK MAN in a purple silk shirt sitting in a chair with a \n               newspaper held open. He barely looks over the top of the \n               Wall Street Journal.\n\n                                     BLACK MAN\n                         Hey, look who's here.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Louis, my man, what's happenin'?\n\n               Ray walks up to the counter. Carl lingers, fidgeting. Ray \n               sets his briefcase on the counter and click-clicks it open. \n               The Hispanic fence man looks inside, and begins pulling out \n               stacks of treasury checks.\n\n                                     FENCE MAN\n                         Clean ones?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Immaculate.\n\n               Ray gestures to Carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on \n               the counter, fumbles with the first latch. The second. He \n               flips it open.\n\n               The fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of Grade A \n               Treasury. A lot of it. Then his eyes rise to Carl.\n\n                                     FENCE MAN\n                         What ya got there, seventy-five \n                         thousand?\n\n                                     CARL\n                         A hundred and ten.

Ray's eyes flit to Carl.\n\n               Louis crushes his newspaper down and lifts a big Colt Python \n               from his lap just as --\n\n               A section of sheetrock kicks open and THREE FEDERAL OFFICERS \n               bust out, each clutching a handgun, SHOUTING inaudibly.\n\n                                     LOUIS\n                         F.B.I.!

MOVE!\n\n               Carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one \n               knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping \n               him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by \n               the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. But the white \n               collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that --\n\n               Ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets \n               over to the Mr. Coffee. He pours one, and adds some milk. \n               Turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of Sweet \n               n'Low.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Slam dunk.\n\n                                     LOUIS\n                         Beauty. Beauty...\n\n               Ray rests his weight against the coffee station, takes a \n               careful sip. Carl is yanked to his feet by the fence man and \n               he stands there, looking at Ray, baffled. Completely shocked.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- \n                         Larry.

SA MILES is about Cooch's age, balding. SA \n               SHERMAN is closer to Ray's age but instead of a suit like \n               the rest, he favors an army-green jacket. Neither is a South \n               Dakota shit-kicker but transplanted field agents. All four \n               shield their eyes with dark glasses, and here in the Badlands \n               it is wise because the sun makes dunes shimmy and craters \n               become faces. It plays mischief on the eye, making Ray and \n               Sherman nearly trip on --\n\n               A DEAD BODY\n\n               lying face down in the rainbow sand. Dried blood and horse \n               flies cover his blown out torso. The agents stand over him, \n               breathless from the rugged walk.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Who found him?\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Indian kids. Hunting fossils.\n\n               Cooch studies the body from where he stands. Sherman hands a \n               file over to Ray.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Okay. I think Agent Levoi and I can \n                         proceed from here. What are your \n                         call signals?\n\n                                     SHERMAN\n                         PX-10 and 11. Anything we can do to \n                         help you out, just radio.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Good. Thanks, Guys.\n\n               The agents start back through the Badlands. Ray is already \n               squatting a safe distance from the body, covering his nose \n               with a kerchief while looking in the file.\n\n               Cooch takes a bended knee on the other side of the body. \n               Flies buzz on and around the corpse.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Leo Fast Elk... Thirty seven... \n                         single... Member of the Tribal \n                         Council.\n\n               Cooch makes a note then slowly circles the body. He holds a \n               hand out to Ray and the younger agent turns the file over.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Looks like Fast Elk wasn't fast enough \n                         to outrun that load. What do you \n                         make of the damage?\n\n               Ray gets closer, swats at Flies with the folder.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Six rounds. 357.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         That's what it looks like, doesn't \n                         it? But that's what a ten gauge, \n                         choke-bored, shotgun will look like \n                         when it hits your lower back from \n                         five feet away.\n\n               Ray looks up impressed. Cooch rises and walks off gingerly, \n               scanning the surroundings.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Somebody was serious about doing \n                         this guy, that's for sure.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Ray.\n\n               Cooch is standing ten feet away, staring at the ground. Ray \n               walks over, carefully. He follows Cooch's frown down at the \n               twisted layers of earth.\n\n               ON THE GROUND\n\n               a circle has been etched deep in the soft gumbo, and in the \n               center of the circle, a white eagle plume sticks straight \n               up, dancing in the wind.\n\n               Cooch and Ray each lower themselves to their haunches to \n               study the strange sight. Cooch puts his reading glasses on, \n               stares at it. Then lights a cigarette.\n\n               Ray hefts up a camera and begins CLICKING off shots. He starts \n               moving around it, taking shots at different angles. And then \n               the sound of a DISTANT MOTOR draws both agent's attention.\n\n               POV:\n\n               way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a \n               lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of \n               a silvery heat mirage. It's fifty yards off but heading \n               straight for us. The HEARTBEAT DRUM.\n\n               REVERSE - RAY AND COOCH try to make the figure out.\n\n               IN THE BADLANDS\n\n               the archaic mud-caked Harley chugs and stalls, spits and \n               choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep \n               side of this natural wonder. At the throttle is an imposing \n               figure.\n\n               WALTER CROW HORSE is a portly Indian in his late-thirties \n               with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems \n               to have been cast from a bust of Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull \n               with aviator shades. Denim jacket over checkered shirt. Faded \n               jeans. Well broken duct-taped boots. His hair is worn long \n               in tight duel braids.\n\n               The rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling \n               out, twenty feet or so from the murder site. Crow Horse swings \n               his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse. He looks \n               around suspiciously then pulls a rolled-up blanket from the \n               carrier rack.\n\n               LEO LITTLE SKY\n\n               lies in death. Crow Horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking \n               like saddle leather.\n\n               He squats and looks at the corpse... then looks around with \n               animal alertness. He reaches into the front pocket of his \n               jacket and pulls out some Bull Durham tobacco. He pinches \n               some and offers it to the four directions around the body.\n\n               He then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man... \n               sense something and wheels to see Cooch standing behind him, \n               one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other \n               hand holding up open wallet. The sun hits his badge.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Good morning.\n\n               Crow Horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second \n               before Ray steps out, his .45 drawn but held at ease.\n\n               Crow Horse slowly raises his arms as Ray moves up to him, \n               studying him.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Taking ol' Leo somewhere?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Leo's been out here too long, man. \n                         I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         This is a restricted area.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Check him out, Ray.\n\n               Ray frisks the Indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then \n               a gun.

A long, dead of South Dakota, Badlands pause. Cooch \n               turns and looks at Ray who holds up the open wallet, revealing \n               a badge. Like Cooch's it shines in the sun.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Walter Crow Horse. Tribal Police.\n\n               Cooch stands staring at the Indian... then takes a few steps \n               over to Ray and grabs the wallet. He examines it. Then looks \n               at Crow Horse and laughs.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         He's a fucking cop.\n\n               The Indian cop has plenty of time to get up on his own but \n               he kneels there, tauntingly, waiting for Ray to help him. \n               Ray walks over and offers a hand. Crow Horse takes it, and \n               pulls himself up, looking square into Ray's sunglasses.\n\n               Cooch walks over and hands the officer his wallet, and his \n               .23. Crow Horse takes the items, eyeing the older agent.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         We got the wire ya was comin'.

Crow Horse nods to Ray, and Ray nods back \n               in case it's the Indian thing to do. Crow Horse nods again. \n               Ray nods again.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. \n                         He's gotta make the journey.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         What journey?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Tell him, Ray.\n\n               Ray stares at Crow Horse, uneasy.

He starts his motor. It dies. Then starts again.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Keeping of the souls.

DWIGHT YOAKUM croons \"Youuuuuu-\n               Got-Your Little-Ways\" on the jukebox from inside.\n\n               The Buffalo Butte bar has several cracked and sun-bleached \n               buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big \n               faded white letters painted across the front read: \"No Indians \n               Allowed.\"\n\n               (This sign actually exists today in the res-line border town \n               of Scenic, South Dakota). The car pulls up beside a pick-up \n               and parks. Ray and Cooch step out, careful to walk wide around \n               a PITBULL in the bed of the truck.\n\n               A WHITE LOCAL walks out of the bar and looks askance at the \n               suits. As the two feds approach the bar, Cooch looks up at \n               the warning sign. Ray sees it too.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Sorry, Ray.

I'll bring you out \n                         a cheeseburger.\n\n               The young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but --\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Hey!\n\n               Ray spins quickly, paranoid about entering. But the man \n               calling to them is --\n\n               An Indian himself. TRIBAL PRESIDENT OLIVER CLEAR MOON, a \n               small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents \n               through fat bifocals. He wears a straw cowboy hat, red \n               windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or \"bobtailed\" as the \n               Indians say.\n\n               Clear Moon is walking away from a parked pick-up truck, toward \n               the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                              (heavy Indian accent)\n                         You made it. Was-te.\n\n               Cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the \n               man\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         You must be...

You must be the Sioux.\n\n               He is pointing his long, skinny finger at Cooch.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         No. That's Ray here.

Pleasure.\n\n               Clear Moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile \n               breaking across his flaccid brown skin. He takes Ray's hand \n               in a respectful double-clutch and grips him tightly... almost \n               desperately.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         It's about time they sent us one of \n                         our own. Was-te.\n\n               He keeps pumping Ray's hand, looking into his face with great \n               admiration. Cooch looks on with amusement.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         Things are no good here. It is like \n                         war zone. We need an official who \n                         understands what is good for the \n                         Indian people. Who knows Indian way.\n\n               Clear Moon has not released Ray's arm as he leads them to a \n               string of seedy motel units across the street.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I thought we were staying on the \n                         reservation.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are \n                         on Indian land.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I see.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         Are you hungry?

He hasn't had \n                         any Indian food in days...\n\n               And Clear Moon guides them through the front door of room \n               13. Ray looks over his shoulder threateningly at Cooch who \n               winks and pats his back.\n\n               EXT. RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT\n\n               A lone headlight appears out of the black. HEARTBEAT DRUM. \n               But faster. Relentless. A \"res\" car, a dented, rusted, peeling \n               old station wagon, drives slowly toward the reservation.\n\n               Then suddenly, someone steps in front of the car. A BIG MAN \n               in cowboy boots and blue jeans.\n\n               INT. MOTEL - ROOM 13 - NIGHT\n\n               Ray lies in bed. Awake. He is hanging off the bed with a \n               file open on the floor and using the moon to light photos \n               and memorandums. And then he hears LAUGHTER outside. And \n               GLASS BREAK.\n\n               He gets out of bed quickly, snatching up his pants, putting \n               their on, and going to the window.\n\n               POV - OUT WINDOW:\n\n               SEVERAL LOCALS out in front of the bar help a middle-aged \n               INDIAN MAN out of the station wagon.\n\n                                     WHITE LOCAL\n                         Where you goin'? Back to the res?\n\n               A young local bends down behind the Indian while another \n               shoves him, sending him tripping over the bent man and onto \n               his back in the dirt.\n\n                                     WHITE LOCAL\n                         What ya doin'? You drunk?\n\n               MORE LOCALS come out from the bar, beers and drinks and \n               interested in what's going on.\n\n               REVERSE - RAY\n\n               at the window, observes. Cooch enters from the connecting \n               room, puffy-eyed but quickly buttoning his shirt. He shares \n               Ray's view.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Let's take a walk.\n\n               Ray is transfixed.\n\n               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE BAR - NIGHT\n\n               The Indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by \n               another white man as a little game of catch takes place. \n               Cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair \n               a mess, looks on. Then steps in front of a big local and \n               catches the Indian as he comes stumbling. He holds onto him, \n               looking at the faces that turn his way. Ray steps up beside \n               him, looking tense.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         What's goin' on here?\n                              (a beat)\n                         I can't walk across the goddamn street \n                         without some breed-ass fallin' all \n                         over me?\n\n               And then Cooch shoves the Indian with all his might back \n               across the road. The locals resume their fun, and Cooch looks \n               at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes Ray \n               do a serious take.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray, \n                         wants a kiss --\n\n               The Indian ends up stumbling back toward Ray, and Ray catches \n               him this time. The man maintains a perfect vacant expression \n               and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening. \n               But he is dizzy, and exhausted, and Ray keeps him from \n               falling.\n\n               Cooch looks at Ray. Their eyes meet. Ray shoves the man \n               forward. This time, instead of catching him, the local on \n               the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face. \n               The Indian drops.\n\n               Cooch runs in, grabs the Indian under the arms and drags him \n               back to his car.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on \n                         your sacred land. Get outta here.\n\n               He shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around. \n               They don't see Cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and \n               lean into the man's ear.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Get outta here. Drive.\n\n               Cooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches \n               forward. A beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls \n               clanking into the middle of the road.\n\n               Ray stands there with the locals as they all watch the car \n               drive off across the reservation line. Cooch, belly sticking \n               out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his \n               face, heads to the bar without breaking stride. This man has \n               done \"underground\" before.\n\n               INT.

In the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and \n               the grass, there is much junk stored, and Ray kneels to look. \n               He is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud. \n               He picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud. \n               His fingers break through the hardened crust and come back \n               moist and blue. He looks at this sniffs it. There is a tense, \n               water-torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water \n               barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. Ray sets the boot \n               down.

As in medicine man?\n\n               Crow Horse nods slowly, looking at Ray in a very serious \n               manner\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Why does he wanna see me?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Good question. Hardly sees anybody \n                         anymore. Hasn't left this place in \n                         twenty years. Did you bring some \n                         tobacco?\n\n               Crow Horse stops walking, making Ray do the same.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         When you go see an elder, you always \n                         bring some tobacco as a gift.\n\n               Ray reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a pack of \n               Marlboro. Crow Horse glances at it, and shrug-nods. They \n               continue on toward the trailer.\n\n               INT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER\n\n               Grandpa Samuel Reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy \n               chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side. We \n               recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at Looks Twice' \n               although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more \n               youthful look despite a face like a map of the Badlands.\n\n               He wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old \n               cowboy boots.\n\n               His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the Marlboro \n               pack as if he's reading braille.\n\n               Crow Horse sits across from him on a stool. Ray leans on one \n               of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable. A three \n               foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with \n               dead ones. There is a black and white TV with Sesame Street \n               wailing, honking and guffawing through static.\n\n               Grandpa fixes his eyes on Ray for only split seconds at a \n               time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep \n               reading of the young man. Slowly, he sits up -- focusing \n               intensely on Ray.\n\n               He begins to speak. A hoarse, strained, string of LAKOTA, \n               spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward Ray. When he \n               finishes, he sits back in his chair. Ray looks intrigued.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         What did he say?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         He wants to know if you ever watch \n                         the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie \n                         Monster is not to be trusted -- a \n                         trickster.\n\n               Ray looks puzzled. Crow Horse laughs bull-wild as Grandpa \n               takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly. The old \n               man begins speaking Indian again.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         He says there's something wrong with \n                         Big Bird -- he's crazy,\n                              (stops laughing)\n                         He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony \n                         last night...?\n\n               Crow Horse turns a questioning look at Ray. Ray doesn't \n               flinch.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         But he is not unhappy with you because \n                         he knows you.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         He knows me?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         He says he saw you in a vision some \n                         time ago.\n\n               Crow Horse stops translating suddenly even though the old \n               man continues speaking. Crow Horse looks concerned, and ASKS \n               A QUESTION IN LAKOTA. We don't know what he's asking but the \n               tone is absolute amazement.\n\n               This question triggers an exchange between he and Grandpa, \n               the old one getting angry. Grandpa wins.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         I guess he had this vision some time \n                         ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees -- \n                         uh, back in the winter. He says you \n                         come from Wasi'cu city in the East \n                         but that your people... way back... \n                         are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But \n                         you yourself don't know that.\n\n               Ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old Indian, \n               absorbing the translation. Grandpa speaks more fervently \n               now, incorporating Indian sign. Each time Grandpa does the \n               hard Sioux HAND SLAP, Ray blinks.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         He says he knew you'd be coming to \n                         Bear Creek. He was told. It is the \n                         will of Tunkasilia -- the grandfather \n                         that you come here. He says let's \n                         smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, \n                         symbol of truth. So that there will \n                         be no lies between us.\n\n               The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone \n               bowl from a beaded pipe bag. He joins the two together then \n               begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four Directions. \n               While this goes on, Ray fidgets.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         What's he smoke in that?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, \n                         we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture \n                         in The Pipe. That's a white man's \n                         myth. This is a sacrament.\n\n               The old man is offering the pipe to Ray.\n\n                                     GRANDPA\n                         Mltaku Oyasin.\n\n               Ray looks at Grandpa. The old man offers the pipe again.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         You don't smoke with him, it means \n                         you're hiding something.\n\n               Ray takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to Crow \n               Horse. The big Indian takes it from Ray, giving him a long \n               eye, then offering the pipe to The Directions before smoking.\n\n               Crow Horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases \n               some smoke upward. Ray watches it climb and fade. The old \n               man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. He speaks.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred \n                         year old turtleshell rattle, passed \n                         down from the Grandfathers. Heavy \n                         duty.\n\n               He shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of \n               Ray. He speaks just above a whisper.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         He says, it is good. The Spirits are \n                         here. The Spirits want to know what \n                         you're doing here?\n\n               Ray smirks.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Tell him I'm trying to find the man \n                         who murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him \n                         if he knows where he is.\n\n               Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota. No answer. The pipe \n               is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the Directions, to \n               the Earth then upward before smoking himself. He begins to \n               speak again.\n\n               Passionately. In long glottal Sioux sentences, adding sign, \n               fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there,\n\n               He is working himself into an excited state, and Ray keeps \n               looking at Crow Horse, very interested in the old man's \n               answer.\n\n               Finally Grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he \n               ends his oratory with a solid hand slap.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         What did he say?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         He said he doesn't know.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         He just did the Gettysburg Address \n                         in Sioux. What did he say?\n\n               Crow Horse ignores him. Grandpa speaks again. More hand \n               language.\n\n               The old man is staring at Ray while whispering to Crow Horse. \n               He strokes his badger claw necklace.\n\n               Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate this \n               new piece of information.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one \n                         stops by here without gettin' stuck \n                         in the old Indian barter. He, uh... \n                         he likes your shades.\n\n               Grandpa smiles toothlessly. Ray who has his driving glasses \n               in hand, lifts them to say \"these?\" but Grandpa sees it as \n               an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. He holds \n               it out.\n\n               Ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes \n               the necklace. Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so does \n               Grandpa, enjoying a good trade. He draws a hand through the \n               air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal. \n               Ray looks confused. Out of his element. And out of his shades.\n\n               Another fly gets snagged on sticky tape.\n\n               EXT. GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER\n\n               Crow Horse is hurrying toward his bike, Ray with him.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         What was he saying?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Why should I tell you.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Because he was talking to me.\n\n               Crow Horse keeps walking.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Does he know something?\n\n               Crow Horse stops walking and eyes Ray, deliberating.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         The old man saw an owl.

Held in the center of a huge arbor. \n               This DANCER, a traditional Kit Fox dancer, is dressed in \n               authentic costume and is dancing with TEN OTHERS dressed in \n               various traditional garb and paints.\n\n               Under the arbor, TWO HUNDRED INDIANS in modern clothing sit \n               on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing. A group \n               of SINGERS sit around a big drum, beating on it, and wailing \n               the song that keeps the dancers hopping.\n\n               SIXTY CARS (res beaters) are parked off around the arbor, \n               less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes.

Hoka \n                         Hey!\n\n               An OLD-INDIAN MAN sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy \n               hat and reaches down toward a blanket. He brings up his VFW \n               hat, adorned with medals and puts it on. Slowly, he rises, \n               and shuffles out to the center pole along with --\n\n               FOUR OTHER VETERANS who have exchanged cowboy hats for \n               veteran's caps. There is even a traditional dancer in there, \n               wearing a veteran cap. As a mournful WAR SONG is banged out \n               by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans. An \n               American Flag. Unrolled, and set on the mast. And together, \n               all five Indian men, hoist --\n\n               THE AMERICAN FLAG\n\n               high. Slowly it climbs. Proudly. It blows in the hot South \n               Dakota wind.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR\n\n               Ray stands, watching this. And then the SONG ENDS. A loud, \n               angry voice breaks across the P.A.\n\n               AT THE CROW'S NEST (CALLER'S BOOTH)\n\n               ANDERSON CHASING HAWK, a young Indian in ribbon shirt and \n               long hair has taken possession of the microphone. SIX W.A.R.N. \n               MEMBERS stand behind him. He speaks loud, firm, with the \n               sharp gestures of an old way Chief.\n\n                                     CHASING HAWK\n                         What is that that you honor there, \n                         uncles? After all the Wasi'cu country \n                         has done to you, after all he still \n                         does to you, you honor that flag?! \n                         That flag has been desecrated by the \n                         United States, because they have not \n                         honored what that flag represents!\n\n               The veterans just stand under the flag, solemn, looking at \n               Chasing Hawk. The flag undulates soundlessly.\n\n                                     CHASING HAWK (O.S.)\n                         To them, we are the Bank of America. \n                         Whenever they get into a little \n                         difficulty, they go to The Bank, \n                         withdraw a little land, withdraw a \n                         little oil --\n\n               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR\n\n               the four FBI agents stand, watching.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         Okay. Here we go.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Who's this guy?\n\n                                     SHERMAN\n                         Anderson Chasing Hawk. Second in \n                         command behind Jimmy.\n\n               AT THE CROW'S NEST\n\n               Chasing Hawk hands the mic over to another Warrior. MAGGIE \n               EAGLE BEAR would be the most beautiful woman Ray has even \n               seen if she was not the meanest-looking. Her thick black \n               hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse-hair \n               belt. Her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots. \n               And she is full of fire. She begins speaking in LAKOTA. \n               Fluently. And with hand sign, like the old man.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE ARBOR\n\n               the agents stand. Cooch is writing into a small notebook.\n\n                                     SHERMAN\n                         Magedelana Eagle Bear. Eagle's claws \n                         and a bear's balls.\n\n                                     MILES\n                         She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in \n                         her truck. And she'll use it.\n\n               As Ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile \n               manner. It is President Clear Moon, looking very upset. He \n               holds the hand of a LITTLE GIRL, dressed in traditional \n               dancing garb.\n\n               He approaches Ray.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Mr. Clear Moon.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         Our police are afraid of them. Please \n                         get them out of here.\n\n               Clear Moon gestures for the little girl to run off. He leans \n               in close to Ray.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         They're going to kill me next. That's \n                         what I hear. These new Indians are \n                         destroying everything. Our people \n                         are a quiet people.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let \n                         them go. We're tightening the net on \n                         him. We know he's on the reservation.\n\n               Clear Moon is looking past Ray at the Warriors. They are \n               approaching the agents, and Clear Moon looks at Ray with \n               great concern.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         Help us.\n\n               And he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor.\n\n               Chasing Hawk, Maggie and the other Warriors strut up to the \n               agents. All but one who is bound to a wheelchair. We've seen \n               RICHARD YELLOW BIRD, the big Cheyenne who wears a Red Power \n               baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals -- in one of \n               the file photos. His arms are plastered with tattoos.\n\n                                     AGENT SHERMAN\n                         Where's Jimmy? We thought he'd be \n                         dancing today.\n\n               The warriors make a show of not acknowledging the FBI \n               presence. They have walked over here just to walk by them. \n               That is there statement. But Yellow Bird stops cranking the \n               wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at Ray.\n\n                                     YELLOW BIRD\n                         Are you the Washington Redskin?\n\n               Even the agents crack grins at this bit of Indian wit. All \n               but Ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest, \n               considering the crippled activist.\n\n                                     AGENT MILES\n                         Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird, \n                         Ray.\n\n               Yellow Bird sits there, staring up at him through thick \n               glasses But then Maggie Eagle Bear takes the handles of Yellow \n               Bird's wheel chair. She looks at Ray with eyes that are choke-\n               cherry black, eyes that look right through him. He returns \n               the glare. And then she pushes Yellowbird forward and leaves \n               the feds alone.\n\n               Ray turns to Cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and \n               concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander \n               under the arbor, visiting people. LAKOTA SINGERS start up.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Ray, get to Jimmy's place and keep \n                         it tight. I'm gonna get a tail on \n                         his Warriors.\n\n               IN THE POWWOW CENTER\n\n               the under ten year-old \"fancy dance\" -- TWENTY-FIVE INDIAN \n               CHILDREN, whirling and stomping and dancing.\n\n               JIMMY LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The battered old house sits under a full moon. The upside \n               down flag moves slightly in the cross winds.\n\n               ACROSS THE ROAD\n\n               several junked cars. Among them a black, rusted out VW van \n               with a smashed windshield. A PACK OF RES DOGS sniff at its \n               tires.\n\n               INT. JIMMY'S VAN\n\n               In the dim light, a boot. A black cowboy boot. Up on the \n               dash. Bluejeans. T-shirt. Second hand leather. And a black \n               cowboy hat. Ray is staking out Jimmy's house.\n\n               Across the passenger seat and console is an M-16 rifle. On \n               his belt, a .357 Red Hawk. He yawns. From outside, he hears \n               a sound.\n\n               POV: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG with a \n               missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and \n               salivating.\n\n               RAY breaks off a piece of sandwich and drops it down to him \n               just as -- HEADLIGHTS catch his face. He slides down low, \n               watching an old pick-up truck creak onto the dirt road, \n               leading to Jimmy's.\n\n               POV: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully. Indian. \n               Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside.\n\n               RAY lifts his radio.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         X22.

And hold \n                         him. Over.\n\n               Ray sets his radio down, unclips the leather guard on his \n               handgun. Picks up the Big Mac.\n\n               EXT. LOOKS TWICE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out. \n               In the dark we cannot latch onto features.\n\n               Suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road, \n               racing toward the running Indian who gets the door of the \n               truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as --\n\n               Ray leaps out, M-16 in hand.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         FBI, freeze, Motherfucker -- drop \n                         it, drop it!\n\n               Ray maneuvers in Quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the \n               Indian's back. The Indian drops what he's holding. And turns \n               around. It's not a he. We've seen her before. At the Powwow. \n               Maggie Eagle Bear. Her hair is pulled back tight, braided.\n\n               Ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still \n               cautious\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Turn around, put your hands on the \n                         roof of the truck.\n\n               She does what he tells her. As Ray moves in on her, he notices \n               an INDIAN CHILD sitting in the passenger seat, looking out \n               into the highbeams, frightened.\n\n               Ray toes Maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one-handed, \n               pats down her boots.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         You're the Indian FBI.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         That's right. Turn around.\n\n               Maggie turns around, looks Ray in the eye. He looks self-\n               conscious in the cowboy hat.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         The people are glad they sent you. \n                         They usually send in guys who come \n                         at ya with highbeams, screamin' \"drop \n                         it, Motherfucker\", stick a gun in \n                         your face, frisk ya down.

He gets in his car.\n\n               In the yard, Ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to \n               follow. He chases it away. And then as he gets closer to the \n               van, he looks up to investigate the COOING SOUND.\n\n               AT THE TOP OF THE FLAG POLE\n\n               there is a shadow. What looks to be a large bird. It just \n               hovers. In the shadows.\n\n               DOWN BELOW\n\n               Ray looks up at the pole, watching. Then walking on.\n\n               EXT. BEAR CREEK RES - SUNRISE\n\n               Mind-blowing sunrise of airbrush red. Clusters of lodge-pole \n               pine. The spectacular mesa.

He steps down into the sage clusters \n               that grow just off his trailer, and offers the plate up toward \n               the sky.\n\n               He then stoops, and scrapes a half-eaten English muffin, \n               some potato chips and half a banana onto the Earth in a neat \n               pile.\n\n               He straightens his back the best he can, looks up again, and \n               prays softly.\n\n               THE BADLANDS\n\n               possess an otherworldly beauty at this magic hour, a maze of \n               shadows and rainbows. In the distance we cannot mistake the \n               frame of Walter Crow Horse. He's out there, long hair blowing \n               against the white bluffs. Stalking. Tracking.\n\n               ON THE VILLAGE ROAD\n\n               a puppy chases a hen in a klutzy, innocent manner then bumps \n               into the tire of a parked car. Taking a shot at doghood, he \n               hikes his leg, squirts a hubcap belonging to --\n\n               Cooch's Le Baron. Cooch leans on the hood, drinking a coffee \n               from a foam-plastic cup, and supervising SIX G-MEN who have \n               a map spread out over the hood and are discussing it.\n\n               MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE\n\n               is way out in a remote corner of the res, a little home, \n               trailer and tipi right on the river. The river is rushing \n               hard this morning, catching the light of the sun. Maggie's \n               truck is parked in front.\n\n               Out at the river, Maggie, her hair long and unbrushed, and \n               wearing an extra large T-shirt and nothing else is hauling \n               water in buckets from the river.\n\n               THREE INDIAN CHILDREN are with her, helping her. Near the \n               house, an OLD WOMAN in bifocal glasses, feeds some chickens, \n               and a cat that gathers with the chickens and eats feed.\n\n               INT. OLD VAN \u0096 NEAR MAGGIE'S\n\n               Ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on \n               the distant house. He opens a carton of milk, drinks some. \n               Then hears a whimpering. In the passenger seat sits the three \n               legged res dog. Ray has taken him with him. He drinks some \n               milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so \n               the dog can lap it up. Ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his \n               head.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         For all I know, you're Jimmy.

Milk is good \n                         for you --\n\n               The dog is lapping the milk, desperately. And then a ROARING. \n               A motorcycle.\n\n               IN THE SIDE MIRROR: Crow Horse, racing up on the left of the \n               van. Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. The motorcycle \n               passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can \n               flip Ray the middle finger. Then he races on, far down the \n               road.\n\n               Ray sits there, shaking his head. He'll let it go. Bullshit. \n               He starts the car.\n\n               EXT. TRIBAL POLICE SHOOTING RANGE - DAWN\n\n               Crow Horse guns in, sliding in dirt up to the run-down, low \n               budget shooting range -- six plastic milk jugs on sticks, \n               jammed in the mud.\n\n               A moment later, the van hammers in. Parks. Ray gets out. \n               He's removed his hat so as not to invite any crap from Crow \n               Horse.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Don't be mad.

His laughter simmers and he gets serious.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked \n                         it out.

DIRT ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S - RES - NIGHT\n\n               The van sits parked down the road from Maggie's dimly-lit \n               home. Ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house. LOCUSTS \n               make a steady and unnerving sound. It is black. Black under \n               big sky. Ray lets his head sag out the open window and he \n               takes in the vastness.\n\n               POV: stars. Millions of stars. And an incredible full moon. \n               It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. The top \n               half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red.\n\n               REVERSE - RAY\n\n               stares at it, lost in thought. From Maggie's house, he hears \n               someone SINGING. Singing a traditional SUNDANCE SONG while \n               they haul water from the creek. A WOMAN'S VOICE, trilling \n               out the beautiful but haunting \"hey-o-hey-o-hey-o-hey-ohhhhh.\"\n\n               Ray just sits, listening. And then something draws his \n               attention to his rearview mirror.\n\n               The res dog, lying in the back seat is GROWLING. Lip curled \n               back, growling low.\n\n               Ray looks at him, looks out the window. Blackness. Nothing \n               but the sound of locusts. And a slight crosswind in the wheat \n               fields. The dog stops growling.

The rear windshield is SHATTERED by an explosion. \n               Ray throws himself low across the passenger seat -- BOOOOOM! \n               The driver's side window and part of the door explodes.\n\n               RES ROAD NEAR EAGLE BEAR'S\n\n               The federal van is HAMMERED BY GUNFIRE.

Ray \n               vanishes, too. It is quiet for a moment, then Ray, pops up \n               ten feet away, and UNLOADS THE M-16, in a left to right, \n               clean sweep before dropping again.

Behind the truck is a fed car which stops at the \n               motel, and the Le Baron which also pulls in.

On the \n               archaic juke box, RANDY TRAVIS sings \"Old 8x10\" while behind \n               the bar, the BAR OWNER, an old man with long white hair and \n               beard, busies himself with leather work. SEVERAL WHITE LOCALS \n               sit on the old water drum bar stools.\n\n               Heads lift, turn when Ray enters in his \"fraternizing\" clothes -- \n               jeans and boots, leather jacket. He scuffs up thick sawdust \n               as he heads to the furthest booth back where --\n\n               Crow Horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer.

Get the Jesus up, \n                         and get the Jesus out or I'm gonna \n                         go out to my truck and come back \n                         with my hardware.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Woh, hold on there, Jack, you're --\n\n                                     RANCHER'S SON\n                         -- don't \"jack\" me, Squanto. I'll \n                         bury your lazy ass right here.\n\n               Ray realizes now that they think he's Indian, too. Crow Horse \n               sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking \n               LAKOTA to Ray.\n\n               The rancher grabs Ray by the cheeks.\n\n                                     RANCHER'S SON\n                         I'm talkin' to --\n\n               Ray decks him. Backhands him in the solar plexus then, lays \n               a burner of a Quantico roundhouse to his ear, knocking him \n               across the bar, over a mop and bucket and into sawdust.\n\n               The others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in, \n               holding them back, and sticking himself in the way. It is \n               Brooks. The old timer Ray met his first night here.\n\n                                     BROOKS\n                         No! No, you butt holes! He ain't \n                         skin! He AIN'T SKIN!\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Yeah he's In'dn. Miniconjou Sioux.\n\n               The rancher's son who is coming back with a broken beer \n               bottle, slows his step and shifts his eyes from Brooks to \n               the young fed There is a lot of heavy breathing. But no \n               talking just yet. The young rancher eyes Ray.\n\n                                     RANCHER'S SON\n                         You ain't Indian?\n\n               Ray just stands tense, staring at him. And it's strange. \n               Because he hasn't really looked like he has any Indian blood \n               up to this moment. But dressed the way he is, and his eyes \n               glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed \n               although that's probably the Italian. But Ray doesn't answer \n               the question. Crow Horse starts laughing. Drunkenly.\n\n                                     OLDER RANCHER\n                         What's so damn funny?\n\n                                     CROW HORSE\n                         Well, it's just that the cavalry \n                         used to always threaten the Lakota. \n                         The cavalry ain't around anymore. \n                         The Lakota still are.\n\n                                     RANCHER'S SON\n                         I got no trouble tellin' where you \n                         come from, Fat Red.\n\n               Crow Horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor, \n               leaving the bar. Brooks is whispering to the others, \n               apparently about who Ray is. The bar man comes up to Ray, \n               holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer. Ray looks \n               at it for a moment.\n\n                                     BAR MAN\n                         Sorry. On the house.\n\n               Ray knocks the tray out of his hand, spilling beer and whiskey \n               all over the bar man and the locals around him.\n\n               And he walks out, leaving the locals confused.\n\n               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING - RES - DAY\n\n               Ray looks strung-out as he drives. If it's not the conflict \n               at the Butte, it's the dangerous seed Crow Horse planted, \n               and it is playing with his mind.

She's been all \n                         over the res, riling up the \n                         traditionals, telling them not to \n                         break, and to keep Jimmy in hiding. \n                         She's a problem now.

WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - DAY\n\n               Maggie's old pick-up is parked near an arch gate of the tiny \n               cemetery where a tall monument is fenced off from other graves \n               There are tobacco offerings and other medicines hanging on \n               the fence and on the monument.\n\n               It is a quiet place. Still.\n\n               Maggie stands before the unkempt monument in her denim jacket, \n               her hair blowing across her face in the wind. She PRAYS IN \n               LAKOTA.\n\n               Behind her TEN CHILDREN from the Bear Creek School stand, \n               heads bowed respectfully. Two of them sit on the lap of \n               Richard Yellow Bird who looks on from his wheelchair, praying \n               quietly with Maggie. When Maggie completes her prayer, she \n               ties some tobacco to the monument then turns and faces the \n               children. One of them, a LITTLE GIRL -- heavy-set -- raises \n               a hand that we might note is deformed. As many of the children \n               we have seen on the res, are.\n\n                                     LITTLE GIRL\n                         Are they all right under here?\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         Two-hundred and sixty-seven men, \n                         women, old people.

All but one boy, who isn't paying \n               attention. He is staring up at a hill, off in the distance.\n\n               MAGGIE'S POV: on the hill, a figure stands, hands in his \n               pockets, hair blowing in the wind.

Behind her an HONORING SONG, sung by ten children haunts \n               the still air.\n\n               He doesn't budge as she mounts the gentle bluff and joins \n               him there.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         We're praying at the grave.

Or for \n                         what you think is power.\n\n               As if exhausted by the thought, Maggie sits down on the bluff, \n               looking out at the children who are still singing the song. \n               As she speaks, she begins digging her fingers in the earth. \n               Ray stands over her.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         You burned an American flag today. \n                         And left it for me...\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         -- You desecrated it, it had to be \n                         burned.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I desecrated it?\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         You forced an innocent man to run \n                         like an animal.

Then toward the long dark \n               silhouette of a mountain range across the plains.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         See those Black Hills out there, \n                         Ray? When the people lost the land \n                         in 1868, the government took \n                         everything but those hills. They \n                         allowed us to keep those Black Hills, \n                         to live there. Signed a treaty. Until \n                         they found gold. Then they told us \n                         we had to leave because of National \n                         interest. They broke that treaty. \n                         Anyone who fought or spoke out against \n                         it, wound up dead or in jail. And \n                         the people wound up here. On a \n                         reservation.\n\n               While she looks off at Paha Sapa, Ray stares at her profile.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         While up there, in the Black Hills... \n                         they carved the faces of four \n                         presidents.\n\n               She looks at Ray with an ironic smile, and she catches him \n               transfixed.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         Your relatives must've taught you \n                         something.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         NO.\n                              (after thought)\n                         My father never told anybody he had \n                         Indian blood.

Ray reaches inside his jacket and takes \n               out five polaroids. He shuffles them as he ponders. He hands \n               one to Maggie who has caught herself opening up too much to \n               the Wasi'cu.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         You ever see that car before?\n\n               Maggie looks at the first photo and says nothing.

He thinks for a long moment, \n               pinches the bridge of his nose, then looks out at the Black \n               Hills, pensive.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I didn't see you today, Maggie.\n                              (a beat)\n                         Goodbye.\n\n               Maggie watches him go.

She stands on the bluff, her hair riding the wind \n               and her eyes searing. And then her lips do something that \n               might qualify as half a smile. A sense of humor rising up \n               through anger. Survival humor.\n\n               Ray looks at her for a long moment. And then he walks on, \n               leaving her there.\n\n               INT.

THUNDER ROLLS like the slow, \n               deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills. He opens his \n               eyes, looks out the window.\n\n               POV: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the children \n               into the back of her truck. She helps them get a tarp over \n               their heads. Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab \n               of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it \n               in.\n\n               She gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road.\n\n               EXT. LE BARON - WOUNDED KNEE \u0096 STRANGE TWILIGHT\n\n               Ray steps out of the car into the rain and closes the door. \n               He stares at the burial grounds. Then slowly, he starts toward \n               them as if magnetically drawn. HEARTBEAT DRUM.\n\n               A shroud of mist lays over the cemetery, growing thicker as \n               the rain falls harder. DRUM BEATS DEEPER. Ray is walking \n               toward the memorial, getting drenched. Then he hears something \n               strange. HOOFBEATS.\n\n               RAY'S POV:\n\n               coming down the dirt road, toward him, a HORSEMAN drives his \n               mount at a fast trot. The rider is only a vague image in the \n               mist, his face hidden. As he rides closer, we can make out a \n               shotgun in his hand. And he throws it up, takes aim.\n\n               REVERSE - RAY\n\n               paralyzed for a moment. And then going for his gun. But it's \n               not there. He's left it in the car. He breaks into a run. \n               But there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and \n               the car and Ray has no choice but to turn and flee.\n\n               His boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and \n               desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy \n               slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking.\n\n               His legs and arms churning, his face contorted. And then \n               someone passes him out, running just as hard. AN INDIAN WOMAN \n               in 1890 Winter rags, clutching a BABY to her breast and \n               CRYING. SCREAMING. Ray looks at her, incredulous as he runs. \n               But he keeps running.\n\n               The rider is right behind him. He FIRES. The GUNSHOT CRACKS \n               the sky like thunder. BOOOOM!\n\n               INT. LE BARON \u0096 TWILIGHT\n\n               Ray jumps awake. Cooch is POUNDING on the window. And the \n               three-legged dog inside is BARKING. Ray quickly rolls the \n               window down, letting in THUNDER.\n\n               Cooch starts to say something then takes note of Ray's peaked \n               face. Sweat runs down his temples, beads at his nose.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Jesus, you alright?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Yeah.

His eyes seek out Ray who stands in the doorway, M-16 \n               in hand, looking concerned. He stares at Ray.\n\n               Cooch storms into a back bedroom, Miles moves to a window. \n               Sherman stands over the old man.\n\n                                     SHERMAN\n                         Where is he, Sam?

GRANDPA REACHES TRAILER\n\n               In a blizzard of rain, Jimmy Looks Twice in a cowboy shirt, \n               jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the Airstream, clutching \n               his medicine bundle. FLOODLIGHTS HIT him from all directions. \n               BULLHORNS screaming at him.\n\n               He tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. Ray, \n               having run out the back door has slammed right into him. He \n               has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a \n               split second before he is converged on. Guns at his back, at \n               his head.\n\n               He is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked.

He is looking at the trailer \n               and there on the rickety porch is Grandpa. He comes down the \n               steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. He watches \n               the cars pulling out.\n\n               Ray walks over to him, looking sick.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Look...

My mother hid \n                         me in the snow in a blanket. One of \n                         those killed was a Holy Man called \n                         Wakiyan Cante -- Thunder Heart. They \n                         killed him while he was running for \n                         The Stronghold. It is his blood -- \n                         the same blood that spilled on the \n                         grass and snow at Wounded Knee -- \n                         that runs through your heart like a \n                         buffalo.\n\n               Ray frowns, disturbed by this story.\n\n               The old man is speaking with conviction. With power.\n\n                                     GRANDPA\n                         Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to \n                         a troubled place to help his people. \n                         That's what I am told. Maybe you're \n                         right and I am mistaken. Your mind \n                         is young, mine is old. If so, so be \n                         it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I'll speak no \n                         more.\n\n               Ray stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. He turns and \n               looks into the old man's sharp eyes. Grandpa has closed his \n               eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face \n               toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to SING \n               IN LAKOTA. And it is too much. Too weird. He wheels and \n               hurries to the car. Gets in, and beats a fast path out of \n               the old man's lonesome patch of land.\n\n               BLUE HEAT LIGHTNING knifes the sky. THUNDER ROLLS, and rumbles \n               into POOL BALLS --\n\n               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL AND BAR - LATE DAY\n\n               The agents have taken over both sides of the streets, gathered \n               in front of the bar and the motel, putting firearms into \n               cases, removing flak jackets.\n\n               POOL BALLS knock from inside the bar while outside, A DAKOTAN \n               takes a piss near a truck while his GIRLFRIEND stands at his \n               back, yelling at him. CHARLIE DANIELS sings country on the \n               juke Ray heads to room 13, starts unlocking the door. Cooch \n               comes up behind him.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Buffalo burgers and cold beer, \n                         Raymond.

But he isn't all there.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         You have a fever. You okay?\n\n               Ray nods. Cooch lets a few agents walk past, LAUGHING. He \n               speaks quietly.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         Listen: when we get back tomorrow, \n                         you're gonna find Tully laying a \n                         promotion on you.

Cooch cups his arm.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Cooch. They sent us out here because \n                         the place was being neglected. Now, \n                         all of a sudden, there's two five \n                         man SWAT teams out there tonight. \n                         Bell Huey choppers flying all over \n                         the place. Federal occupation to \n                         catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What's \n                         going on?\n\n               Cooch stares at Ray. The younger agent looks like he indeed \n               has a fever.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         National security, Ray. Get some \n                         sleep. Tomorrow, we fly.\n\n               Cooch hurries across the rain-swept street. Ray steps inside \n               and closes the door.\n\n               INT. ROOM 13 - BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL\n\n               Ray closes the door, and stands there. He seems to be having \n               trouble breathing. He looks down at his boots. There is \n               something on the floor. Something that has been slipped under \n               the door earlier. He just stares down at it. Then slowly \n               stoops.\n\n               CLOSE ON: the polaroid of the res car he gave to Maggie \n               earlier. She\n\n               has returned it. He turns it over. Written across the white \n               backing of the photo, in dark black marker is the name -- \n               YELLOW BIRD.\n\n               Ray stares at this for a moment then hurries over to boxes \n               of files on the bed. He rummages like a nervous thief and \n               comes up with a folder. He flips through it, casting off \n               files and 302's and profiles and finally stopping on --\n\n               The 8x10 BLACK AND WHITE of Richard Yellow Bird seen earlier. \n               Sitting in his wheelchair, Red Power cap on, tattoos marring \n               big arms. And under it a DOUBLE MUG SHOT stamped LEAVENWORTH \n               PRISON. Under that ANOTHER PRISON MUG SHOT stamped SIOUX \n               FALLS PRISON. And under that a --\n\n               THIRD MUG SHOT stamped \"PAROLED.\"\n\n               Ray, his eyes fixed on this one, takes a few steps and sits \n               on the end of the bed. He then stuffs the file back in a \n               box, and takes off toward the door.\n\n               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - SUNSET\n\n               The Le Baron throws up loose rock and red dust, driving toward \n               a place where the sun begins a slow drop behind the Black \n               Hills. HORSES run out of the road. HEARTBEAT DRUM.\n\n               EXT. MULE DEER DISTRICT \u0096 RES - SUNSET\n\n               A tarpaper shack. Outhouse. Clothesline on which jerked meat \n               hangs. No cars. A lonely, unnerving place. Le Baron pulls \n               in. Ray gets out, adjusting the gun at the back of his \n               waistband. He starts for the shack. Ray raps a fist on the \n               splintered plywood door. Knocks again. He checks out a boarded-\n               up window. The door finally opens. Just a crack. Tiny black \n               eyes peer out into the fading light.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird.\n\n               Ray sticks his open badge, gold eagle wings, near the crack. \n               The door closes. Then unlatches and opens. Yellow Bird sits \n               there in his wheelchair, tiny tobacco bundles in his lap. \n               He's been tying them.\n\n                                     YELLOW BIRD\n                         The Washington Redskin. Thought you'd \n                         be gone by now.\n\n               He pivots his chair to allow Ray room to enter.\n\n               INT. YELLOW BIRD SHACK\n\n               Yellow Bird, in a T-shirt that reveals twenty different ink \n               tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a \n               cheese crate where his eye glasses sit. He puts the thick \n               bifocals on and focuses resentfully on Ray in the ochre \n               flicker of the dirty room.\n\n                                     YELLOW BIRD\n                         What ya want?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Must be a bitch getting around in \n                         that wheelchair.

Ray \n               starts to look like maybe the game's not working. Like maybe \n               this doesn't add up.

He lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath \n               and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor.\n\n               Ray peers out the cracks in the boards.\n\n                                     YELLOW BIRD\n                         Man, I don't know who the fuck I am \n                         no more.\n\n               Ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door. \n               He stops and looks back at the Indian, sitting on the floor, \n               clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         You and me both.\n\n               Yellow Bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face \n               contorted And Ray leaves.\n\n               EXT. YELLOW BIRD'S SHACK - NIGHT\n\n               Ray steps out into the falling night. There is a car parked \n               there. With a high aerial. Ray raises a hand in a slight \n               wave, walks on. At the fed car, A REGIONAL AGENT behind the \n               wheel, waves a hand. Watches Ray get into the Le Baron.\n\n               Ray gets in the car and takes off.\n\n               LE BARON - TRAVELING\n\n               Ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation. \n               Through miles of open land and strange rock formations. And \n               he looks trapped. HEADLIGHTS flicker in his rearview. He \n               sees this. Slams the gas pedal.\n\n               EXT. RES ROADS - NIGHT\n\n               The Le Baron races at 85 down the dirt stretch. A moment \n               later a car rattles by at 90.\n\n               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING\n\n               Ray reaches over to the passenger seat and pulls up the M-\n               16. He lays it across his lap. Looks in the rearview again. \n               Then makes a sudden sharp turn.\n\n               He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the \n               already foggy night, the car goes out of control.\n\n               EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT\n\n               The car that was following drives right past the narrow layby, \n               hidden by grassy slopes and keeps flying down the long \n               stretch.\n\n               INT. LE BARON\n\n               Ray skids through the dirt, trying to stop -- he can't -- \n               and the Le Baron fishtails, smashing into a chain-link fence. \n               And coming to a stop.\n\n               Breathing as if he's been running not driving, Ray looks \n               behind him to make sure he lost the car. He did. When he \n               turns back to his wheel, he sees --\n\n               THROUGH THE CHAINLINK FENCE\n\n               lit by his headlights: THE WOUNDED KNEE gravesite. He is \n               right up on the arch, and the tall stone marker beyond it.\n\n               EXT. WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL - NIGHT\n\n               The Le Baron just sits parked, headlights making the night \n               fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb, along the fence.\n\n               The driver's door opens slowly. And Ray steps out. He walks \n               through the arch. Into the small fenced area. Up to the stone \n               which is overgrown with stubborn weeds, half-hidden in mist. \n               Ray studies the tomb.\n\n               POV: THE NAMES ON THE STONE ARE CHISELED VERTICALLY:\n\n               CHIEF STANDING BEAR\n\n               MR.

He drops to \n               his knees, clearing weeds.\n\n               STRONG FOX\n\n               THUNDER HEART\n\n               MOVING DOWN and then suddenly back up to the name:\n\n               THUNDER HEART\n\n               REVERSE ON - RAY\n\n               kneeling in the weeds, the wind getting restless around him, \n               screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are \n               filled with a whistling. What sounds like EAGLE BONE WHISTLES, \n               piping shrill.\n\n               Ray kneels before the marker, staring at the name on the \n               stone, his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across \n               the grass, whistling eagles, building to an unbearable, pitch.\n\n               Ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small \n               hole into another world. A world that frightens him. He gets \n               up and backs away from the stone, through the gate. And gets \n               back in his car, quickly. He takes off.\n\n               EXT. MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The little home on the river. Dark. Empty. Ray runs up the \n               steps, pounds at the door. No answer.

He hurries back down the steps, \n               starts around the back of the house and something attacks \n               him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet, \n               into the grass. Hits him again.\n\n               But as quickly as he falls, he rolls, throwing up his hands \n               and blocking a savage kick aimed for his face. He traps the \n               boot, twists it and drops the attacker onto his back. In a \n               matter of seconds, he is on top of the man, sticking his gun \n               in his throat. He grabs a flashlight from his jacket and \n               shines it in the man's face.\n\n               Crow Horse.

Crow Horse is looking past him. Ray turns. The \n               spectacular mesa that we have admired with every sunrise, \n               looms massive now that we are under it. Moonlight falls on \n               it. And the HEARTBEAT DRUM pulses from it.\n\n               EXT. WHERE-THE-ELK-PEOPLE-USED-TO-LIVE - NIGHT\n\n               The land behind Red Deer Table is Badlands. Badlands pierced \n               by a few rutted old wagon roads. At a place between two \n               grotesque buttes, Crow Horse stops, looking uneasy.\n\n               He digs into his pocket, pulls out some loose tobacco and \n               spills it on the ground. Then he walks on.\n\n               Ray observes this, starting forward, then stopping long enough \n               to fish a cigarette out from his pocket and drop it next to \n               Crow Horse's offering.\n\n               THROUGH THE BADLANDS\n\n               Ray and Crow Horse walk, carefully under a full moon, scanning \n               the area. Crow Horse stops, checks out some tracks. Ray walks \n               on, looking up at the table. He shines his flashlight up and \n               it illuminates --\n\n               A RED RIBBON, tied on stakes on a ridge. Ten stakes. Twenty \n               stakes.

Something... some unseen thing snags him \n               by the leg, sucking him into the Earth with a horrible GUSHING \n               SOUND.\n\n               Ray is drawn into a hole up to his hips, a bluish-black slime, \n               oozing out around him. Crow Horse grabs him, struggling to \n               pull him up. He does, stumbling back and stepping into a \n               hole himself.\n\n               The two men are wheeling, throwing flashlight beams around, \n               slapping through a wet jelly, and finally getting their \n               bearings.\n\n               Ray touches the ground where a blue-black chemical solution \n               oozes out with water from the aquifer below. His flashlight \n               scans --\n\n               TWENTY DRILLED HOLES IN THE EARTH. A uranium strip-mining \n               grid laid out in a 50 x 60 pattern.

COYOTES. Some forty yards \n               away, on a flat stretch of stoney ground. Six Coyotes, dancing \n               in the shadows of rock formations. MOVING IN ON THEM as Ray \n               walks forward, they circle... scatter... run back... circle \n               again. Look straight at Ray, eyes glowing.\n\n               And run.\n\n               REVERSE - RAY\n\n               and Crow Horse walk toward them. To the place they just left. \n               A place in the dirt, they were digging up.

Denim jacket and a shock of black \n               hair, thrown into tangles and dirt. It was buried. Until the \n               coyote caught wind. Crow Horse bends down, touches the \n               jacket... turns the body over And almost vomits when he sees \n               Maggie Eagle Bear.\n\n               RAY\n\n               looks down in disbelief.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         No. No...\n\n               Ray steps back, his boots squishing in solution and sealant \n               and soiled water. He covers his mouth, stopping himself from \n               getting sick. And then he explodes, YELLING.\n\n               LONG SHOT - RED DEER TABLE\n\n               in the moonlight.

Ray sits there, and he looks \n               almost hurt by this statement. But he is the white man. But \n               he is Indian. He lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple. \n               He takes out a smoke. Tries to light it. His hands are shaking \n               too badly. But he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in \n               his rearview.\n\n               INT.

CLEAR MOON, a rotund, gentle woman brings him a coffee. \n               A TEENAGE GIRL in a men's extra-large T-shirt stands in the \n               hall, looking at him.\n\n               Clear Moon in pajamas, rises, and with a coffee in hand, \n               starts walking in slow steps toward the kitchen. He loses \n               control before he gets there and hurls the cup across the \n               room into the sink, smashing it. He wheels and faces Crow \n               Horse. He SPEAKS LAKOTA. Asking questions. Crow Horse SPEAKS \n               LAKOTA. Answering him.\n\n               Mrs. Clear Moon, understanding, shakes her head in disbelief \n               and her eyes begin to well. Oliver, walking back to his chair, \n               sits, and thinks for a moment. MORE LAKOTA. He gets up, goes \n               to a drawer and rummages. He sits again, and tosses something \n               onto the coffee table. It is a badge. A tribal police badge.\n\n               INT.

He looks haggard but still buoyant, \n               his eyes piercing. The connecting door creaks open and Cooch \n               walks in. The SAC is freshly showered and he is fidgeting \n               with a Windsor knot. He studies his number two man, says \n               nothing for a moment but is obviously holding something down. \n               His face is a red hue.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                              (extra casual)\n                         Couldn't sleep, Ray?\n\n               Ray looks at Cooch.

An insecure smile \n               but a smile just the same. He starts to laugh.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         You fucking hot head, we can get in \n                         trouble for that.\n\n               Cooch laughs in amusement and Ray's face crinkles into a \n               grin as he lowers his eyes, wiping a paper towel over his \n               face. And then, suddenly, Ray lunges at Cooch.\n\n               He slams the Agent in Charge against the hollow wall, and \n               holds him there. His eyes wild.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Why didn't you tell me what we were \n                         doing here?\n\n               Cooch is stunned.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         We're running a cover-up and you \n                         didn't --\n\n               Cooch suddenly explodes, throwing Ray off of him and sending \n               him reeling back against the sink.

RESERVATION ROAD - TOWARD GRANDPA REACHES - MORNING\n\n               Crow Horse chugs along on his motorbike toward the council, \n               his long hair and eagle feather trailing in the wind.\n\n               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL - MORNING\n\n               Two federal vehicles are waiting in front of Cooch's Chevy \n               and Ray's Le Baron. One is an FBI van where Sherman helps \n               THREE AGENTS load file boxes and computers.\n\n               Cooch walks with Ray toward the Le Baron, looking at him as \n               the go. Ray looks better as he breathes the morning air. As \n               they pass the second fed car, the back window power glides \n               down, and someone looks out with a friendly smile.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         Ah, there you are. The Sioux.\n\n               Ray stops dead. Beholds the Tribal President who wears a \n               western cut jacket and a strained expression behind his smile. \n               He hole a hand out to Ray.\n\n                                     CLEAR MOON\n                         You got the troublemakers off our \n                         land. Good, Was-te.\n\n               Ray stares at him, speechless. Horrified. What is he doing \n               here? What about the council fire? Ray somehow nods. Then \n               walks on to the Le Baron. Cooch gets behind the wheel of the \n               car that Clear Moon sits in. Clear Moon's eyes follow Ray to \n               the car.\n\n               EXT. RES ROAD - TO GRANDPA REACHES\n\n               Crow Horse guns past a little shack. As he does, he looks in \n               his side mirror then out across the grasslands. Then quickly\n\n               IN HIS MIRROR: a car has pulled out from behind the shack. \n               CROW HORSE observes this. Then twists the fuel throttle hard.\n\n               INT. LE BARON\n\n               Ray gets behind the wheel, looks at his watch. He is \n               panicking. He starts the car, reverses, slams into drive.\n\n               RAY\u0092S POV: swerving and reckless as he races forward. Sherman, \n               walking around to one of the cars has to run out of the way. \n               The other agents clear out, looking in confusion as Ray cuts \n               a hard U -- sweeps PAST THE BAR, SMASHES INTO AND THROUGH \n               the old hitching post -- and HEADS TOWARD the reservation \n               which lies vast before him.\n\n               EXT. BUFFALO BUTTE MOTEL\n\n               With agents scrambling about, looking after the car, Cooch \n               gets out, looking into the dust Ray left behind.

When \n               Cooch quickly gets back behind the wheel, Sherman pulls his \n               radio up and starts yelling into it.\n\n               Cooch reaches out the window and grabs his radio arm.\n\n                                     COOCH\n                         No, damn it.

It's \n                         under control.\n\n               And Cooch squeals out with a petrified Clear Moon in the \n               backseat, inquiring nervously.\n\n               EXT. ROAD TO GRANDPA REACHES\n\n               Crow Horse passes by an abandoned horse trailer. When he \n               does, another car pulls out. And follows. The first car passes \n               by.\n\n               Crow Horse sees he's being followed. He cranks his throttle \n               and the engine grinds then dies. He heels his kickstart on \n               the fly, and keeps it alive. But his old horse is no match \n               for the big engines coming up fast behind him.\n\n               INT. LE BARON - TRAVELING\n\n               Ray is leaving little transitional developments and trailers \n               behind. His eyes bore into the road before him, looking for \n               a sign of Crow Horse, and in the rearview for a sign of his \n               FBI mentor.\n\n               EXT.

To his right the \n               Badlands loom deep, a drop into a caliche netherworld of \n               jagged rock.\n\n               He throws the bike right, trying to ride the thin ribbon of \n               shoulder.\n\n               THE FIRST CAR\n\n               floors it, and swipes him, and the bike goes over the edge, \n               launched into --\n\n               THE BADLANDS\n\n               where it does a violent triple flip, throwing Crow Horse \n               then smashing into a tent shaped dune.\n\n               A RIFLE\n\n               sticks out from a window and punches the Badlands with THREE \n               SHOTS.\n\n               EXT.

The sound \n               of clacking steel, all around. But Cooch seems disturbed by \n               the sound. Because its coming from above.

Silent.\n\n               Twenty, twenty-five, thirty traditionals, forming a line \n               along the ridge, a line that runs in a circle, broken by the \n               Stronghold entrance, then starting again on the next butte. \n               Thirty-five, forty of them. And more, standing along the \n               opposite craggy rock, some wearing tractor caps, some cowboy \n               hats, some just long hair blowing in the wind. Fifty, sixty, \n               SEVENTY-FIVE RESERVATION PEOPLE forming a circle on the rocks; \n               it's Little Big Horn revisited.

He \n               looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way \n               down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat \n               of a lot more guns from above. And now Ray walks forward, \n               collecting his gun.

He takes it in a white man's \n               shake then follows Walter's cue into the Indian \"allies\" \n               grip and slap.

But he sees someone sitting across \n               the street on the trading post porch. The old man.\n\n               Ray considers him for a moment then walks over. They lock \n               eyes. Grandpa stares at Ray as if he's never seen him before, \n               and then arcs a brow. He touches his sleeve at the wrist. \n               Ray rolls his sleeve back to reveal his Rolex. Grandpa smiles \n               and Ray strips it off. He hands it to the old man and his \n               face crinkles into caliche earth.\n\n               Grandpa holds the watch up in the light, admires it then \n               puts it in his shirt pocket. He moves a flat hand through \n               the air in the \"done deal\" sign language. Ray, a little \n               surprised that he gets nothing in the trade, returns the \n               smile and walks away.\n\n               He gets to his car and wipes away two inches of dust from \n               the broken windshield.\n\n               INT. LE BARON\n\n               After THREE TRIES, he gets the engine started. He pulls his \n               gun off his waistband, goes to lay it on the passenger seat \n               and finds something there.\n\n               Grandpa's sacred caanunpa. The Pipe. Symbol of truth. Ray \n               looks out the window at the old man who is watching him with \n               those sharp black eyes. Ray lifts his hand, holds it flat, \n               and does the Sioux done deal sign.\n\n               EXT. BEAR CREEK RESERVATION - DAY\n\n               The Le Baron eats up the dirt road at a moderate, gravel \n               crunching pace. It slows as it passes Maggie Eagle Bear's \n               quiet home on the river. Children walk with the old woman, \n               carrying buckets from the river.\n\n               The Le Baron slows to a crawl, then drives on.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE TRADING POST PORCH\n\n               where the elders sit, watching the dust blow.\n\n                                     CROW HORSE (V.O.)\n                              (voice lingering)\n                         We will be here.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CROW HORSE walking off down the road.

He doesn't go \n               West. Doesn't go East. He sits there. Fishes a smoke out \n               from a pocket, clicks a lighter, and fires up. He sits there, \n               smoking.\n\n               Deliberating.\n\n               SUDDEN CUT TO BLACK.\n\n               And after a long silent beat, A DRUM.
