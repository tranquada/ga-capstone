He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, \n\tlooking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a \n\tperformance.\n\n\tIn the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a \n\tflat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a \n\tthick rope that hangs from the ceiling.\n\n\tThe voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen \n\tstage:\n\n\t\t\t\tACTOR\n\t\tI'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for \n\t\tgood.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye, \n\t\tthese four stinkin' walls, the six \n\t\tflights up, the el that roars by at \n\t\tthree A.M. like a castiron wind. \n\t\tKiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!  \n\t\tI'll miss 'em \u0096 like hell I will!\n\n\t\t\t\tACTRESS\n\t\tDreaming again!\n\n\t\t\t\tACTOR\n\t\tNot this time, Lil! I'm awake now, \n\t\tawake for the first time in years. \n\t\tUncle Dave said it: Daylight is a \n\t\tdream if you've lived with your eyes \n\t\tclosed. Well my eyes are open now! I \n\t\tsee that choir, and I know they're \n\t\tdressed in rags! But we're part of \n\t\tthat choir, both of us \u0096 yeah, and \n\t\tyou, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!\n\n\t\t\t\tMAURY\n\t\tThe sun's coming up, kid. They'll be \n\t\thawking the fish down on Fulton \n\t\tStreet.\n\n\t\t\t\tACTOR\n\t\tLet 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their \n\t\thearts out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAURY\n\t\tThat's it, kid. Take that ruined \n\t\tchoir.  Make it sing!\n\n\t\t\t\tACTOR\n\t\tSo long, Maury.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAURY\n\t\tSo long.\n\n\tWe hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps. A \n\ttall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up \n\tvalise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage:\n\n\t\t\t\tMAURY\n\t\tWe'll hear from that kid. And I don't \n\t\tmean a postcard.\n\n\tThe actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int \n\the shadows behind Barton.\n\n\tAn older man in work clothes \u0096 not wardrobe \u0096 passes in front \n\tof Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of \n\tthe stage and cups his hands to his mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tOLDER MAN\n\t\tFISH! FRESH FISH!\n\n\tAs the man walks back off the screen:\n\n\t\t\t\tLILY\n\t\tLet's spit on our hands and get to \n\t\twork.  It's late, Maury.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAURY\n\t\tNot any more Lil...\n\n\tBarton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor:\n\n\t\t\t\tMAURY\n\t\t...It's early.\n\n\tWith this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the \n\trope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts \n\tof \"Bravo!\"  \n\n\tAs the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat \n\tmuting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame \n\ttoward the stage.\n\n\tThe stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain \n\tback up and unmuting the applause.\n\n\tBarton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other \n\tmen, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage.\n\n\tBARTON'S POV\n\n\tLooking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as \n\tthe curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take \n\ttheir bows and the cry of \"Author, Author\" goes up from the \n\tcrowd.\n\n\tThe actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe hesitates, unable to take it all in.\n\n\tHe is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed \n\tgentlemen.\n\n\tAs he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.\n\n\tTRACKING SHOT\n\n\tPushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he \n\tleads the way through the restaurant.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAITRE 'D\n\t\tYour table is ready, Monsieur Fink...  \n\t\tseveral members of your party have \n\t\talready arrived...\n\n\tREVERSE\n\n\tPulling Barton\n\n\t\t\t\tFINK\n\t\tIs Garland Stanford here?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAITRE 'D\n\t\tHe called to say he'd be a few minutes \n\t\tlate... Ah, here we are...\n\n\tTRACKING IN\n\n\tToward a large semi-circular booth. Three guests, two me and \n\ta woman in evening wear, are rising and beaming at Barton. A \n\tfat middle-aged man, one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw \n\tbackstage, is moving out to let Barton slide in.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tBarton, Barton, so glad you could \n\t\tmake it.  You know Richard St. \n\t\tClaire...\n\n\tBarton nods and looks at the woman.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking \n\t\tchampagne, dear boy, in honor of the \n\t\toccasion. Have you seen the Herald?\n\n\tBarton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man \n\tfills it.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNot yet.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tWell, I don't want to embarrass you \n\t\tbut Caven could hardly contain \n\t\thimself. But more important, Richard \n\t\tand Poppy here loved the play.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n\t\tLoved it! What power!\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tYeah, it was a corker.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThanks, Richard, but I know for a \n\t\tfact the only fish you've ever seen \n\t\twere tacked to a the wall of the \n\t\tyacht club.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tOuch!\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tBravo! Nevertheless, we were all \n\t\tdevastated.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n\t\tWeeping! Copius tears! What did the \n\t\tHerald say?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tI happen to have it with me.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tPlease Derek \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n\t\tDo read it, do!\n\n\t\t\t\tDEREK\n\t\t\"Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the \n\t\tCommon Man. The star of the Bare \n\t\tRuined Choirs was not seen on the \n\t\tstage of the Belasco last night \u0096 \n\t\tthough the thespians involved all \n\t\tacquitted themselves admirably. The \n\t\tfind of the evening was the author \n\t\tof this drama about simple folk \u0096 \n\t\tfish mongers, in fact \u0096 whose brute \n\t\tstruggle for existence cannot quite \n\t\tquell their longing for something \n\t\thigher. The playwright finds nobility \n\t\tin the most squalid corners and poetry \n\t\tin the most callused speech. A tough \n\t\tnew voice in the American theater \n\t\thas arrived, and the owner of that \n\t\tvoice is named... Barton Fink.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThey'll be wrapping fish in it in \n\t\tthe morning so I guess it's not a \n\t\ttotal waste.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n\t\tCynic!\n\n\t\t\t\tDEREK\n\t\tWell we can enjoy your success, \n\t\tBarton, even if you can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tDon't get me wrong \u0096 I'm glad it'll \n\t\tdo well for you, Derek.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEREK\n\t\tDon't worry about me, dear boy \u0096 I \n\t\twant you to celebrate.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAll right, but I can't start listening \n\t\tto the critics, and I can't kid myself \n\t\tabout my own work. A writer writes \n\t\tfrom his gut, and his gut tells him \n\t\twhat's good and what's... merely \n\t\tadequate.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n\t\tWell I don't pretend to be a critic, \n\t\tbut Lord, I have a gut, and it tells \n\t\tme it was simply marvelous.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tAnd a charming gut it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n\t\tYou dog!\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\t\t(baying)\n\t\tAaa-woooooooo!\n\n\tBarton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling. \n\tWe swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the \n\trestaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with \n\tBarton's name on it.\n\n\tTRACKING IN TOWARD A BAR\n\n\tA distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes \n\tis nursing a martini, watching Barton approach.\n\n\tPULLING BARTON\n\n\tAs he draws near.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI thought you were going to join us.  \n\t\tJesus, Garland, you left me alone \n\t\twith those people.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tDon't panic, I'll join you in a \n\t\tminute.  What's you think of Richard \n\t\tand Poppy?\n\n\tBarton scowls\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThe play was marvelous. She wept, \n\t\tcopiously. Millions of dollars and \n\t\tno sense.\n\n\tGarland smiles, then draws Barton close.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tWe have to talk a little business. \n\t\tI've just been on the phone to Los \n\t\tAngeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures \n\t\twants to put you under contract. \n\t\tThey've offered you a thousand dollars \n\t\ta week. I think I can get them to go \n\t\tas high as two.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tTo do what?\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tWhat do you do far a living?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm not sure anymore. I guess I try \n\t\tto make a difference.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tFair enough. No pressure here, Barton, \n\t\tbecause I respect you, but let me \n\t\tpoint out a couple of things. One, \n\t\there you make a difference to five \n\t\thundred fifty people a night \u0096 if \n\t\tthe show sells out.  Eighty five \n\t\tmillion people go to the pictures \n\t\tevery week.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tTo see pap.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tYes, generally, to see pap. However, \n\t\tpoint number two: A brief tenure in \n\t\tHollywood could support you through \n\t\tthe writing of any number of plays.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI don't know, Garland; my place is \n\t\there right now. I feel I'm on the \n\t\tbrink of success-\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tI'd say you're already enjoying some.\n\n\tBarton leans earnestly forward.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo, Garland, don't you see? Not the \n\t\tkind of success where the critics \n\t\tfawn over you or the producers like \n\t\tDerek make a lot of money. No, a \n\t\treal success \u0096 the success we've \n\t\tbeen dreaming about \u0096 the creation \n\t\tof a new, living theater of, about, \n\t\tand for the common man! If I ran off \n\t\tto Hollywood now I'd be making money, \n\t\tgoing to parties, meeting the big \n\t\tshots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself \n\t\toff from the wellspring of that \n\t\tsuccess, from the common man.\n\n\tHe leans back and chuckles ruefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...I guess I'm sprouting off again. \n\t\tBut I am certain of this, Garland: \n\t\tI'm capable of more good work. Maybe \n\t\tbetter work than I did in Choirs. It \n\t\tjust doesn't seem to me that Los \n\t\tAngeles is the place to lead the \n\t\tlife of mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tOkay Barton, you're the artist, I'm \n\t\tjust the ten percenter. You decide \n\t\twhat you want and I'll make it happen. \n\t\tI'm only asking that your decision \n\t\tbe informed by a little realism \u0096 if \n\t\tI can use that word and Hollywood in \n\t\tthe same breath.\n\n\tBarton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the \n\tfloor.\n\n\tGarland studies him.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\t...Look, they love you, kid \u0096 \n\t\teverybody does. You see Caven's review \n\t\tin the Herald?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo, what did it say?\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tTake my copy. You're the toast of \n\t\tBroadway and you have the opportunity \n\t\tto redeem that for a little cash \u0096 \n\t\tstrike that, a lot of cash.\n\n\tGarland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\t...The common man'll still be here \n\t\twhen you get back. What the hell, \n\t\tthey might even have one or two of \n\t\t'em out in Hollywood.\n\n\tAbsently:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...That's a rationalization, Garland.\n\n\tGarland smiles gently.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tBarton, it was a joke.\n\n\tWe hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to:\n\n\tA GREAT WAVE\n\n\tCrushing against the Pacific shore.\n\n\tThe roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to:\n\n\tHOTEL LOBBY\n\n\tA high wide shot from the front door, looking down across \n\twilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty \n\twing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed.\n\n\tAmber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from \n\tbehind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights.  \n\n\tBarton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops \n\tin the middle foreground to look across the lobby.\n\n\tWe are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is \n\tempty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in.  \n\n\tBarton moves toward the front desk.\n\n\tTHE REVERSE\n\n\tAs Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver \n\tbell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without \n\tlosing volume.\n\n\tAfter a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs.  \n\tBarton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at \n\tthe floor behind the front desk.\n\n\tA TRAP DOOR\n\n\tIt swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, \n\tholding a shoebrush and a shoe \u0096 not one of his own \u0096 climbs \n\tup from the basement.\n\n\tHe closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his \n\tfinger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting \n\tit.\n\n\tThe lobby is now silent again.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tWelcome to the Hotel Earle. May I \n\t\thelp you, sir?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm checking in. Barton Fink.\n\n\tThe clerk flips through cards on the desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tF-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be \n\t\tyou, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tMust be.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tOkay then, everything seems to be in \n\t\torder. Everything seems to be in \n\t\torder.\n\n\tHe is turning to a register around for Barton to sign.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t...Are you a tranz or a rez?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tExcuse me?\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tTransient or resident?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI don't know... I mean, I'll be here, \n\t\tuh, indefinitely.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tRez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a \n\t\tweek payable in advance. Checkout \n\t\ttime is twelve sharp, only you can \n\t\tforget that on account you're a rez.  \n\t\tIf you need anything, anything at \n\t\tall, you dial zero on your personal \n\t\tin-room telephone and talk to me. My \n\t\tname is Chet.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, I'm going to be working here, \n\t\tmostly at night; I'm a writer. Do \n\t\tyou have room service?\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tKitchen closes at eight but I'm the \n\t\tnight clerk. I can always ring out \n\t\tfor sandwiches.\n\n\tThe clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index \n\tcard.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t...Though we provide privacy for the \n\t\tresidential guest, we are also a \n\t\tfull service hotel including \n\t\tcomplimentary shoe shine. My name is \n\t\tChet.\n\n\tHe pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index \n\tcard.\n\n\tBarton looks at the card.\n\n\tOn it: \"CHET!\" Barton looks back up at the clerk. They regard \n\teach other for a beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t...Okay\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\tThe clerk.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tOkey-dokey, go ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhat \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tDon't you wanna go to your room?!\n\n\tBarton stares at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...What number is it?\n\n\tThe clerk stares back.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell \n\t\tyou.\n\n\tAs Barton stoops to pick up his two small bags:\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t...Those your only bags?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThe others are being sent.\n\n\tThe clerk leans over the desk to call after him:\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tI'll keep an eye out for them. I'll \n\t\tkeep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.\n\n\tBarton is walking to the elevator.\n\n\tELEVATOR\n\n\tBarton enters and sets down his bags.\n\n\tAn aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon \n\tuniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel. He does not \n\tacknowledge Barton's presence.\n\n\tAfter a beat:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Six, please.\n\n\tThe elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes the \n\tdoor closed:\n\n\t\t\t\tELEVATOR MAN\n\t\tNext stop: Six.\n\n\tSIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY\n\n\tBarton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the \n\tdoors.\n\n\tThe long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained \n\tforest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing \n\tpalm trees.  Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door \n\tmidway down the hall.\n\n\tHIS ROOM\n\n\tAs Barton enters.\n\n\tThe room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy \n\tbed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and \n\ta wooden luggage stand.\n\n\tAs Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and \n\twash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and \n\ta window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.  \n\n\tBarton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, \n\tjittering.  He shrugs off his jacket.\n\n\tPips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot.  \n\n\tHe walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and \n\tstruggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it \n\tfor a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound.  \n\n\tBarton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary \n\ttable. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat.  \n\n\tNext to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: \n\t\"THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME.\"\n\n\tWe pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall \n\tabove the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a \n\tcobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as \n\tshe looks out at a crashing surf.\n\n\tThe sound of the surf mixes up.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tLooking at the picture\n\n\tTRACKING IN ON THE PICTURE\n\n\tThe surf mixes up louder. We hear a gull cry.\n\n\tThe sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone.\n\n\tTHE HOUSE PHONE\n\n\tOn the nightstand next to the bed. With a groan of bedsprings \n\tBarton sits into frame and picks up the telephone.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHow d'ya like your room!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Who is this?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tChet!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Who?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tChet! From downstairs!\n\n\tBarton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t...How d'ya like your room!\n\n\tA PILLOW\n\n\tAs Barton's head drops down into frame against it.\n\n\tHe reaches over and turns off the bedside light.\n\n\tHe lies back and closes his eyes.\n\n\tA long beat.\n\n\tWe hear a faint hum, growing louder.\n\n\tBarton opens his eyes.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tA naked, peeling ceiling.  The hum \u0096 a mosquito, perhaps \u0096 \n\tstops.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHis eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he \n\tshuts them again.\n\n\tAfter another silent beat, we hear \u0096 muffled, probably from \n\tam adjacent room \u0096 a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing and \n\tweary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob.\n\n\tSilence again.\n\n\tWe hear the rising mosquito hum.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\tEXECUTIVE OFFICE\n\n\tBarton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an \n\tobsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit.\n\n\tThere are mosquito bites on Barton's face.\n\n\tREVERSE\n\n\tFrom behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive \n\tsuit gets to his feet and strides across the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tIs that him?! Barton Fink?!  Lemme \n\t\tput my arms around this guy!\n\n\tHe bear-hugs Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t...How the hell are ya? Good trip?\n\n\tHe separates without waiting for an answer.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tMy name is Jack Lipnik. I run this \n\t\tdump. You know that \u0096 you read the \n\t\tpapers.\n\n\tLipnik is lumbering back to his desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tLou treating you all right? Got \n\t\teverything you need?  What the hell's \n\t\tthe matter with your face? What the \n\t\thell's the matter with his face, \n\t\tLou?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tIt's not as bad as it looks; just a \n\t\tmosquito in my room \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tPlace okay?\n\n\tTo Lou:\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...Where did we put him?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm at the Earle.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tNever heard of it. Let's move him to \n\t\tthe Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, \n\t\the can stay at my place.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThanks, but I wanted a place that \n\t\twas less...\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tLess Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's \n\t\tnot a dirty word. Sat whatever the \n\t\thell you want. The writer is king \n\t\there at Capitol Pictures. You don't \n\t\tbelieve me, take a look at your \n\t\tpaycheck at the end of every week \u0096 \n\t\tthat's what we think of the writer.\n\t\t\t(to Lou)\n\t\t...so what kind of pictures does he \n\t\tlike?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\tMr. Fink hasn't given a preference, \n\t\tMr.  Lipnik.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tHow's about it, Bart?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tTo be honest, I don't go to the \n\t\tpictures much, Mr. Lipnik \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tThat's okay, that's okay, that's \n\t\tokay \u0096 that's just fine. You probably \n\t\tjust walked in here thinking that \n\t\twas going to be a handicap, thinking \n\t\twe wanted people who knew something \n\t\tabout the medium, maybe even thinking \n\t\tthere was all kind of technical mumbo-\n\t\tjumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. \n\t\tWe're only interested in one thing: \n\t\tCan you tell a story, Bart?  Can you \n\t\tmake us laugh, can you make us cry, \n\t\tcan you make us wanna break out in \n\t\tjoyous song? Is that more than one \n\t\tthing? Okay.  The point is, I run \n\t\tthis dump and I don't know the \n\t\ttechnical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run \n\t\tit? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit.  \n\t\tShowmanship. And also, and I hope \n\t\tLou told you this, I bigger and meaner \n\t\tthan any other kike in this town. \n\t\tDid you tell him that, Lou? And I \n\t\tdon't mean my dick's bigger than \n\t\tyours, it's not a sexual thing \u0096 \n\t\talthough, you're the writer, you \n\t\twould know more about that. Coffee?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Yes, thank you.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tLou.\n\n\tLou immediately rises and leaves. Lipnik's tone becomes \n\tconfidential:\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...He used to have shares in the \n\t\tcompany.  An ownership interest. Got \n\t\tbought out in the twenties \u0096 muscled \n\t\tout according to some. Hell, according \n\t\tto me. So we keep him around, he's \n\t\tgot a family. Poor schmuck. He's \n\t\tsensitive, don't mention the old \n\t\tdays. Oh hell, say whatever you want.  \n\t\tLook, barring a preference, Bart, \n\t\twe're gonna put you to work on a \n\t\twrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I \n\t\tsay this because they tell me you \n\t\tknow the poetry of the street. That \n\t\twould rule out westerns, pirate \n\t\tpictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...\n\n\tHe rises and starts pacing.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tBut look, I'm not one of these guys \n\t\tthinks poetic has gotta be fruity.  \n\t\tWe're together on that, aren't we? I \n\t\tmean I'm from New York myself \u0096 well, \n\t\tMinsk if you wanna go way back, which \n\t\twe won't if you don't mind and I \n\t\tain't askin'. Now people're gonna \n\t\ttell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery, \n\t\tit's a B picture. You tell them, \n\t\tbullshit. We don't make B pictures \n\t\there at Capitol.  Let's put a stop \n\t\tto that rumor right now.\n\n\tLou enters with coffee.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. \n\t\tTalking about the Wallace Beery \n\t\tpicture.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\tExcellent picture.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tWe got a treatment on it yet?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\tNo, not yet Jack. We just bought the \n\t\tstory. Saturday Evening Post.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tOkay, the hell with the story. Wallace \n\t\tBeery is a wrestler. I wanna know \n\t\this hopes, his dreams. Naturally, \n\t\the'll have to get mixed up with a \n\t\tbad element. And a romantic interest. \n\t\tYou know the drill.  Romantic \n\t\tinterest, or else a young kid. An \n\t\torphan. What do you think, Lou?  \n\t\tWally a little too old for a romantic \n\t\tinterest?  Look at me, a writer in \n\t\tthe room and I'm askin' Lou what the \n\t\tgoddamn story should be!\n\n\tAfter a robust laugh, he beams at Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? \n\t\tDame?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Both maybe?\n\n\tThere is a disappointed silence. Lipnik looks at Lou.  Lou \n\tclears his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\t...Maybe we should do a treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tAh, hell, let Bart take a crack at \n\t\tit.  He'll get into the swing of \n\t\tthings or I don't know writers. Let's \n\t\tmake it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. \n\t\tWe don't gotta tackle the world our \n\t\tfirst time out. The important thing \n\t\tis we all have that Barton Fink \n\t\tfeeling, but since you're Barton \n\t\tFink I'm assuming you have it in \n\t\tspades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. \n\t\tWe're off to a good start. Dammit, \n\t\tif all our writers were like you I \n\t\twouldn't have to get so goddamn \n\t\tinvolved. I'd like to see something \n\t\tby the end of the week.\n\n\tLou is getting to his feet and signaling for Barton to do \n\tlikewise.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...Heard about your show, by the \n\t\tway. My man in New York saw it. Tells \n\t\tme it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty \n\t\tdamn moving.  A little fruity, he \n\t\tsaid, but I guess you know what you're \n\t\tdoing. Thank you for your heart. We \n\t\tneed more heart in pictures.  We're \n\t\tall expecting great things.\n\n\tTRACKING SHOT\n\n\tWe are in the sixth-floor hallway of the Earle, late at night. \n\tA pair of shoes sits before each door. Faintly, from one of \n\tthe rooms, we can hear the clack. clack. clack. of a \n\ttypewriter.\n\n\tIt grows louder as we track forward.\n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT \u0096 TYPEWRITER\n\n\tClose on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is \n\ttyped, without context.\n\n\tOne by one the letters clack on: a-u-d-i-b-l-e. After a short \n\tbeat, a period strikes.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tElbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written. \n\tHe rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.\n\n\tTHE PAGE\n\n\tIt says:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n\n\tA TENEMENT BUILDING\n\n\tOn Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is \n\taudible.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tAfter a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.\n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT\n\n\tThe letter-strike area. It is lined up to the last period, \n\twhich is struck over by a comma. The words \"as is\" are typed \n\tin and we cut back to \u0096\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\t\u0096 as he continues typing. He stops after several more \n\tcharacters and looks.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\tBreaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room. \n\tA man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless.\n\n\tBarton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe picture of the girl on the beach.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tStaring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Barton \n\tlooks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but \n\tthe sound is too insistent to ignore.\n\n\tWIDE SHOT\n\n\tThe room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall.  \n\n\tThe laughter.\n\n\tBarton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and \n\tlooks out.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the \n\tend of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the \n\tstaircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of \n\twall sconces.\n\n\tThe laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the \n\tempty hall.\n\n\tPerhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because \n\tit is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for \n\tweeping.\n\n\tBarton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly \n\twithdraws into his room.\n\n\tHIS ROOM\n\n\tBarton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The \n\tlaughter/weeping continues.\n\n\tHe walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house \n\tphone.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHello... Chet? This is Barton Fink \n\t\tin room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's \n\t\tsomeone in the room next door to \n\t\tmine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... \n\t\tmaking a lot of... noise.\n\n\tAfter a beat:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Thank you.\n\n\tHe cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or \n\ttwo, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the \n\ttelephone ringing next door.\n\n\tBarton looks at the wall.\n\n\tThe muffled sound of a man talking.\n\n\tThe sound of the earpiece being pronged.\n\n\tMuffled footsteps next door.\n\n\tThe sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.  \n\n\tFootsteps approaching the hall.\n\n\tA hard, present knock at Barton's door.\n\n\tBarton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.\n\n\tON THE DOOR\n\n\tAs Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man \u0096 a \n\tvery large man \u0096 in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened \n\ttie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of \n\tsweat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tDid you... Somebody just complained...\n\n\tHastily:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo, I didn't \u0096 I mean, I did call \n\t\tdown, not to complain exactly, I was \n\t\tjust concerned that you might \u0096 not \n\t\tthat it's my business, but that you \n\t\tmight be in some kind of... distress. \n\t\tYou see, I was trying to work, and \n\t\tit's, well, it was difficult \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tYeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered \n\t\tyou.  The damn walls here, well, I \n\t\tjust apologize like hell...\n\n\tHe sticks his hand out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess \n\t\twe're neighbors...\n\n\tWithout reaching for the hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tBarton Fink.\n\n\tUnfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tNeighbor, I'd feel better about the \n\t\tdamned inconvenience if you'd let me \n\t\tbuy you a drink.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThat's all right, really, thank you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tAll right, hell, you trying to work \n\t\tand me carrying on in there. Look, \n\t\tthe liquor's good, wuddya say?\n\n\tAs he enters:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t... You got a glass? It's the least \n\t\tI can do.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tOkay... a quick one, sure...\n\n\tHe gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits down \n\ton the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, \n\t\tall the carryings-on next door.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThat's okay, I assure you. It's just \n\t\tthat I was trying to work \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhat kind of work do you do, Barton, \n\t\tif you don't mind my asking?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, I'm a writer, actually.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou don't say. That's a tough racket. \n\t\tMy hat's off to anyone who can make \n\t\ta go of it. Damned interesting work, \n\t\tI'd imagine.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tCan be. Not easy, but \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tDamned difficult, I'd imagine.\n\n\tAs he hands Charlie a glass:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAnd what's your line, Mr. Meadows?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, \n\t\tyou might say I sell peace of mind. \n\t\tInsurance is my game \u0096 door-to-door, \n\t\thuman contact, still the only way to \n\t\tmove merchandise.\n\n\tHe fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty \n\tglass.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...In spite of what you might think \n\t\tfrom tonight, I'm pretty good at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tDoesn't surprise me at all.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHell yes. Because I believe in it. \n\t\tFire, theft, and casualty are not \n\t\tthings that only happen to other \n\t\tpeople \u0096 that's what I tell 'em. \n\t\tWriting doesn't work out, you might \n\t\twant to look into it. Providing for \n\t\tbasic human need \u0096 a fella could do \n\t\tworse.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThanks, I'll keep it in mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhat kind of scribbler are you \u0096 \n\t\tnewspaperman did you say?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo, I'm actually writing for the \n\t\tpictures now \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tPictures! Jesus!\n\n\tHe guffaws.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...I'm sorry, brother, I was just \n\t\tsitting here thinking I was talking \n\t\tto some ambitious youngster, eager \n\t\tto make good.  Hell, you've got it \n\t\tmade! Writing for pictures! Beating \n\t\tout that competition!  And me being \n\t\tpatronizing!\n\n\tHe gestures toward his face:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Is the egg showing or what?!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThat's okay; actually I am just \n\t\tstarting out in the movies \u0096 though \n\t\tI was pretty well established in New \n\t\tYork, some renown there,\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOh, it's an exciting time then. I'm \n\t\tnot the best-read mug on the planet, \n\t\tso I guess it's no surprise I didn't \n\t\trecognize your name. Jesus, I feel \n\t\tlike a heel.\n\n\tFor the first time Barton smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThat's okay, Charlie. I'm a \n\t\tplaywright. My shows've only played \n\t\tNew York. Last one got a hell of a \n\t\twrite-up in the Herald. I guess that's \n\t\twhy they wanted me here.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHell, why not? Everyone wants quality.  \n\t\tWhat kind of venue, that is to say, \n\t\tthematically, uh...\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhat do I write about?\n\n\tCharlie laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tCaught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, \n\t\tthat's it, Bart.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, that's a good question. Strange \n\t\tas it may seem, Charlie, I guess I \n\t\twrite about people like you. The \n\t\taverage working stiff. The common \n\t\tman.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell ain't that a kick in the head!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah, I guess it is. But in a way, \n\t\tthat's exactly the point. There's a \n\t\tfew people in New York \u0096 hopefully \n\t\tour numbers are growing \u0096 who feel \n\t\twe have an opportunity now to forge \n\t\tsomething real out of everyday \n\t\texperience, create a theater for the \n\t\tmasses that's based on a few simple \n\t\ttruths \u0096 not on some shopworn \n\t\tabstractions about drama that doesn't \n\t\thold true today, if they ever did...\n\n\tHe gazes at Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...I don't guess this means much to \n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHell, I could tell you some stories\u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAnd that's the point, that we all \n\t\thave stories. The hopes and dreams \n\t\tof the common man are as noble as \n\t\tthose of any king. It's the stuff of \n\t\tlife \u0096 why shouldn't it be the stuff \n\t\tof theater?  Goddamnit, why should \n\t\tthat be a hard pill to swallow? Don't \n\t\tcall it new theater, Charlie; call \n\t\tit real theater. Call it our theater.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI can see you feel pretty strongly \n\t\tabout it.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, I don't mean to get up on my \n\t\thigh horse, but why shouldn't we \n\t\tlook at ourselves up there?  Who \n\t\tcares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop \n\t\tand Lady Higginbottom and \u0096 and \u0096 \n\t\tand who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI can feel my butt getting sore \n\t\talready.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tExactly, Charlie! You understand \n\t\twhat I'm saying \u0096 a lot more than \n\t\tsome of these literary types. Because \n\t\tyou're a real man!\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tAnd I could tell you some stories \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSure you could!  And yet many writers \n\t\tdo everything in their power to \n\t\tinsulate themselves from the common \n\t\tman \u0096 from where they live, from \n\t\twhere they trade, from where they \n\t\tfight and love and converse and \u0096 \n\t\tand \u0096 and... so naturally their work \n\t\tsuffers, and regresses into empty \n\t\tformalism and \u0096 well, I'm spouting \n\t\toff again, but to put it in your \n\t\tlanguage, the theater becomes as \n\t\tphony as a three dollar bill.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYeah, I guess that's tragedy right \n\t\tthere.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tFrequently played, seldom remarked.\n\n\tCharlie laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhatever that means.\n\n\tBarton smiles with him.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYou're all right, Charlie. I'm glad \n\t\tyou stopped by. I'm sorry if \u0096 well \n\t\tI know I sometimes run on.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, \n\t\tI'll let you know if I'm bored. I \n\t\tfind it all pretty damned interesting. \n\t\tI'm the kind schmoe who's generally \n\t\tinterested in the other guy's point \n\t\tof view.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, we've got something in common \n\t\tthen.\n\n\tCharlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell Christ, if there's any way I \n\t\tcan contribute, or help, or whatever\u0096\n\n\tBarton chuckles and extends his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSure, sure Charlie, you can help by \n\t\tjust being yourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell, I can tell you some stories \u0096\n\n\tHe pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...And look, I'm sorry as hell about \n\t\tthe interruption. Too much revelry \n\t\tlate at night, you forget there are \n\t\tother people in the world.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSee you, Charlie.\n\n\tCharlie closes the door and is gone.\n\n\tBarton goes back to his desk and sits.\n\n\tMuffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening \n\tand closing.\n\n\tBarton looks at the wall.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe bathing beauty.\n\n\tFrom offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHe looks around to the opposite \u0096 \n\t\tbed \u0096 wall.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat.  \n\n\tOne swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from \n\tthe wall. About three feet of the wall, where it meets the \n\tceiling, is exposed.\n\n\tThe strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and \n\tnods above the bed. It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical \n\tflower.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tHe goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. He smooths the \n\twallpaper back up against the wall.\n\n\tHe looks at his hand.\n\n\tHIS HAND\n\n\tSticky with tacky yellow wall sweat.\n\n\tHe wipes it onto his shirt.\n\n\tWe hear a faint mosquito hum.\n\n\tBarton looks around.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\tA TYPEWRITER Whirring at high speed. The keys strike too \n\tquickly for us to make out the words.\n\n\tSLOW TRACK IN\n\n\tOn Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring \n\tblankly.  Distant phones ring. Barton's eyes are tired and \n\tbloodshot.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tA gargoyle secretary sits typing a document.\n\n\tThe office door opens in the background and a short middle-\n\taged man in a dark suit emerges.\n\n\tTo his secretary:\n\n\t\t\t\tEXECUTIVE\n\t\tI'm eating on the lot today \u0096\n\n\tHe notices Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tEXECUTIVE\n\t\t...Who's he?\n\n\tThe secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip \n\tof paper on her desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tSECRETARY\n\t\tBarton Fink, Mr. Geisler.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tMore please.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm a writer, Mr. Geisler.

Writers come \n\t\tand go; we always need Indians.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're \n\t\tproducing this Wallace Beery picture \n\t\tI'm working on.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tWhat!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. \n\t\tThey've assigned me enough pictures \n\t\tfor a goddamn year. What Ted Okum \n\t\tdoesn't know you could almost squeeze \n\t\tinto the Hollywood Bowl.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThen who should I talk to?\n\n\tGeisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he \n\taddresses the secretary:\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tGet me Lou Breeze.\n\n\tHe perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward \n\tthe secretary, as he glares wordlessly at Barton.\n\n\tAfter a moment:\n\n\t\t\t\tSECRETARY\n\t\tIs he in for Mr. Geisler?\n\n\tShe puts the phone in Geisler's hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tLou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this \n\t\tmorning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay, \n\t\tthe reason I'm calling, I got a writer \n\t\there, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm \n\t\tproducing that Wallace Beery wrestling \n\t\tpicture \u0096 what'm I, the goddamn \n\t\tjanitor around here?...  Yeah, well \n\t\twho'd you get that from?...  Yeah, \n\t\twell tell Lipnik he can kiss my \n\t\tdimpled ass... Shit! No, alright... \n\t\tNo, no, all right.\n\n\tWithout looking he reaches the phone back. The secretary \n\ttakes it and cradles it.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\t...Okay kid, let's chow.\n\n\tCOMMISSARY\n\n\tBarton and Geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth. Geisler \n\tspeaks through a mouthful of food:\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tDon't worry about it. It's just a B \n\t\tpicture. I bring it in on budget, \n\t\tthey'll book it without even screening \n\t\tit. Life is too short.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tBut Lipnik said he wanted to look at \n\t\tthe script, see something by the end \n\t\tof the week.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tSure he did. And he forgot about it \n\t\tbefore your ass left his sofa.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tOkay. I'm just having trouble getting \n\t\tstarted. It's funny, I'm blocked up.  \n\t\tI feel like I need some kind of \n\t\tindication of... what's expected \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tWallace Beery. Wrestling picture. \n\t\tWhat do you need, a road map?\n\n\tGeisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\t...Look, you're confused? You need \n\t\tguidance? Talk to another writer.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWho?\n\n\tGeisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tJesus, throw a rock in here, you'll \n\t\thit one. And do me a favor, Fink: \n\t\tThrow it hard.\n\n\tCOMMISSARY MEN'S ROOM\n\n\tBarton stands at a urinal.\n\n\tHe stares at the wall in front of him as he pees. After a \n\tmoment, he cocks his head, listening.\n\n\tWe hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a \n\tdifficult passage. It is followed by the gurgling ruch of \n\tvomit.\n\n\tBarton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls.\n\n\tThere is more businesslike throat clearing.\n\n\tBarton stoops.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tWe boom down to show the blue serge pants and well-polished \n\tshoes of the stall's kneeling occupant.\n\n\tA white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect \n\tthe trouser knees.\n\n\tThe toilet flushes. The man rises, picks up his handkerchief \n\tup off the floor and gives it a smart flap.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe quickly straightens and goes to the sink. He starts washing \n\this hands. We hear the stall door being unlatched.\n\n\tBarton glances over his shoulder.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe stall door opening.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tQuickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hands.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tHis hands writhing under the running water. We hear footsteps \n\tapproaching.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tForcing himself to look at his hands. We hear the man reach \n\tthe adjacent sink and turn on the tap.\n\n\tBarton can't help glancing up.\n\n\tTHE MAN\n\n\tA dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit. He has warm \n\tbrown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt-and-pepper mustache. \n\tHe smiles pleasantly at Barton.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe gives a nervous smile \u0096 more like a tic \u0096 and looks back \n\tdown at his hands. We hear the man gargling water and spitting \n\tinto the sink.\n\n\tAfter a moment, Barton looks up again.\n\n\tTHE MAN\n\n\tReacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time, \n\ta curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tLooks back down, then up again.\n\n\tTHE MAN\n\n\tExtends a dripping hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tBill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.\n\n\tHis speech is softly accented, from the South.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tBarton Fink.\n\n\tThey shake, then return to their ablutions.\n\n\tWe hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned \n\toff and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's \n\teyes are widening.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Jesus. W.P.!\n\n\tThe dapper little man stops and turns.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tI beg your pardon?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tW.P. Mayhew? The writer?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tJust Bill, please.\n\n\tBarton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little \n\tman, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short \n\tpause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but \n\turgent.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tBill!...\n\n\tMayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally \n\tBarton brings out:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...You're the finest novelist of our \n\t\ttime.\n\n\tMayhew leans against a stall.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tWhy thank you, son, how kind. Bein' \n\t\toccupied here in the worship of \n\t\tMammon, I haven't had the chance yet \n\t\tto see your play \u0096\n\n\tHe smiles at Barton's surprise.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\t...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the \n\t\tnews reaches us in Hollywood.\n\n\tHe is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSir, I'm flattered that you even \n\t\trecognize my name. My God, I had no \n\t\tidea you were in Hollywood.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tAll of us undomesticated writers \n\t\teventually make their way out here \n\t\tto the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's \n\t\twhy I allus have such a powerful \n\t\tthrust.\n\n\tHe clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves \n\tit at Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\t...A little social lubricant, Mistuh \n\t\tFink?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tIt's still a little early for me.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tSo be it.\n\n\tHe knocks back some more.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Bill, if I'm imposing you should \n\t\tsay so, I know you're very busy \u0096 I \n\t\tjust, uh... I just wonder if I could \n\t\task you a favor... That is to say, \n\t\tuh... have you ever written a \n\t\twrestling picture?\n\n\tMayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\t...You are drippin', suh.\n\n\tBarton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown \n\tpaper towel from a dispenser.\n\n\tMayhew sighs:\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\t...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented \n\t\ta genre of picture that Bill Mayhew \n\t\thas not, at one time or othuh, been \n\t\tinvited to essay. I have taken my \n\t\tstabs at the wrastlin' form, as I \n\t\thave stabbed at so many others, and \n\t\twith as little success. I gather \n\t\tthat you are a fresh-man here, eager \n\t\tfor an upperclassman's council.  \n\t\tHowever, just at the moment...\n\n\tHe waves his flask.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\t...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't \n\t\tyou stop at my bungalow, which is \n\t\tnumbah fifteen, later on this \n\t\tafternoon...\n\n\tHe turns to leave.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\t...and we will discuss wrastlin' \n\t\tscenarios and other things lit'rary.\n\n\tTHE NUMBER \"15\"\n\n\tWe are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door.  \n\n\tMuted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice \u0096 enraged, \n\tbellowing.  We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's \n\tvoice, its tone placating.\n\n\tREVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN\n\n\tOn Barton, standing in front of the door.\n\n\tThe noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice \n\tagain.\n\n\tBarton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks.  \n\n\tWith this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing \n\tagain.\n\n\tThe door cracks open.\n\n\tThe woman looks as if she has been crying.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t...Can I help you?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... \n\t\tUh, Bill asked me to drop by this \n\t\tafternoon.  Is he in?\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tMr. Mayhew is indisposed at the \n\t\tmoment\u0096\n\n\tFrom inside, we hear Mayhew's wail.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tHONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!\n\n\tThe woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps \n\toutside, closing the door behind her.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tMr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr. \n\t\tMayhew's personal secretary. I know \n\t\tthis all must sound horrid. I really \n\t\tdo apologize...\n\n\tThrough the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tIs, uh... Is he okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tHe will be... When he can't write, \n\t\the drinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tWHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S \n\t\tM'HONEY!!\n\n\tShe brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tI am sorry, it's so embarassing.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHow about you? Will you be alright?\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tI'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr \n\t\tFink?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYes I am. I'm working on a wres \u0096 \n\t\tplease call me Barton.\n\n\tAudrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tI'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm \n\t\tsure he'll want to reschedule your \n\t\tappointment.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tPerhaps you and I could get together \n\t\tat some point also. \u0096I'm sorry if \n\t\tthat sounds abrupt. I just... I don't \n\t\tknow anyone here in this town.\n\n\tAudrey smiles at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tPerhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tPlease, Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tBarton. You see, Barton, I'm not \n\t\tjust Bill's secretary \u0096 Bill and I \n\t\tare... I love. We-\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW'S VOICE\n\t\tM'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!\n\n\tAudrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes \n\tand heavy footsteps.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI see.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\t...I know this must look... funny.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo, no \u0096\n\n\tHurriedly:\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tWe need each other. We give each \n\t\tother...  the things we need \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tM'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of \n\t\tbitches... the water's lappin' up...\n\t\tM'HONEY!!\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tI'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't \n\t\tjudge us. Please...\n\n\tFlustered, she backs away and closes the door.\n\n\tCLOSE ON A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE\n\n\tHand-printed on the package is the message:\n\n\t\"Hope these will turn the trick, Mr. Fink. \u0096 Chet!\"  \n\n\tThe wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened.\n\n\tTwo thumbtacks are taken out.\n\n\tBARTON'S HOTEL ROOM\n\n\tLate at night. The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has \n\tsagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the \n\tswath next to it.\n\n\tBarton enters frame and steps up onto the bed.\n\n\tHe smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near \n\tthe top.\n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE SHOT\n\n\tOn the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky \n\tyellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around \n\tthe tack.\n\n\tON BARTON\n\n\tSmoothing up the second swath.\n\n\tAs he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening.  \n\n\tMuffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning.  \n\n\tAfter a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the \n\twall.\n\n\tCLOSE ON BARTON\n\n\tAs his ear meets the wall.\n\n\tThe woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of \n\tbedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling.\n\n\tBarton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the \n\tsecretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the \n\tcarriage.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under \n\tthe metal prongs that hold the paper down.\n\n\tWe begin to hear moaning again.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tStill looking; sweating.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tTracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so \n\tthat we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the \n\tpage.\n\n\tThe moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks.\n\n\tTHE DOOR\n\n\tAs it swings open.  Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHowdy, neighbor.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tCharlie. How are you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tJesus, I hope I'm not interrupting \n\t\tyou again. I heard you walking around \n\t\tin here.  Figured I'd drop by.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really \n\t\tgotten started yet \u0096 what happened \n\t\tto your ear?\n\n\t\u0096 for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As \n\the enters:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic \n\t\tthing.  Goes away for a while, but \n\t\tit always comes back. Gotta put cotton \n\t\tin it to staunch the flow of pus. \n\t\tDon't worry, it's not contagious.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSeen a doctor?\n\n\tCharlie gives a dismissive wave.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tAh, doctors. What's he gonna tell \n\t\tme?  Can't trade my head in for a \n\t\tnew one.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo, I guess you're stuck with the \n\t\tone you've got. Have a seat.\n\n\tCharlie perches on the corner of the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThanks, I'd invite you over to my \n\t\tplace, but it's a goddamn mess. You \n\t\tmarried, Bart?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNope.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI myself have yet to be lassoed.\n\n\tHe takes his flask out.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Got a sweetheart?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo... I guess it's something about \n\t\tmy work. I get so worked up over it, \n\t\tI don't know; I don't really have a \n\t\tlot of attention left over, so it \n\t\twould be a little unfair...\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYeah, the ladies do ask for attention. \n\t\tIn my experience, they pretend to \n\t\tgive it, but it's generally a smoke-\n\t\tscreen for demanding it back \u0096 with \n\t\tinterest. How about family, Bart?  \n\t\tHow're you fixed in that department?\n\n\tBarton smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tMy folks live in Brooklyn, with my \n\t\tuncle.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tMine have passed on. It's just the \n\t\tthree of us now...\n\n\tHe taps himself on the head, chuckling.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...What's the expression \u0096 me myself \n\t\tand I.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSure, that's tough, but in a sense, \n\t\twe're all alone in this world aren't \n\t\twe Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by \n\t\tfamily and friends, but...\n\n\tHe shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tMm... You're no stranger to \n\t\tloneliness, then. I guess I got no \n\t\tbeef; especially where the dames are \n\t\tconcerned. In my line of work I get \n\t\topportunities galore \u0096 always on the \n\t\twing, you know what I'm saying. I \n\t\tcould tell stories to curl your hair \n\t\t\u0096 but it looks like you've already \n\t\theard 'em!\n\n\tHe laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls \n\ta dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to \n\tBarton:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...That's me in Kansas City, plying \n\t\tmy trade.\n\n\tTHE PHOTO\n\n\tCharlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running \n\tboard of a 1939 roadster. A battered leather briefcase dangles \n\tfrom one hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...It was taken by one of my policy \n\t\tholders. They're more than just \n\t\tcustomers to me, Barton.  They really \n\t\tappreciate what I have to offer them. \n\t\tYa see, her hubby was out of town at \n\t\tthe time \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYou know, in a way, I envy you \n\t\tCharlie.  Your daily routine \u0096 you \n\t\tknow what's expected. You know the \n\t\tdrill. My job is to plumb the depths, \n\t\tso to speak, dredge something up \n\t\tfrom inside, something honest. There's \n\t\tno road map for that territory...\n\n\tHe looks from Charlie to the Underwood.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...and exploring it can be painful. \n\t\tThe kind of pain most people don't \n\t\tknow anything about.\n\n\tHe looks back at Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...This must be boring you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tNot at all. It's damned interesting.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah...\n\n\tHe gives a sad chuckle.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Probably sounds a little grand \n\t\tcoming from someone who's writing a \n\t\twrestling picture for Wallace Beery.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBeery! You got no beef there! He's \n\t\tgood.  Hell of an actor \u0096 though, \n\t\tfor my money, you can't beat Jack \n\t\tOakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, \n\t\tfunny stuff. But don't get me wrong \n\t\t\u0096 Beery, a wrestling picture, that \n\t\tcould be a pip. Wrestled some myself \n\t\tback in school. I guess you know the \n\t\tbasic moves.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNope, never watched any. I'm not \n\t\tthat interested in the act itself \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOkay, but hell, you should know what \n\t\tit is. I can show you in about thirty \n\t\tseconds.\n\n\tHe is getting down on his hands and knees.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...You're a little out of your weight \n\t\tclass, but just for purposes of \n\t\tdemonstration \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThat's all right, really \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tNot a bit of it, compadre! Easiest \n\t\tthing in the world! You just get \n\t\tdown on your knees to my left, slap \n\t\tyour right hand here...\n\n\tHe indicated his own right bicep.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...and your left hand here.\n\n\tHe indicated his left bicep.\n\n\tBarton hesitates.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...You can do it, champ!\n\n\tBarton complies.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...All right now, when I say \"Ready...  \n\t\twrestle!\"  you try and pin me, and I \n\t\ttry and pin you. That's the whole \n\t\tgame. Got it?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Yeah, okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tReady... wrestle!\n\n\tWith one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, his \n\thead and shoulders hitting with a thump. Charlie pins Barton's \n\tshoulders with his own upper body.\n\n\tBut before the move even seems completed Charlie is standing \n\tagain, offering his hand down to Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tDamn, there I go again. We're gonna \n\t\twake the downstairs neighbors.  I \n\t\tdidn't hurt ya, did I?\n\n\tBarton seems dazed, but not put out.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tIt's okay, it's okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell, that's all that wrestling is. \n\t\tExcept usually there's more grunting \n\t\tand squirming before the pin. Well, \n\t\tit's your first time. And you're out \n\t\tof your weight class.\n\n\tBarton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the \n\tback of his head. This registers on Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Jesus, I did hurt you!\n\n\tHe clomps hurriedly away.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I \n\t\tsure do apologize.\n\n\tWe hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet towel.  \n\n\tBarton accepts the towel and presses it to his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...You sure you're okay?\n\n\tBarton gets to his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm fine, Charlie. Really I am. \n\t\tActually, it's been helpful, but I \n\t\tguess I should get back to work.\n\n\tCharlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and heads \n\tfor the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell, it wasn't fair of me to do \n\t\tthat. I'm pretty well endowed \n\t\tphysically.\n\n\tHe opens the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't \n\t\tbe much of a match for you at mental \n\t\tgymnastics. Gimme a holler if you \n\t\tneed anything.\n\n\tThe door closes.\n\n\tBarton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the \n\tback of his head.

Early morning traffic is \n\taudible, as is the cry fishmongers.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tHe rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the \n\tpage.\n\n\tHis gaze drifts up.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe bathing beauty.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tLooking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands \n\tagainst his ears.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe bathing beauty. Faint, but building, is the sound of the \n\tsurf.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHead cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound.  \n\tBarton looks sharply around.\n\n\tTHE BATHROOM\n\n\tBarton enters.\n\n\tThe sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet \n\tBarton's towel, is overflowing. Water spills onto the tile \n\tfloor.\n\n\tBarton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and \n\treaches into the sink.\n\n\tAs his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged \n\tsink gulp water.\n\n\tBARTON'S HAND\n\n\tHolding a dripping wad of cotton.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tAfter a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton \n\tcame from \u0096 and convulsively flips it away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n\n\tON THE TITLE PAGE OF A BOOK:\n\n\t\"NEBUCHADNEZZAR  \n\tBY  \n\tW.P.

The last of the sunlight slopes \n\tdown through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the \n\tonly customers at the stand.\n\n\tMayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot.  \n\n\tMayhew leans back in his chair.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tIf I close m'eyes I can almost smell \n\t\tthe live oak.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tThat's hamburger grease, Bill.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tWell, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish \n\t\ton me \u0096 lyin' and deceitful...\n\n\tHis eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the \n\tbreeze.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\t...Still, I must say.

Ain't writin' peace?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell... actually, no Bill...\n\n\tBarton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...No, I've always found that writing \n\t\tcomes from a great inner pain. Maybe \n\t\tit's a pain that comes from a \n\t\trealization that one must do something \n\t\tfor one's fellow man \u0096 to help somehow \n\t\tto ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a \n\t\tpersonal pain. At any rate, I don't \n\t\tbelieve good work is possible without \n\t\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tMmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' \n\t\tthings up. Yessir.

I think \n\t\tit's Bill's finest, or among his \n\t\tfinest anyway.\n\n\tMayhew looks at her narrowly.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tSo now I'm s'posed to roll over like \n\t\tan ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly \n\t\tscratched.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tBill \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tLook, maybe it's none of my business, \n\t\tbut a man with your talent \u0096 don't \n\t\tyou think your first obligation would \n\t\tbe to your gift?

But I do know \n\t\twhat you're doing with that drink. \n\t\tYou're cutting yourself off from \n\t\tyour gift, and from me and Audrey, \n\t\tand from your fellow man, and from \n\t\teverything your art is about.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tNo son, thisahere moonshine's got \n\t\tnothin' to do with shuttin' folks \n\t\tout.

He looks at her, stops singing, \n\tshe murmurs something, and he bellows:\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tThe truth, m'honey, is a tart that \n\t\tdoes not bear scrutiny.\n\n\tShe touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, \n\tknocking her to the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tBreach my levee at your peril!\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe rises.\n\n\tAUDREY\n\n\tComing back to Barton.\n\n\tMAYHEW\n\n\tStumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and \n\twaving his bottle of Wild Turkey.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tLet him go.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThat son of a bitch... Don't get me \n\t\twrong, he's a fine writer.\n\n\tHe looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving \n\tin the dust.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tI'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, \n\t\tand from there I'll... improvise.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAre you all right?\n\n\tWe hear distant bellowing:\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYHEW\n\t\tSilent upon a hill in Darien!\n\n\tAudrey bursts into tears. Barton puts his arms around her \n\tand she leans into him.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAudrey, you can't put up with this.\n\n\tGradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\t...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for \n\t\thim!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhat?! He's a son of a bitch!\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tNo, sometimes he just... well, he \n\t\tthinks about Estelle. His wife still \n\t\tlives in Fayettesville. She's... \n\t\tdisturbed.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tReally?...\n\n\tHe considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Well that doesn't excuse his \n\t\tbehavior.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tHe'll wander back when he's sober \n\t\tand apologize. He always does.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tOkay, but that doesn't excuse his \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tBarton. Empathy requires... \n\t\tunderstanding.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhat. What don't I understand?\n\n\tAudrey gazes at him.\n\n\tMAYHEW\n\n\tHe is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his \n\tlight summer suit. \"Old Black Joe\" floats back to us in the \n\ttwilight.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\tBARTON'S HOTEL ROOM\n\n\tFrom a high angle, booming down on Barton.\n\n\tThe room is dark. Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out \n\ton the bed, asleep. The hum of the mosquito fades up in the \n\tstillness.\n\n\tSuddenly Barton slaps his cheek. His eyes open, but he remains \n\tstill. The hum fades up again.  Barton reaches over and turns \n\ton the bedside lamp. His eyes shift this way and that as he \n\twaits, listening.\n\n\tThe hum fades down to silence.\n\n\tBarton's eyes shift.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled \n\thalfway through the carriage.\n\n\tTHE TYPEWRITER\n\n\tBarton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tNext to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper.  \n\tThe page in the carriage reads:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n\n\tA TENEMENT HOTEL\n\n\tOn the Lower East Side. We can faintly hear the cry of the \n\tfishmongers. It is too early for us to hear traffic; later, \n\tperhaps, we will.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tLooking down at the page.\n\n\tCLOSE ON BARTON'S FEET\n\n\tSwinging in the legwell.\n\n\tOne foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined \n\tshoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the \n\tlegwell.\n\n\tWe hear typing start.\n\n\tTHE PAGE\n\n\tA new paragraph being started: \"A large man...\"\n\n\tBARTON'S FEET\n\n\tAs he slides them into the shoes.\n\n\tTHE PAGE\n\n\t\"A large man in tights...\"\n\n\tThe typing stops.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tLooking quizzically at the page. What's wrong?\n\n\tHIS FEET\n\n\tSliding back and forth \u0096 swimming \u0096 in his shoes, which are \n\tseveral sizes too large.\n\n\tWe hear a knock at the door.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe rises and answers the door.\n\n\tCharlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of \n\tnicely shined shoes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI hope these are your shoes.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHi, Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBecause that would mean they gave \n\t\tyou mine.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah, as a matter of fact they did. \n\t\tCome on in.\n\n\tThe two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton \n\treaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tJesus, what a day I've had. Ever had \n\t\tone of those days?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSeems like nothing but, lately.\n\n\tChalrie perches on the edge of the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tJesus, what a day. Felt like I \n\t\tcouldn't've sold ice water in the \n\t\tSahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't \n\t\twant insurance, so okay, that's your \n\t\tloss. But God, people can be rude. \n\t\tFeel like I have to talk to a normal \n\t\tperson like just to restore a little \n\t\tof my...\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, my pleasure. I could use a \n\t\tlittle lift myself.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tA little lift, yeah...\n\n\tSmiling, he takes out his flask.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Good thing they bottle it, huh \n\t\tpal?\n\n\tHe takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barton a \n\tshot:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Did I say rude? People can be \n\t\tgoddamn cruel. Especially some of \n\t\ttheir housewives. Okay, so I've got \n\t\ta weight problem. That's my cross to \n\t\tbear. I dunno...\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell it's... it's a defense mechanism.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tDefense against what? Insurance?  \n\t\tSomething they need? Something they \n\t\tshould be thanking me for offering? \n\t\tA little peace of mind?...\n\n\tHe shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Finally decided to knock off early, \n\t\ttake your advice. Went to see a doctor \n\t\tabout this.\n\n\tHe indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...He told me it was an ear infection.  \n\t\tTen dollars, please. I said, hell, I \n\t\ttold YOU my ear was infected. Why \n\t\tdon't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, \n\t\tTHAT led to an argument...\n\n\tHe gives a rueful chuckle.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if \n\t\tmy problems amounted to a hill of \n\t\tbeans. How goes the life of the mind?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, it's been better. I can't seem \n\t\tto get going on this thing. That one \n\t\tidea, the one that lets you get \n\t\tstarted \u0096 I still haven't gotten it.  \n\t\tMaybe I only had one idea in me \u0096 my \n\t\tplay. Maybe once that was done, I \n\t\twas done being a writer.  Christ, I \n\t\tfeel like a fraud, sitting here \n\t\tstaring at this paper.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThose two love-birds next door drivin' \n\t\tyou nuts?\n\n\tBarton looks at him curiously.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHow did you know about that?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tKnow about it? I can practically see \n\t\thow they're doin' it. Brother, I \n\t\twish I had a piece of that.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah, but \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tSeems like I hear everything that \n\t\tgoes on in this dump. Pipes or \n\t\tsomethin'. I'm just glad I don't \n\t\thave to ply MY trade in the wee-wee \n\t\thours.\n\n\tHe laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Ah, you'll lick this picture \n\t\tbusiness, believe me. You've got a \n\t\thead on your shoulders. What is it \n\t\tthey say? Where there's a head, \n\t\tthere's a hope?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhere there's life there's hope.\n\n\tCharlie laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThat proves you really are a writer!\n\n\tBarton smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAnd there's hope for you too, Charlie.  \n\t\tTomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen \n\t\tpolicies.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThanks, brother. But the fact is, I \n\t\tgotta pull up stakes temporarily.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYou're leaving?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tIn a few days. Out to your stompin' \n\t\tgrounds as a matter of fact \u0096 New \n\t\tYork City. Things have gotten all \n\t\tballed up at the Head Office.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.  \n\t\tI'll miss you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell hell, buddy, don't pull a long \n\t\tface!  This is still home for me \u0096 I \n\t\tkeep my room, and I'll be back sooner \n\t\tor later...\n\n\tBarton rises and walks over to his writing table.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...And \u0096 mark my words \u0096 by the time \n\t\tI get back you're picture'll be \n\t\tfinished. I know it.\n\n\tBarton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNew York can be pretty cruel to \n\t\tstrangers, Charlie. If you need a \n\t\thome-cooked meal you just look up \n\t\tMorris and Lillian Fink.  They live \n\t\ton Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.\n\n\tWe hear a tacky, tearing sound.\n\n\tBarton looks toward the door.\n\n\tCharlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton \n\tsits.\n\n\tThe two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau \u0096 the \n\tslight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a \n\thunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close \n\ttogether.\n\n\tTHEIR POV\n\n\tA swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from \n\tthe wall. It sags and nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(off)\n\t\tChrist!\n\n\tTHE TWO MEN\n\n\tFrozen, looking.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Your room does that too?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI guess the heat's sweating off the \n\t\twallpaper.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhat a dump...\n\n\tHe heads for the door and Barton follows.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...I guess it seems pathetic to a \n\t\tguy like you.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell...\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean \n\t\tto a guy from New York.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThis kind of heat. It's pathetic.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, I guess you pick your poison.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tSo they say.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tDon't pick up and leave without saying \n\t\tgoodbye.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tCourse not, compadre. You'll see me \n\t\tagain.\n\n\tBarton closes the door.\n\n\tHe goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter.  \n\tAfter a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the \n\tceiling.\n\n\tWe hear a loud thump.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe ceiling \u0096 a white, seamless space.\n\n\tAs we track in the thumping continues \u0096 slowly, rhythmically, \n\tprogressively louder \u0096 the effect, it seems, of odd doings \n\tupstairs.\n\n\tLOOKING DOWN ON BARTON\n\n\tFrom a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the \n\tceiling.\n\n\tWe track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues, \n\tgrowing louder, sharper.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tMoving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area \n\tand cease to have any sense of movement.\n\n\tWith a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame \n\tto land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is \n\tgone, having left a huge black \"T\" stamped into the white \n\tceiling.\n\n\tWe are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of \n\tthe key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear \n\trapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The \n\tthumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter.\n\n\tBEN GEISLER\n\n\tIs emerging from his office.  As he enters the secretary \n\tstops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs \n\ttonelessly, without looking up:\n\n\t\t\t\tSECRETARY\n\t\tBarton Fink.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tYeah. Fink. Come in.\n\n\tThe clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises.\n\n\tGEISLER'S OFFICE\n\n\tThe two men enter.\n\n\tThis office is considerably smaller than Lipnik's, done in \n\tgrays and black. There are pictures on the wall of Geisler \n\twith various celebrities.\n\n\tGeisler sits behind his desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tWuddya got for me \u0096 what the hell \n\t\thappened to your face?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNothing. It's just a mosquito bite.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tLike hell it is; there are no \n\t\tmosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos \n\t\tbreed in swamps \u0096 this is a desert \n\t\ttown.

Where are we? \n\t\tWuddya got?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell, to tell you the truth, I'm \n\t\thaving some trouble getting started\u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tGEISLER\n\t\tGetting STARTED! Christ Jesus! \n\t\tStarted?!

We are craning down toward the bed, where \n\tBarton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow \n\tas if to blot out the world.\n\n\tThe track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm: \n\t1:30.\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY\n\n\tAt the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on \n\tover the elevator, with a faint bell.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tWith two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow \n\toff his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his \n\twatch.\n\n\tThere is a knock at the door.\n\n\tBarton swings his feet off the bed.\n\n\tTHE DOORWAY\n\n\tBarton opens the door to Audrey.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tHello, Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAudrey, thank you for coming. Thank \n\t\tyou.  I'm sorry to be such a... such \n\t\ta... Thank you.\n\n\tThey enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge \n\tof the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tNow that's all right, Barton.  \n\t\tEverything'll be all right.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYes. Thank you. How's Bill?\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tOh, he's... he drifted off. He'll \n\t\tsleep for a while now. What is it \n\t\tyou have to do, exactly?\n\n\tBarton paces.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell I have to come up with \u0096 an \n\t\toutline, I'd guess you call it. The \n\t\tstory. The whole goddamn story. Soup \n\t\tto nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tIt's alright, Barton. You don't have \n\t\tto write actual scenes?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo, but the whole goddamn \u0096 Audrey?  \n\t\tHave you ever had to read any of \n\t\tBill's wrestling scenarios?\n\n\tAudrey laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tYes, I'm afraid I have.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhat are they like? What are they \n\t\tabout?\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tWell, usually, they're... simply \n\t\tmorality tales. There's a good \n\t\twrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he \n\t\tconfronts at the end. In between, \n\t\tthe good wrestler has a love interest \n\t\tor a child he has to protect.  Bill \n\t\twould usually make the good wrestler \n\t\ta backwoods type, or a convict. And \n\t\tsometimes, instead of a waif, he'd \n\t\thave the wrestler protecting an idiot \n\t\tmanchild.  The studio always hated \n\t\tthat. Oh, some of the scripts were \n\t\tso... spirited!\n\n\tShe laughs \u0096 then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She \n\tlooks at Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\t...Barton.\n\n\tShe shakes her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\t...Look, it's really just a formula. \n\t\tYou don't have to type your soul \n\t\tinto it.  We'll invent some names \n\t\tand a new setting.  I'll help you \n\t\tand it won't take any time at all. I \n\t\tdid it for Bill so many times \u0096\n\n\tBarton's pacing comes up short.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tDid what for Bill?\n\n\tGuardedly:\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tWell... THIS.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYou wrote his scripts for him?\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tWell, the basic ideas were frequently \n\t\this-\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYou wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus \n\t\tChrist, you wrote his \u0096 what about \n\t\tbefore that?\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tBefore what?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tBefore Bill came to Hollywood.\n\n\tAudrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tWell, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so \n\t\tto speak-\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWhat do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, \n\t\thow long have you been his... \n\t\tsecretary?\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tBarton, I think we should concentrate \n\t\ton OUR little project-\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI want to know how many of Bill's \n\t\tbooks you wrote!\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tBarton!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI want to know!\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tBarton, honestly, only the last couple-\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHah!\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tAnd my input was mostly... EDITORIAL,\n\t\treally, when he'd been drinking-\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'll bet. Jesus \u0096 \"The grand \n\t\tproductive days.\" What a goddamn \n\t\tphony.\n\n\tHe resumes pacing.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn \n\t\tPhony Mayhew. All his guff about \n\t\tescape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped!\n\n\tBarton sighs and looks at his watch.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Well, we don't have much time.\n\n\tHe sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\tIt'll be fine... Don't judge him, \n\t\tBarton.  Don't condescend to him...\n\n\tShe strokes Barton's hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDREY\n\t\t...It's not as simple as you think. \n\t\tI helped Bill most by appreciating \n\t\thim, by understanding him. We all \n\t\tneed understanding, Barton. Even \n\t\tyou, tonight, it's all you really \n\t\tneed...\n\n\tShe kisses him.\n\n\tAs Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away.\n\n\tWe frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward \n\tthe sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and \n\tBarton's breath, becoming labored.\n\n\tThe continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the \n\tsink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the \n\tporcelain white.  We track up to the drain and are enveloped \n\tby it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of \n\tpipes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBLACK\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tThe hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are \n\tlooking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn.\n\n\tBarton's eyes snap open.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe white ceiling. A humming black speck flits across the \n\twhite.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tSlowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following \n\tthe sound of the mosquito.\n\n\tHis gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the \n\thum stops.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tAudrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered \n\tby a blanket.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tGingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's \n\tback.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe alabaster white of Audrey's back.\n\n\tThe mosquito is feeding on it.\n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE ON BARTON'S EYES\n\n\tLooking.\n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE ON THE MOSQUITO\n\n\tSwelling with blood.\n\n\tWIDER\n\n\tAs Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back.  \n\n\tShe doesn't react.\n\n\tBarton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with \n\tblood.\n\n\tON BARTON\n\n\tHe looks at his hand.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tHis hand is dripping with blood. Too much blood.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tEyes wide, he looks down at the bed.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tBlood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's \n\tback.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe pulls Audrey's shoulder.\n\n\tAUDREY\n\n\tShe rolls onto her back. Her eyes are wide and lifeless.  \n\n\tHer stomach is nothing but blood. The top sheet, drawn to \n\ther waist is drenched red and clings to her body.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe screams.\n\n\tHe screams again.\n\n\tWe hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening \n\tand closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door.  \n\n\tBarton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily \n\tfrozen.\n\n\tAnother knock.\n\n\tBarton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.\n\n\tTHE DOORWAY\n\n\tOver Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door.\n\n\tCharlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a \n\tsleeveless tee.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tAre you all right?\n\n\tBarton stares dumbly for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Can I come in?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo!...

He averts \n\this eyes \u0096 as it happens, toward the secretary.\n\n\tHe walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey.\n\n\tCLOSE ON BARTON\n\n\tAs he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, \n\ttotally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed.  \n\n\tHe stares for a long beat.\n\n\tStrange, involuntary noises come from his throat. He is not \n\tin control.\n\n\tBecoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops.\n\n\tHe lurches to his feet.\n\n\tTHE DOORWAY\n\n\tAs Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out.\n\n\tHALLWAY\n\n\tBarton peers out the see if the coast is clear.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe long hallway.\n\n\tIn the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping \n\tin front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. Next to him \n\tis a castored shoe caddy.\n\n\tAll of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes.\n\n\tCHET\n\n\tClose on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up.\n\n\tCHET'S POV\n\n\tUp the long hall. In the deep background a door is closing.\n\n\tCHET\n\n\tHe pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the \n\tshoe caddy. It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall.\n\n\tBARTON'S ROOM\n\n\tBarton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak.  \n\tEventually it becomes inaudible.\n\n\tHe cracks the door again, looks out, and exits.\n\n\tHALLWAY\n\n\tBarton goes to Charlie's room and knocks.\n\n\tFootfalls end as the door is cracked open.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBarton.

For a moment the two men stare \n\tat each other \u0096 Charlie's look inquisitive, Barton's \n\tsupplicating.\n\n\tFinally, Charlie nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOkay.\n\n\tHe turns and pushes open the door.\n\n\tBARTON'S ROOM\n\n\tThe two men enter.\n\n\tBarton lingers by the door. Charlie walks into the foreground \n\tto look off toward the bed.\n\n\tHis eyes widen and he screams.\n\n\tHe turns and disappears into the bathroom. We hear vomiting, \n\tthen the flush of a toilet.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tJesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...\n\n\tHis reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and more \n\tagitated.\n\n\tCharlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is \n\t\tthis?  What're we gonna do?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI've gotta call the police \u0096 or you \n\t\tcould call for me \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHold on \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYou gotta believe me \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHold on \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI didn't do this, I did NOT do this\u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. \n\t\tTell me what happened.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI don't know! I woke up, she was... \n\t\tGod, you gotta believe me!\n\n\tCharlie, in spite of himself, is sneaking horrified glances \n\tback into the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI believe you, brother, but this \n\t\tdon't look good.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWe gotta call the police \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHold on. I said hold on, so hold on.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhat do you think happened?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI don't know!  Maybe it was her...  \n\t\tboyfriend. I passed out. I don't \n\t\tknow.  Won't the police be able to \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tStop with the police! Wake up, friend!  \n\t\tThis does not look good! They hang \n\t\tpeople for this!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tBut I didn't do it \u0096 don't you believe \n\t\tme?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI believe you \u0096 I KNOW you. But why \n\t\tshould the police?\n\n\tBarton gives him a dumb stare.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Did you... Barton, between you \n\t\tand me, did you have sexual \n\t\tintercourse?\n\n\tBarton stares at Charlie. He swallows.\n\n\tCharlie shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tJesus... They can tell that...\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThey GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They \n\t\tgotta have mercy!\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou're in pictures, Barton. Even if \n\t\tyou got cleared eventually, this \n\t\twould ruin you.\n\n\tHe turns and starts toward the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Wait in the bathroom.\n\n\tBATHROOM\n\n\tLater. Barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against \n\tthe wall, staring glassily at his feet.\n\n\tFrom the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the \n\tsounds of bed clothes being torn off.\n\n\tFinally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of \n\tCharlie grunting under great weight.\n\n\tWe hear heavy footsteps approaching.\n\n\tBarton looks up through the open bathroom door.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tCharlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the \n\tsheetswaddled body in his arms.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tHis neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back \n\tto hit the wall.\n\n\tBLACK\n\n\tSlap! Slap!  \n\n\tWe are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap \n\tand backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now \n\twearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has \n\tblood flecks across the belly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou passed out.\n\n\tBarton looks groggily up.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tShe's dead, Barton! If that was her \n\t\tname.\n\n\tTRACKING IN ON BARTON\n\n\tHe stares at Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(off)\n\t\tBarton, listen to me. You gotta act \n\t\tlike nothing's happened. Put this \n\t\ttotally out of your head. I know \n\t\tthat's hard, but your play from here \n\t\ton out is just to go about business \n\t\tas usual. Give us some time to sort \n\t\tthis out...\n\n\tBarton looks at his watch.\n\n\tTHE WATCH\n\n\t7:45.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(off)\n\t\t...Just put it out of you head...\n\n\tTRACKING\n\n\tToward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and \n\tstatuary set amid palms trees.\n\n\tSunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching \n\tJack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tBart! So happy to see ya!\n\n\tREVERSE\n\n\tPulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze.\n\n\tBarton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much \n\tsun.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tSit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then \n\t\ttalk!  Drink?\n\n\tAs Barton sits:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah... rye whiskey?\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tBoy! You writers! Work hard, play \n\t\thard!  That's what I hear, anyway...\n\n\tHe laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t... Lou.\n\n\tLou exits.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tAnyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're \n\t\tgoing along great.  Thinks we've got \n\t\ta real winner in this one. And let \n\t\tme tell you something, I'm counting \n\t\ton it. I've taken an interest. Not \n\t\tto interfere, mind you \u0096 hardly seems \n\t\tnecessary in your case. A writer \u0096 a \n\t\tstoryteller \u0096 of your stature.  \n\t\tGivitta me in bold strokes, Bart. \n\t\tGimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting \n\t\tin the audience, the lights go down, \n\t\tCapitol logo comes up... you're on!\n\n\tHe beams expectantly at Barton.  Barton licks his parched \n\tlips.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah, okay... well... we fade in...\n\n\tLipnik is nodding, already involved in the story.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...It's a tenement building. On the \n\t\tLower East Side...\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tGreat! He's poor, this wrestler! \n\t\tHe's had to struggle!\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tAnd then... well...\n\n\tBarton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits \n\tagainst the sun. He looks back at Lipnik.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tCAN you?  You damn well better be. \n\t\tJesus, if I hadn't been honest in my \n\t\tbusiness dealings \u0096 well, of course, \n\t\tyou can't always be honest, not with \n\t\tthe sharks swimming around this town \n\t\t\u0096 but if you're a writer, you don't \n\t\tthink about those things \u0096 if I'd \n\t\tbeen totally honest, I wouldn't be \n\t\twithin a mile of this pool \u0096 unless \n\t\tI was cleaning it. But that's no \n\t\treason for you not to be. Honest, I \n\t\tmean.  Not cleaning the pool.\n\n\tLou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton. \n\tLou sits.\n\n\tBarton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, \n\tbut must finally take the plunge.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWell... to be honest, I'm never really \n\t\tcomfortable discussing a work in \n\t\tprogress.  I've got it all worked \n\t\tout in my head, but sometimes if you \n\t\tforce it out in words \u0096 prematurely \n\t\t\u0096 the wrong words \u0096 well, your meaning \n\t\tchanges, and it changes your own \n\t\tmind, and you never get it back \u0096 so \n\t\tI'd just as soon not talk about it.\n\n\tLipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a \n\tlong beat.\n\n\tLou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to \n\tfill the silence.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\t...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never \n\t\tmind how long I've been in pictures. \n\t\tMr. Lipnik has been in pictures just \n\t\tabout since they were invented. HE \n\t\tpractically invented them.\n\n\tLipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\t...Now I think if he's interested in \n\t\twhat one of his contract employees \n\t\tis doing while he draws pay, I think \n\t\tthat employee ought to tell him, if \n\t\the wants to stay an employee. Right \n\t\tnow the contents of your head are \n\t\tthe property of Capitol Pictures, so \n\t\tif I were you I would speak up. And \n\t\tpretty goddamn fast.\n\n\tLou looks at Barton, expectantly. Lipnik continues to stare \n\tat Lou.\n\n\tThere is a long silence, terribly heavy.\n\n\tFinally, Lipnik explodes \u0096 at Lou.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tYou lousy sonofabitch! You're telling \n\t\tthis man \u0096 this ARTIST \u0096 what to \n\t\tdo?!\n\n\tLou Breeze is stunned.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\tMr. Lipnik, I \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tThis man creates for a living! He \n\t\tputs food on your table and on mine! \n\t\tTHANK him for it!  Thank him, you \n\t\tungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or \n\t\tYOU'RE fired!\n\n\tBarton is staring, aghast.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tMr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-\n\n\tLipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton. \n\tHe rises and points.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tGet down on your knees, you \n\t\tsonofabitch!  Get down on your knees \n\t\tand kiss this man's feet!\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\tMr. Lipnik, please \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI \u0096 Mr. Lipnik \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tKISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!\n\n\tLou, aghast, looks at Barton.\n\n\tBarton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look.\n\n\tLipnik snarls at Lou:\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...Okay, get out of here. You're \n\t\tfired, you understand me?  Get out \n\t\tof my sight.\n\n\tLou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tMr. Lipnik, I \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tI apologize, Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNo no, Mr. Breeze has actually been \n\t\ta great help \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tYou don't have to cover for him. \n\t\tIt's noble of you, but these things \n\t\thappen in business.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tMr. Lipnik, I really would feel much \n\t\tbetter if you could reconsider \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tAh, forget it, kid. I want you to \n\t\tpull this out of your head. If that \n\t\tsonofabitch wouldn't apologize to \n\t\tyou, goddammit, I will. I respect \n\t\tyour artistry and your methods, and \n\t\tif you can't fill us in yet, well \n\t\thell, we should be kissing your feet \n\t\tfor your fine efforts.\n\n\tHe gets down on his knees in front of Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...You know in the old country we \n\t\twere taught, as very young children, \n\t\tthat there's no shame in supplicatin' \n\t\tyourself when you respect someone.\n\n\tBarton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his \n\tfeet.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, \n\t\tthe administration, and all a the \n\t\tstockholders, please accept this as \n\t\ta symbol of our apology and respect.\n\n\tBARTON'S POV\n\n\tLipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him.\n\n\tBehind Lipnik the pool glitters.\n\n\tBARTON'S ROOM\n\n\tThe cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a \n\tloud but distorted thumping noise.\n\n\tWe are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. \n\tWe are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, \n\thunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the \n\tbed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt \n\tand his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets \n\thave been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous \n\trust-red stain in the middle.\n\n\tAfter a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: \n\tA bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near \n\twall.\n\n\tSilence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a \n\tknock at the door.\n\n\tBarton rises slowly and crosses to the door.\n\n\tTHE DOOR\n\n\tBarton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, \n\this hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head. \n\tIt is the first time we have seen him well turned out.\n\n\tA battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. He holds a \n\tparcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in \n\tbrown paper and tied up with twine.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBarton. Can I come in?\n\n\tBarton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his \n\tbriefcase and enters.\n\n\tTHE ROOM\n\n\tAs the two men enter.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tJesus... You're leaving.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHave to, old timer. Just for a while.\n\n\tBarton sounds desperate:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tJesus, Charlie, I...\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tEverything's okay, believe me. I \n\t\tknow it's rough mentally, but \n\t\teverything's taken care of.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tCharlie! I've got no one else here! \n\t\tYou're the only person I know in Los \n\t\tAngeles...\n\n\tHe starts weeping\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...that I can talk to.\n\n\tCharlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around \n\tBarton.\n\n\tBarton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. Charlie is somber.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tIt's okay... It's okay...\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tCharlie, I feel like I'm going crazy \n\t\t\u0096 like I'm losing my mind. I don't \n\t\tknow what to do... I didn't do it, \n\t\tbelieve me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. \n\t\tI just...\n\n\tHis breath comes in short gasping heaves.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...I just don't know what... to do\u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou gotta get a grip on, brother. \n\t\tYou gotta just carry on \u0096 just for a \n\t\tfew days, till I get back. Try and \n\t\tstay here, keep your door locked. \n\t\tDon't talk to anyone. We just gotta \n\t\tkeep our heads and we'll figure it \n\t\tout.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah, but Charlie \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tDammit, don't argue with me. You \n\t\tasked me to believe you \u0096 well I do.  \n\t\tNow don't argue with me.\n\n\tHe looks at Barton for a beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Look, pal \u0096 can you do something \n\t\tfor me?\n\n\tCharlie hands him his parcel.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Keep this for me, till I get back.\n\n\tBarton, snuffling, accepts the package.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...It's just personal stuff. I don't \n\t\twanna drag it with me, but I don't \n\t\ttrust 'em downstairs, and I'd like \n\t\tto think it's in good hands.\n\n\tStill snuffling:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSure, Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tFunny, huh, when everything that's \n\t\timportant to a guy, everything he \n\t\twants to keep from a lifetime \u0096 when \n\t\the can fit it into a little box like \n\t\tthat. I guess... I guess it's kind \n\t\tof pathetic.\n\n\tWallowing in self-pity:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tIt's more than I've got.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell, keep it for me. Maybe it'll \n\t\tbring you good luck. Yeah, it'll \n\t\thelp you finish your script. You'll \n\t\tthink about me...\n\n\tHe thumps his chest.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll \n\t\tlick that story of yours.\n\n\tBarton is tearfully sincere:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThanks, Charlie.\n\n\tCharlie solemnly thrusts out his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYeah, well, see you soon, friend. \n\t\tYou're gonna be fine.\n\n\tBarton shakes. As they walk to the door:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYou'll be back?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tDon't worry about that, compadre. \n\t\tI'll be back.\n\n\tBarton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns \n\taround.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress.\n\n\tBarton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge \n\tof the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long beat, \n\the sits still, but something is building inside.\n\n\tFinally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator \n\tarriving for Charlie, it erupts:\n\n\tBarton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned \n\tchild.\n\n\tHIGH WIDE SHOT\n\n\tBarton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored \n\tstain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n\n\tBATHING BEAUTY\n\n\tWith the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up.\n\n\tWe pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been \n\ttucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of \n\tCharlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running \n\tboard of the 1939 Ford roadster.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tSitting at the desk, staring at the picture. From his glazed \n\teyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has \n\tbeen staring at the picture for some time.\n\n\tHe notices something on the desk and picks it up.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThe Holy Bible \u0096 Placed by the Gideons.\n\n\tBarton opens it, randomly, to the Book of Daniel. The text \n\tis set in ornately Gothic type.\n\n\t\"5. And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the \n\tChaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known \n\tunto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in \n\tpieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill.\"\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tStaring at the passage. His mouth hangs open.\n\n\tTHE BIBLE\n\n\tBarton riffles to the first page.\n\n\tIn bold type at the top:\n\n\t\"THE BOOK OF GENESIS\"\n\n\tUnderneath, in the same ornately Gothic type:\n\n\t\"Chapter One 1. Fade in on a tenement building on Manhattan's \n\tLower East Side.  Faint traffic noise is audible; 2. As is \n\tthe cry of fishmongers.\"\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tSquinting at the page through bloodshot eyes.\n\n\tHis mouth hangs open.\n\n\tBARTON'S ROOM \u0096 DAY\n\n\tAt the cut the harsh clackety-clack of typing bangs in. \n\tSunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making \n\tit a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains \n\tfairly dim.\n\n\tBarton sits at the secretary, typing furiously.\n\n\tHe finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places \n\tit face-down on a short stack of face-down pages.\n\n\tHe feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. He \n\tis sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we \n\tleft him the previous night.\n\n\tThe telephone rings. After several rings Barton stops typing \n\tand answers it, absently, still looking at his work. His \n\tvoice is hoarse.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHello... Chet... Who?...\n\n\tHe puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the \n\ttypewriter, and examines something he has just written.\n\n\tHe picks the phone back up and listens for a beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t... No, don't send them up here. \n\t\tI'll be right down.\n\n\tELEVATOR\n\n\tA small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator.  \n\n\tWe pan down to Barton, who is riding down with Pete, the old \n\televator operator. Barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...You read the Bible, Pete?\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tHoly Bible?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tI think so... Anyway, I've heard \n\t\tabout it.\n\n\tBarton nods.\n\n\tThey ride for a beat.\n\n\tLOBBY\n\n\tLate afternoon sun slants in from one side. The lobby has \n\tthe same golden ambiance as when first we saw it.\n\n\tBarton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows, \n\tfrom which two men in suits are rising. One is tall, the \n\tother short.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\tFink?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN #2\n\t\tDetective Mastrionotti.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN #1\n\t\tDetective Deutsch.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tL.A.P.D.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tUh-huh.\n\n\tAll three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs. Mastrionotti \n\tperches on the edge of his chair; Deutsch slumps back in the \n\tshadows, studying Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tGot a couple questions to ask ya.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tWhat do you do, Fink?\n\n\tStill hoarse:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI write.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tOh yeah?

You talked to Mundt, what about?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNothing, really.

I'm trying to think... Nothing, \n\t\treally... He... He said he liked \n\t\tJack Oakie pictures.\n\n\tMastrionotti looks at Deutsch. Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti.  \n\tAfter a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tYa know, Fink, ordinarily we say \n\t\tanything you might remember could be \n\t\thelpful. But I'll be frank with you: \n\t\tThat is not helpful.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tYa see how he's not writing it down?\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tFink. That's a Jewish name, isn't \n\t\tit?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\tMastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tYeah, I didn't think this dump was \n\t\trestricted.\n\n\tHe digs in his pocket.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\t...Mundt has disappeared.

Or \n\t\tif you remember something that isn't \n\t\ttotally idiotic.\n\n\tBARTON'S ROOM\n\n\tWe are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on \n\tthe nightstand next to Barton's bed.   \n\n\tBarton enters and picks it up. He holds it for a beat, looking \n\tat it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits.\n\n\tHe shakes it.\n\n\tNo sound; whatever is inside is well packed.\n\n\tBarton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, \n\tas if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf.  \n\n\tFinally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the \n\tbathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    THROUGH TO:\n\n\tREVERSE\n\n\tSome time later; Barton still types. He is face to us; beyond \n\thim we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain.\n\n\tThe phone rings. Barton ignores it. It continues to ring.  \n\n\tBarton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the \n\tbackground. We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile \n\tas the phone continues ringing.\n\n\tBarton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear. \n\tHe resumes typing.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tBarton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the \n\ttypewriter.  Charlie's parcel chatters.\n\n\tBarton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places \n\tit face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds in \n\ta new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the \n\thall. Barton resumes typing.\n\n\tWe hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react, \n\tapparently not hearing.\n\n\tTHE DOORWAY\n\n\tWe are close on the bottom of the door. Someone in the hallway \n\tis sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears \n\tand his footsteps recede.\n\n\tThe note is a printed message headed: \"While You Were Out... \n\t\" Underneath are the printed words: \"You were called by\" \n\tand, handwritten in the space following: \"Mr. Ben Geisler.\"  \n\n\tHandwritten below, in the message space:\n\n\t\"Thank you. Lipnik loved your meeting. Keep up the good work.\" \n\n\tBarton's offscreen typing continues steadily.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\tHALLWAY\n\n\tA perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty \n\thall.  Shoes are set put in front of each door except for \n\tone in the middle background.\n\n\tAt the cut in we hear faint, regular typing.\n\n\tWe hold for a beat. There is no motion. The long, empty hall. \n\tThe distant typing.\n\n\tWe hold.\n\n\tThe typing stops. There is a beat of quiet.\n\n\tIt is broken by the sound of a door opening. It is the \n\tshoeless door in the middle background.\n\n\tA hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway.  \n\n\tThe hand withdraws.\n\n\tThe door closes.\n\n\tA short beat of silence.\n\n\tThe distant typing resumes.\n\n\tThe long empty hall. The distant typing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\tOVER THE BLACK\n\n\tWe hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and \n\tindistinct.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tJust a minute and I'll connect you...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n\n\tCLOSE ON BARTON\n\n\tHis eyes are red-rimmed and wild. He sits on the edge of his \n\tbed holding the phone to his ear.\n\n\tHis voice is unnaturally loud:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHello? Operator! I can't... Oh!\n\n\tHe stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear.\n\n\tWe hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines \n\tswitch, and then a distant ring. The phone rings three or \n\tfour times before it is answered by a groggy voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t...Hello.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tGarland, it's me.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tBarton? What time is it? Are you all \n\t\tright?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYeah, I'm fine, Garland \u0096 I have to \n\t\ttalk to you. I'm calling long \n\t\tdistance.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tOkay.\n\n\tMuffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\t...It's Barton. Calling long distance.\n\n\tBack into the receiver:\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\t...What is it Barton? Are you okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm fine, garland, but I have to \n\t\ttalk with you.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tGo ahead, son.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tIt's about what I'm writing, Garland. \n\t\tIt's really... I think it's really \n\t\tbig.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tWhat do you mean, Barton?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tNot big in the sense of large \u0096 \n\t\talthough it's that too. I mean \n\t\timportant. This may be the most \n\t\tIMPORTANT work I've done.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tWell, I'm... glad to hear that \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tVery important, Garland. I just \n\t\tthought you should know that. Whatever \n\t\thappens.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\t...That's fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tHave you read the Bible, Garland?\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\t...Barton, is everything okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYes... Isn't it?\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tWell, I'm just asking. You sound a \n\t\tlittle \u0096\n\n\tGuardedly:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tSound a little what?\n\n\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n\t\tWell, you just... sound a little\u0096\n\n\tBitterly:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThanks, Garland. Thanks for all the \n\t\tencouragement.\n\n\tHe slams down the phone.\n\n\tOVER HIS SHOULDER\n\n\tA one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the \n\tcotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear.\n\n\tHe resumes typing, furiously.\n\n\tAfter a beat he mutters, still typing.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...Nitwit.\n\n\tTHE BATHING BEAUTY\n\n\tLater. We hear typing and the roar of the surf.'\n\n\tCLOSE ON TYPEWRITER\n\n\tWe are extremely close on the key-strike area. As we cut in \n\tBarton is typing:\n\n\t\"p-o-s-t-c-a-r-d-.\"\n\n\tThe carriage returns a couple of times and \"T-H-E\u0096E-N-D\" is \n\ttyped in.\n\n\tThe paper is ripped out of the carriage.\n\n\tCLOSE ON A STACK OF PAGES\n\n\tLying face down on the desk; the last page is added, face \n\tdown, to the pile.  The pile is picked up, its edges are \n\tstraightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop, \n\tand then the pile is replaced on the desk, face up.  The \n\ttitle page reads:\n\n\t\"THE BURLYMAN \n\tMotion Picture Scenario \n\tBy \n\tBarton Fink\"\n\n\tBarton's right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton \n\twad on top of the script.\n\n\tBarton's left hand enters to deposit another small cotton \n\twad on top of the script.\n\n\tWe hear Barton walk away. We hear bath water run.\n\n\tTHE BATHING BEAUTY\n\n\tStill looking out to sea.\n\n\tUSO HALL\n\n\tWe are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band \n\tplays an up-tempo number.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tDancing animatedly, almost maniacally, his fingers jabbing \n\tthe air.\n\n\tThe hall is crowded, but Barton is one of few men not in \n\tuniform.\n\n\tUSO GIRL\n\n\tGiggling, dancing opposite Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL\n\t\tYou're cute!\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tCaught up in his dancing, oblivious to the girl.\n\n\tA white uniformed arm reaches in to tap Barton on the \n\tshoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAILOR\n\t\t'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?\n\n\tBarton glares at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tThis is MY dance, sailor!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAILOR\n\t\tC'mon buddy, I'm shipping out \n\t\ttomorrow.\n\n\tFor some reason, Barton is angry.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm a writer! Celebrating the \n\t\tcompletion of something GOOD!  Do \n\t\tyou understand that, sailor? I'm a \n\t\tWRITER!\n\n\tHis bellowing has drawn onlookers' attention.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICES\n\t\tStep aside, four-eyes! Let someone \n\t\telse spin the dame! Give the navy a \n\t\tdance! Hey, Four-F, take a hike!\n\n\tBarton turns furiously against the crowd.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE!  \n\t\tHe points at his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...This is my uniform!\n\n\tHe taps his skull.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...THIS is how I serve the common \n\t\tman!  THIS is where I \u0096\n\n\tWHAPP! An infantry man tags Barton's chin on the button. \n\tBodies surge. The crowd gasps. The band blares nightmarishly \n\ton.\n\n\tHOTEL HALLWAY\n\n\tQuiet at the cut.\n\n\tAfter a beat, there is a faint ding at the end of the hall \n\tand, as the elevator door opens, we faintly hear:\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tThis stop: six.\n\n\tBarton, disheveled, emerges and stumbles wearily down the \n\thall. He stops in front of his door, takes his key out, and \n\tenters the room.\n\n\tBARTON'S POV\n\n\tMastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading \n\tBarton's manuscript.\n\n\tDeutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing \n\tbeauty.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tMother: What is to become of him. \n\t\tFather: We'll be hearing from that \n\t\tcrazy wrestler.  And I don't mean a \n\t\tpostcard. Fade out. The end.\n\n\tHe looks up at Barton.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\t...I thought you said you were a \n\t\twriter.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tI dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tKeep your filthy eyes off that.\n\n\tDeutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at \n\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tYou made morning papers, Fink.\n\n\tBarton opens the paper. A headline reads: Writer Found \n\tHeadless in Chavez Ravine. The story has two pictures \u0096 a \n\tstudio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the \n\tcrime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a \n\tgulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tSecond one of your friends to end up \n\t\tdead.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tYou didn't tell us you knew the dame.\n\n\tWith a jerk of his thumb, Mastrionotti indicates the \n\tbloodstained bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tSixth floor too high for you, Fink?\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tGive you nose bleeds?\n\n\tBarton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed, \n\tstaring at the newspaper.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tJust tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd \n\t\tyou put their heads?\n\n\tDistractedly:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tCharlie... Charlie's back...\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tNo kidding, bright boy \u0096 we smelt \n\t\tMundt all over this.

It's hot... He's \n\t\tback.\n\n\tDown the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator.  \n\n\tMastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look.\n\n\tHe rises and walks slowly out into the hall. Deutsch wathces \n\thim go.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tMastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door, \n\tstill looking puzzled.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\t...Fred...\n\n\tDeutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on \n\this hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt. He \n\tunhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist \n\tand the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of \n\tthe bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tSit tight, Fink.\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY\n\n\tAs Deutsch joins Mastrionotti.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\tWhy's it so goddamn hot out here?\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\t...Fred...\n\n\tDeutsch looks where Mastrionotti is looking.\n\n\tTHE WALL\n\n\tTacky yellow fluid streams down. The walls are pouring sweat.  \n\n\tThe hallway is quiet.\n\n\tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH\n\n\tThey look at each other. They look down the hall.\n\n\tTHEIR POV\n\n\tThe elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall.  \n\n\tFor a long beat, nothing.\n\n\tFinally Pete, the elevator man, emerges.\n\n\tAt this distance, he is a small figure, stumbling this way \n\tand that, his hands presseed against the sides of his head.  \n\n\tHe turns to face Mastrionotti and Deutsch and takes a few \n\tsteps forward, still clutching his head.\n\n\tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH\n\n\tWatching.\n\n\tPETE\n\n\tHe takes on last step, then collapses.\n\n\tAs he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head. His \n\thead separates from his neck, hits the floor, and rolls away \n\tfrom his body with a dull irregular trundle sound.\n\n\tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH\n\n\tWide-eyed, they look at each other, then back down the hall.  \n\n\tAll is quiet.\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY\n\n\tSmoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall.  \n\n\tWe hear a muted rumble.\n\n\tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH\n\n\tMastrionotti tugs at his tie. He slowly unholsters his gun.  \n\tDeutsch slowly, hypnotically, follows suit.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\t... Show yourself, Mundt!\n\n\tMore quiet.\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY\n\n\tMore smoke.\n\n\tLOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR\n\n\tThe crack where the floor of the elevator meets that of the \n\thall.\n\n\tIt flickers with red light from below. Bottom-lit smoke sifts \n\tup.\n\n\tCLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI\n\n\tStanding in the foreground, gun at ready. Sweat pours down \n\this face.\n\n\tBehind him, Deutsch stands nervously in the light-spill from \n\tBarton's doorway.\n\n\tThe rumble and crackle of fire grows louder.\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY\n\n\tMore smoke.\n\n\tPATCH OF WALL\n\n\tSweating.\n\n\tA swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall, \n\texposing glistening lath underneath.\n\n\tWith a light airy pop, the lathwork catches on fire.\n\n\tMASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH\n\n\tSweating.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEUTSCH\n\t\t...Mundt!\n\n\tTHEIR POV\n\n\tThe hallway. Its end-facing-wall slowly spreads flame from \n\twhere the wallpaper droops.\n\n\tLOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR\n\n\tMore red bottom-lit smoke seeps up from the crack between \n\televator and hallway floors.\n\n\tWith a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the \n\televator door, a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the \n\tdoorway.\n\n\tJUMPING BACK\n\n\tWide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the \n\televator and is hellishly backlit by the flame.\n\n\tHis suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head. \n\tFrom his right hand his briefcase dangles.\n\n\tHe stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental \n\tin his posture, shoulders thrown back.\n\n\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\n\tTensed. Behind him, Deutsch gulps.\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tThere's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy \n\t\tcase down and your mitts in the air.\n\n\tCHARLIE\n\n\tHe leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor.\n\n\tCLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI\n\n\tRelax. He murmurs:\n\n\t\t\t\tMASTRIONOTTI\n\t\tHe's complying.\n\n\tBACK TO CHARLIE\n\n\tHe straightens up from the briefcase, a sawed-off shotgun in \n\this hands.\n\n\tBOOM! The shotgun spits fire.\n\n\tMastrionotti's face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown \n\tback down the hallway into Deutsch.\n\n\tBellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tLOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL \n\t\tSHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY\n\n\tThe fire starts racing down the hallway.\n\n\tCLOSE STEEP ANGLE ON PATCH OF WALL\n\n\tFire races along the wall-sweat goopus.\n\n\tTRACK IN ON DEUTSCH\n\n\tHis eyes widen at Charlie and the approaching fire; his gun \n\tdangles forgotten from his right hand.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tCharlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun \n\tloosely in front of his chest, in double-time position. The \n\tfire races along with him.\n\n\tHe is bellowing:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tLOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE \n\t\tOF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE \n\t\tOF THE MIND!\n\n\tDEUTSCH\n\n\tTerrified, he turns and runs.\n\n\tREVERSE PULLING DEUTSCH\n\n\tAs he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke, \n\tand Karl Mundt \u0096 who, also on the run, levels his shotgun.\n\n\tBOOM!\n\n\tPUSHING DEUTSCH\n\n\tHis legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air, \n\tthen come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown \n\ttires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor.\n\n\tPULLING CHARLIE\n\n\tHe slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun.\n\n\tPUSHING DEUTSCH\n\n\tWeeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows.\n\n\tPULLING CHARLIE\n\n\tHe slows to a walk.\n\n\tBARTON'S ROOM\n\n\tBarton strains at his handcuffs.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tThrough the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two \n\tshells into his shotgun.\n\n\tPULLING DEUTSCH\n\n\tCharlie looms behind him and \u0096 THWACK \u0096 snaps the shotgun \n\tclosed.\n\n\tDeutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows, facing Charlie.  \n\n\tCharlie primes the shotgun \u0096 CLACK.\n\n\tHe presses both barrels against the bridge of Deutsh's nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHeil Hitler.\n\n\tDEUTSCH\n\n\tScreams.\n\n\tCHARLIE\n\n\tTightens a finger over both triggers. He squeezes.\n\n\tBLAM!\n\n\tTRACK IN ON BARTON\n\n\tHe flinches.\n\n\tThe gunshot echoes away.\n\n\tBarton strains at the handcuffs.\n\n\tWe hear Charlie's footsteps approach \u0096 slowly, heavily.\n\n\tTHE DOORWAY\n\n\tCharlie, walking down the hall, glances in and seems mildly \n\tsurprised to see Barton. The set of his jaw relaxes. His \n\texpression softens. He pushes his hat farther back on his \n\thead.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBarton!\n\n\tHe shakes is head and whistles.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Brother, is it hot.\n\n\tHe walks into the room.\n\n\tBARTON'S ROOM\n\n\tAs Charlie wearily enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHow you been, buddy?\n\n\tHe props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, who \n\tstared at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Don't look at me like that, \n\t\tneighbor.  It's just me \u0096 Charlie.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.\n\n\tCharlie reaches a flask from his pocket.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tJesus, people can be cruel...\n\n\tHe takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haunted \n\tstare.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...if it's not my build, it's my \n\t\tpersonality.\n\n\tCharlie is perspiring heavily. The fire rumbles in the \n\thallway.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...They say I'm a madman, Barton, \n\t\tbut I'm not mad at anyone. Honest \n\t\tI'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry \n\t\tfor. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to \n\t\tthink about what they're going \n\t\tthrough. How trapped they are. I \n\t\tunderstand it. I feel for 'em. So I \n\t\ttry and help them out...\n\n\tHe reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels \n\t\tlike, when things get all balled up \n\t\tat the head office. It puts you \n\t\tthrough hell, Barton. So I help people \n\t\tout. I just wish someone would do as \n\t\tmuch for me...\n\n\tHe stares miserably down at his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets \n\t\tso hot, I wanna crawl right out of \n\t\tmy skin.\n\n\tSelf-pity:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tBut Charlie \u0096 why me? Why \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBecause you DON'T LISTEN!\n\n\tA tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear and \n\trunning down his cheek.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Jesus, I'm dripping again.\n\n\tHe pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...C'mon Barton, you think you know \n\t\tabout pain? You think I made your \n\t\tlife hell?  Take a look around this \n\t\tdump. You're just a tourist with a \n\t\ttypewriter, Barton. I live here. \n\t\tDon't you understand that...\n\n\tHis voice is becoming choked.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...And you come into MY home... And \n\t\tyou complain that I'M making too... \n\t\tmuch... noise.\n\n\tHe looks up at Barton.\n\n\tThere is a long silence.\n\n\tFinally:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...I'm sorry.\n\n\tWearily:\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tDon't be.\n\n\tHe rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the \n\tfoot of the bed.\n\n\tThe two men regard each other.\n\n\tCharlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring \n\tat Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His \n\tneck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His face \n\tis a reddening grimace.\n\n\tWith a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which \n\tBarton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton \n\tslides the cuff off it, free.\n\n\tCharlie gets to his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI'm getting off the merry-go-round.\n\n\tHe takes his shotgun and walks to the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...I'll be next door if you need me.\n\n\tA thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton.  \n\tBehind him the hallway blazes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Oh, I dropped in on your folks. \n\t\tAnd Uncle Dave?\n\n\tHe smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t...Good people. By the way, that \n\t\tpackage I gave you? I lied. It isn't \n\t\tmine.\n\n\tHe leaves.\n\n\tBarton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.\n\n\tTHE HALLWAY\n\n\tAs Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the \n\twallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the \n\thallway. Barton looks down the hall.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tCharlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase \n\tdangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket \n\tfor his key.\n\n\tWith his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped \n\twith fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel \n\tafter a long hard day on the road.\n\n\tHe opens the door and goes into his room.\n\n\tBACK TO BARTON\n\n\tHe turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, \n\tthe parcel in the other.\n\n\tA horrible moaning sound \u0096 almost human \u0096 can be heard under \n\tthe roar of the fire.\n\n\tBLACKNESS\n\n\tSTUDIO HALLWAY\n\n\tWe are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive \n\tbuilding. From offscreen we hear:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tFink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- \n\t\tfive Fulton Street!\n\n\tFiltered through phone:\n\n\t\t\t\tOPERATOR\n\t\tI understand that, sir \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tOr Uncle Dave!\n\n\tOur track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, \n\tunshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway \n\tin the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry \n\tup.\n\n\t\t\t\tOPERATOR\n\t\tI understand that, sir, but there's \n\t\tstill no answer. Shall I check for \n\t\ttrouble on the line?\n\n\tBarton slams down the phone.\n\n\tLIPNIK'S OFFICE\n\n\tBarton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel.\n\n\tLou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton.  \n\tLipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tFink.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tMr. Lipnik.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tColonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.\n\n\tHe turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a \n\tsmartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the \n\tchest.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...Siddown.\n\n\tBarton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...I was commissioned yesterday in \n\t\tthe Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau \n\t\tarranged it. He's a dear friend.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tCongratulations.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tActually it hasn't officially gone \n\t\tthrough yet. Had wardrobe whip this \n\t\tup. You gotta pull teeth to get \n\t\tanything done in this town. I can \n\t\tunderstand a little red tape in \n\t\tpeacetime, but now it's all-out \n\t\twarfare against the Japs. Little \n\t\tyellow bastards.  They'd love to see \n\t\tme sit this one out.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYes sir, they \u0096\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tAnyway, I had Lou read your script \n\t\tfor me.\n\n\tHe taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a \n\tslightly charred title page.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\t...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't \n\t\twash.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tWith all due respect, sir, I think \n\t\tit's the best work I've done.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tDon't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion \n\t\tmattered, then I guess I'd resign \n\t\tand let YOU run the the studio. It \n\t\tdoesn't and you won't, and the \n\t\tlunatics are not going to run THIS \n\t\tparticular asylum. So let's put a \n\t\tstop to THAT rumor right now.\n\n\tListlessly:\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYes sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tI had to call Beery this morning, \n\t\tlet him know we were pushing the \n\t\tpicture back.  After all I'd told \n\t\thim about quality, about that Barton \n\t\tFink feeling. How disappointed we \n\t\twere. Wally was heartbroken. The man \n\t\twas devastated. He was \u0096 well, I \n\t\tdidn't actually call him, Lou did. \n\t\tBut that's a fair description, isn't \n\t\tit Lou?\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\tYes, Colonel.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tHell, I could take you through it \n\t\tstep by step, explain why your story \n\t\tstinks, but I won't insult your \n\t\tintelligence. Well all right, first \n\t\tof all: This is a wrestling picture; \n\t\tthe audience wants to see action, \n\t\tdrama, wrestling, and plenty of it. \n\t\tThey don't wanna see a guy wrestling \n\t\twith his soul \u0096 well, all right, a \n\t\tlittle bit, for the critics \u0096 but \n\t\tyou make it the carrot that wags the \n\t\tdog. Too much of it and they head \n\t\tfor exits and I don't blame 'em.  \n\t\tThere's plenty of poetry right inside \n\t\tthat ring, Fink. Look at \"Hell Ten \n\t\tFeet Square\".\n\n\t\t\t\tLOU\n\t\t\"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas\".\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tLook at \"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas\". \n\t\tThese are big movies, Fink. About \n\t\tbig men, in tights \u0096 both physically \n\t\tand mentally. But especially \n\t\tphysically. We don't put Wallace \n\t\tBeery in some fruity movie about \n\t\tsuffering \u0096 I thought we were together \n\t\ton that.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI'm sorry if I let you down.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tYou didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. \n\t\tWe don't live or die by what you \n\t\tscribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler \n\t\tdown. He liked you. Trusted you. And \n\t\tthat's why he's gone. Fired.  That \n\t\tguy had a heart as big as the \n\t\toutdoors, and you fucked him. He \n\t\ttried to convince me to fire you \n\t\ttoo, but that would be too easy. No, \n\t\tyou're under contract and you're \n\t\tgonna stay that way.  Anything you \n\t\twrite will be the property of Capitol \n\t\tPictures. And Capitol Pictures will \n\t\tnot produce anything you write. Not \n\t\tuntil you grow up a little. You ain't \n\t\tno writer, Fink \u0096 you're a goddamn \n\t\twrite-off.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI tried to show you something \n\t\tbeautiful.  Something about all of \n\t\tUS \u0096\n\n\tThis sets Lipnik off:\n\n\t\t\t\tLIPNIK\n\t\tYou arrogant sonofabitch!  You think \n\t\tyou're the only writer who can give \n\t\tme that Barton Fink feeling?!  I got \n\t\ttwenty writers under contract that I \n\t\tcan ask for a Finktype thing from. \n\t\tYou swell-headed hypocrite!  You \n\t\tjust don't get it, do you?  You think \n\t\tthe whole world revolves inside \n\t\twhatever rattles inside that little \n\t\tkike head of yours. Get him outta my \n\t\tsight, Lou. Make sure he stays in \n\t\ttown, though; he's still under \n\t\tcontract. I want you in town, Fink, \n\t\tand outta my sight. Now get lost. \n\t\tThere's a war on.\n\n\tTHE SURF\n\n\tCrashing against the Pacific shore.\n\n\tTHE BEACH\n\n\tAt midday, almost deserted. In the distance we see Barton \n\twalking.\n\n\tThe paper-wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left \n\thand.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand, looking \n\tout to see. His gaze shifts to one side.\n\n\tHIS POV\n\n\tDown the beach, a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the \n\twater. She looks much like the picture on the wall in Barton's \n\thotel room.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tHe stares, transfixed, at the woman.\n\n\tTHE WOMAN\n\n\tVery beautiful, backlit by the sun, approaching.\n\n\tBARTON\n\n\tFollowing her with his eyes.\n\n\tTHE WOMAN\n\n\tHer eyes meet Barton's. She says something, but her voice is \n\tlost in the crash of the surf.\n\n\tBarton cups a hand to his ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUTY\n\t\tI said it's a beautiful day...\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tYes... It is...\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUTY\n\t\tWhat's in the box?\n\n\tBarton shrugs and shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUTY\n\t\tIsn't it yours?\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\tI... I don't know...\n\n\tShe nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from \n\thim, facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at \n\tBarton.\n\n\t\t\t\tBARTON\n\t\t...You're very beautiful. Are you in \n\t\tpictures?\n\n\tShe laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUTY\n\t\tDon't be silly.\n\n\tShe turns away to look out at the sea.\n\n\tWIDER\n\n\tFacing the ocean. Barton sits in the middle foreground, back \n\tto us, the box in the sand next to him.\n\n\tThe bathing beauty sits, back to us, in the middle background.  \n\tThe surf pounds.\n\n\tThe sun sparkles off the water.\n\n\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarton Fink\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Joel Coen\u00a0\u00a0Ethan Coen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:20:22.634960"}
