He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, \n\tlooking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a \n\tperformance.\n\n\tIn the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a \n\tflat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a \n\tthick rope that hangs from the ceiling.\n\n\tThe voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen \n\tstage:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tACTOR\n</b>\t\tI'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for \n\t\tgood.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye, \n\t\tthese four stinkin' walls, the six \n\t\tflights up, the el that roars by at \n\t\tthree A.M. like a castiron wind. \n\t\tKiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!  \n\t\tI'll miss 'em \u0096 like hell I will!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tACTRESS\n</b>\t\tDreaming again!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tACTOR\n</b>\t\tNot this time, Lil! I'm awake now, \n\t\tawake for the first time in years. \n\t\tUncle Dave said it: Daylight is a \n\t\tdream if you've lived with your eyes \n\t\tclosed. Well my eyes are open now! I \n\t\tsee that choir, and I know they're \n\t\tdressed in rags! But we're part of \n\t\tthat choir, both of us \u0096 yeah, and \n\t\tyou, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAURY\n</b>\t\tThe sun's coming up, kid.

A \n\ttall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up \n\tvalise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAURY\n</b>\t\tWe'll hear from that kid. And I don't \n\t\tmean a postcard.\n\n\tThe actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int \n\the shadows behind Barton.\n\n\tAn older man in work clothes \u0096 not wardrobe \u0096 passes in front \n\tof Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of \n\tthe stage and cups his hands to his mouth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tOLDER MAN\n</b><b>\t\tFISH!

It's late, Maury.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAURY\n</b>\t\tNot any more Lil...\n\n\tBarton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAURY\n</b>\t\t...It's early.\n\n\tWith this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the \n\trope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts \n\tof \"Bravo!\"  \n\n\tAs the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat \n\tmuting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame \n\ttoward the stage.\n\n\tThe stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain \n\tback up and unmuting the applause.\n\n\tBarton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other \n\tmen, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage.\n\n<b>\tBARTON'S POV\n</b>\n\tLooking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as \n\tthe curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take \n\ttheir bows and the cry of \"Author, Author\" goes up from the \n\tcrowd.\n\n\tThe actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.\n\n<b>\tBARTON\n</b>\n\tHe hesitates, unable to take it all in.\n\n\tHe is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed \n\tgentlemen.\n\n\tAs he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.\n\n<b>\tTRACKING SHOT\n</b>\n\tPushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he \n\tleads the way through the restaurant.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAITRE 'D\n</b>\t\tYour table is ready, Monsieur Fink...  \n\t\tseveral members of your party have \n\t\talready arrived...\n\n<b>\tREVERSE\n</b>\n\tPulling Barton\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFINK\n</b>\t\tIs Garland Stanford here?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAITRE 'D\n</b>\t\tHe called to say he'd be a few minutes \n\t\tlate...

The star of the Bare \n\t\tRuined Choirs was not seen on the \n\t\tstage of the Belasco last night \u0096 \n\t\tthough the thespians involved all \n\t\tacquitted themselves admirably. The \n\t\tfind of the evening was the author \n\t\tof this drama about simple folk \u0096 \n\t\tfish mongers, in fact \u0096 whose brute \n\t\tstruggle for existence cannot quite \n\t\tquell their longing for something \n\t\thigher. The playwright finds nobility \n\t\tin the most squalid corners and poetry \n\t\tin the most callused speech. A tough \n\t\tnew voice in the American theater \n\t\thas arrived, and the owner of that \n\t\tvoice is named... Barton Fink.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tThey'll be wrapping fish in it in \n\t\tthe morning so I guess it's not a \n\t\ttotal waste.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n</b>\t\tCynic!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEREK\n</b>\t\tWell we can enjoy your success, \n\t\tBarton, even if you can't.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tDon't get me wrong \u0096 I'm glad it'll \n\t\tdo well for you, Derek.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEREK\n</b>\t\tDon't worry about me, dear boy \u0096 I \n\t\twant you to celebrate.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tAll right, but I can't start listening \n\t\tto the critics, and I can't kid myself \n\t\tabout my own work. A writer writes \n\t\tfrom his gut, and his gut tells him \n\t\twhat's good and what's... merely \n\t\tadequate.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n</b>\t\tWell I don't pretend to be a critic, \n\t\tbut Lord, I have a gut, and it tells \n\t\tme it was simply marvelous.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n</b>\t\tAnd a charming gut it is.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOPPY\n</b>\t\tYou dog!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n</b>\t\t\t(baying)\n\t\tAaa-woooooooo!\n\n\tBarton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling. \n\tWe swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the \n\trestaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with \n\tBarton's name on it.\n\n<b>\tTRACKING IN TOWARD A BAR\n</b>\n\tA distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes \n\tis nursing a martini, watching Barton approach.\n\n<b>\tPULLING BARTON\n</b>\n\tAs he draws near.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tI thought you were going to join us.  \n\t\tJesus, Garland, you left me alone \n\t\twith those people.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tDon't panic, I'll join you in a \n\t\tminute.  What's you think of Richard \n\t\tand Poppy?\n\n\tBarton scowls\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tThe play was marvelous. She wept, \n\t\tcopiously. Millions of dollars and \n\t\tno sense.\n\n\tGarland smiles, then draws Barton close.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tWe have to talk a little business. \n\t\tI've just been on the phone to Los \n\t\tAngeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures \n\t\twants to put you under contract. \n\t\tThey've offered you a thousand dollars \n\t\ta week. I think I can get them to go \n\t\tas high as two.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tTo do what?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tWhat do you do far a living?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tI'm not sure anymore. I guess I try \n\t\tto make a difference.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tFair enough. No pressure here, Barton, \n\t\tbecause I respect you, but let me \n\t\tpoint out a couple of things. One, \n\t\there you make a difference to five \n\t\thundred fifty people a night \u0096 if \n\t\tthe show sells out.  Eighty five \n\t\tmillion people go to the pictures \n\t\tevery week.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tTo see pap.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tYes, generally, to see pap. However, \n\t\tpoint number two: A brief tenure in \n\t\tHollywood could support you through \n\t\tthe writing of any number of plays.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tI don't know, Garland; my place is \n\t\there right now. I feel I'm on the \n\t\tbrink of success-\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tI'd say you're already enjoying some.\n\n\tBarton leans earnestly forward.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tNo, Garland, don't you see? Not the \n\t\tkind of success where the critics \n\t\tfawn over you or the producers like \n\t\tDerek make a lot of money. No, a \n\t\treal success \u0096 the success we've \n\t\tbeen dreaming about \u0096 the creation \n\t\tof a new, living theater of, about, \n\t\tand for the common man! If I ran off \n\t\tto Hollywood now I'd be making money, \n\t\tgoing to parties, meeting the big \n\t\tshots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself \n\t\toff from the wellspring of that \n\t\tsuccess, from the common man.\n\n\tHe leans back and chuckles ruefully.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\t...I guess I'm sprouting off again. \n\t\tBut I am certain of this, Garland: \n\t\tI'm capable of more good work. Maybe \n\t\tbetter work than I did in Choirs. It \n\t\tjust doesn't seem to me that Los \n\t\tAngeles is the place to lead the \n\t\tlife of mind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tOkay Barton, you're the artist, I'm \n\t\tjust the ten percenter. You decide \n\t\twhat you want and I'll make it happen. \n\t\tI'm only asking that your decision \n\t\tbe informed by a little realism \u0096 if \n\t\tI can use that word and Hollywood in \n\t\tthe same breath.\n\n\tBarton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the \n\tfloor.\n\n\tGarland studies him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\t...Look, they love you, kid \u0096 \n\t\teverybody does. You see Caven's review \n\t\tin the Herald?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tNo, what did it say?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tTake my copy. You're the toast of \n\t\tBroadway and you have the opportunity \n\t\tto redeem that for a little cash \u0096 \n\t\tstrike that, a lot of cash.\n\n\tGarland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\t...The common man'll still be here \n\t\twhen you get back. What the hell, \n\t\tthey might even have one or two of \n\t\t'em out in Hollywood.\n\n\tAbsently:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\t...That's a rationalization, Garland.\n\n\tGarland smiles gently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGARLAND\n</b>\t\tBarton, it was a joke.\n\n\tWe hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to:\n\n<b>\tA GREAT WAVE\n</b>\n\tCrushing against the Pacific shore.\n\n\tThe roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to:\n\n<b>\tHOTEL LOBBY\n</b>\n\tA high wide shot from the front door, looking down across \n\twilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty \n\twing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed.\n\n\tAmber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from \n\tbehind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights.  \n\n\tBarton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops \n\tin the middle foreground to look across the lobby.\n\n\tWe are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is \n\tempty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in.  \n\n\tBarton moves toward the front desk.\n\n<b>\tTHE REVERSE\n</b>\n\tAs Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver \n\tbell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without \n\tlosing volume.\n\n\tAfter a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs.  \n\tBarton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at \n\tthe floor behind the front desk.\n\n<b>\tA TRAP DOOR\n</b>\n\tIt swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, \n\tholding a shoebrush and a shoe \u0096 not one of his own \u0096 climbs \n\tup from the basement.\n\n\tHe closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his \n\tfinger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting \n\tit.\n\n\tThe lobby is now silent again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tWelcome to the Hotel Earle. May I \n\t\thelp you, sir?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tI'm checking in. Barton Fink.\n\n\tThe clerk flips through cards on the desk.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tF-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be \n\t\tyou, huh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tMust be.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tOkay then, everything seems to be in \n\t\torder. Everything seems to be in \n\t\torder.\n\n\tHe is turning to a register around for Barton to sign.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\t...Are you a tranz or a rez?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tExcuse me?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tTransient or resident?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tI don't know... I mean, I'll be here, \n\t\tuh, indefinitely.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tRez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a \n\t\tweek payable in advance. Checkout \n\t\ttime is twelve sharp, only you can \n\t\tforget that on account you're a rez.  \n\t\tIf you need anything, anything at \n\t\tall, you dial zero on your personal \n\t\tin-room telephone and talk to me. My \n\t\tname is Chet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tWell, I'm going to be working here, \n\t\tmostly at night; I'm a writer.

They regard \n\teach other for a beat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\t...Okay\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tHuh?\n\n\tThe clerk.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tOkey-dokey, go ahead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tWhat \u0096\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tDon't you wanna go to your room?!\n\n\tBarton stares at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\t...What number is it?\n\n\tThe clerk stares back.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\t...Six-oh-five.

I'll \n\t\tkeep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.\n\n\tBarton is walking to the elevator.\n\n<b>\tELEVATOR\n</b>\n\tBarton enters and sets down his bags.\n\n\tAn aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon \n\tuniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel. He does not \n\tacknowledge Barton's presence.\n\n\tAfter a beat:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\t...Six, please.\n\n\tThe elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes the \n\tdoor closed:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELEVATOR MAN\n</b>\t\tNext stop: Six.\n\n<b>\tSIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY\n</b>\n\tBarton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the \n\tdoors.\n\n\tThe long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained \n\tforest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing \n\tpalm trees.  Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door \n\tmidway down the hall.\n\n<b>\tHIS ROOM\n</b>\n\tAs Barton enters.\n\n\tThe room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy \n\tbed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and \n\ta wooden luggage stand.\n\n\tAs Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and \n\twash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and \n\ta window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.  \n\n\tBarton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, \n\tjittering.  He shrugs off his jacket.\n\n\tPips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot.  \n\n\tHe walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and \n\tstruggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it \n\tfor a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound.  \n\n\tBarton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary \n\ttable. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat.  \n\n\tNext to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: \n<b>\t\"THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME.\"\n</b>\n\tWe pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall \n\tabove the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a \n\tcobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as \n\tshe looks out at a crashing surf.\n\n\tThe sound of the surf mixes up.\n\n<b>\tBARTON\n</b>\n\tLooking at the picture\n\n<b>\tTRACKING IN ON THE PICTURE\n</b>\n\tThe surf mixes up louder. We hear a gull cry.\n\n\tThe sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone.\n\n<b>\tTHE HOUSE PHONE\n</b>\n\tOn the nightstand next to the bed. With a groan of bedsprings \n\tBarton sits into frame and picks up the telephone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tHow d'ya like your room!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\t...Who is this?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tChet!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\t...Who?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tChet!

What do you think, Lou?  \n\t\tWally a little too old for a romantic \n\t\tinterest?

After a short \n\tbeat, a period strikes.\n\n<b>\tBARTON\n</b>\n\tElbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written. \n\tHe rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.\n\n<b>\tTHE PAGE\n</b>\n\tIt says:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>\tA TENEMENT BUILDING\n</b>\n\tOn Manhattan's Lower East Side.

He stops after several more \n\tcharacters and looks.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\tBreaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room. \n\tA man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless.\n\n\tBarton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.\n\n<b>\tHIS POV\n</b>\n\tThe picture of the girl on the beach.\n\n<b>\tBARTON\n</b>\n\tStaring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Barton \n\tlooks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but \n\tthe sound is too insistent to ignore.\n\n<b>\tWIDE SHOT\n</b>\n\tThe room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall.  \n\n\tThe laughter.\n\n\tBarton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and \n\tlooks out.\n\n<b>\tHIS POV\n</b>\n\tThe empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the \n\tend of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the \n\tstaircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of \n\twall sconces.\n\n\tThe laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the \n\tempty hall.\n\n\tPerhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because \n\tit is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for \n\tweeping.\n\n\tBarton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly \n\twithdraws into his room.\n\n<b>\tHIS ROOM\n</b>\n\tBarton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The \n\tlaughter/weeping continues.\n\n\tHe walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house \n\tphone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBARTON\n</b>\t\tHello... Chet? This is Barton Fink \n\t\tin room 605.

The laughter continues for a moment or \n\ttwo, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the \n\ttelephone ringing next door.\n\n\tBarton looks at the wall.\n\n\tThe muffled sound of a man talking.\n\n\tThe sound of the earpiece being pronged.\n\n\tMuffled footsteps next door.\n\n\tThe sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.  \n\n\tFootsteps approaching the hall.\n\n\tA hard, present knock at Barton's door.\n\n\tBarton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.\n\n<b>\tON THE DOOR\n</b>\n\tAs Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man \u0096 a \n\tvery large man \u0096 in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened \n\ttie.
