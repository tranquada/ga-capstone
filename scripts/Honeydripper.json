The parking lot is empty but for\r\n     Ty's old Ford-\r\n\r\n     Ty, exhausted but happy, steps out front. He pastes a SNIPE\r\n     that says HELD OVER! across the Guitar Sam poster-\r\n\r\n<b>                         POSSUM (O.S.)\r\n</b>               That boy can play some.\r\n\r\n     Ty turns. Possum is on the road, guitar strung over his\r\n     shoulder, feeling his way with a red-tipped CANE.\r\n\r\n<b>                         TY\r\n</b>               You leavin?\r\n\r\n<b>                         POSSUM\r\n</b>               Aint needed round here no more.\r\n\r\n<b>                         TY\r\n</b>               Where you headed?\r\n\r\n<b>                            POSSUM\r\n</b>               (smiles)     Oh-- down the road.\r\n\r\n     Ty watches the blind man move away for a moment.\r\n\r\n<b>                            MACEO (O.S.)\r\n</b>               Tyrone-\r\n\r\n     Ty turns as Maceo steps out, equally tired and unshaven-\r\n\r\n<b>                         MACEO\r\n</b>               Who you talkin to out here?\r\n\r\n     Maceo looks down the road, but Possum is nowhere to be seen.\r\n     Ty shrugs-\r\n\r\n<b>                         TY\r\n</b>               Just myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>78   EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - EARLY MORNING                      78\r\n</b>     Scratch and Lonnie are set to pretend to play music again.\r\n     Lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys he's drawn on the\r\n     board-\r\n\r\n     -and begins to PLAY!    Fast, rhythmic boogie piano-\r\n<b>                                                       116.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n  Instead of a Diddley bow, Scratch is pretending to tune the\r\n  two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling\r\n  wire. He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope\r\n  leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of\r\n  the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who\r\n  nods, and then-\r\n\r\n  -he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie.\r\n\r\n  We CRANE UP and away from them, the MUSIC spilling out over\r\n  the field-\r\n\r\n  It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                             THE END\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Honeydripper.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Honeydripper</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=John Sayles\" title=\"Scripts by John Sayles\">John Sayles</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Musical\" title=\"Musical Scripts\">Musical</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Honeydripper Script.html#comments\" title=\"Honeydripper comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:30.953701"}
