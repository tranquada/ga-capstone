SHARECROPPER SHACK - ECU FINGERS - LATE AFTERNOON        1\r\n    We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption-\r\n\r\n\r\n    WIDER\r\n\r\n    SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling\r\n    wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is\r\n    stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret\r\n    and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire.\r\n\r\n    His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he\r\n    has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny\r\n    CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-\r\n\r\n                        LONNIE\r\n              Leave off with that, Scratch.\r\n\r\n                        SCRATCH\r\n              Aint bothering you.\r\n\r\n                           LONNIE\r\n              Yes it is.     That aint no kind of\r\n              music.\r\n\r\n    We see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that\r\n    Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it-\r\n\r\n                        SCRATCH\r\n              Least I make a sound.\r\n\r\n                        LONNIE\r\n              Yeah and it's a nasty one.\r\n\r\n    Lonnie looks at the sky-\r\n\r\n                        SCRATCH\r\n              You want to try again tonight?\r\n\r\n    Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from\r\n    the setting sun-\r\n\r\n                        LONNIE\r\n              Might as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON                        2\r\n    SLIDE GUITAR plays.

We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men\r\n    and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard\r\n    work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing\r\n    LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them.\r\n\r\n    The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction-\r\n\r\n\r\n3   EXT.

HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT                               7\r\n    We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER\r\n    LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads.\r\n                                                             3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF\r\n    erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward\r\n    and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up\r\n    with Lonnie and Scratch.\r\n\r\n    The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and\r\n    go up on their toes to peek in through a window-\r\n\r\n\r\n8   INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT                                     8\r\n    An OVERHEAD ANGLE of long fingers on piano keys-\r\n\r\n\r\n    SINGER\r\n\r\n    A woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY,\r\n    leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a\r\n    little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS-\r\n\r\n                        BERTHA MAE\r\n              I know a gal name of Betty Sue\r\n              Shook it so much\r\n              She got the German flu\r\n              No matter how she done it\r\n              No matter how she done it\r\n              No matter how she done it\r\n              She done it just the same\r\n\r\n    As she sings we PAN and TRACK, moving through the large, near-\r\n    empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE-\r\n\r\n                        BERTHA MAE\r\n              You women don't worry\r\n              About your life\r\n              She made Jack the Ripper\r\n              Throw away his knife-\r\n\r\n\r\n    Only a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and\r\n    bar stools. A pretty young woman in her late teens, CHINA\r\n    DOLL, is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening\r\n    aimlessly.\r\n\r\n                        BERTHA MAE\r\n              No matter how she done it\r\n              No matter how she done it\r\n              No matter how she done it\r\n              She done it just the same\r\n\r\n    Lonnie and Scratch step in, cautiously looking around, hoping\r\n    that nobody will notice and tell them to leave.\r\n                                                         4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently\r\nwatching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see\r\nTYRONE `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his\r\n50's. He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on\r\nthe music. We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up\r\nthe song-\r\n\r\n                    BERTHA MAE\r\n          A copper brought her in\r\n          She didn't need no bail\r\n          She shook it for the judge\r\n          He threw the cop in jail\r\n          No matter how she done it\r\n          No matter how she done it\r\n          No matter how she done it\r\n          She done it just the same\r\n\r\nSLICK, a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the\r\nbar, and MACEO, who sits at a table near the bandstand\r\nsmiling throughout, APPLAUD. The sound makes the room seem\r\nmore empty.\r\n\r\nTy stands, nods to METALMOUTH SIMS, a slight, worried-looking\r\nharmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae-\r\n\r\n                    TY\r\n          You take it for a while.\r\n\r\nAs Ty crosses to the bar we hear RECORDED MUSIC booming from\r\noutside-\r\n\r\n                    BERTHA MAE\r\n          They makin all that racket again at\r\n          Toussaint's.\r\n\r\n                    TY\r\n          Yeah.

He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope\r\n  leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of\r\n  the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who\r\n  nods, and then-\r\n\r\n  -he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie.\r\n\r\n  We CRANE UP and away from them, the MUSIC spilling out over\r\n  the field-\r\n\r\n  It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nHoneydripper\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John Sayles\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Musical\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:27:03.201060"}
