SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN\r\n                         \r\n          It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL\r\n          ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only\r\n          source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN\r\n                         \r\n          We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops\r\n          and we watch the knob slowly turn.\r\n                         \r\n          Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces \"hope.\"\r\n          We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the\r\n          pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.\r\n                         \r\n          NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling\r\n          the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage\r\n          table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and\r\n          the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior\r\n          2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.\r\n                         \r\n          She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues\r\n          digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She\r\n          opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt\r\n          foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.\r\n                         \r\n          She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She\r\n          flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks\r\n          better of it and hangs up.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

The phone rests on the passenger seat.\r\n          We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on\r\n          the steering wheel.

We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as\r\n          a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The\r\n          sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time\r\n          radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...\r\n                         \r\n          An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and\r\n          gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a\r\n          cell phone starts ringing.\r\n                         \r\n          Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and\r\n          inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his\r\n          40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs\r\n          in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty\r\n          carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP\r\n          snatches up his phone and answers...\r\n                         \r\n                          VOICE\r\n           For the love of Christ!

Whip smiles, taking it all in...\r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           (into the phone)\r\n           I've been up since the crack 'a\r\n           dawn.

How\r\n           much does it cost to go there?\r\n                         \r\n          The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is\r\n          puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.\r\n                         \r\n          The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second,\r\n          hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP\r\n          shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on\r\n          the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP (CONT'D)\r\n           NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed\r\n           private school...lemme talk to\r\n           Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the\r\n           phone works both ways. Oh he's my\r\n           son because you need a tuition\r\n           check...that's great Deana. I'm\r\n           glad you tracked me down in Orlando\r\n           at 7 in the fucking morning to\r\n           shake me down for money. Does he\r\n           even like the fucking school? No\r\n           I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder\r\n           why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock\r\n           flight, sit tight 'till I get back\r\n           to Atlanta. How am I a liar?\r\n           What? No, I'll call you.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last\r\n          beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.\r\n                         \r\n                          YOUNG WOMAN\r\n           Was that your wife?\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           That was my ex-wife. But you\r\n           Trina, you could be my second or\r\n           third wife if you'd just C'mere.\r\n                         \r\n          The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...\r\n                         \r\n                          TRINA\r\n           Whip, don't even joke about that.\r\n           Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.\r\n                         \r\n          TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a\r\n          white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help\r\n          but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.\r\n                         \r\n          ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock\r\n          anthem...JOE COCKER's \"I'm Feeling Alright\"\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Yeah, I'm feelin' a little light-\r\n           headed. I shoulda ate somethin'.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's\r\n          been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

JOE COCKER continues to wail,\r\n          perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains\r\n          while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the\r\n          mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual\r\n          walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the\r\n          jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in\r\n          to a puddle.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Son of a bitch!\r\n                         \r\n          Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the\r\n          stairs.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

(In the reflection of this photo we see a flame cooking\r\n          heroin in a spoon.)\r\n                         \r\n          Another photo depicts an 8 year-old girl's birthday party.\r\n          (In the reflection of this photo see wee Nicole tying off.)\r\n                         \r\n          A last photo shows NICOLE (30)and her mom (54). They are\r\n          both wearing kerchiefs. We can see that her mom is gaunt and\r\n          has no hair under her kerchief. (In the reflection of this\r\n          photo we see the needle injected into her arm.)\r\n                         \r\n          A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE is placed in front of that picture. Next\r\n          to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life\r\n          and turns up. The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's\r\n          \"Medication\" begin to play.\r\n                         \r\n          We pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that she\r\n          used to tie off with. Her face is pure happiness.\r\n                         \r\n          Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a\r\n          suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table. NICOLE\r\n          picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down.\r\n                         \r\n          She picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and\r\n          reaches for the lighter. She laughs and hums, pulls out gum,\r\n          a brush...She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave\r\n          of narcotic death washes over her. She leans back and uses\r\n          the wall for support. \"Medication\" is hitting its chorus...\r\n           24.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           Oh man...\r\n                         \r\n          She puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria. A slow, sloppy\r\n          smile breaks across her face. She exhales slowly. She\r\n          reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of\r\n          heavy drugs hits. NICOLE looks up with fear.\r\n                         \r\n           NICOLE (cont'd) (CONT'D)\r\n           Oh no, oh no, oh no...\r\n                         \r\n          She reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her.\r\n          Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. As she tries to\r\n          dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls\r\n          her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little\r\n          bag of coke falls from her fingers.\r\n                         \r\n          There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose.\r\n          NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks\r\n          to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the\r\n          snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear a pounding on the door.

WHIP sees a fire truck\r\n          fly by him, down the grassy slope towards the burning plane.\r\n                         \r\n           FADE OUT.\r\n                         \r\n                         FADE IN:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S POV --\r\n                         \r\n          LOOKING UP at the sky -- WE SEE black, oily SMOKE billowing\r\n          across the shattered church steeple --\r\n                         \r\n          WE GLIMPSE PEOPLE rushing past, some are wearing white\r\n          flowing robes --\r\n                         \r\n          WE HEAR DISTANT SIRENS APPROACHING AND PEOPLE PRAYING --\r\n                         \r\n           FADE OUT.\r\n                         \r\n                         FADE IN:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          A LOUD SIREN SCREAMS --\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S POV --\r\n                         \r\n          LOOKING UP at the ceiling of an ambulance --\r\n                         \r\n          TWO EMTS are urgently attending to him --\r\n                         \r\n           FADE OUT.\r\n                         \r\n                         FADE IN:\r\n           41.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S POV -- NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A halogen overhead light and an air-conditioning vent --\r\n          brown-stained acoustic ceiling tiles --\r\n                         \r\n          WE HEAR the rhythmic BEEP of a heart monitor --\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

You\r\n           have numerous lacerations around\r\n           your left eye. We're going to leave\r\n           the patch on for a few days as a\r\n           precaution. But it seems your eye\r\n           is OK. MRI's show strained tendons\r\n           in your left knee and ankle but you\r\n           didn't break any bones.\r\n           43.\r\n                         \r\n           You have some deep bruising in your\r\n           left thigh and you have a few torn\r\n           ligaments in your left wrist.\r\n           Nothing serious. So as soon as we\r\n           clear you from the concussion, and\r\n           you feel well enough -- you can go\r\n           home. That could be a day, could\r\n           be 3 days.

CHARLIE pats WHIP's\r\n          shoulder before he leaves. WHIP sits up and pulls his phone\r\n          from the plastic bag. Dials, waits...\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Harling...Harling...yeah, it's\r\n           Whip.

Well, I'm looking to\r\n           get outta here...hopefully\r\n           tomorrow. Yeah. But, listen, I\r\n           need you to bring me something to\r\n           wear.\r\n           47.\r\n                         \r\n           I don't know -- clothes -- and\r\n           smokes, I really need smokes. Tee\r\n           shirt, sweat pants....Harling?\r\n           I'll put you on the visiting list.\r\n           Yeah...and smokes.

Good.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP closes his eyes and exhales. He now stares at the foot\r\n          of the bed for a long, long moment. WHIP squeezes his eyes\r\n          shut tight -- holding back tears. Then quietly, as if\r\n          whispering a prayer...\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP (CONT'D)\r\n           Goddamn it...\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

HARLING has\r\n          a pony tail and a goatee and is probably wearing a Tommy\r\n          Bahama button down shirt.\r\n                         \r\n          We follow HARLING as he strides down the hall. With ear buds\r\n          in, HARLING points a Sanyo pistol-shaped cam corder at the\r\n          ATTENDING NURSE at the nurses' station, recording her...\r\n                         \r\n                          HARLING MAYS\r\n           I'm on the list baby girl.

He sees...\r\n                         \r\n          The MORNING NURSE is helping WHIP to stand. HARLING points\r\n          his camcorder at WHIP and the NURSE.\r\n                         \r\n           HARLING MAYS (O.C.)\r\n           If this is gonna turn into a sponge\r\n           bath, I'll come back.\r\n                         \r\n                          NURSE\r\n                          SIR-\r\n                         \r\n          HARLING immediately goes to WHIP and supports him.\r\n           48.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           It's okay, Harling.\r\n                         \r\n                          HARLING MAYS\r\n           That's right honey, I'm on the\r\n           list. Harling Mays. Some say they\r\n           Harling knew me.\r\n                         \r\n          HARLING boxes her out. She steps away.\r\n                         \r\n           HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)\r\n           Honey can you hustle us a couple of\r\n           daiquiris and a cocktail weenie?\r\n           On second thought just bring the\r\n           booze. I brought my own weenie.\r\n                         \r\n          No reaction as the NURSE collects the trash and towels.\r\n          HARLING focuses his camcorder on the NURSE and leaves WHIP in\r\n          an unsteady stance. HARLING films her and comments...\r\n                         \r\n           HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)\r\n           She's offended, and she should be.\r\n           I'm a pig. And I hate me. That's\r\n           what we have in common Nurse\r\n           Ratched...we both hate me.\r\n                         \r\n          And she's gone.

Easy...\r\n                         \r\n          HARLING helps him get settled.

HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he\r\n          scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window.\r\n          Thunder RUMBLES.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine\r\n          gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to\r\n          the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that\r\n          HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter\r\n          still in its package.\r\n                         \r\n          Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been\r\n          placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a\r\n          medical cane.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He checks the quiet\r\n          corridor as he begins his quest...\r\n           53.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to\r\n          slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP\r\n          walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

She drops her cigarette which we see was barely\r\n          smoked as she maneuvers to leave.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP (CONT'D)\r\n           Don't go. I'll be quiet.\r\n                         \r\n          He offers her a cigarette, she takes it.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP (CONT'D)\r\n           We don't have to talk.

He is\r\n          dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an I.V. pole on which\r\n          hangs a small bag of clear liquid. The man's hair has\r\n          completely left him. His skin is gray.

We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his\r\n           house after his divorce. We see bikes, weights and fishing\r\n           gear.\r\n                         \r\n           Whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home\r\n           office.

On the small table next to him rests his beer and an\r\n           unopened bottle of bourbon with a glass of ice. WHIP cracks\r\n           the seal on the bourbon bottle and pours a drink.

After a moment, 78\r\n           NICOLE stands and takes the drink out of WHIP's hand and sets\r\n           it down. She now bends down and kisses him softly.

We see the awesome\r\n          devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour\r\n          can do to a hillside.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           You can see the initial impact\r\n           sheared the right wing clean off.\r\n           If only the left wing had come off\r\n           at impact, I think everyone would\r\n           have walked off that plane.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           The left wing partially pulled away-\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           It snapped but stayed connected to\r\n           the airframe. So it whipped back\r\n           towards the plane, hit the fuselage\r\n           in front of the tail. If you were\r\n           sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on\r\n           the left side, it was like being\r\n           hit by a train.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           I drank a lot the night before that\r\n           flight.

CARR\r\n           In a minute. Alright, so let's get\r\n           down to it, Lenny. What does the\r\n           union plan to do about this blood\r\n           test that says Whitaker was high on\r\n           booze and coke? This guy's a real\r\n           peach.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           I'm gonna kill the toxicology\r\n           report.\r\n           (feels eyes of disbelief)\r\n           It was done incompetently. The\r\n           last time the toxicology equipment\r\n           they used was calibrated was in\r\n           June of 2009, which is 18 months\r\n           past code. Their log that should\r\n           clearly state who labeled the blood\r\n           vials and when, is very incomplete.\r\n           And they aren't sure who stored\r\n           them. They used a preservative in\r\n           the vials that has in some cases\r\n           caused blood to ferment and\r\n           register higher in an alcohol test.\r\n           That's what I've done so far. I\r\n           can handle this.\r\n                         \r\n           MR. CARR\r\n           I like this guy Lenny.

CARR\r\n           That's sweet Mr. Caldwell, but if\r\n           the NTSB leaks that toxicology\r\n           report showing my pilot was flying\r\n           that plane drunk?

He freezes at one\r\n           point and places his hands straight out in front of himself,\r\n           a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000\r\n           miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet.

WHIP motions to his lips\r\n           as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and\r\n           trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground.\r\n                         \r\n           NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened\r\n           but passed out. NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with\r\n           a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a\r\n           pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to\r\n           the side so he doesn't choke.\r\n                         \r\n           NICOLE looks around the room.

Because it makes me tell\r\n           the truth about who I am. It\r\n           reminds that I never ever told the\r\n           truth. I lied about everything.\r\n           My whole life had been a lie. And\r\n           I was told that I would never get\r\n           sober if I kept lying.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP is very reserved, poker-faced.\r\n                         \r\n           A.A.

SPEAKER #1\r\n           Like I said, I would lie about\r\n           everything. It didn't matter what\r\n           it was. My whole life had been a\r\n           lie. A series of lies strung\r\n           together by me. And when I drank?\r\n           It was worse. What I came to\r\n           understand was that, my lies were\r\n           killing me. And that remains the\r\n           great fact for me...My lies will\r\n           kill me.\r\n                         \r\n          93 WHIP is gone. 93\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           INT.

WHIP sees NICOLE sitting on the bed.\r\n          She quickly tucks her cell phone away as WHIP holds up his\r\n          hand to signal a truce.\r\n           109.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Alright look, I was loaded when I\r\n           crashed that plane. With this\r\n           investigation going on, I don't\r\n           know what's gonna happen.

I'll do it for\r\n           you. Anything you want.\r\n                         \r\n          NICOLE looks at the sincere love in his eyes.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           I don't wanna use again.

We stay on NICOLE's face as\r\n          he holds her tighter and tighter.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          NICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table. Past\r\n          NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed.\r\n                         \r\n          She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at\r\n          her feet. She finishes a handwritten note and places it\r\n          down. NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it.\r\n           110.\r\n                         \r\n          She hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and\r\n          takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP. She leaves,\r\n          careful not to make a sound.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- FRONT DOOR -- EARLY MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          NICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her\r\n          stuff. She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as\r\n          she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the\r\n          top of the driveway, far from the house.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. WHITAKER RANCH -- BEDROOM -- LATER SAME DAY\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP stirs, wakes up and looks around. WHIP walks around\r\n          looking for NICOLE. He finds the note and reads it. The\r\n          reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the\r\n          window and stares out at the barn.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big\r\n          book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP\r\n          picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the\r\n          back of a chair and tosses it against the wall.\r\n                         \r\n          After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer\r\n          bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall.\r\n          The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came\r\n          within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his\r\n          son.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP\r\n          relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him.\r\n                         \r\n          Whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is\r\n          answered by the old machine...\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE\r\n           You've reached the Whitaker Crop\r\n           Dusting Company, flying lessons and\r\n           plane rides.

What's goin' on?\r\n                         \r\n          104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks... 104\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n           WHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch\r\n           him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice.\r\n           WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink.\r\n                         \r\n           WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and\r\n           stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him\r\n           walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY\r\n           GUARD meets him and takes him inside.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY\r\n                         \r\n           WHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. He sees\r\n           the plane.\r\n                         \r\n           The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as\r\n           possible. Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum. The\r\n           sight is awesome, breathtaking. WHIP walks closer to the\r\n           twisted wreck and stops. WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight\r\n           and as he is about to leave...\r\n                         \r\n           CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to\r\n           WHIP.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Here's our guy. C'mon.\r\n                         \r\n           WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the\r\n           plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top\r\n           of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane...\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           Captain Whitaker, we've won.\r\n                         \r\n           WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH (CONT'D)\r\n           This is what we call in my\r\n           profession a \"walk over.\"\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           They've scheduled the hearing.

It's no longer a\r\n           question of your condition but the\r\n           condition of the plane.\r\n                         \r\n          This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH (CONT'D)\r\n           I've had an \"Act of God\"\r\n           successfully added to the list of\r\n           probable causes.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Look, it's simple.

That's right.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           And what about my toxicology\r\n           report?\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           (trying to stay calm)\r\n           I killed it. They have no physical\r\n           proof that you were intoxicated on\r\n           that plane. And no eye witness\r\n           claims. But there's a problem.\r\n                         \r\n          This stops WHIP cold.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH (CONT'D)\r\n           Because of the turbulence at the\r\n           beginning of the flight and then\r\n           the crash, there was never any\r\n           drink service on the flight. But,\r\n           they found two little vodka bottles\r\n           in the galley trash bin. There was\r\n           no physical evidence found on the\r\n           bottles, no DNA, no finger prints.\r\n           But both the bottles were uncapped\r\n           and empty. The only people who had\r\n           access to those bottles and could\r\n           have drank them were the flight\r\n           crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia\r\n           Satou all had clean tox reports.\r\n           That leaves you and Trina Marquez.\r\n                         \r\n          They let that land. WHIP nods.\r\n           113.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Okay.

He reaches up and pushes a button on\r\n          the TV and it goes off.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           What the hell is wrong with you? I\r\n           spoke to Hugh, he told me that you\r\n           went to your ex-wife's house?\r\n           Drunk as a skunk and the news crews\r\n           showed up?\r\n           (Whip just stares)\r\n           And the police escorted you out?\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           I think it's okay. I've been\r\n           watching and I think it's okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Hugh checked every media outlet\r\n           that covered it and it looks like\r\n           we're good. You come off fine.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie,\r\n           here's the deal-\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           No Whip. No deals. Look at you.\r\n           I have no idea what you're gonna do\r\n           or say, ever. You're all over the\r\n           place. I was the one guy in your\r\n           court. I was your apologist, your\r\n           defender. But not anymore.\r\n           121.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           No. I can do this.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           You're about to be questioned by a\r\n           Federal Agency about piloting an\r\n           airliner drunk...an airliner that\r\n           crashed. And you continue to drink\r\n           and stumble around. What kind of\r\n           crazy do you have to be to do that?\r\n           I'm scared of you.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Let's just stick to the plan.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           You can't stick to anything.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           This whole thing has just been so\r\n           heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh,\r\n           I can do it. Look, I really wanna\r\n           fly again, get back to my life and\r\n           be done with all this shit.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           This hearing is 10 days away. Hugh\r\n           busted his ass to try to get you\r\n           excused, but there's no way. You\r\n           have to appear.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Let me stay here. They have my\r\n           houses all staked out now. Let me\r\n           stay here until the hearing,\r\n           Charlie. I won't leave the house.\r\n                         \r\n           CHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           You can't drink here, Whip. You\r\n           can't drink in my house. Can you\r\n           do that?\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           I won't drink.\r\n                         \r\n          118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118\r\n           122.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand. We pull\r\n          out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE\r\n          ST. JEROME HOTEL. Time has passed as WHIP looks the best\r\n          we've ever seen him look. He is well rested, well dressed\r\n          and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag.\r\n                         \r\n          As we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out.\r\n          A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room\r\n          and stands behind him.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           You look great, Whip. I mean that.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Thank you. I feel really good.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           I heard you haven't had a drink in\r\n           8 days.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           9 days...\r\n           (checks his watch)\r\n           Two hours and 26 minutes...but\r\n           who's counting?\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Officer Edmonds?\r\n                         \r\n                          OFFICER EDMONDS\r\n           Yes sir.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Whip, Officer Edmonds will be\r\n           staying here tonight. Any problems\r\n           he'll handle it.\r\n                         \r\n          HUGH stands by the open door and gestures CHARLIE and WHIP\r\n          inside...\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          HUGH walks in to the center of the room and turns to WHIP.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           Well, Whip we just wanted to make\r\n           this as easy for you as possible.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed.\r\n           123.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Just get a good night's rest.\r\n           Relax, order up a steak, get a\r\n           movie.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP is checking his phone. HUGH gestures to CHARLIE for him\r\n          to leave so they can be alone.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n           Okay, cowboy, I'm out. The hearing\r\n           starts at 10, so we should plan on\r\n           9 for breakfast here in the room.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting\r\n           me stay with you. I needed it.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           You did great cowboy.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           You've got a beautiful family.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           I'm very blessed.\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE leaves and HUGH joins WHIP at the window. HUGH hands\r\n          WHIP a thick folder.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH LANG\r\n           I made you a copy of my entire file\r\n           on you and the investigation. I\r\n           also tried to anticipate what you\r\n           might be asked under oath and I\r\n           wrote out some non-damaging\r\n           responses. It's all in there;\r\n           photos, testimony, interviews...I\r\n           called Ellen Block let her know\r\n           that you're here and all tucked in.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           So does she have the knife out for\r\n           me?\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH LANG\r\n           Remember she's limited in what she\r\n           can ask you. You're not on trial\r\n           but you are under oath. She's\r\n           probably not happy that I killed\r\n           the tox report, but you'll be fine.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP laughs a little.\r\n           124.\r\n                         \r\n           HUGH LANG (CONT'D)\r\n           I'll see you in the morning.\r\n                         \r\n          The two respectfully nod. HUGH leaves and the door shuts\r\n          behind him. WHIP puts the folder on the table and steps to\r\n          the mini-bar. He bends down and opens the fridge...\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices.\r\n          Every soft drink you can imagine. No booze, anywhere. WHIP\r\n          chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak.\r\n          The File Folder sits on the table.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Now in his undershirt and shorts, Whip lies propped up on the\r\n          bed watching television. The File Folder now rests on the\r\n          bed.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S BATHROOM -- LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Whip is meticulously shaving. He stares a long while at the\r\n          disposable razor as the water runs over its blade. After a\r\n          moment he goes back to shaving.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S ROOM -- MUCH LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Whip sits at the small table looking through the file. He\r\n          leafs through photos, with no recognizable emotion. He looks\r\n          to the clock radio -- 12:37.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S ROOM -- BATHROOM -- LATER AGAIN\r\n                         \r\n          We hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER THAN THAT\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his\r\n          neck. He looks to the clock -- 2:07\r\n                         \r\n          WE WATCH HIS SUIT BE PULLED FROM THE WARDROBE BAG.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP lays the suit out neatly on the couch, separating the\r\n          shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any\r\n          creases.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER YET AGAIN\r\n           125.\r\n                         \r\n          The room is dark. A soft wind RATTLES the window sash.\r\n          WHIP lies on the bed. He sighs, sleep is alluding him and\r\n          the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head\r\n          spinning. He hears a metallic click. He stays quiet to\r\n          listen for it...there it is again. An annoying click.\r\n                         \r\n          The clock reads \"3:43\"--\r\n                         \r\n          He sits up and switches on the LIGHT. He rubs his eyes and\r\n          goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there. As\r\n          he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again.\r\n          He goes to investigate.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          HOTEL ROOM CONNECTING DOOR -- SAME TIME\r\n                         \r\n          The connecting door is unlocked. WHIP arrives and waits. He\r\n          now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the\r\n          frame -- the door swinging in a draft. He looks up to see\r\n          the culprit -- a heating vent. WHIP flips the vent closed.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few\r\n          inches. Nothing. Darkness.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Hello? Anyone?\r\n                         \r\n          Whip enters.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. CONNECTING HOTEL ROOM -- SAME\r\n                         \r\n          The room is vacant. The bed is made. The drapes are pulled\r\n          open.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. The\r\n          night is clear. Quiet. Whip takes in the city lights.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP'S POV --\r\n                         \r\n          Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a\r\n          church spire. A simple cross is perched on top.\r\n                         \r\n          Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.\r\n                         \r\n          Then suddenly...\r\n                         \r\n          We HEAR A HUM. THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...\r\n                         \r\n          It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.\r\n           126.\r\n                         \r\n          Whip stares at the gleaming black box. The WHIR of the motor\r\n          seems to get LOUDER. Calling Whip. Beckoning him...\r\n                         \r\n          Whip looks at the fridge. His face is blank, His eyes tell us\r\n          nothing. Then...\r\n                         \r\n          Whip steps toward the box.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door.\r\n                         \r\n          WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS.\r\n                         \r\n          COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like\r\n          jewels in a chest.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP stares at the \"glimmering gems\" for a long, long time --\r\n          vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,\r\n          CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently\r\n          pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the\r\n          fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.\r\n                         \r\n          Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White\r\n          Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists\r\n          the tiny cap back on.\r\n                         \r\n          With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted\r\n          mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.\r\n                         \r\n          WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small\r\n          bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side\r\n          -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly...\r\n                         \r\n          WHAP!!! In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!!\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. THE ST.

HUGH joins him as they take in the room. The bed\r\n          looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests\r\n          politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH LANG\r\n           Did he disappear?\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the\r\n          bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining\r\n          room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Whip? Hello?\r\n                         \r\n          CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No\r\n          response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Smoke still\r\n          hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every\r\n          surface in the room. HUGH joins him...\r\n           128.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           Where is he?\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Whip?

WHIP slowly manages\r\n          to place his face in position to ingest the coke. It's tense\r\n          as his head wobbles. He finally zeroes in and snorts the\r\n          first line. HARLING quickly switches nostrils. WHIP sniffs\r\n          the other side.\r\n                         \r\n           HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)\r\n           Atta boy, head back now.

HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his\r\n          mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through\r\n          the cigarette.\r\n           133.\r\n                         \r\n          HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of\r\n          the cigarette.

WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his\r\n          head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and\r\n          holds it.\r\n                         \r\n           HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)\r\n           (still holding the smoke)\r\n           Keep it down big dog, banana boat's\r\n           comin' tell me the banana boat's\r\n           comin'...\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP finally exhales the smoke, HARLING does too.

Deja Vu.\r\n           Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank\r\n           him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that\r\n           OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves,\r\n           carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any\r\n           evidence of the debauched night or the morning's\r\n           resurrection.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           INT.

It is miraculous how the coke\r\n           has revived him. A MOM and her 8 year old DAUGHTER get on\r\n           the elevator.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLIE\r\n           Morning.\r\n                         \r\n           We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left\r\n           nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it\r\n           to WHIP.\r\n                         \r\n                          HUGH\r\n           Your nose...\r\n                         \r\n           WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose. WHIP sees\r\n           blood on the cloth and tilts his head back.\r\n           135.\r\n                         \r\n          We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator.\r\n          WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds\r\n          the hankie to his nose. WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE\r\n          helps him regain his balance.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. THE ST.

ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the\r\n          cockpit voice recording...\r\n                         \r\n          The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A\r\n          large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield\r\n          that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen\r\n          will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB.\r\n                         \r\n          A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file\r\n          which she lays on the podium.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELLEN BLOCK\r\n           Those are difficult images to\r\n           watch. For the record, I'm Ellen\r\n           Block, Hearing Officer for this\r\n           hearing. Captain Whitaker, good\r\n           morning.\r\n           136.\r\n                         \r\n          We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           Morning.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELLEN BLOCK\r\n           What was captured on that video is\r\n           that the aircraft was in a\r\n           relatively stable glide just prior\r\n           to the moment of impact.\r\n           However, according to the data we\r\n           retrieved from the cockpit data\r\n           recorders, at exactly 9:34, after\r\n           flying 27 minutes without incident,\r\n           the transponder recorded a loss in\r\n           altitude in excess of 4800 feet per\r\n           minute in what is considered a\r\n           \"full pitch nose down\" attitude.\r\n           Then at 9:42, according to the data\r\n           recorders, a decision was made to\r\n           invert the aircraft. The NTSB has\r\n           created animated simulation that I\r\n           would like to play at this point.\r\n                         \r\n          ELLEN points to the screen...\r\n                         \r\n          An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow\r\n          it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the\r\n          real audio of the flight crew.\r\n                         \r\n          The animation has a split screen that also shows the\r\n          instruments and printed text of what's being said.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear...\"What's your son's name?\" \"Why?\" \"The black box\"\r\n          \"I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you.\" \"What\r\n          are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!\" \"We're gonna roll\r\n          it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control.\"\r\n                         \r\n          That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops\r\n          and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in\r\n          progress.\r\n                         \r\n           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)\r\n           That audio is tragic and\r\n           compelling. I chose to play that\r\n           part of the cockpit recording to\r\n           highlight a key moment aboard\r\n           flight 227, wherein you say \"We're\r\n           gonna roll it, here we go, I've got\r\n           control.\" You made a very\r\n           conscious decision to invert the\r\n           airplane, to roll the plane upside\r\n           down. Is that correct?\r\n           137.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           I'm not sure it was conscious. It\r\n           was more of an instinct.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELLEN BLOCK\r\n           What led to that decision?\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair. The coke got him\r\n          there but it may start to fail him soon.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           I don't recall.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELLEN BLOCK\r\n           Let me quote from an investigative\r\n           summary...\"From 9:34 until 9:42 the\r\n           events on the aircraft are\"...again\r\n           I quote, \"bold and remarkable\"...\r\n           \"By inverting the plane, Captain\r\n           Whitaker arrested the descent and\r\n           allowed the aircraft to level off\r\n           enabling him to glide the aircraft\r\n           away from any populated areas and\r\n           allowing him to execute a forced\r\n           landing in an open field.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions\r\n          are remarkable.\r\n                         \r\n                          WHIP\r\n           I heard a metallic bang.

However, my first\r\n           officer and I discussed the\r\n           conditions on the field and\r\n           determined that we were safely\r\n           within our visibility and crosswind\r\n           minimums.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELLEN BLOCK\r\n           Yes, first officer Evans' testimony\r\n           confirms the same.\r\n                         \r\n          WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses,\r\n          seeing if he has any reaction.

As you can see,\r\n           the threads on this screw are\r\n           almost entirely gone. \"\r\n           139.\r\n                         \r\n           Substandard thread life\" is how we\r\n           reported it. This part was\r\n           suggested as a maintenance\r\n           replacement in January of 2010. It\r\n           was never replaced.\r\n                         \r\n           This had 1200 additional hours of\r\n           flight on it. It finally failed.\r\n                         \r\n          AN ANIMATION SHOWS THE TAIL ASSEMBLY.\r\n                         \r\n          We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes\r\n          up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.\r\n                         \r\n           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)\r\n           Our investigators have concluded\r\n           that the jackscrew snapped and the\r\n           elevator was frozen in a fixed\r\n           position, locking the elevator in a\r\n           down position which forced the\r\n           plane into a dive. The loss of the\r\n           elevator was, and I quote our\r\n           report, a \"catastrophic event, from\r\n           which recovery was improbable and\r\n           stable flight impossible.\"\r\n                         \r\n          Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone\r\n          changes as she understands how hard this is for some people\r\n          to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last\r\n          living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.\r\n                         \r\n          It is deathly quiet in the ballroom. Even the PRESS are\r\n          silent.\r\n                         \r\n           ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)\r\n           Again I quote...\"From 9:34 until\r\n           9:42 the piloting decisions made by\r\n           Captain Whitaker were bold and\r\n           remarkable. The fact that Captain\r\n           Whitaker commanded that the\r\n           aircraft stay inverted while\r\n           descending to an extremely low\r\n           altitude shows a miraculous\r\n           intuition that in this instance\r\n           saved 96 lives.\"\r\n                         \r\n          A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room.

He begins to\r\n          alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the\r\n          promise of a connection with his son.\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nFlight\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John Gatins\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:16.068286"}
