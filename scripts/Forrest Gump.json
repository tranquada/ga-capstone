The feather \n               floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down \n               toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive \n               by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.\n\n               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked \n               back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. \n               The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward \n               the street.\n\n               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying \n               back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather \n               floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's \n               mudsoaked shoe.\n\n               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is \n               FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a \n               box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.\n\n               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a \n               pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.\n\n               Forrest pulls out a book titled \"Curious George,\" then places \n               the feather inside the book.
