A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)\n\n               A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.\n\n               A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather \n               floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down \n               toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive \n               by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.\n\n               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked \n               back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. \n               The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward \n               the street.\n\n               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying \n               back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather \n               floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's \n               mudsoaked shoe.\n\n               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is \n               FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a \n               box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.\n\n               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a \n               pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.\n\n               Forrest pulls out a book titled \"Curious George,\" then places \n               the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.\n\n               Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all \n               there.\n\n               Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.\n\n               A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus \n               continues on.\n\n               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at \n               the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a \n               magazine as Forrest looks at her.\n\n                                     FORREST\n                         Hello.

COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY \n               (1951)\n\n               A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as \n               he sits in a doctor's office.\n\n                                     FORREST (V.O.)\n                         She said they was my magic shoes.\n\n               Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg \n               braces.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         All right, Forrest, you can open \n                         your eyes now. Let's take a little \n                         walk around.\n\n               The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around \n               stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS.

His legs are \n                         strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've \n                         ever seen. But his back is as crooked \n                         as a politician.\n\n               Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         But we're gonna straighten him right \n                         up now, won't we, Forrest?\n\n               A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.\n\n                                     MRS.

Forrest \n               walks stiffly next to his mother.\n\n                                     FORREST (V.O.)\n                         Now, when I was a baby, Momma named \n                         me after the great Civil War hero, \n                         General Nathan Bedford Forrest...\n\n               EXT. RURAL ALABAMA\n\n               A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\n               The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded \n               sheet over his head.\n\n               The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.\n\n               The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan \n               members dressed in full uniform.\n\n                                     FORREST (V.O.)\n                         She said we was related to him in \n                         some way. And, what he did was, he \n                         started up this club called the Ku \n                         Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in \n                         their robes and their bedsheets and \n                         act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks \n                         or something. They'd even put \n                         bedsheets on their horses and ride \n                         around. And anyway, that's how I got \n                         my name. Forrest Gump.\n\n               EXT. GREENBOW\n\n               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.\n\n                                     FORREST (V.O.)\n                         Momma said that the Forrest part was \n                         to remind me that sometimes we all \n                         do things that, well, just don't \n                         make no sense.\n\n               Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's \n               brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and \n               tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a \n               barber shop and watch.\n\n                                     MRS. GUMP\n                         Just wait, let me get it.\n\n               Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.\n\n                                     MRS. GUMP\n                         Let me get it. Wait, get it this \n                         way. Hold on.\n\n               Forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.\n\n                                     MRS. GUMP\n                         All right.\n\n               Mrs. Gump helps Forrest up onto the sidewalk. She looks up \n               and notices the two old man.\n\n                                     MRS. GUMP\n                         Oooh. All right. What are you all \n                         staring at? Haven't you ever seen a \n                         little boy with braces on his legs \n                         before?\n\n               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two \n               old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.\n\n                                     MRS. GUMP\n                         Don't ever let anybody tell you \n                         they're better than you, Forrest. If \n                         God intended everybody to be the \n                         same, he'd have given us all braces \n                         on our legs.\n\n                                     FORREST (V.O.)\n                         Momma always had a way of explaining \n                         things so I could understand them.\n\n               EXT. OAK ALLEY/THE GUMP BOARDING HOUSE\n\n               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road.

That's in \n                         the county of Greenbow. Our house \n                         had been in Momma's family since her \n                         grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come \n                         across the ocean about a thousand \n                         years ago. Something like that.\n\n               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House \n               driveway.\n\n                                     FORREST (V.O.)\n                         Since it was just me and Momma and \n                         we had all these empty rooms, Momma \n                         decided to let those rooms out.

GUMP HOUSE - MORNING\n\n               Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom. He carries a tray with \n               breakfast on it. Forrest looks at Jenny as she sleeps.\n\n               Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest.\n\n                                     FORREST\n                         Hey.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Hey.\n\n               Forrest sets the tray down next to Jenny as she sits up in \n               bed.

The stars emerge from behind the clouds.\n\n                                     FORREST (V.O.)\n                         Sometimes it would stop raining long \n                         enough for the stars to come out. \n                         And then it was nice. It was like \n                         just before the sun goes to bed down \n                         on the bayou...\n\n               EXT.

It looks \n                         like there were two skies, one on \n                         top of the other.

It is \n               the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to \n               school when he was a young boy.\n\n                                     SCHOOLD BUS DRIVER\n                         You understand this is the bus to \n                         school now, don't you?\n\n                                     FORREST JR.\n                         Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris \n                         and I'm Forrest Gump.\n\n               Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father. Forrest nods \n               approvingly.\n\n               Forrest Jr. gets on the bus. The bus pulls away. Forrest \n               stands next to the mailbox.\n\n               Forrest sits down. The camera cranes down, revealing the \n               feather as it lies at Forrest's feet.\n\n               A gust of wind picks the feather up. The feather floats up \n               into the air.\n\n               Forrest sits at the side of the road. The feather floats \n               higher into the air.\n\n               The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down, \n               then covers the camera lens.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForrest Gump\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Eric Roth\u00a0\u00a0Winston Groom\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:17.672521"}
