Makes a miniscule adjustment\n               to a single joint. Drops in another ball.\n               It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down.\n               Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine.\n               Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful\n               woman in her mid-30s.\n               His wife.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n\n<b>               INT.

And\n               then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls\n               off her - slowly coming back to earth.\n               Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and\n               gratitude and satisfaction on her face -\n               - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear.\n               She is, after all, having an affair.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>                                                                              2\n</b>\n<b>               \n</b>\n<b>               \n</b>\n\n<b>               INT.

Then he stands,\n               removing the glasses.\n\n               We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment\n               related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets\n               take off from an industrial airstrip.\n\n               Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk\n               drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private\n               bathroom.\n\n               He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then\n               puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk.\n\n               He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks\n               like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card.\n\n               He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on\n               the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby.\n               Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays:\n               dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal.\n\n               TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.\n\n<b>                                        TINA\n</b>                           The N.T.S.B. guys are here.\n\n<b>                                        CRAWFORD\n</b>                                  (Doesn't look up)\n                           Yep.\n\n               She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle.\n               Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and\n               grabbing his jacket -\n               - which knocks over the bottle.   It skitters across the desk,\n               liquor spilling.\n               Crawford just walks out past Tina.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n\n<b>               INT.

A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this\n               is not a man who skips a shave.\n               But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding\n               the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:\n\n<b>                                         CRAWFORD\n</b>                            It's here.\n\n               He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off\n               toward the giant open doors out to the airfield.\n               His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in\n               passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford\n               doesn't slow or look back.\n\n<b>               \n</b>\n\n<b>               INT.

The ball rolls and leaps and\n               clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one\n               point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it\n               spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected -\n               - until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails\n               across the living room -\n               - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table.\n               Willy grimaces.

Savoring Crawford's growing fear.\n               They can hear a car rolling up the driveway.

Trying to focus.    His mind working.\n               The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe.\n               The doorbell rings.\n\n               Crawford looks up.
