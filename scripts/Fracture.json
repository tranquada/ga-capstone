Makes a miniscule adjustment\n               to a single joint. Drops in another ball.\n               It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down.\n               Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine.\n               Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful\n               woman in her mid-30s.\n               His wife.\n\n               \n\n\n               INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - THE SAME TIME\n\n               JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm -\n               - with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish.\n               They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And\n               then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls\n               off her - slowly coming back to earth.\n               Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and\n               gratitude and satisfaction on her face -\n               - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear.\n               She is, after all, having an affair.\n\n               \n\n                                                                              2\n\n               \n\n               \n\n\n               INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless,\n               expressionless.\n\n               He takes a deep breath and checks his watch.   Then he stands,\n               removing the glasses.\n\n               We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment\n               related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets\n               take off from an industrial airstrip.\n\n               Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk\n               drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private\n               bathroom.\n\n               He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then\n               puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk.\n\n               He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks\n               like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card.\n\n               He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on\n               the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby.\n               Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays:\n               dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal.\n\n               TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.\n\n                                        TINA\n                           The N.T.S.B. guys are here.\n\n                                        CRAWFORD\n                                  (Doesn't look up)\n                           Yep.\n\n               She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle.\n               Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and\n               grabbing his jacket -\n               - which knocks over the bottle.   It skitters across the desk,\n               liquor spilling.\n               Crawford just walks out past Tina.\n\n               \n\n\n               INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - SOON AFTER\n\n               The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet\n               is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor.\n\n               \n\n                                                                             3\n\n               \n\n               \n               N.T.S.B. INVESTIGATORS in shirtsleeves and AIRCRAFT COMPANY\n               EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with\n               photographs and diagrams of a crash site.\n               They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying\n               the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this\n               is not a man who skips a shave.\n               But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding\n               the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:\n\n                                         CRAWFORD\n                            It's here.\n\n               He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off\n               toward the giant open doors out to the airfield.\n               His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in\n               passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford\n               doesn't slow or look back.\n\n               \n\n\n               INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - SOON AFTER\n\n               Rob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching\n               Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit.\n\n                                         ROB\n                            What about dinner tonight?\n\n               She looks at him, surprised.    Smiles, comes to sit beside\n               him. Gently:\n\n                                         JENNIFER\n                            We go out to dinner - we might never\n                            come back.\n\n               Beat.   Rob nods.\n\n                                         ROB\n                            Okay.\n                                   (Beat)\n                            I want to wake up with you.    I want\n                            to...\n\n               He gropes for words, but it's too big and he relents - scales\n               back, sighing:\n\n                                         ROB\n                            ...at least see where you live.\n\n               She regards him tenderly, feeling the same reckless yearning.\n               But also fear. She rubs his hair.\n\n               \n\n                                                                             4\n\n               \n\n               \n\n                                        JENNIFER\n                           I live...here.\n\n               She leans over to kiss him delicately on the lips.\n\n               \n\n\n               EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - DAY\n\n               A black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach,\n               pulls into a parking space.\n               Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell\n               phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials.\n\n                                        OPERATOR (ON PHONE)\n\n                           L.A.P.D.\n\n                                        CRAWFORD\n                           Lieutenant Nunally, please.\n\n               He listens to hold music and checks the time.\n\n                                        OPERATOR (ON PHONE)\n                           He doesn't come on til six. You want\n                           his voice mail?\n\n                                         CRAWFORD\n                           No.  Thank you.\n                                  (beat)\n                           I'll see him later.\n\n               He hangs up, grabs his cell, and takes off down the sidewalk.\n\n               \n\n\n               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\n               Crawford enters. He knows where he's going - past the front\n               desk and outside to the -\n\n               \n\n\n               EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY\n\n               Jennifer swims laps with strong, even strokes.   Rob is\n               enjoying the sun in a lounge chair.\n               Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low\n               fence. Unnoticed, he heads upstairs.\n\n               \n\n                                                                             5\n\n               \n\n               \n\n\n               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               Crawford stops at a room with a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the\n               knob. He takes out his PDA-device and slides its card into\n               the key-card slot of the lock.\n               The lock clicks to green.\n\n               \n\n\n               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n               Crawford enters, quietly closing the door behind him.\n               He just stands there, taking it all in. The unmade bed, the\n               ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor.\n               He is silent.   Very still.\n\n               \n\n\n               EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - LATER\n\n               Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive\n               houses in the late-afternoon light.\n               She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home.\n               Across the street, MR. GIFFORD is playing catch with his\n               GRANDSON. He waves to Jennifer.\n               She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the\n               front door.\n\n               \n\n\n               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Cold. Elegant. Metal planters with bamboo trees. Glass\n               doors out to a back garden. A fire in the fireplace.\n               In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this\n               one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the\n               center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings.\n               Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and -\n               - freezes, startled.\n               Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer\n               \"disarray\", he is calm and focused.\n\n                                        JENNIFER\n                           You're - home early.\n\n               \n\n                                                                            6\n\n               \n\n               \n\n                                        CRAWFORD\n                           I just felt a sudden urge.\n\n                                        JENNIFER\n                           Are you...okay?\n               Crawford shrugs, smiling strangely.

Preparing herself to\n               turn and end it, to grow, to move on.\n\n                                        CRAWFORD\n                           It's not like I don't let little\n                           pleasures, in return for the pain.\n\n               \n\n                                                                              8\n\n               \n\n               \n               She frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear.\n               Crawford is holding a semi-automatic pistol, aimed at her\n               face. Very still.\n               The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud.\n\n               \n\n\n               EXT.

CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic\n               curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The\n               hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove.\n               He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing\n               from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way\n               to Jennifer.\n               He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in\n               a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open.\n               The doorbell rings.\n\n               \n\n\n               EXT.

They curl and blacken.\n\n               \n\n                                                                              9\n\n               \n\n               \n               Crawford watches, expressionless - then looks around,\n               satisfied.

Nearby houses\n               have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved\n               back to a block away.\n               UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan\n               rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck.\n               ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent\n               his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an\n               L.A.P.D.

But\n               then he turns - with the SWAT Commander and everyone else -\n               - as Crawford's front door unlocks and opens a few inches.\n               Nunally considers this, looks at the SWAT COMMANDER.\n\n                                         NUNALLY\n                           Okay then.   Here we go.\n               He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk\n               for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt,\n               concealed under the jacket.\n               He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.\n               The spectators fall silent.    Radios crackle and hiss as he\n               heads up the driveway.\n\n               \n\n\n               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Crawford watches Nunally's silhouette appear on the frosted\n               glass, from across the living room.\n\n                                           NUNALLY (O.S.)\n                           Mr. Crawford?\n               The door pushes open very slowly.

Nunally glances back, sees the SWAT teams and -\n               down the street - the distant barricades, the media.\n               He nods, steps in and lets the door shut.     Careful silence.\n\n                                        CRAWFORD\n                           Do I call you Rob?\n\n                                           NUNALLY\n                           If you want.\n\n               \n\n                                                                             11\n\n               \n\n               \n\n                                           CRAWFORD\n                           Not vampires.\n\n                                           NUNALLY\n                           What?\n\n                                           CRAWFORD\n                           Not vampires.     Ghouls.   Sorry.\n               Nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around. Sees the small\n               pool of blood where Jennifer fell.

Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't\n               one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be\n               standing in the open center of the room.\n\n               \n\n                                                                           12\n\n               \n\n               \n\n                                        CRAWFORD\n                           Happy ending, then.\n               Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes -\n               - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster.\n               Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly -\n               the two men cautiously set down their guns -\n               - and step away.

Willy lets himself in.\n               He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex\n               computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it.\n               Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters.\n               He can't get any other pre-sets to work.\n               The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is\n               black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange.\n               Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the\n               French doors to the garden.

The front door opens, and slams.\n               A little worried, Willy takes a deep breath.       Gets to work.\n               He still has three days to break this open.\n               Walking through the crime again.\n               Playing it out in his mind. Standing in different places,\n               getting different perspectives.\n               Willy stands in the alcove.    Looking around.\n               There's something here.     But he can't get it.\n               His eye falls on the Rube Goldberg device.       Moves closer,\n               peering into the mechanism.\n               Turns away: no gun. But now he's facing the big wooden bowl\n               of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on\n               the coffee table.\n               Hide in plain sight.\n               He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around.\n               Nope. He sighs. Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand.\n               Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot.\n               The machine is amazing. The ball rolls and leaps and\n               clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one\n               point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it\n               spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected -\n               - until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails\n               across the living room -\n               - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table.\n               Willy grimaces.

Now or never.\n               Willy won't look up.\n               Nunally stares, agonized.\n               Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning up,\n               turning to ash and blowing away -\n               - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's\n               note. Shuts the briefcase. Looks at the Judge.\n\n                                        WILLY\n                           I have no further evidence at this\n                           time, your honor.\n               Crawford begins to smile.\n               Lobruto looks down.    A buzz rises in the gallery -\n               - as Nunally gets up, furious - stalks to the doors, slams\n               out.\n\n               \n\n                                                                              85\n\n               \n\n               \n               Judge Robinson looks at Willy a moment - then at Crawford,\n               who has been waiting, calm and polite. Very reluctantly:\n\n                                         JUDGE ROBINSON\n                            Motion to dismiss is granted.\n               Uproar.

Refusing\n               to look up.\n               The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, but\n               no one is listening - SPECTATORS swarm up the aisles, out to\n               the hallway - and the Court starts to close down.\n               Crawford comes over to Willy, holds out a hand.\n               Willy looks him in the eye.   Doesn't move.   Crawford shrugs.\n\n                                         CRAWFORD\n                            Even a broken clock gets to be right\n                            twice a day.\n               He winks, and heads up the aisle.\n               As Willy watches Crawford go out the doors into a clamor of\n               lenses, hand-held mikes, white-hot halogen glare and flashes -\n               - he hears a buzzing noise. Looks down at his briefcase,\n               moves the papers aside: his cell phone is vibrating.\n               Willy stares at it, as if he'd forgotten the thing could be\n               used for an incoming call.\n               The caller ID reads: WOOTON SIMS.

Tomorrow's just a travel da-\n               - there's a gun shot outside the courtroom.\n               Willy turns.    Shocked.

Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless\n               fingers.   Blood all over, from his head.\n               Willy stops pushing.

Everyone else is moving, talking,\n               gawking at the body or averting their eyes -\n               - except Crawford.   He's looking straight at Willy.\n               Pleased.

Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his\n               cuffs.

WILLY'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER\n\n               The garage door is open, letting in daylight. We can see the\n               alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers\n               on the clothes-bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been\n               taken apart, stacked on the floor.\n               Willy is packing.    He's wearing jeans, an old t-shirt.\n               He carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash\n               bins, throws them away.\n\n               \n\n                                                                         108\n\n               \n\n               \n               As he turns to go back in - he sees Lobruto coming along the\n               alley, wearing a suit.

Shrugs, accepts the\n               decision, with regret.\n               Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing.\n               Lobruto starts to leave.    But from the alley door:\n\n                                        LOBRUTO\n                           If it makes you feel any better -\n                           technically, you let a man get away\n                           with attempted murder.\n               Willy doesn't respond.    Keeps packing.\n               Lobruto goes out.\n               After a moment, Willy stops.    Looking up.

Right?\n               Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now.         Impressed\n               with the young man's fervor, and his logic.\n               But he shakes his head.\n\n                                        LOBRUTO\n                           All your evidence is still toxic.
