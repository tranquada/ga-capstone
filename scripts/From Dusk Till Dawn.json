I'm\n\t\tsimply saying that if I was\n\t\tscratching, and if I did scratch, it's\n\t\tnot because I was signaling the cop,\n\t\tit's because I'm fuckin' scared\n\t\tshitless.\n\n\tRichard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to\n\tSeth.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tThe Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't\n\t\tI just go in there, blow his head off\n\t\tand get outta here.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tDon't do that! Look, you asked me to\n\t\tact natural, and I'm acting as natural\n\t\t-- in fact, under the circumstances, I\n\t\tthink I ought get a fuckin' Academy\n\t\tAward for how natural I'm acting. You\n\t\tasked me to get rid of him, I'm doing\n\t\tmy best.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYeah, well, your best better get a\n\t\thelluva lot fuckin' better, or you're\n\t\tgonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot\n\t\tworse.\n\n\tThe toilet FLUSHES.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tEverybody be cool.\n\n\tEverybody goes back to what they were doing.\n\n\tMcGraw steps back out of the back.

So tonight I'm gonna sit\n\t\tin front of the box and just drink\n\t\tbooze.

Pete\n\tscreams from behind the counter.\n\n\tSeth smiles to himself and stands.\n\n\tRichard shakes his head in amusement and stands.\n\n\tPete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES\n\tstill holding his weapon and FIRING.\n\n\tSeth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.\n\n\tPete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess\n\tPastry display.\n\n\tSeth and Richard rise from the rubble.\n\n\n\n\tEXT.

EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY\n\n\tEmma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,\n\tcowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through\n\tthe maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.\n\n\tIt stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER\n\tFAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary\n\tcategory. The members of the unit consist of the father,\n\tJACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,\n\tand his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who\n\tpossesses what can only be described as an apple pie\n\tsensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,\n\tcomplete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's\n\tVietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid\n\twho always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal\n\tgarage band he plays guitar for, \"Precinct 13.\" The three\n\tof them are wolfing down a late lunch.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWe got about two more hours of day\n\t\tlight left. That'll get us into\n\t\tEl Paso, which is right next to the\n\t\tborder. We'll stop at a motel --\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tStop? We're not going to actually\n\t\tstop at a motel, are we?\n\n\tScott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something\n\tthat Jacob has said about three hundred times.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT AND KATE\n\t\tWe've got a Winnebago. We don't need\n\t\tthose over priced roach havens. We're\n\t\tself contained.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOkay, Okay, maybe I was a little\n\t\toverzealous, but give me a break, I\n\t\tjust bought it.\n\n\tScott and Kate continue the impersonation.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tWhy, just look at all this. You got\n\t\tyour kitchen --\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t-- you got your microwave --\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\t-- you got your sink --\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t-- you got your shower --\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\t-- see this, television!\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tFeel this, real wood paneling. That's\n\t\treal wood, too, not that fake stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tUnless you two wiseacres wanna be\n\t\tintroduced to the joys of hitchhiking,\n\t\twhat say we drop this?\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\t\t(to Kate)\n\t\tThe truth hurts.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t\t(to Scott)\n\t\tIt's the bitterest of pills.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou two ought to start a stand-up\n\t\tact, because you're just wasting your\n\t\thumor on me.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tAin't it the truth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tWhy do you want to stop?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm exhausted.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tLie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us\n\t\tinto Mexico.\n\n\tJacob gives Scott a look that says, \"You aren't touching my\n\tnew motor home.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI just bet you would. Don't even thin\n\t\tabout it. Besides, I want to have one\n\t\tnight's sleep in an\n\t\thonest-to-goodness bed. The beds in\n\t\tthe home are okay, but they're not\n\t\tlike a real bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tHey, if we go to a motel, we can\n\t\tswim.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tI'll be right back. I'm gonna go to\n\t\tthe bathroom.\n\n\tScott gets up from the table and walks out back to the\n\trestroom.\n\n\tJacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of\n\tsilence before...\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tDad, when I called the machine to\n\t\tcheck our messages there was one from\n\t\tBethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he\n\t\twouldn't permanently replace you until\n\t\twe came back. He said when we come\n\t\thome, if you still feel the same\n\t\tway --\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThat's very nice of Ted, but I'll\n\t\tcall him tomorrow and tell him not\n\t\tto bother waiting.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tI didn't want to talk about this in\n\t\tfront of Scott because he gets upset.\n\t\tBut you don't believe in God\n\t\tanymore?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNot enough to be a pastor. Look, I\n\t\tknow this is hard on you kids. After\n\t\tJenny's death, this is probably the\n\t\tlast thing you need. But I can't do\n\t\tit any longer. My congregation needs\n\t\tspiritual leadership. Well, they can't\n\t\tget that from me anymore. My faith is\n\t\tgone. To answer your question, yes,\n\t\tI do believe in Jesus. But do I love\n\t\tthem? No. After Jenny died, I just\n\t\tthought, what's the point?\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t\t(pushing him)\n\t\tIt's just, all our lives you've been\n\t\ta pastor. For twenty years you've\n\t\tpreached trust in the lord. And then\n\t\tone day you wake up and say fuck him?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI didn't say fuck him. I'm just not\n\t\tconnected anymore.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tThat happens, you'll get it back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tKate, give your old man a little\n\t\tcredit. Every person who chooses the\n\t\tservice of God as their life's work\n\t\thas something in common. I don't care\n\t\tif you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,\n\t\ta rabbi or a Buddhist monk.

Jacob and Scott get on their feet\n\tand move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun\n\tready to spit.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(to Scott and Jacob)\n\t\tStop!\n\n\tJacob and Scott freeze.\n\n\tRichard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and\n\tpositioning himself behind the terrified Kate.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tWhat's going on?\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tWe're having a wet bikini contest,\n\t\tand you just won.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(to Kate)\n\t\tIt's okay, honey.

So, with all due\n\t\trespect, mind your own business.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI seem to have touched a nerve. Don't\n\t\tbe so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this\n\t\tfriendly. But you're right, enough\n\t\twith the getting to know you shit.\n\t\tNow, there's two ways we can play this\n\t\thand. One way is me and you go round\n\t\tan' round all fuckin' night. The other\n\t\tway, is we reach some sort of an\n\t\tunderstanding. Now, if we go down that\n\t\tfirst path at the end of the day, I'll\n\t\twin. But we go down the second, we'll\n\t\tboth win. Now, I don't give a rat's\n\t\tass about you or your fuckin' family.\n\t\tY'all can live forever or die this\n\t\tsecond and I don't care which.

Now,\n\t\tstop me if I'm wrong, but I take it\n\t\tyou don't give a shit about seeing me\n\t\tand my brother receiving justice, or\n\t\tthe bank getting its money back. Right\n\t\tnow all you care about is the safety\n\t\tof your daughter, your son and\n\t\tpossibly yourself. Am I correct?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI thought so. You help us get across\n\t\tthe border without incident, stay with\n\t\tus the rest of the night without\n\t\ttrying anything funny, and in the\n\t\tmorning we'll let you and your family\n\t\tgo. That way everybody gets what they\n\t\twant. You and your kids get out of\n\t\tthis alive and we get into Mexico.\n\t\tEverybody's happy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHow do I know you'll keep your word?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tJesus Christ, Pops, don't start with\n\t\tthis shit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou want me to sit here and be\n\t\tpassive. The only way being passive in\n\t\tthis situation makes sense is if I\n\t\tbelieve you'll let us go. I'm not\n\t\tthere yet. You have to convince me\n\t\tyou're telling the truth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tLook, dickhead, the only thing you\n\t\tneed to be convinced about is that\n\t\tyou're stuck in a situation with a\n\t\tcoupla real mean motor scooters. I\n\t\tdon't wanna hafta worry about you all\n\t\tfuckin' night. And I don't think you\n\t\twanna be worrying about my brother's\n\t\tintentions toward your daughter all\n\t\tnight.

So, as I was saying,\n\t\tI'm willing to make a deal. You\n\t\tbehave, get us into Mexico, and don't\n\t\ttry to escape. I'll keep my brother\n\t\toff your daughter and let you all\n\t\tloose in the morning.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYou won't let him touch her?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI can handle Richie, don't worry.\n\n\tThe two men look at each other for some measure of trust.\n\tSeth sticks out his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI give you my word.\n\n\tSeth can't help but think about the last time he gave his\n\tword.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(hand sticks out)\n\t\tMy words, my law. Better you not take\n\t\tit, and that's just where we are,\n\t\tthen take it and not mean it.\n\n\tJacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIf he touches her, I'll kill him.

Chet Pussy talks into\n\tthe microphone.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\t\t(yelling into the microphone)\n\t\tTake advantage of our penny pussy sale.\n\t\tBuy any piece of pussy a tour regular\n\t\tprice, you get another piece of pussy,\n\t\tof equal or lesser value, for a penny.\n\t\tNow try and beat pussy for a penny!\n\t\tIf you can find cheaper pussy\n\t\tanywhere, fuck it!\n\n\tChet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\t\t(in microphone, towards Kate)\n\t\tWhat's this? A new flavor approaching.\n\t\tApple Pie Pussy.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tStep aside, asshole.\n\n\tChet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tNot so fast, Slick.\n\n\tSeth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till\n\tthe BONE SNAPS in two.\n\n\tChet lets out a SCREAM.\n\n\tSeth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's\n\tNOSE.\n\n\tChet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.\n\n\tSeth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that\n\tSNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.\n\n\tAfter HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight\n\tto Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.\n\n\tChet is OUT.\n\n\tThe whole altercation took two seconds.\n\n\tEveryone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at\n\teveryone.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tNow, is my shit together, or is my\n\t\tshit together?\n\n\tRichard and Seth laugh with each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\t\t(slappin' Seth five)\n\t\tYour shit is forever together!\n\n\tThey head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,\n\tand gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,\n\n\n\tINT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT\n\n\tIf the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world\n\tfrom the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, \"You\n\tain't seen nothin' yet.\" This is the kind of place where\n\tthey sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood\n\tand the beer at closing.\n\n\tIn the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,\n\twhile a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played\n\tat ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage\n\tBAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of\n\tbikers and truckers.\n\n\tOne of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his\n\tname is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in\n\tthe saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is\n\tATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the\n\tcrowd.\n\n\tBikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out\n\there about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,\n\tbut the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.\n\n\tSeth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.\n\tThey each individually take in the sights and the smells.\n\tSeth is the first to say something.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tNow this is my kinda place! I could\n\t\tbecome a regular.\n\n\tThe man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group\n\tas they approach.\n\n\tTheir difference from the usual road waif nomads who\n\tpopulate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing\n\tlook across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies\n\tup to the bar.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWhiskey!\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\t\t(in English)\n\t\tYou can't come in here.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWhat dya mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\tThis is a private club. You're not\n\t\twelcome.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tAre you tellin' me I'm not good enough\n\t\tto drink here?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\tThis bar is for bikers and truckers\n\t\tonly.\n\t\t\t(points his finger to Seth)\n\t\tYou, get out!\n\n\tBig Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places \n\tHIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG EMILIO\n\t\t\t(to Seth in Spanish)\n\t\tWalk, Pendaho.\n\n\tSeth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(low)\n\t\tTake your hand off me.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG EMILIO\n\t\t\t(Spanish)\n\t\tI'm going to count to three.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tNo, I'm going to count to three.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG EMILIO\n\t\tUno...\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tTwo..\n\n\tJacob jumps in the middle.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNow wait a minute, there's no reason\n\t\tto get ugly. There's just a\n\t\tmisunderstanding going on here. You\n\t\tsaid this bar is for truckers and\n\t\tbikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.\n\n\tEverybody looks at Jacob.\n\n\tAs Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIf you look outside your door, parked\n\t\tin your parking lot, you'll see a big\n\t\tass recreational vehicle. That's mine.\n\t\tIn order to drive that legally, you\n\t\tneed a class two driver's license.\n\t\tThat is the same license that the\n\t\tDMV requires truck drivers to carry\n\t\tin order to drive a truck.\n\t\t\t(he takes the license out\n\t\t\t of his wallet and lays it\n\t\t\t on the bar)\n\t\tThat is me, and this is my class two\n\t\tlicense. This is a truck driver's bar,\n\t\tI am a truck driver, and these are\n\t\tmy friends.\n\n\tEverybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.\n\n\tRazor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at\n\teveryone in the party and smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\t\t(to Jacob)\n\t\tWelcome to the Titty Twister. What\n\t\tcan I get you?\n\n\tSeth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tBottle of whiskey and five glasses.\n\n\tRazor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big\n\tsmile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.\n\tBut instead he just says,\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\tComing right up.\n\n\tRazor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the\n\tparty one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a\n\tbuddy punch on the shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tGood job, Pops.\n\n\tSeth's still frying an egg on his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tThat's just fuckin' typical. Biggest\n\t\tnumber one problem with Mexico, it's\n\t\tnot service oriented. I was feelin'\n\t\tso good, and those fuckin' spies\n\t\tbrought me down.\n\n\tRichard puts his arm around Seth.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tFuck 'em, shake it off.\n\n\tRazor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks\n\tat the guy, still pissed.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYou serve food, Jose?\n\n\tRazor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,\n\tbut he just smiles and says,\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\tBest in Mexico.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a\n\t\ttable, send over a waitress to take\n\t\tour order.\n\n\tSeth walks away, and the group follows him.\n\n\tWe just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor\n\tCharlie's head.\n\n\tThe five of them move across the floor to a table. As they\n\twalk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments\n\tfrom some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.\n\n\tThe dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,\n\twild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.\n\n\tRichard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tAnytime you want a lap dance with that\n\t\tbroad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.\n\n\tHe gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the\n\tsurroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange\n\twords about the party in Spanish.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\t\t(in Spanish)\n\t\tThey're not the normal road trash we\n\t\tnormally feed on. But it'll be okay.\n\t\tNo one knows they're here.\n\n\tThe five of them find a table and sit down.\n\n\tSeth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey\n\tbottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWho else?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tPass.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(picking a fight)\n\t\tWhy not, against your religion?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(won't be baited)\n\t\tNo, I do drink, I'm just not drinking\n\t\tnow.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tSuit yourself, more for me.\n\t\t\t(to Scott)\n\t\tScotty?\n\n\tScott shakes his head no.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(to Kate)\n\t\tHow 'bout you?\n\t\t\t(pointing at Scott and Kate)\n\t\tare safer in here with us than\n\t\twandering around a Mexican border town\n\t\tall night long. Just don't do nothin'\n\t\tstupid and we'll all get along fine.\n\t\t\t(to Scott)\n\t\tScotty, you sure you don't want a\n\t\tdrink?\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tOkay, I'll have one.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo you won't.\n\n\tSeth pours Scott a shot.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tSorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I\n\t\tdon't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms\n\t\tup, boy.\n\n\tScott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an\n\ton-drinker's tremor.\n\n\tSeth turns to Kate.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tHow about you, cutie pie? Ready for\n\t\tround two?\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tOkay.\n\n\tSeth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and\n\tknocks it back.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\t\t(to Seth)\n\t\tHey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you\n\t\tjust created a monster.\n\n\tJacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhy are you so agitated?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI'm still stewing about that ape\n\t\tlaying hands on me. And that fuckin'\n\t\tbartender sticks a weed up my ass,\n\t\ttoo.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tHe backed down.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tHe's smilin' at us. But behind his\n\t\tsmile, he's sayin', \"Fuck you Jack.\"\n\t\tI hear that loud and clear.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat are you going to do?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(picking up the whiskey bottle)\n\t\tI'm gonna just sit here and drain\n\t\tthis bottle. And when I've drunk the\n\t\tlast drop, if I still feel then, the\n\t\tway I feel now, I'm gonna take this\n\t\tbottle and break it over his melon\n\t\thead.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tBefore we stepped in here, you told\n\t\tall of us to be cool. That means you,\n\t\ttoo.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(tossing it off)\n\t\tI never said do what I do, I said do\n\t\twhat I say.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAre you so much a fucking loser, you\n\t\tcan't tell when you've won?\n\n\tRichard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can\n\tbelieve what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays\n\tdown his drinking glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWhat did you call me?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNothing. I didn't make a statement. I\n\t\tasked a question. Would you like me to\n\t\task it again? Very well. Are you such\n\t\ta loser you can't tell when you've\n\t\twon?\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tThe entire state of Texas, along with\n\t\tthe FBI, is looking for you. Did they\n\t\tfind you? No. They couldn't. They had\n\t\tevery entrance to the border covered.\n\t\tThere's no way you could get across.\n\t\tDid you? Yes, you did. You've won,\n\t\tSeth, enjoy it.\n\n\tSeth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tJacob, I want you to have a drink with\n\t\tme. I insist.\n\n\tJacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze\n\tin Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tTo your family.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tTo yours.\n\n\tThey both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNow, is your shit together?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tForever together.\n\n\tSeth turns to Scott.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tIn that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take\n\t\tit that's yours.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tYeah, it's mine.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tGo out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  CUT TO:\n\n\tSeth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican\n\tsongs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered\n\taround their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the\n\tsong. Everybody applauds.\n\n\tRazor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone\n\tthat he uses to announce dancers.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\t\t(announcer voice in Spanish)\n\t\tAnd now for your viewing pleasure. The\n\t\tMistress of the Macabre. The Epitome\n\t\tof Evil. The most sinister woman to\n\t\tdance on the face of the earth. Lowly\n\t\tdogs, get on your knees, bow your\n\t\theads and worship at the feet of\n\t\tSANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!\n\n\tThe lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening\n\tnotes of the Coaster's \"Down in Mexico\" fills the room.\n\n\tThe crowd hushes up.\n\n\tAnd on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.\n\n\tThis Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that\n\tStendhal described in \"As the Promise of Happiness,\" but\n\tthe beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.\n\n\tShe dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the\n\tstage, but like she owned the world.\n\n\tAnd if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the\n\tworld is proud to be her possession.\n\n\tAll activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the\n\tFuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially\n\tRichard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and\n\taccompanies from the table with the guitar.\n\n\tWhen the music builds to its explosive section.\n\n\tSantanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the\n\troom.\n\n\tShe does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with\n\tthe beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up\n\tlooking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie\n\tand points at Seth's table, describing what happened.\n\n\tAs the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up\n\tfrom the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.\n\n\tRichard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.\n\n\tSantanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.\n\tShe STANDS OVER him.\n\n\tWhile moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky\n\tbottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.\n\n\tShe lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her\n\ttoes, and sticks it in Richard's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tSANTANICO\n\t\t\t(to Richard in Spanish)\n\t\tDrink up.\n\n\tRichie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The\n\tCROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she\n\tsurveys.\n\n\tJacob and Scott are embarrassed.\n\n\tKate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power\n\tthis woman has over a man she's deathly feared.\n\n\tSeth laughs out loud a Mexican \"yi yi yiii\" laugh, keeping\n\tthe beat with his guitar.\n\n\tAcross the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions\n\tover Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what\n\tSeth and company did to Chet.\n\n\tRichard continues to suck her toes.\n\n\tThe song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's\n\tmouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks\n\tdown at the seated Richard.\n\n\tShe GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His\n\tmouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE\n\tOVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey\n\tfrom her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd\n\tapplauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob\n\tand Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,\n\tnone louder than Seth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tBravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what\n\t\tI call a fuckin' show!\n\n\tOne of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,\n\twhich she puts on.\n\n\tRichard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(snapping his fingers)\n\t\tEarth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask\n\t\tyour new friend to join us?\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWell, then ask her, dumb ass.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\t\t(looking up at Santanico)\n\t\tPor favor, Senorita. Would you care to\n\t\tjoin us?\n\n\t\t\t\tSANTANICO\n\t\t\t(to Richard)\n\t\tMuy bien, gracias.\n\n\tSantanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tRichie, you lucky bastard!\n\t\t\t(to Santanico)\n\t\tNow, little lady, you could of just as\n\t\teasily done that to me. Who a Nelly!\n\t\tYou got my dick harder 'n Chinese\n\t\tarithmetic.\n\n\tThe table laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWhich reminds me of a joke. Little Red\n\t\tRiding Hood is walking through the\n\t\tforest and she comes across Little Bo\n\t\tPeep, and Little Bo Peep says:\n\t\t\"Little Red Riding Hood, are you\n\t\tcrazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf\n\t\tis walking these woods and if he finds\n\t\tyou he's gonna pull down your dress\n\t\tand squeeze your titties?\" Then Little\n\t\tRed Riding Hood hitches up her skirt\n\t\tand taps a .357 Magnum she has\n\t\tholstered on her thigh and says: \"No\n\t\the won't.\"\n\n\tAs Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big\n\tEmilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(to himself)\n\t\tOh, shit.\n\t\t\t(to Seth)\n\t\tSeth --\n\n\tSeth waves him away.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tNot now. So finally she comes across\n\t\tthe Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad\n\t\tWolf's laughing and says: \"Little Red\n\t\tRiding Hood, you know better than to\n\t\tbe walking around these woods alone.\n\t\tYou know I'm just gonna have to pull\n\t\tdown your dress and squeeze your\n\t\ttitties.\" Then Little Red Riding Hood\n\t\twhips out her .357, cocks it, sticks\n\t\tit in the Big Bad Wolf's face and\n\t\tsays: \"No you won't. You're gonna eat\n\t\tme, just like the story says.\"\n\n\tSeth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,\n\tKate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say\n\tanything --\n\n\tThe Titty Twister trio stand over the table.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAZOR CHARLIE\n\t\t\t(to Chet in Spanish)\n\t\tWhich one?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\t\t(pointing at Seth)\n\t\tThis piece of shit broke my finger\n\t\tand my nose...\n\t\t\t(pointing at Richard)\n\t\tthen this fag kicked me in the ribs\n\t\twhile I was down.\n\n\tThat's all Big Emilio has to hear.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG EMILIO\n\t\t\t(to The Gecko Brothers)\n\t\tUp!\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tFuck off, ape man!\n\n\tBig Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by\n\tthe shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from\n\this wounded shoulder.\n\n\tSantanico steps back from the table.\n\n\tSeth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into\n\tBig Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.\n\tRazor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake\n\tand SLASHES Seth across the face.\n\n\tSeth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to\n\this laid open cheek.\n\n\tRichard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,\n\tbrings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.\n\n\tRazor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly\n\tbefore he hits the floor.\n\n\tJacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay\n\tout of gunfire.\n\n\tThe bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what\n\tthey were doing.\n\n\tThe music continues to play, though the dancers stop\n\tdancing.\n\n\tSantanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells\n\tsomething.\n\n\tHer NOSTRILS FLARE.\n\n\tRichard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief\n\tand puts it to his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tHow are you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tScarred for life, that's how I am!\n\n\tSeth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYou thought it was pretty funny,\n\t\tdidn't you?\n\n\tBoth brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...\n\tleft... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards\n\tthe crowd.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tEverybody be cool, or you'll be just\n\t\tas dead as these fucks!\n\n\tSLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.\n\n\tSLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.\n\n\tThe CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the\n\twaitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.\n\n\tSLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls\n\tto the floor, splattering.\n\n\tWE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills\n\ther nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face\n\tcould easily be read as intense sexual desire.\n\n\tCLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR\n\n\tLooks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's\n\ttransformation.\n\n\tHer NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites\n\tof her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from\n\ther mouth. Kate yells from the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tRichie, look out!\n\n\tBefore Richie can turn around.\n\n\tSANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and\n\tSINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.\n\n\tRichard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.\n\n\tSeth turns to his brother's cry.\n\n\tHe sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to\n\ta cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried\n\tdeep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming\n\tabout, trying to knock her off.\n\n\tRichard screams to Seth:\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tShoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!\n\n\tSeth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He\n\tcan't get a clear shot.\n\n\tJacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.\n\n\tRichard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico\n\trides him down to the floor.\n\n\tSeth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the\n\tvamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.\n\n\tRichard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about\n\thalf way before he stops, saying:\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\t\t(with his dying breath)\n\t\tFucking Bitch!\n\n\tHe tumbles over, a corpse.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tRichie.\n\n\tSuddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet\n\tPussy pop open. The \"dead\" men sit up with evil grins on\n\ttheir faces.\n\n\tThe patrons scream.\n\n\tA WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock\n\twith steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar\n\tand yells:\n\n\t\t\t\tWHORE\n\t\tDinner is served!\n\n\tThe bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching\n\tthe impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers\n\tand whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have\n\tturned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping\n\tVAMPIRES.\n\n\tThe vamps attack.\n\n\tWhat follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been\n\tsitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven\n\tnecks.\n\n\tNaked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.\n\tTruckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.\n\tThe patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the\n\tmonsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,\n\tanything.\n\n\tJacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.\n\tThey hide and watch.\n\n\tSeth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,\n\ttoo freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands\n\tmotionless, watching what he can't believe.\n\n\tBehind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,\n\teyes POP OPEN.\n\n\tShe RISES in her snake/dance way.\n\n\tSeth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.\n\n\t\t\t\tSANTANICO\n\t\tLet's see if you taste as good as your\n\t\tbrother.\n\n\tShe approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...\n\tCLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her\n\thair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.\n\n\tSantanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the\n\tJAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the\n\tFLOOR and INTO the WALL.\n\n\tA bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the\n\tside of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a\n\tpool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.\n\n\tBig Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a\n\tswitchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the\n\tbar to the other.\n\n\tThe biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,\n\tgoes head to head with a stripper.\n\n\tThe vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has\n\tclose to superhuman strength, and he's matching the\n\tvamp bitch blow for blow.\n\n\tThen he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head\n\tand BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her\n\ton the wooden leg.\n\n\tFROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie\n\tappears, straight razor in hand.\n\n\tFrost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor\n\tCharlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool\n\tcue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie\n\tUPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.\n\tCharlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of\n\tthe cue in Razor Charlie's heart.\n\n\tGreen blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the\n\tvampire's death scream.\n\n\tSeth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He\n\ttries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his\n\tchest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but\n\tthe pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block\n\tplaced on his chest.\n\n\t\t\t\tSANTANICO\n\t\tI'm not gonna drain you completely.\n\t\tYou're gonna turn for me, You'll be\n\t\tmy slave. You'll live for me. You'll\n\t\teat bugs because I order it. Because\n\t\tI don't think you're worthy of human\n\t\tblood, you'll feed on the blood of\n\t\tstray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.\n\t\tAnd at my command, you'll lick the dog\n\t\tshit from my boot heel. Since you'll\n\t\tbe my dog, your new name will be\n\t\t\"Spot\". Welcome to slavery.\n\n\tSLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing\n\t\t end over end.\n\n\tCLOSE-UP SANTANICO\n\n\tlooking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when\n\tthe bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.\n\n\tWe see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.\n\n\tSantanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is\n\tmomentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.\n\n\tSeth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.\n\n\tSantanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes\n\tthe liquor-soaked robe ignite.\n\n\tSantanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.\n\n\tBig Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG EMILIO\n\t\tNoooooo!\n\n\tHe turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.\n\n\tSeth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they\n\tsee him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to\n\tJacob.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWe may be in trouble.\n\n\tBig Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla\n\twalks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting\n\tvamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp\n\tout Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack\n\thim, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed\n\taside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.\n\n\tBig Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off\n\tSeth and Jacob.\n\n\tSeth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a\n\tweapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.\n\n\tBig Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their\n\twood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him\n\tlook like a huge walking shark.\n\n\tJust when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n\t\tHey, you, monkey man!\n\n\tBig Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tAnything you gotta say to them, say\n\t\tto me first.\n\n\tBoth Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He\n\teffortlessly knocks them away.\n\n\tThey both hit the ground.\n\n\tSex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to \"come\n\tahead.\"\n\n\tBig Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway\n\tlocomotive.\n\n\tSex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two\n\thuge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the\n\tGargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one\n\tbuckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,\n\twho HITS the floor.\n\n\tOnce on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,\n\tBEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The\n\tvamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the\n\tsavage beating.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tThat's enough.\n\n\tJacob and Seth stop.\n\n\tSex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the\n\tend tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into\n\tbig vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and\n\tdies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead\n\tvamp.\n\n\tChet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He\n\tbreaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from\n\taround his mouth.\n\n\tKate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears\n\tover the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to\n\tprotect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his\n\ttrouble. Chet dives at Kate.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tYou know what everybody says about me?\n\t\tI suck!\n\n\tChet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees\n\ther crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of\n\this head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips\n\toff her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening\n\this mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll\n\tup back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.\n\n\tGULP.\n\n\tChet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard\n\tmoving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his\n\tmouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He\n\tjumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.\n\tHe jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming\n\tall the while.\n\n\tKate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on\n\ttheir faces.\n\n\tChet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top\n\tof his lungs like a vamp King Lear.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tI-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!\n\n\tChet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tStop the pain, stop the pain, stop the\n\t\tpain, stop the pain, stop the pain...\n\n\tHe plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the\n\tvampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being\n\tstaked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.\n\n\tBy this time there are not too many people left. Most of the\n\tvampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the\n\tcustomers have been butchered or drained.\n\n\tAll that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers\n\tand two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his\n\tkids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who\n\tare hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding\n\twooden stakes.\n\n\tThe four human men group together. The four female vampires\n\tcharge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.\n\tSeth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and\n\tslam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four\n\tstaked bodies hit the floor.\n\n\tKate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's\n\tside.\n\n\tThey all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has\n\ttaken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.\n\n\t\t\t\tFROST\n\t\tAin't they supposed to burn up or\n\t\tsomething?\n\n\tAt that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating\n\teveryone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills\n\tthe air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense\n\tlight, which lasts only a split second.\n\n\tIt vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All\n\tthat remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies\n\tonce lay.\n\n\tThey all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN\n\tfor the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's\n\tuseless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.\n\n\tExcept for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over\n\tto his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.\n\n\tHe takes his dead hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tRichie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.\n\t\tYou'd really like it in El Ray. We'd\n\t\tfind peace there. I love you little\n\t\tbrother, I'll miss ya bad.\n\n\tSeth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES\n\tPOP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tI'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I\n\t\tlove you, too.\n\n\tRichard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him\n\tdown to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.\n\tHe SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down\n\tto striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big\n\tbite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him\n\tfrom Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have\n\tsurrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his\n\thead. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a\n\twall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to\n\twhere the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the\n\twood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth\n\twhips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tTouch my brother with that stake,\n\t\tbiker, and vampires won't need to\n\t\tsuck your blood, they'll be able to\n\t\tlick it up off the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tHe ain't your brother no more.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tThat's a matter of opinion, and I\n\t\tdon't give a fuck about your's.\n\n\tJacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to\n\tthe ground.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tDon't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!\n\n\tSeth aims his gun at the group.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tShut up!\n\n\tRichard's giggling.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICHARD\n\t\tYeah, shut up.\n\n\tSeth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake\n\tout of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tHold him down.\n\n\tThe smile evaporates from Richard's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tRichie, here's the peace in death I\n\t\tcould never give you in life.\n\n\tSeth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of\n\this .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's\n\theart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the\n\tbody as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.\n\tSeth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.\n\tHe grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,\n\tof all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at\n\tthe bar.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tAre you okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tPeachy! Why shouldn't I be? The\n\t\tworld's my oyster, except for the\n\t\tfact that I just rammed a wooden\n\t\tstake in my brother's heart because\n\t\the turned into a vampire, even\n\t\tthough I don't believe in vampires.\n\t\tAside from that unfortunate business,\n\t\teverything's hunky-dory.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tI'm really sorry.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tBullshit! You hate us. If you had half\n\t\ta chance you'd feed us to them!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThen why didn't I?\n\n\tJacob walks over to Seth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI saved your life. I didn't have to,\n\t\tbut I did. And I'm sorry you lost your\n\t\tbrother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm\n\t\tsorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're\n\t\tgonna get out of this we need each\n\t\tother. And we need you sober and\n\t\tthinking, not drunk and...\n\n\tAs Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has\n\tgrown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to\n\tidentify it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat the hell is that?\n\n\t\t\t\tFROST\n\t\tAt first I just thought it was birds.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tNo, it's more of a gnawing sound.\n\t\tBirds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats\n\t\tgnaw.\n\n\tSeth puts the bottle in his hand down.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tIt's bats.\n\n\n\tEXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT\n\n\tThe outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with\n\thats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get\n\tinside.\n\n\n\tINT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT\n\n\tEverybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all\n\talong the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's\n\tscared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to\n\tdo next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little\n\tclaws poke their way through.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGive me a hand!\n\n\tJacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area\n\tthe bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other\n\titems to help secure and barricade the door.\n\n\tAs the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and\n\tthe windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops\n\topen his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious\n\tactivity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new\n\tfriend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's\n\tputting a board into place. He springs to his feet and\n\tPOUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the\n\troom in her direction.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tWatch out, girly!\n\n\tThe biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a\n\tscream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but\n\tshe's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The\n\tothers hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,\n\tBig Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.\n\tAs the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out\n\tof Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the\n\tvamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her\n\tand spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and\n\tSWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking\n\tthe bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the\n\tvamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one\n\tof the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's\n\theart. He dies and bursts into flames.\n\n\tAt that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting\n\tposition. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the\n\tground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\t\t(mumbling to himself)\n\t\tGoddamn fuckin' vampires.\n\n\tThe biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire\n\tHunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their\n\tfeet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into\n\tflames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,\n\tSMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for\n\ta loop.\n\n\tAs CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS\n\ton his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a\n\tstack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate\n\tby the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is\n\tlying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine\n\traises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the\n\tvamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,\n\twhich hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tFire!\n\n\tFrost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tFROST\n\t\t\t(to Sex Machine)\n\t\tWe'll put this out. You stake the rest\n\t\tof these fuckers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tWay ahead of ya.\n\t\t\t(to Kate)\n\t\tWhat's your name, girly?\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tKate, what's yours?\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tSex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.\n\t\tKate, let's stake these blood-sucker\n\t\tfuckers.\n\n\tKate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to\n\twork STAKING the dead bodies.\n\n\tJacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and\n\twhatever else is at hand.\n\n\tA hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered\n\tover. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands\n\tin front of the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tWe got a problem!\n\n\tSeth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's\n\tdirection. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS\n\ta little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is\n\tSQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its\n\tbody through the newly formed hole.\n\n\tSeth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,\n\tpoint-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.\n\n\tThe bat/rat sees this, makes an \"oh shit\" face, and YANKS\n\this head back through the hole.\n\n\tSeth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,\n\twhen...\n\n\tWHAM !\n\n\tThe bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a\n\tcannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,\n\tLANDING HARD on his back.\n\n\tOnce Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body\n\tof a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split\n\tRUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the\n\tbat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has\n\tits CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just\n\tinches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tGet this bastard off of me!\n\n\tFrost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and\n\tGRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.\n\n\tSex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their\n\tpreventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a\n\tdead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The\n\tbody SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood\n\tsquirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake\n\tdown in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.\n\tSex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of\n\this shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him\n\tget bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.\n\n\tFrost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in\n\tfront of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a\n\twhile, then...\n\n\tBASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some\n\tfight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head\n\tagainst the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the\n\tbat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a\n\tcup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's\n\theart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of\n\tFLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.\n\n\tSex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered\n\twindow with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with\n\tthe bat-thing.\n\n\tJacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,\n\texhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue\n\tto try and claw their way in.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIs everybody okay?\n\n\tEveryone mutters \"yeah.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOkay, does anybody here know what's\n\t\tgoing on?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYeah, I know what's going on. We got\n\t\ta bunch of fuckin' vampires outside\n\t\ttrying to get inside and suck our\n\t\tfuckin' blood! That's it, plain and\n\t\tsimple. And I don't wanna hear any\n\t\tbullshit about \"I don't believe in\n\t\tvampires\" because I don't fuckin'\n\t\tbelieve in vampires either. But I do\n\t\tbelieve in my own two fuckin' eyes,\n\t\tand with my two eyes I saw fuckin'\n\t\tvampires! Now, does everybody agree\n\t\twe're dealin' with vampires.\n\n\tEverybody agrees.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYou too, preacher?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm like you. I don't believe in\n\t\tvampires, but I believe in what I saw.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tGood for you. Now, since we all\n\t\tbelieve we're dealing with vampires,\n\t\twhat do we know about vampires?\n\t\tCrosses hurt vampires. Do you have a\n\t\tcross?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIn the Winnebago.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tIn other words, no.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tWhat are you talking about? We got\n\t\tcrosses all over the place. All you\n\t\tgotta do is put two sticks together\n\t\tand you got a cross.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tHe's right. Peter Cushing does that\n\t\tall the time.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI don't know about that. In order for\n\t\tit to have any power, I think it's\n\t\tgotta be an official crucifix.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's an official cross? Some piece\n\t\tof tin made in Taiwan? What makes that\n\t\tofficial? If a cross works against\n\t\tvampires, it's not the cross itself,\n\t\tit's what the cross represents. The\n\t\tcross is a symbol of holiness.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tOkay, I'll buy that.

But these vamps got soft\n\t\tbodies. The texture of their skin is\n\t\tsofter, mushier. You can push shit\n\t\tright through 'em. Conceivably, if\n\t\tyou hit one hard enough, you could\n\t\ttake their fuckin' head off.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tYou could take their head off.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tActually, our best weapon against\n\t\tthese satanic cocksuckers is this man.\n\t\t\t(he points at Jacob)\n\t\tHe's a preacher.\n\n\tFrost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tAs far as God's concerned, we might\n\t\tjust as well be a piece of fuckin'\n\t\tshit. But he's one of the boys.

We need you. A\n\t\tfaithless preacher doesn't mean shit\n\t\tto us. But a man who's a servant of\n\t\tGod can grab a cross, shove it in\n\t\tthese monsters' asses. A servant of\n\t\tGod can bless the tap water and turn\n\t\tit into a weapon.\n\n\tSeth rises.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI know why you lost your faith. How\n\t\tcould true holiness exist if your wife\n\t\tcan be taken away from you and your\n\t\tchildren? Now, I always said God can\n\t\tkiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed\n\t\tmy lifetime tune about thirty minutes\n\t\tago' cause I know, without a doubt,\n\t\twhat's out there trying to get in\n\t\there is pure evil straight from hell.\n\t\tAnd if there is a hell, and those\n\t\tmonsters are from it, there's got to\n\t\tbe a heaven. Now which are you, a\n\t\tfaithless preacher or a mean,\n\t\tmother fuckin' servant of God?\n\n\tJacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob\n\tsticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tI'm a mean, mother fucking servant of\n\t\tGod.\n\n\tThe laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only\n\tsound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.\n\tIt immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit\n\tthey're in.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tI don't know if I can take two hours\n\t\tof that noise.\n\n\t\t\t\tFROST\n\t\tYou can. You'll take it 'cause ya got\n\t\tno choice.

They\n\t\tthought they killed everybody, and\n\t\texcept for me, they were right. But it\n\t\twasn't for lack of trying. A grenade\n\t\tblew up right next to me, that's why\n\t\tI'm so pretty.\n\n\tThey thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all\n\tthe bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing\n\tpossum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,\n\tlistening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after\n\thour...\n\n\tAs Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and\n\tthe camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He\n\tcan't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he\n\tdoesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE\n\tsay:\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\tThirst.\n\n\t\"Who the fuck was that?\" he thinks to himself. He turns\n\taround: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to\n\thear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\tThirst.\n\n\tWe hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE (V.O.)\n\t\tStop fucking saying that!\n\n\t\t\t\tTWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)\n\t\tThirst!\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE (V.O.)\n\t\tThat bite weren't nothin'. It just\n\t\thurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's\n\t\tall. It barely punched the skin.\n\n\tSex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The\n\tbiker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing\n\tall the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are\n\tmany voices, male, female, children saying:\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICES (V.O.)\n\t\tThirst... Thirst... Thirst...\n\n\tSex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group\n\tin a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer\n\tand closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck\n\tactually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine\n\thas turned into a vampire.\n\n\tThe sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.\n\n\t\t\t\tFROST\n\t\t...and then when I came back to my\n\t\tsenses, I realized I had killed the\n\t\tentire V.C. squadron single handedly.\n\t\tMy bayonet had blood and chunks of\n\t\tyellow flesh on it like some cannibal\n\t\tshish kabob. And to this day I don't\n\t\thave the slightest idea how I --\n\n\tSex Machine lets out a hideous cry.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tTHIRST!\n\n\tFrost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES\n\tinto his neck.\n\n\tThe group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.\n\n\tJacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries\n\tpulling.\n\n\tSex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and\n\tSINKS them in Jacob's arm.\n\n\tJacob SCREAMS and lets go.\n\n\tSeth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.\n\n\tSex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the\n\tbar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.\n\n\tFrost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his\n\tbleeding neck.\n\n\t\t\t\tFROST\n\t\tI been bit! He fuckin' bit me!\n\n\tSex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a\n\tsack of potatoes.\n\n\tHe smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a\n\ttable.\n\n\tSex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table\n\tleg. Frost looks at the big vamp.\n\n\t\t\t\tFROST\n\t\t\t(to Sex Machine)\n\t\tYou're dead, mother fucker! You're\n\t\tgonna bite me! You just turned me\n\t\tinto a vampire, asshole!\n\n\t\t\t\tSEX MACHINE\n\t\tWhat are you gonna do about it?\n\n\tFrost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,\n\tstraight at Sex Machine.\n\n\tSex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and\n\tpulls it back, so he can really haul off.\n\n\tFrost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets\n\tloose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the\n\tfloor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face\n\tCOLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so\n\thard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him\n\tthrough the air.\n\n\tSeth sees where Frost is heading and says:\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tOh shit!\n\n\tJacob sees.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGood lord!\n\n\tFrost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow\n\tand CRASHES through it.\n\n\tSex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of\n\tbat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the\n\thand and runs for the backroom.\n\n\tBehind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the\n\tground.\n\n\tTen bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,\n\twho are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the\n\tback room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An\n\tugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the\n\tdoor as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard\n\tas they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,\n\thowls and snaps in fury.\n\n\tSeth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his\n\t.45 in its big mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYou wanna suck something, suck on\n\t\tthis!\n\n\tHe FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over\n\tthe wall.\n\n\tKate yells:\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tWe have to go back for Daddy!\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tDaddy's dead.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tNoooo!\n\n\tShe spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door\n\tand help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up\n\tagainst the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tHe's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was\n\t\ttoo far away. If flinging that door\n\t\tand filling this room with those\n\t\tbat-things would save him, I'd fling\n\t\tit. The only thing it'll do is turn us\n\t\tinto one of them.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tHe needs our help!\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tHe's beyond our help. You saw him get\n\t\tbit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.\n\t\tYou can't help him. I've got no one\n\t\tleft to lose but you. I can't be alone\n\t\tagain. We're sticking together.\n\n\tJust then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.\n\n\n\tINT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tJacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting\n\tappropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at\n\tbay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his\n\trestored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making\n\this way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of\n\tthe bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.\n\n\tThe creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of\n\tholiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,\n\twhirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and\n\tin front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of\n\tgod. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire\n\tstake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible\n\tin a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.\n\tAs he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost\n\tlying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a\n\tcandy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this\n\trepugnant sight trip him up.\n\n\tJacob has backed himself up by the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tOpen the door.\n\n\tThe door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS\n\tshut.\n\n\tJacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his\n\tbloody arm.\n\n\tWhen he releases them, they can't help but notice.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tDid he...?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tYep.\n\n\tSeth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping\n\tover tables and cussing a blue streak.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tFuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'\n\t\tvampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!\n\t\tGoddamn mother fuckin' vampires!\n\n\tSeth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the\n\tcreatures on the other side.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYou all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm\n\t\tgonna fuckin' kill every last one of\n\t\tyou godless pieces of shit!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(to Seth)\n\t\tYou bet your sweet ass you are, and\n\t\tI'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't\n\t\tgot much time.\n\n\tKate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tYou're gonna be okay, aren't you,\n\t\tdaddy?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,\n\t\tI'm already dead.\n\n\tScott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for\n\tdear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the\n\tkids will never have the courage for what they must do.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(to his children)\n\t\tChildren, listen to me. I love you two\n\t\tmore than anybody. And I just want you \n\t\tto know you've made me proud all your\n\t\tlives. But never more so than tonight.\n\t\tAnd I wish we could sit here and cry\n\t\ttill I pass on, but we can't. Because\n\t\tI'm not going to pass on. I'm going to\n\t\tturn into a monster. And when I do,\n\t\tI'm going to be dangerous. But before\n\t\tthat happens, just know I love you.\n\t\t\t(to Seth and the kids)\n\t\tNow, I'd say in the next twenty or\n\t\tthirty minutes our friends outside\n\t\twill bust in this door. And I'll\n\t\tprobably turn into a vampire within\n\t\tthe hour. Now, you have two choices.\n\t\tYou can wait for me to turn, then deal\n\t\twith me, then wait for them to burst\n\t\tinside here and the three of you will\n\t\tdeal with them. Or, we can kick open\n\t\tthat door and the four of us can hit\n\t\t'em with everything we have, and carve\n\t\ta path right through 'em to front\n\t\tentrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,\n\t\twe gotta go at 'em now. I confused\n\t\tthem, I scared them, I took them off\n\t\tguard. But they're going to get\n\t\tunconfused, they're going to get\n\t\tunscared, they're going to get\n\t\ttogether and they're going to hit that\n\t\tdoor like a ton of bricks. And when\n\t\tthat moment arrives, we gotta be\n\t\tready.\n\n\tJacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled\n\twith boxes and crates.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhat's this stuff?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tMy guess is that this little dive's\n\t\tbeen feeding on nomad road waifs like\n\t\tbikers and truckers for a longtime.\n\t\tThis is probably some of the\n\t\tshipments they stole off the trucks.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWell, I say lets tear this place apart\n\t\tfor weapons. So when they burst\n\t\tthrough that door, we'll make 'em wish\n\t\tthey never did.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI don't give a shit about living or\n\t\tdying anymore. I just want to send as\n\t\tmany of these devils back to hell as\n\t\tI can.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tAmen.\n\n\tMONTAGE\n\n\tThe survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A\n\tlot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,\n\tteddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the\n\tdoctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield\n\ta shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores\n\tare a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of\n\tballoons. And captured en route to a hardware store are\n\tshipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.\n\n\tSeth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.\n\n\tKate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the\n\tbackroom sink.\n\n\tJacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet\n\tin the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.\n\n\tVampires all start converging on the back room door,\n\tgetting their courage back.\n\n\tKate makes water balloons.\n\n\tScott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth\n\tattaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.\n\n\tJacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,\n\tturning it into holy water.\n\n\tOur heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.\n\tThe back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,\n\tbegins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.\n\tThe room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,\n\tpounding, squeaking and screaming.\n\n\tFinally they're ready.\n\n\tJacob turns to his kids.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tBefore we go any further, I need you\n\t\tthree to promise me something. I'll\n\t\tfight with you to the bitter end,\n\t\tbut when I turn into one of them, I\n\t\twon't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a\n\t\tlap dog of Satan. I want you three to\n\t\tpromise you'll take me down, no\n\t\tdifferent from the rest.\n\n\tThe kids can't say the words.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI promise.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tKate, Scott?\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tI promise.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tScott?\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tYeah, I promise.\n\n\tJacob doesn't believe them.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tWhy don't I believe you?\n\t\t\t(he picks up the .45)\n\t\tI'm gonna ask you two again, then I\n\t\twant you to swear to God that you'll\n\t\tkill me. If you don't, I'm gonna\n\t\tjust kill myself right now. Now,\n\t\tsince you need me I think you better\n\t\tswear. Kate, do you swear to God\n\t\tthat when I turn into one of the\n\t\tundead, you'll kill me?\n\n\tKate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his\n\ttemple.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tKate, we don't have all day, so I'm\n\t\tonly gonna count to five. One...two...\n\t\tthree... four...\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tOkay, okay, I promise I'll do it!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNot good enough, swear to God.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tI swear to God, our father, that when\n\t\tyou change into one of the undead, I\n\t\twill kill you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tGood girl. Now, Scott, we have even\n\t\tless time, so I'm only giving you the\n\t\tcount of three. One...\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tYou don't believe in suicide.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tIt's not suicide if you're already\n\t\tdead. Two...\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tOkay, I'll kill you when you change,\n\t\tI swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tThank you, son.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tOkay, vampire killers, let's kill some\n\t\tfuckin' vampires.\n\n\n\tINT. BARROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tThe vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING\n\tdown the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through\n\tthe door.\n\n\tWaiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns\n\tand water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like\n\tgrenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden\n\tstakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding\n\tthe jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room\n\tinto the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.\n\n\tWhat we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la \"The Wild\n\tBunch.\" A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just\n\twatch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,\n\tlike the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by\n\tstarting up the jackhammer.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tKill 'em all!\n\n\tJacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.\n\n\tThe kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire\n\tflesh.\n\n\tThe pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk\n\tforward.\n\n\tThey are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards\n\tthe door.\n\n\tSeth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds\n\tin and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in\n\tgreen vamp blood.\n\n\tJacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand\n\tand SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the\n\tother.\n\n\tFlame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.\n\n\tKate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and\n\ttoss them into the crowd.\n\n\tThey burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming\n\tin pain.\n\n\tFrom its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and\n\tHURLS toward the group.\n\n\tJacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.\n\n\tThe bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.\n\n\tSeth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming\n\tthe hammer stake into vampire chests.\n\n\tThe front door is barricaded again by a big table and other\n\tjunk.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tWhy did they block the door again?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tTo keep the daylight out! This is\n\t\twhere they sleep! Get to the door!\n\n\tSeth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a\n\thalf bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from\n\tabove in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The\n\tSex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth\n\toff the ground.\n\n\tSeth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,\n\the CRASHES into a table.\n\n\tThe Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer\n\tsticking out of his chest, dead.\n\n\tKate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She\n\tscreams:\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tSeth!\n\n\tSeth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires\n\ton all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tOkay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite\n\t\tand feel all right!\n\n\tKate clusters with her father and Scott.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tI'm going for 'em!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACOB\n\t\tNo!\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tEverybody goes home!\n\n\tKate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,\n\tone-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in\n\tSeth's direction.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tDie, monster, die! Die, monster, die!\n\n\tKate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,\n\tburning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a\n\tcouple of water balloons and a stake.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t\t(to Seth)\n\t\tWatch my back!\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tAnytime.\n\n\tCutting through vampires, the two make their way across the\n\tbar.\n\n\tJacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in\n\tfiery death.\n\n\tScott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.\n\n\tAs Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He\n\tcan't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts\n\tto hear the words: \"Thirst, thirst, thirst.\" He notices the\n\tvampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit\n\thappy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.\n\tHis eyes are yellow.\n\n\tScott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.\n\n\tJacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and\n\tsinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody\n\tmurder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.\n\n\tScott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and\n\tSMASHES it against Jacob's head.\n\n\tThe holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go\n\tof Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.\n\n\tScott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it\n\tup to fire.\n\n\tA totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares\n\twith the boy he once called his son.\n\n\tScott's eyes turn to steel.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tI swear to God, in Jesus Christ's\n\t\tname.\n\n\tHe FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,\n\tcreating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire\n\thead bursts into flames, then explodes.\n\n\tFrom across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She\n\tcries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tFight now, cry later.\n\n\tKate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face\n\twith a holy water balloon, which melts his head.\n\n\tA bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as\n\tit bites into him. He drops the .45.\n\n\tKate sees Scott get bit.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tOh my god.\n\n\tAnother bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.\n\tScott screams.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tYou bastards!\n\n\tShe goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.\n\n\tNow seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.\n\tScott is in agony.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTT\n\t\tKill me, Kate! \n\n\tKate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming\n\tup by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three\n\ttimes.\n\n\tOne... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then\n\tall of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.\n\n\tThe remaining vamps approach.\n\n\tAll the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy\n\tballoon.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tHow many bullets left, kid?\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tNot many.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWell, when you run out of weapons,\n\t\tjust start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em\n\t\tsing for their supper.\n\n\tThe two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat\n\tthings do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth\n\tthrows the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two\n\tbat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.\n\n\tThe two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before\n\tthem. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands\n\tholding the .45, arm outstretched.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\t\t(to Seth)\n\t\tShould I use the last bullets on us?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYou use 'em on the first couple of\n\t\tthese parasites that try to bite you.\n\n\tThe vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights\n\ton the face of an approaching vampire.\n\n\tSeth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first\n\tvampire's head that gets in swinging distance.\n\n\tBeams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot\n\tthrough the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched\n\tvamps scream like they've never screamed before.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tShoot more holes!\n\n\tKate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall\n\tbehind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and\n\tSeth with a safe, lighted area.\n\n\tThe .45's empty.\n\n\tThe vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being\n\table to get at them.\n\n\tThe two survivors hold hands, when...\n\n\tAll of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on\n\tfrom the outside.\n\n\tThe vamps look towards it in horror.\n\n\tFrom the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a\n\tSpanish accent.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(in Spanish)\n\t\tI'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in\n\t\tthere?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tCarlos!\n\t\t\t(in Spanish)\n\t\tHelp us, bash the door. Bash the door\n\t\tin!\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(in Spanish)\n\t\tDanny, Manny, knock down the door.\n\t\tHurry, hurry!\n\n\tThe vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly\n\taround the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto\n\teach other.\n\n\tThe front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from\n\tthe outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the\n\tdoor.\n\n\tThe table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.\n\n\tThe door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps\n\tare instantly fried, bursting into flames.\n\n\tThe Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and\n\tMANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves\n\tin fright.\n\n\tVampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight\n\thits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending\n\thundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.\n\tVamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps\n\tcombust in fiery explosions.\n\n\tThe Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.\n\n\tSeth and Kate run through the building and leap through the\n\tdoor into the parking lot.\n\n\n\tEXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING\n\n\tCarlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk\n\tthem away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by\n\tCarlos's Mercedes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\t\t(to Seth)\n\t\tWhat the fuck was going on in there?\n\n\tSeth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his\n\tbreath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the\n\tkisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\t\t(in Spanish)\n\t\tWhatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWhy the fuck, outta all the god\n\t\tforsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you\n\t\thave us rendezvous at that place?\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tI don't know, one place's as good as\n\t\tanother.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tHave you ever been there before?\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tNo, but I passed by it a couple of\n\t\ttimes. It's out in the middle of\n\t\tnowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,\n\t\tso there wouldn't be a lot of police.\n\t\tAnd it's open from dusk till dawn.\n\t\tYou said meet you in the morning.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tWell, because you picked that place\n\t\tout of a hat, my brother's dead now.\n\t\tAnd this girl's family's dead.\n\n\tCarlos stands up again.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tI'm sorry to hear that. What were\n\t\tthey, psychos?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tDid they look like psychos? They\n\t\twere fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't\n\t\texplode when sunlight hits 'em, I\n\t\tdon't care how crazy they are.\n\n\tDanny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing\n\tthemselves again.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tOh, Seth, how can I ever make it up\n\t\tto you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tYou can't, but fifteen percent instead\n\t\tof thirty for my stay at El Ray is a\n\t\tgood start.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tTwenty-eight.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tJesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's\n\t\tdead and he's not coming back, and\n\t\tit's all your fault. Twenty.\n\n\n\tThey look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH AND CARLOS\n\t\t\t(in Spanish)\n\t\tTwenty-five.\n\n\tSeth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over\n\tto a red 1990 Porsche 911.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tYou like the car?\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI said new, this is an '90.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tIt's hardly been used at all. I got it\n\t\tfrom a drug dealer who only drove it 5\n\t\ttimes in as many years. Swear to God.\n\t\tThat's like new.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tSo do I just follow you?\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\tYeah, follow us.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tSo let's do it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARLOS\n\t\t\t(to Danny and Manny)\n\t\tVamanos!\n\n\tCarlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.\n\n\tSeth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.\n\n\tKate stands alone.\n\n\tThe whole desert seems between them.\n\n\tSo much to say ... but no words.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tI'm sorry.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tMe too.\n\n\tLong pause.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tSee ya.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tLater.\n\n\tSeth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate\n\tsays behind him:\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE (O.S.)\n\t\tSeth.\n\n\tSeth turns around.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATE\n\t\tYou want some company?\n\n\tSeth smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tSETH\n\t\tKate honey, I may be a bastard. But\n\t\tI'm not a fuckin' bastard.\n\n\tHe blows her a kiss across the desert.\n\n\tShe blows one back.\n\n\tSeth's in his car and GONE.\n\n\tKate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and\n\tbegins her long walk home.\n\n\tTHEME OF MOVIE BEGINS POUNDING\n\n \tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Quentin Tarantino\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:32.320853"}
