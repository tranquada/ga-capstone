As they drive off, the CAMERA\n               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion\n               in military history.\n\n               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered\n               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles\n               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored\n               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-\n               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers\n               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships\n               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of\n               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some\n               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.\n\n               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny\n               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,\n               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the\n               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day\n               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and\n               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are\n               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned\n               equipment, bodies.\n\n               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine\n               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly\n               take in the view.

One of them reads:  \"Ramelle 16 Km.\" Miller puts\n               away the map.  Checks the horizon.

OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY\n</b>\n               A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,\n               cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone\n               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.\n\n               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the\n               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.\n\n<b>               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD\n</b>\n               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.\n\n<b>                                     MILLER\n</b>                         Scans the Germans with his binoculars.\n\n<b>                                     REIBEN\n</b>                         Looks like tea time, maybe they're\n                         Brits.\n\n<b>                                     UPHAM\n</b>                         I sure hope so.\n\n<b>                                     SARGE\n</b>                         What do you think they're waiting\n                         for, Captain?\n\n               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more\n               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER\n               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know\n               that sound, they don't like it.\n\n<b>               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS\n</b>\n               Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who\n               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,\n               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two\n               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and\n               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.\n               There are four of them.\n\n<b>                                     MILLER\n</b>                         Puts away the binoculars and jerks\n                         his head for his men to follow, low,\n                         along the wall.  The men are happy\n                         to do so, looking back nervously at\n                         the German tanks.\n\n<b>               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY\n</b>\n               The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is\n               a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell\n               casings and bodies, German and American and a few French\n               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons\n               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.\n\n               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging\n               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of\n               the firing.\n\n               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He\n               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the\n               firing.\n\n               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.\n\n<b>               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY\n</b>\n               A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC\n               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near\n               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of\n               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings\n               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.\n               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on\n               both sides of the bridge.\n\n<b>               MILLER AND HIS MEN\n</b>\n               Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the\n               bridge.\n\n<b>                                     REIBEN\n</b>                         Looks like they've been having a\n                         hell of a party, here, Captain.\n\n<b>                                     MILLER\n</b><b>                         ON THE BRIDGE!
