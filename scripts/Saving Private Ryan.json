Trying to block out the fury around them.\n\n               A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT\n\n               A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.\n\n               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT\n\n               The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them.\n               FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into\n               the bow.\n\n               THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS\n\n               BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.

Starts to lose it.\n                         Begins to shudder and weep.  His\n                         name is DeLancey.\n\n               THE BOYS AROUND HIM\n\n               Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects\n               them.  It starts to spread.\n\n                                     A FIGURE\n                         Pushes through the men.  Puts himself\n                         in front of DeLancey.\n\n               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far\n               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,\n               powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a\n               cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's\n               helmet and lights the cigar.\n\n               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw\n               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is\n               terrified.\n\n               Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?\n\n               Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.\n\n               Delancey Oh, Jesus...\n\n               Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your\n               left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for\n               those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're\n               not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage\n               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves\n               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the\n               cheek and moves on to the bow.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL\n                         IN FRONT OF THEM.\n\n               PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND\n\n               It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none\n               of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it\n               belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his\n               eyes back to the objective.\n\n               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH\n\n               The six surviving boats alongside.\n\n               EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE\n\n               From the landing crafts.  Arc toward the top of the cliffs.\n\n               THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN\n\n               A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft.

He\n               swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward\n               Miller.\n\n               A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant\n               from death.\n\n               SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE\n\n               Under the overhang to safety.\n\n               MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL\n               IS BLOWN OFF.\n\n               UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         I'll be Goddamned!

MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.\n               HIT more Germans.\n\n               SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop\n               near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw\n               long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.\n\n               THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.\n\n               Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Crosses the gap.

The Germans\n               are CUT DOWN.\n\n               MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man\n               who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel\n               charges.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Okay, Wade, your turn.\n\n               Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.\n\n               Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to\n               the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.\n               Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED\n               EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.\n\n                                     MILLER AND SARGE\n                         Survey the field.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         What the hell were you doing?

He's clearly affected.\n\n               Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves\n               on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German\n               bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE\n               surround him.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY\n\n               Very busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,\n               quickly and efficiently.  No small talk.\n\n                                     A CLERK\n                         Older than the others, sad-eyed,\n                         adds a sheet of paper to a large\n                         pile in his out-box.\n\n                                     CLOSE SHOT\n                         An outgoing telegram.

Reads.  Finds\n                         something troubling.  Quickly shuffles\n                         through some other papers.  Finds\n                         what he's looking for.  Rises from\n                         his desk and hurries out of the\n                         office.\n\n               INT.

The clerk speaks to a YOUNG\n               LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.\n               He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the\n               office with the clerk on his heels.\n\n               INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY\n\n               Again, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks\n               to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly\n               bothered by what he's being told.  The Captain takes the\n               papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.\n\n               INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY\n\n               A busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The\n               walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex\n               deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of\n               ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly\n               hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff\n               officer, walks in.\n\n               Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know\n               about.\n\n               One-armed colonel Yes?\n\n               Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha\n               Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother\n               was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this\n               morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams\n               this afternoon.\n\n               The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear\n               and freeze.\n\n               One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.\n\n               Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The\n               youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First\n               Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front.\n\n               One-armed colonel Is he alive?\n\n               Young captain We don't know.\n\n               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly\n               to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me.\n\n               The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly\n               to the Captain.\n\n               One-armed colonel Come with me.\n\n               The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his\n               heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go.\n\n               EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY\n\n               A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising\n               behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.\n\n               EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY\n\n               A whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as\n               far as the eye can see.\n\n                                     IN THE YARD\n                         A tire swing.

Her face\n                         shows the lines of a life of hard\n                         work and mother hood.  A good woman.\n\n               She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the\n               fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind\n               the black car.\n\n               She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her\n               house.  She starts to grow uneasy.\n\n               As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She\n               reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.\n\n               The car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out,\n               one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come.\n\n               INT.

Half-\n               a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and\n               the Young Captain, wait.

As they drive off, the CAMERA\n               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion\n               in military history.\n\n               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered\n               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles\n               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored\n               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-\n               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers\n               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships\n               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of\n               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some\n               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.\n\n               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny\n               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,\n               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the\n               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day\n               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and\n               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are\n               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned\n               equipment, bodies.\n\n               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine\n               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly\n               take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in\n               the back of the jeep.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Captain, can I ask you a question?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Sure, Reiben.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Where are you planning on putting\n                         Private Ryan, sir?\n\n               Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                              (continuing)\n                         It's just that it's kind of crowded\n                         back here, I was wondering if you're\n                         expecting to have more room on the\n                         way back?\n\n               Miller points out a turn to Sarge.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Left.\n\n               Sarge makes the turn.  Miller folds up the map and pockets\n               it.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Now we've got a straight shot, due\n                         north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,\n                         two villages between here and there,\n                         St. Mere, then Bernay.

Even if Ryan's\n                         where he's supposed to be, he's more\n                         than likely dead.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         Hell of a mission.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Yep, hell of a mission.\n\n               IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP\n\n               Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring\n               at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful\n               smile.\n\n               Upham Hi.  So, uh, you're all Rangers?\n\n               Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an\n               insect.\n\n               Upham I'm Upham.\n\n               (pointing at his corporal's stripes)\n\n               Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.\n               Their jaws drop.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                              (to Wade)\n                         You want to shoot him, or should I?\n\n               Wade It's not my turn.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                              (politely)\n                         Jackson?\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,\n                         Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.\n\n               Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.\n\n               Upham Miller?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I don't want anybody to shoot him,\n                         that's an order.

Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-\n               faced.\n\n               No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as\n               if it had never happened.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony\n                         of this mission is fucking killing\n                         me.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Yeah, how so?\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         I should be on my way to Caen, sir.\n                         It's like Beethoven, the guy's one\n                         of the greatest composers ever lived\n                         and he goes deaf.

They take off, spraying\n               gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels\n               down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters.\n               They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct\n               hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.\n\n               AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS\n\n               On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of\n               a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham\n               grows weak at the sight.

They are\n               CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.\n\n               As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET\n               SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.\n\n               Miller motions Jackson across first.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Stay low.\n\n               Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,\n               kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and\n               makes it to the cover of the far side.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Dang!  That was close!\n\n               Miller nods to Upham.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Your turn.\n\n               Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him\n               very gently.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Zig-zag, change your pace a couple\n                         times, you'll be alright.\n\n               Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Okay, I'm going to draw fire for\n                         you.\n                              (sternly)\n                         But if I do, you goddamned well better\n                         go.\n\n               Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Looks to Upham\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Ready?\n\n               Upham nods, still terrified.\n\n               MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN\n\n               Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Go.\n\n               Upham runs.\n\n               A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.\n\n               He doesn't budge.\n\n               UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.\n\n               REIBEN watches Upham run.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Hey, that guy can move.\n\n               A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to\n               the far side.\n\n               MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't\n               even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.\n               He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                              (under his breath so\n                              only Miller can hear)\n                         Damn fool.\n                              (beat)\n                         Sir.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Captain, he's fast!\n\n                                     MILLER\n                              (glances at Sarge,\n                              speaks to Reiben)\n                         Glad of it.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         On the other side of the street,\n                         crouches in a doorway with Jackson.\n                         Upham is a bit in shock, less from\n                         the nearness of the bullets than\n                         from what Miller just did for him.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         DASHES across the street.\n\n               GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches\n               behind him.\n\n               HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Bring 'em over.\n\n               UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Captain, I...\n\n               Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         One at a time.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-\n                         runs down the block.  He passes a:\n\n                                     BOMBED OUT BUILDING\n                         Out of the line of fire.  A dozen\n                         dead American soldiers lined up on\n                         the ground.  The battered, bloody\n                         bodies, only partially covered by\n                         ponchos.\n\n               Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.\n               Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Sees the dead and wounded, shows no\n                         reaction.  Runs to:\n\n                                     AN ALLEY\n                         Captain Hamill and his men are bunched\n                         there, out of the line of fire.\n                         He's sending off a squad to continue\n                         their door-to-door.\n\n               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the\n               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.\n\n               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two\n               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak\n               familiarly.\n\n               Captain hamill How was the road in?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         We had a jeep until a few hours ago,\n                         a nice one, it had a cute little\n                         flag with a couple of stars on it.\n\n               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.\n\n               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         We called in a strike on the eighty-\n                         eights that took it out, but it's\n                         the Kraut spotter that counts,\n                         wherever the hell that bastard is.\n\n               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant\n               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.\n\n               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying\n               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying\n               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant\n               steeple.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Jackson.\n\n               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson\n               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and\n               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to\n               his back.\n\n               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and\n               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very\n               unusual, long-barrel, rifle.\n\n               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,\n               along with Upham, watch curiously.\n\n               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,\n               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he\n               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He\n               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham\n               is fascinated.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         What is that?\n\n               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized\n               shell.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel\n                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,\n                         elevated three-glass scope and a\n                         single-throw hammer.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         The Army gave you that?\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Yep.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         You must be a hell a shot.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Not where I come from.\n\n               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and\n               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.\n\n               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the\n               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight\n               and waits, absolutely motionless.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         That must be four thousand yards.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                              (without taking his\n                              eye from the scope)\n                         Forty-two-hundred, I figure.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         You take account of the wind?\n\n               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks\n               back with an expression that clearly says, \"What are you,\n               some kind of fucking idiot?\" Reiben puts himself between\n               Upham and Jackson.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                              (put-on Southern accent)\n                         Dang right, he take 'count of the\n                         wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a\n                         Kentucky windage?\n\n               Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the\n               trigger.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Reiben, how many time I got to tell\n                         you, I'm from Tennessee.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         They got squirrels there, too, right?\n\n               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart\n               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his\n               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them\n               the St. Mere road is open.\n\n               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to\n               Miller.\n\n               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Very far, they're not coming this\n                         way, they're going to take Caen first.\n\n               Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a\n               lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it\n               gets better.  How many men did you bring?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Five, but we not staying, we're on\n                         our way to Ramelle.\n\n               Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private\n               Ryan?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Yeah, you know about that?\n\n               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in\n               with the early wounded or dead.\n\n               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED\n               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.\n\n               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted\n               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two\n               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,\n               they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Wonderful.\n\n               Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the\n               hell out of there before those Krauts show up.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         How do we get out of here?\n\n               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in\n               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If\n               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,\n               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by\n               tomorrow night.\n\n               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his\n               head.\n\n               Captain hamill Tough, huh?

Miller smiles.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                              (continuing)\n                         ...my home town, which shall remain\n                         un-named.\n\n               The men ease back, disappointed.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Any further thoughts on the subject?\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like\n                         to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,\n                         fuck the cheese capital of France\n                         and while we're at it, fuck Private\n                         James Ryan.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I'll make a note of your suggestions\n                         but I'll leave that last one to you,\n                         especially if he's already dead.\n\n               The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets\n               serious.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         We move out in two hours, try and\n                         get some sleep.\n\n               The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all\n               settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to\n               follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange\n               men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow\n               suit.\n\n               Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his\n               flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,\n               he studies his maps while his men rest.\n\n               EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER)\n\n               Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson,\n               Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his\n               flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,\n               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in\n               Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         You ever going to open those letters?\n                         Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Maybe.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         It's not normal, not reading letters\n                         from home.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Since when have things been normal?\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         You got me.

A moment passes between the two of\n               them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at\n               the men.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         You think they'll be alright?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         They're fine.

Let's go.\n\n               Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their\n               gear.\n\n               EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT\n\n               SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY\n               BOOMS.  Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral\n               toward the outskirts of town.  They're just a small squad,\n               but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are\n               very formidable-looking.\n\n               EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT\n\n               Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill\n               and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:\n\n               A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON\n\n               Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The\n               AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the\n               countryside like a tidal wave.\n\n               Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.\n\n               IT'S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE.  The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY\n               is incredible, strange, other-worldly.\n\n               EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.\n\n               Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.\n\n               MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.\n\n               SARGE notices, says nothing.\n\n               MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes\n               go back to the BLAZING SKY.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                              (awe-struck)\n                         Makes you feel small, doesn't it?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         It doesn't take this.\n\n               Upham's face shows more fear than awe.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         I wasn't made for this.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                              (bitterly)\n                         You think the rest of us were?\n\n               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns\n               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a\n               hold of himself and speaks gently.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect\n                         you, this shit's gonna keep him up\n                         all night, anyway.\n\n               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for\n               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Let's go, this ain't what they pay\n                         us for.\n\n               Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points\n               the way.\n\n               Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a\n               gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until\n               you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.\n\n               As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to\n               move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private\n               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up\n               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to\n               Reiben.\n\n               Gentle-faced private Here.\n\n               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-\n               ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's\n               vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.\n\n               Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at\n               Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.\n\n               Reiben takes the ammo.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                              (gently)\n                         Just what I need.\n\n               Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands\n               them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Thanks, but you may need these more\n                         than us, or Ryan.\n\n               Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes\n               the ammo back.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Let's move out.\n\n               Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,\n               lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill\n               and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a\n               strange bit of hope.\n\n               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT\n\n               The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The\n               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way\n               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside\n               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.\n               Sarge How long's your hand been shaking?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         A couple of weeks.  It started in\n                         Portsmouth when they brought us down\n                         for loading.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         Is it getting worse?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         No.  It comes and goes.  It stops\n                         when I look at it.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         You may have to find yourself a new\n                         line of work, this one doesn't seem\n                         to agree with you anymore.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I'll be alright.\n\n               Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk\n               on.\n\n               EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)\n\n               Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at\n               point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge\n               brings up the rear.\n\n               A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate\n               only with hand signals.\n\n               JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.\n\n               MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease\n               into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY\n               MEN appear.\n\n               REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission\n               to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, \"let them\n               go.\" A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the\n               bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of\n               relief and lowers hi B.A.R.\n\n               THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet\n               from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed\n               with fear.  The others are stone-faced.\n\n               THE GERMANS PASS.\n\n               MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.\n\n               UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh\n               of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing\n               the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.\n\n               UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly\n               exposed.  Shitting bricks.\n\n               Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad\n               approaches.\n\n               Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in\n               the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-\n               kneed, amazed that he's still alive.\n\n               MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the\n               rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries\n               after Miller, staying close on his heels.\n\n               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT\n\n               The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,\n               parallel to a cart path.  Wary.\n\n               Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each\n               other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and\n               motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.\n\n               EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT\n\n               Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as\n               Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional\n               signs.  One of them reads:  \"Ramelle 16 Km.\" Miller puts\n               away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn\n               is visible.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         It'll be light, soon.  Let's pick it\n                         up.\n\n               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN\n\n               First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by\n               the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five.\n\n               Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at\n               the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.\n               The war is far away.\n\n               Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together\n               without speaking for a moment.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         It looks like a Renoir.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth\n                         Symphony, The Normandy?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I've been humming it.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         I heard.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         It seemed appropriate.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         You know classical music?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Some.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Where are you from, Captain?\n\n               Miller smiles.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         What's the pool up to?\n\n               Upham smiles, caught.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Over three-hundred.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I'll tell you what, if I'm still\n                         alive when it hits five-hundred,\n                         I'll let you know and we'll split\n                         the money.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         If that's the way you feel, why don't\n                         we wait until it's up to a thousand.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I don't expect to live that long.\n\n               Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Five hundred, then.\n\n               Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to\n               feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself\n               back into a commander and barks at Upham.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Let's go, private.\n\n               Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure\n               him out, then he simply follows him.\n\n               EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN\n\n               The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by\n               war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is\n               lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,\n               hundred of years old.\n\n               Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They\n               advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.\n               An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to\n               this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and\n               a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a\n               draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.\n               A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with\n               empty shell casings around his body.\n\n               Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to\n               Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks\n               gently to him in French.\n\n               The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands\n               and translates.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Five nights ago, he found this\n                         paratrooper caught in a tree with a\n                         broken leg.  The leg got infected.\n                         Last night he went to Ville Cholet\n                         to get a doctor.  The doctor refused\n                         to come and when he got back, this\n                         is what he found.  The Krauts must\n                         have shown up while he was gone.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Did he see any sign of them?\n\n               Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         No, but he heard firing, just east,\n                         less that a kilometer.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Thank him and tell him we're sorry\n                         about his loss.\n\n               Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.\n               Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.\n\n               Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his\n               hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.\n\n               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY\n\n               A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last\n               of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.\n\n               The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the\n               edge of the field.\n\n               Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches\n               and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.\n\n               Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to\n               some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with\n               bullets.\n\n               Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.\n\n                                     WADE\n                         Captain.\n\n               Staying low, they join Wade who has found:\n\n               TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS\n\n               A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.\n\n               MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON\n\n               Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow.  The\n               others crawl up behind them.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Where?\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         In the shadow by those two trees.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         My guess, too.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         A machine gun.\n\n               Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover\n               of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Sir, I've got an idea, let's go\n                         around.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         We can't leave it here.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         We left them eighty-eights.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         They don't send planes to put out\n                         machine guns.\n                              (beat)\n                         Two flank runners with surpressing\n                         fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes\n                         left has to be fast.\n\n               Upham steels himself and steps forward.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         He's fast, Captain, I saw him.\n\n               Miller takes Upham's measure.

Upham is\n               impressed.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         Twenty-two flat?\n\n               Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.\n\n                                     WADE\n                         I would have won the states if some\n                         bastard hadn't tripped me in the\n                         finals.\n\n               Miller points the others to their firing positions.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Sarge, Upham, here.

Then:\n\n               A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.

Motionless.  He gently\n                         closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers\n                         slightly as he unclips one of Wades\n                         dogtags.

NARROW GULLY - DAY\n\n               Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good\n               hiding place.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Rest.  One hour.  Jackson, Reiben,\n                         perimeter.  Keep your eyes open.\n                         I'm going to re-con.\n\n               Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but\n               there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.\n               He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.\n\n               EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY\n\n               Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The\n               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,\n               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for\n               faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,\n               as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,\n               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller\n               senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a\n               thousand miles away.

Have I ever\n                         told you about her?\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         Bits and pieces.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         She's the best poker player you ever\n                         saw.  My father used to go to these\n                         Saturday night games and lose his\n                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him\n                         an ultimatum, either she gets a\n                         regular seat at the table or she\n                         locks him in every Saturday night.\n                         He squawked and so did his buddies\n                         but after a while they gave in and\n                         from the first night she sat down,\n                         she never lost.  She could read those\n                         cocky bastards like they were playing\n                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had\n                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her\n                         eyes, the tone of her voice, her\n                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped\n                         her coffee, she was a master.  She\n                         won more money on shit hands than\n                         anyone in the history of the game.\n                         Every Saturday night, my father would\n                         lose two, three hundred bucks and\n                         she'd win it all back and then some.\n                         And I'd stand there, glued to her\n                         shoulder, from the time I was five\n                         years old, watching every hand, every\n                         move, studying how she did it.\n                              (beat)\n                         That's why I'm such a good officer,\n                         I can look at a man's face and tell\n                         you exactly what he's holding, and\n                         if it's a shit hand, I know just\n                         what cards to deal him.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         And what about your own hand?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less?\n                         So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear\n                         me apart when I'd get one of my men\n                         killed, but what was I supposed to\n                         do?  Break down in front of the ones\n                         who were standing there waiting for\n                         me to tell them what to do?  Of course\n                         not, so I bluffed, and after a while,\n                         I started to fall for my own bluff.\n                         It was great, it made everything so\n                         much easier.  Sarge Is that why your\n                         hand's been shaking?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         It could be worse.  You know the\n                         first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?\n                         Lie to your men.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         Oh, yeah?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Not in so many words, but they tell\n                         you you can have all the firepower\n                         in the world and if your men don't\n                         have good morale, it's not worth a\n                         damn.  So if you're scared or empty\n                         or half-a-step from a Section Eight,\n                         do you tell your men?  Of course\n                         not.

Every time you\n                         kill one of your men, you tell\n                         yourself you just saved the lives of\n                         two, three, ten, a hundred others.\n                         We lost, what, thirty-one on the\n                         cliffs?

A thousand.\n                         Then thousand.  Any number you want.\n                         See?  It's simple.  It lets you always\n                         choose mission over men.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         Except this time, the mission IS a\n                         man.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's\n                         Ryan?  If they're both standing in\n                         front of me and I have to shoot one\n                         or the other, how do I choose?  Look\n                         at my hand, there it goes again.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         John, I've got to tell you, I think\n                         you're about used up.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I think you're right, Keith.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         You want me to take over?\n\n               The question helps Miller pull himself back together.

Knowing you,\n                         you don't let him carry my gear,\n                         even though he really should, and we\n                         all get killed, trying to keep him\n                         alive.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Except for the last part, that one's\n                         not bad.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown\n                         up by the German equivalent of Wade,\n                         whose name I know you don't want me\n                         to mention.  There's nothing to find.\n                         The biggest piece is the size of a\n                         pea.  We wander around, looking for\n                         him until the Germans pick us off,\n                         one after another.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I don't like that one.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is\n                         the worst one, we find Ryan and he's\n                         wounded.  Not only does he not carry\n                         my gear, we have to carry his gear.\n                         And him.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         But we accomplish the mission.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Maybe.  But what if he dies on the\n                         way back?  you see what I'm saying,\n                         sir?  The best possible situation\n                         is, he's dead, we find his body,\n                         more or less intact, we grab one of\n                         his dog-tags and high-tail it back\n                         to the beach, or better yet, we head\n                         over to Caen and catch up with\n                         division.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Has anyone ever told you, you're\n                         officer material?\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         No, sir.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         That's a mystery to me.\n\n               No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.\n\n               EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY\n\n               The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush\n               near the crossroads.  A sign reads:  \"Ramelle 3 Km.\"  Miller\n               folds up the map.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         Looks like we're going to beat those\n                         Kraut companies to Ramelle.\n\n               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something\n               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they\n               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I don't think so.\n\n               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY\n\n               THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop\n               trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack\n               Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a\n               bridge.\n\n               CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL\n\n               Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.\n               Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.\n\n                                     GERMAN FLANK SQUADS\n                         Hurry along the fields on either\n                         side of the road, trying to keep up\n                         with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS\n                         MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching\n                         German Flank Squad.  They flatten\n                         themselves into the mucky water.\n                         Ready their weapons.  Prepare to\n                         fire.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN SQUAD\n                         Approaches the bridge.\n\n               PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES\n\n               See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Is just about to open up on them.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN SERGEANT\n                         Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind\n                         and CALLS to them.\n\n                                     THE GERMAN PRIVATES\n                         Obey.  Hurry after the rest of the\n                         convoy.\n\n                                     IN THE CULVERT\n                         The Americans breathe again.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         I wonder where they're going.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Same place we are.\n\n               Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast\n               is clear.  They head out.\n\n               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY\n\n               A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,\n               cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone\n               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.\n\n               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the\n               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.\n\n               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD\n\n               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Scans the Germans with his binoculars.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Looks like tea time, maybe they're\n                         Brits.\n\n                                     UPHAM\n                         I sure hope so.\n\n                                     SARGE\n                         What do you think they're waiting\n                         for, Captain?\n\n               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more\n               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER\n               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know\n               that sound, they don't like it.\n\n               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS\n\n               Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who\n               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,\n               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two\n               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and\n               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.\n               There are four of them.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Puts away the binoculars and jerks\n                         his head for his men to follow, low,\n                         along the wall.  The men are happy\n                         to do so, looking back nervously at\n                         the German tanks.\n\n               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY\n\n               The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is\n               a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell\n               casings and bodies, German and American and a few French\n               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons\n               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.\n\n               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging\n               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of\n               the firing.\n\n               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He\n               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the\n               firing.\n\n               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.\n\n               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY\n\n               A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC\n               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near\n               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of\n               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings\n               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.\n               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on\n               both sides of the bridge.\n\n               MILLER AND HIS MEN\n\n               Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the\n               bridge.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Looks like they've been having a\n                         hell of a party, here, Captain.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         ON THE BRIDGE!

With Forrest are\n               some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller\n               catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to\n               nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I'll keep it in mind.\n                              (calls to Sarge)\n                         OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.\n\n               Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as\n               they come in.

Ryan is an\n                         American classic, nineteen years\n                         old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.\n                         Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and\n                         smeared with dirt and blood, he's\n                         very alive.  His eyes shine, his\n                         face has a spark.  You can't help\n                         but love this kid.\n\n                                     MILLER'S MEN\n                         All watch Ryan run toward them.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         So, that's Ryan.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         Looks like a flaming asshole to me.\n\n               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the\n               barricade.  He salutes Miller.\n\n                                     REIBEN\n                         I'm Ryan, sir.  You wanted to see\n                         me?\n\n               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally\n               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,\n               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.\n               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers\n               have been killed in action.\n\n               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.\n               Somehow he remains upright.\n\n               Ryan All three?\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Yes.\n\n               Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning\n               him against some sandbags.\n\n                                     THE PARATROOPERS\n                         Are stunned at the news.  They look\n                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they\n                         can do.\n\n                                     MILLER'S MEN\n                         Also look at Ryan, but then, one\n                         after another, they turn away,\n                         adverting their eyes, looking a their\n                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,\n                         the sky, anything other than Ryan.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         We've been sent to get you out of\n                         here.  You're going home.\n\n               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and\n               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a\n               little room.\n\n               Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm\n                         taking you and your men with me.\n\n               Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this\n               bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-\n               ninth Division.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.\n\n               Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         I'm not going to leave you and your\n                         men here to get killed.

Miller is about\n               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting\n               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on\n               the arm and speaks softly to him.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Come on, Private, you're going home.\n\n               Ryan jerks away from Miller.\n\n                                     RYAN\n                         No, sir.\n\n               All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.

American tanks, with wave after\n               wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.

In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies\n               of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers\n               are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.\n\n               Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if\n               they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by\n               any of the advancing troops or vehicles.\n\n                                     MILLER\n                         Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down\n                         next to Sarge and looks at him for a\n                         long moment.  Then, with a steady\n                         hand, he takes one of Sarge's two\n                         dog-tags.
