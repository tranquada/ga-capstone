Excited shrieking.\n\n     A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs\n    through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE,\n    and sister, ANNE, (10).\n\n     Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head\n    skimming along the sheaves.\n\n     REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their\n    parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).\n\n                            SIR THOMAS\n              I received a formal request for marriage\n             today for Anne.\n                     (a beat)\n              From the Carey family.\n\n    SIR THOMAS indicates to\n                         ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.\n    Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.\n\n                        LADY ELIZABETH\n           But that's wonderful.\n\n                        SIR THOMAS\n             I turned it down.\n\n     LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'\n\n                        SIR THOMAS\n            And offered them Mary instead.\n\n    SIR THOMAS indicates \n                         MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.\n    Pretty. Sweet-natured.\n\n                          SIR THOMAS\n           Fnne's too good for William Carey. She\n           can do (better than a merchant's son.\n\n                          LADY ELIZABETH\n            You underestimate Mary.\n\n                          SIR THOMAS\n            Not true. I think she's..the kinder of\n           the two. Quite possibly the fairer.\n\n    The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..\n\n                         SIR THOMAS\n           But to get ahead in this world, you need\n           more than fair looks and a kind heart.\n\n     On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms\n    aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.\n\n                                                                2.\n\n\n    SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?'

WILLIAM CAREY,\n    (35), puts it on MARY's finger.\n\n      few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her\n    across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.\n\n\n    INT.

At the centre of it: GEORGE\ndances with a radiant, triumphant JANE PARKER. GEORGE's eyes\nmeet those of FRANCIS WESTON across the room.\n\n y contrast: HENRY dances with MARY.

HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's\n     ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side...\n\n     MARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM\n     CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly.\n\n                         WILLIAM\n            You're in love with him, aren't you?\n\n                         MARY\n             illiam, you're drunk.\n\n                         WILLIAM\n            How is it?

But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY\n     sees this from across the room..\n\n                         WILLIAM\n            I know you look at me with contempt.\n            But I had no choice. Your father\n            insisted I stand aside. What was I\n            expected to do?\n\n                         MARY\n            Say `no', husband.\n                   (a beat)\n            That was all you had to do.\n\n     MARY pulls her arm away, and goes.

Two people giving everything of\n     themselves..\n\n     Hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms.\n     MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms.

He puts his head\n      on the block. A PRIEST says last rites as GEORGE's arms are held\n      back. Terrified, his lips mouth prayers..begging forgiveness.\n\n      The axe falls. A huge ROAR goes up.\n\n      REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this has been watched by SIR THOMAS\n      BOLEYN.\n\n\n      EXT.
