CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY\n</b>\nA monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on\nBeverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries\na paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.\nNeil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.\nAt 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight\nyears in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and\nhit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were\nspent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language\nis precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very\ngood. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high\nline, high number scores and does it anyway the score has\nto be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's\nfine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine\ntoo. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your\nproblem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's\nno steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps\nit so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds\nflat.\n\n<b>ANGLE\n</b>\nRight now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white\nintern's coat from his paper bag.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

Chris wears a hard hat\nover a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless\nsweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,\nMilwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction\nworker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.\nHe's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline\npro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.\nRight now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley\nwere cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to\n1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and\nspends money as fast as he makes it.
