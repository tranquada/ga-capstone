He has a sweet\n            natured smile on his face.

KITCHEN - A FEW MOMENTS LATER\n\n            Marian shakes a Valium out of a vial, puts it into her mouth, \n            swallows it with a drink of orange juice.\n\n                                                                FADE TO:\n\n            INT. PAULA'S CO-OP - THE NEXT DAY\n\n            Marian, not wanting to be a disappointment to her daughter,\n            damn her fears, gathers her purse up and starts out the door.\n\n            INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\n            Marian is again prevented from an easy exit when a young, hip\n            looking COUPLE come bounding down the stairs.  As she stands\n            at her open door to let them pass, they completely ignore her\n            as if she didn't exist.\n\n            EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER\n\n            Seen from Marian's perspective across the street, the front\n            of the Satan's Disciples headquarters is quiet.  There are\n            only a couple Harleys parked out front.\n\n            Marian, relieved that there are no bikers out, hurries off in\n            the direction of First Avenue, determined to see the sights\n            of the city.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n            EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY - MONTAGE\n\n            A giddy, almost dreamlike, MONTAGE of Marian touring New\n            York.  She's SUPERIMPOSED over famous landmarks, as if she\n            were standing stationery and the city were in a diorama\n            rotating all around her.  The Empire State Building; Circle\n            Cruise Line; eating a hot dog from a street vendor; shopping\n            at Macy's.  Marian beams as she is magically whisked along,\n            walking on air.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n            EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY\n\n            Marian comes INTO THE FRAME around the corner.  She has a\n            spring in her step and a broad smile emblazoning her face. \n            But her sanguine mood is quickly shattered when she HEARS\n            shouting.  She freezes in her tracks.\n\n            ACROSS THE STREET - THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES HEADQUARTERS -\n\n            The Disciple Prospect and another Biker are roughing up a\n            teenage KID, wrestling him into submission.\n\n                                DISCIPLE PROSPECT\n                      You're just chilling, huh?

She rummages\n            anxiously through her purse, but she can't find her keys!\n\n                                MARIAN\n                      Oh, no.\n\n            Marian glances across the street, her face tensed with fear.\n\n            ACROSS THE STREET -\n\n            The Bikers continue to roughhouse the Kid.  The Disciple\n            Prospect brandishes a plastic bag under his nose.\n\n                                DISCIPLE PROSPECT\n                      What's this, huh?\n\n                                KID\n                      I ain't got shit on me.\n\n                                DISCIPLE PROSPECT\n                      What is that?

One of them\n            squirts lighter fluid on the fire burning in the steel drum\n            and the flames explode.  Then KID is dragged over toward the\n            fire.  The Disciple Prospect drags him dangerously close to\n            the flames.\n\n                                DISCIPLE\n                      Roast him!\n\n                                KID\n                          (screaming)\n                      All right all right all right.\n\n            MARIAN -\n\n            petrified, as if she'd stepped into a re-enactment of a\n            passage out of Revelations, walks briskly down to the middle\n            of the block toward a pay phone. \n\n            DISCIPLES CLUBHOUSE -\n\n            The Disciples kick the drug-dealing Teenager a couple more\n            times, then set him free, laughing as he flees down the block\n            in mortal fear.\n\n            PAY PHONE -\n\n            Marian drops the appropriate coins in the coin slot and dials\n            a number from memory.\n\n                                MARIAN\n                          (quavery voice)\n                      Yes, is Paula there? ...

As she EXITS RIGHT,\n            the Disciple Prospect ENTERS LEFT and trails after her.\n\n            EXT. PAULA'S BUILDING - DAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER\n\n            Marian is at the front entrance, uncertain what to do.  She\n            quailss when the Disciple Prospect approaches.  Without a\n            word, he reaches his arm over her and presses a buzzer to one\n            of the units.\n\n                                WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                      Hello.\n\n                                DISCIPLE PROSPECT\n                      Washing machine repairman.\n\n            The DOOR BUZZES almost at once, and the Disciple Prospect\n            pushes it in and holds it open until Marian is safely inside. \n            He looks at her a little annoyed.  Marian is absolutely\n            nonplussed.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            INT.

Marian\n            doesn't turn to acknowledge her.  She continues to stare\n            transfixed at the bikes and the fire-burning oil drum.\n\n                                PAULA\n                          (softer)\n                      Okay?

I thought today was Saturday.\n\n            Marian, seemingly reassured, opens the door for her.  She\n            sees Marika, realizes she's upset about something, and feels\n            immediately compassionate toward her.\n\n                                MARIKA\n                      I'm sorry.

Calls made\n                      at three and four in the morning.  So, I\n                      called the number ... and a woman\n                      answered.  And I ...

She brings a plate\n            of food for herself to the table.\n\n                                MARIAN\n                      And they were so friendly those young\n                      men.  Though I do think they should shave\n                      their beards and ... and get some nicer\n                      clothes.\n\n            Marian sits down at the table and takes a sip of her wine,\n            picks up her utensils and gets ready to dig in.  She turns to\n            Paula who isn't touching her food, her head in her hands. \n            Marian, seemingly oblivious of her daughter's feelings,\n            prattles on.\n\n                                MARIAN\n                      What do you say ... we take a subway\n                      uptown and see a play tonight?\n\n            Marian finally notices that Paula isn't listening.\n\n                                MARIAN\n                      What's wrong?\n\n                                PAULA\n                      Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine\n                      such a thing, but ... how many of those\n                      pills have you been taking?\n\n                                MARIAN\n                          (stung, taken aback)\n                      Oh, that has nothing to do with it.\n\n                                PAULA\n                      No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing\n                      you too hard to do things on your own.\n\n            Marian retreats into herself, sips her wine - as if she,\n            herself, now wonders if she's lost her mind - and her buoyant\n            mood deflates almost at once.\n\n                                PAULA\n                      The, um, other night, I got up to get a\n                      glass of water and you were standing by\n                      the window talking to daddy.  I called\n                      out to you, but you didn't answer.  You\n                      remember?\n\n            Marian doesn't remember, and her daughter's words pierce her. \n            She's afraid to object.\n\n                                PAULA\n                      New York is a ... it's a strange place in\n                      the summertime.  The noise, the warm air,\n                      it's ... easy to imagine things.\n\n            Paula lays a reassuring hand on Marian's arm, talks to her\n            condescendingly, as if she were a child.\n\n                                PAULA\n                      Now, you know you didn't go into the\n                      clubhouse, did you?\n\n            Marian doesn't bother to argue, fearing anything she might\n            say would compromise her.\n\n                                PAULA (CONT'D)\n                      It's okay.  Dad's dying put a lot of\n                      stress on you.  But you're going to be\n                      all right.  We're all going to be all\n                      right.  Where did you get this vivid\n                      imagination, huh?\n\n            Paula grips Marian's arm a little tighter and shakes it\n            gently as if snapping her back to reality.  Marian returns\n            her a tight-lipped smile.\n\n                                                               FADE OUT.\n\n            INT. CO-OP - NIGHT\n\n            Marian, lying supine on the convertible sofa bed by the open\n            window, snoring peacefully.\n\n            EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - NIGHT\n\n            On the sidewalk, the Disciple Prospect sits next to the fire\n            breathing oil drum, standing sentry over the Harleys.\n\n            One of the Disciples comes out of the clubhouse and they high\n            five.  The Disciple mounts his Harley and is about to kick\n            start it to life, when the Disciple Prospect rises from his\n            stool.\n\n                                DISCIPLE PROSPECT\n                      Yo, man!\n\n            The Disciple about to start his bike, turns.  \n\n            The Disciple Prospect raises two fingers to his lips in a\n            kind of warning, then gestures up to Paula's co-op where\n            Marian is sleeping.\n\n            The Disciple, remembering the new rule, nods assent with a\n            slightly annoyed expression.\n\n            Then, he puts his Harley into neutral, dismounts, and starts\n            slowly walking it down the quiet, ill-lit street.\n\n            INT. CO-OP - NIGHT\n\n            The room is cast in soft ambient light from the street. \n            Paula comes into the living room and lies down next to her\n            mother on the sofa bed and rouses her awake.  Marian swims\n            leadenly back to consciousness.  \n\n                                PAULA\n                      Mom, I need to talk to you.\n\n                                MARIAN\n                          (still drowsy)\n                      If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't\n                      want to talk about it.\n\n                                PAULA\n                      No, I had a dream about daddy.

CENTRAL PARK - DAY\n\n            A lovely, sun-drenched day.  Shadows dapple a promenade along\n            one of the park's many ponds.
