NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY\n</b>\n\tTRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S \n\told Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward \n\tcoffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the \n\tsame direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.\n\n<b>3\tINT.

COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n</b>\n\tAt the entrance is another \"CONNIE WHITE\" display and from the \n\tjukebox we hear one of her songs.\n\n\tThe waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an \n\toverflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.\n\n\tThere are several people at the counter with him, including \n\tGREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT \n\tREESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.\n\n\tA small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full \n\tor dishes. This is WADE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWADE\n</b>\t\t\t\t(to SUELEEN)\n\t\t\tYou want a ride into town?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n</b>\t\t\tYou bet.\n\n\tREESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the \n\tTRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and \n\tcheckbook are still there, then he buries himself in his \n\tnewspaper.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n</b>\t\t\tGot me an audition tonight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tWADE\n</b>\t\t\tWell, you just remember, if you \n\t\t\tcan't kick front, kick back, 'cause \n\t\t\tat least you're kicking... Ten \n\t\t\tminutes, okay?\n\n\tShe nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking \n\tlooks at her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n</b>\t\t\tI've just been waiting for the \n\t\t\tright spot to sing in...

Teaches you how to \n\t\t\tphrase; that's really important. \n\t\t\tAnd breathing. Well, you know all \n\t\t\tabout that. Anyway, I wrote this \n\t\t\tsong.\n\n\tShe looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do \n\tall of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some \n\tglasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every \n\ttime someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through \n\tthe song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks \n\taway from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished \n\this meal.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n</b>\t\t\tOh, listen, I really do go on. \n\t\t\tHere's your check.

CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY\n</b>\n\tWe hear the last chorus or \"Keep on a goin'\" as sung by HAVEN, \n\twho is recording.\n\n\tHe is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY \n\tPEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is \n\taccompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. \n\tHAVEN is not too happy with him. \n\n<b>6\tANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\n\tOPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape \n\trecorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and \n\tthe piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming \n\tinstructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.\n\n<b>7\tINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\n\tOPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBUD\n</b>\t\t\tSorry.

Can \n\t\t\tyou arrange an interview?\n\n<b>8\tINT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY\n</b>\n\tThey have entered a different control tooth. In the recording \n\tportion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. \n\tOPAL asks BUD who this group is.\n\n<b>9\tINT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY\n</b>\n\tBUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and \n\tstarts to leave, yelling at the producer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n</b>\t\t\tWho the hell is playing piano? Get \n\t\t\tthat hippie out of here...

HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\n\tIt is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates \n\tbeing crushed and moves through the congestion like a white \n\tknight. OPAL moves near.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tOPAL\n</b>\t\t\tExcuse me, sir. I'm here putting \n\t\t\ttogether a film.

Oh, Jesus!\n\n\tHe runs off.\n\n<b>16\tANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\n\tAs NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep \n\tarrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. \n\tREESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT \n\tis already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all \n\tshake hands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n</b>\t\t\tDelbert, how are you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tREESE\n</b>\t\t\tI'm fine. This here is John \n\t\t\tTriplette.

But \n\t\t\tshe'll be late for the Opera if she \n\t\t\tdoesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on \n\t\t\tthe walkie-talkie.\n\n\tBUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get \n\tanything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBUD\n</b>\t\t\tThey don't seem to be answering. \n\t\t\tThe ambulance boys are here, though. \n\t\t\tBarnett always expects them to get \n\t\t\tthere like a shot.

The band and majorettes \n\tand horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes \n\tas BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, \n\tespecially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of \n\tapplause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been \n\texposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in \n\tawe of the situation.\n\n\tWhen the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN \n\tdescends the stairs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n</b>\t\t\tBud, tell them to move the horses. \n\t\t\tPromised this strip would be spic \n\t\t\tand span.\n\n\tHe smiles and winks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tREESE\n</b>\t\t\tListen, we'll go get the car and \n\t\t\tcome back.

The cars are \n\twaiting for the talent show to set off the track.\n\n<b>188\tNEW ANGLE\n</b>\n\tAlbuquerque starts to take off her clothes. The MC hasn't \n\tnoticed, but the grandstand has.

All right, would you stand, please?\n\n\tThe people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A \n\t'74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized \n\tAmerican flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end \n\tof the song the Pontiac drives off the track.\n\n<b>\tAL\n</b>\tThis is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick \n\tourselves a winner.\n\n<b>191\tNEW ANGLE\n</b>\n\tThe drivers get into their cars and start up. The track man \n\twaves a flag which starts them around the track in pairs. We \n\tnotice the TRICYCLE MAN, who has been there all the time. The \n\trace starts and the SOUND is deafening. ALBUQUERQUE is thrilled \n\tto death.
