NASHVILLE AIRPORT - DAY\n\n\tTRICYCLE MAN drives into parking lot and parks next to GREEN'S \n\told Chevy. TRICYCLE MAM: locks his machine and walks toward \n\tcoffee shop. GREEN gets out of his car, locks it, starts in the \n\tsame direction. NORMAN parks the limo, goes into main building.\n\n3\tINT. AIRPORT - DAY\n\n\tNORMAN is attracted to large \u0093CONNIE WHITE\u0094 display.\n\n4\tINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\n\tAt the entrance is another \"CONNIE WHITE\" display and from the \n\tjukebox we hear one of her songs.\n\n\tThe waitress, SUELEEN, drops a fork, then gets another from an \n\toverflowing sink and hands it to her customer, TRICYCLE MAN.\n\n\tThere are several people at the counter with him, including \n\tGREEN, who has just walked in. Another man enters, DELBERT \n\tREESE. SUELEEN waits on all of them.\n\n\tA small black man comes out of the kitchen, carrying a tray full \n\tor dishes. This is WADE.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWADE\n\t\t\t\t(to SUELEEN)\n\t\t\tYou want a ride into town?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n\t\t\tYou bet.\n\n\tREESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the \n\tTRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and \n\tcheckbook are still there, then he buries himself in his \n\tnewspaper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n\t\t\tGot me an audition tonight.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWADE\n\t\t\tWell, you just remember, if you \n\t\t\tcan't kick front, kick back, 'cause \n\t\t\tat least you're kicking... Ten \n\t\t\tminutes, okay?\n\n\tShe nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking \n\tlooks at her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n\t\t\tI've just been waiting for the \n\t\t\tright spot to sing in... I'm so \n\t\t\tnervous...\n\n\tShe laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n\t\t\tI'm good, though. There ain't but \n\t\t\tone Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to \n\t\t\tbe conceited, but really it's true. \n\t\t\tI've been taking special coaching \n\t\t\tlessons from Zeke Willard -- he's \n\t\t\tjust wonderful. Teaches you how to \n\t\t\tphrase; that's really important. \n\t\t\tAnd breathing. Well, you know all \n\t\t\tabout that. Anyway, I wrote this \n\t\t\tsong.\n\n\tShe looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do \n\tall of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some \n\tglasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every \n\ttime someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through \n\tthe song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks \n\taway from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished \n\this meal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUELEEN\n\t\t\tOh, listen, I really do go on. \n\t\t\tHere's your check. Sure has been \n\t\t\tnice talking to you.\n\n\tAs she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the \n\tjukebox, \"Keep on a goin'.\"  The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.\n\n\tCUT TO:\n\n5\tINT. CONTROL BOOTH - NASHVILLE STUDIO - DAY\n\n\tWe hear the last chorus or \"Keep on a goin'\" as sung by HAVEN, \n\twho is recording.\n\n\tHe is always dressed in white. In the booth are BUD and LADY \n\tPEARL. Also present are two engineers and a producer. HAVEN is \n\taccompanied by a long haired piano player with a white sweater. \n\tHAVEN is not too happy with him. \n\n6\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tOPAL enters the booth, carrying a too-large English tape \n\trecorder. HAVEN Stops singing, mad at OPAL'S interruption and \n\tthe piano player. Through the glass we see him pantomiming \n\tinstructions for her to leave. As she does, HAVEN starts over.\n\n7\tINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\n\tOPAL wanders to the next studio. BUD follows, apologizing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBUD\n\t\t\tSorry. He sees a tape recorder and \n\t\t\tgets upset.\n\n\tShe looks at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBUD\n\t\t\tHe's my father.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOPAL\n\t\t\tHaven Hamilton is your father? Can \n\t\t\tyou arrange an interview?\n\n8\tINT. SECOND RECORDING BOOTH - DAY\n\n\tThey have entered a different control tooth. In the recording \n\tportion, LINNEA and an all-black, male CHOIR sings a gospel song. \n\tOPAL asks BUD who this group is.\n\n9\tINT. FIRST CONTROL BOOTH - DAY\n\n\tBUD returns. HAVEN has just exploded at the piano player and \n\tstarts to leave, yelling at the producer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tWho the hell is playing piano? Get \n\t\t\tthat hippie out of here... He's got \n\t\t\ta tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. \n\t\t\tI'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to \n\t\t\tthe airport. When you get my \n\t\t\tbackups straight, then we'll talk \n\t\t\tabout cutting this tune here.\n\n\tHe heads for the hallway.\n\n10\tINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\n\tIt is jammed with black singers from the CHOIR. HAVEN hates \n\tbeing crushed and moves through the congestion like a white \n\tknight. OPAL moves near.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOPAL\n\t\t\tExcuse me, sir. I'm here putting \n\t\t\ttogether a film. I would like to \n\t\t\task some questions.\n\n\tShe has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tForeigner?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOPAL\n\t\t\tI'm from BBC television.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tWhere the hell is that?\n\n\tHAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and \n\tPEARL. He spots LINNEA.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tLinnea.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLINNEA\n\t\t\tHow you doing, Haven?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\toh, fine. Couldn't be better.\n\n11\tANGLE T0WARD OUTSIDE\n\n\tThey all say goodbye and HAVEN'S group gets into a new white jeep\n\n\tCUT TO:\n\n12\tEXT.

LANDING AREA - AIRPORT - DAY\n\n\tGLENN has just deposited a postcard in a mailbox and approaches a \n\tgathering cluster of people. NORMAN and TRICYCLE MAN are nearby. \n\tEverybody is waiting for BARBARA JEAN to appear. GLENN steps \n\tclose to NORMAN.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGLENN\n\t\t\tAm I late?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\tLate!  Oh, Jesus!\n\n\tHe runs off.\n\n16\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tAs NORMAN runs toward passenger loading, we see HAVEN'S jeep \n\tarrive with HAVEN, BUD and PEARL. It parks and all climb out. \n\tREESE and TRIPLETTE approach the 'Barbara Jean' plane. BARNETT \n\tis already on the runway, making arrangements. HAVEN'S group all \n\tshake hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tDelbert, how are you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tREESE\n\t\t\tI'm fine. This here is John \n\t\t\tTriplette. Triplette, like you to \n\t\t\tmeet the Honorary Mayor, Haven \n\t\t\tHamilton.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tGood to meet you.\n\t\t\t\t (turns to BUD)\n\t\t\tBud, have them move the horses.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRIPLETTE\n\t\t\tPleasure \n\n\t\t\t\t\tREESE\n\t\t\tWhere is she?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tStill inside the plane posing for \n\t\t\tpictures and signing autographs. \n\t\t\tShe's got a new album cut again. \n\t\t\tShe'll be down in a minute. But \n\t\t\tshe'll be late for the Opera if she \n\t\t\tdoesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on \n\t\t\tthe walkie-talkie.\n\n\tBUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get \n\tanything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBUD\n\t\t\tThey don't seem to be answering. \n\t\t\tThe ambulance boys are here, though. \n\t\t\tBarnett always expects them to get \n\t\t\tthere like a shot. That thing only \n\t\t\tgoes a hundred fall bore with the \n\t\t\tsirens going.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tThank you, Bud.\n\n\tBUD nods like he has been complimented.\n\n17\tANGLE TOWARD PLANE\n\n\tA wave of noise begins from the fans. The band and majorettes \n\tand horses and ropers go into a rendition of one of her hit tunes \n\tas BARBARA JEAN appears. Everyone is breaking their neck to see, \n\tespecially GLENN. HAVEN and REESE give her the first round of \n\tapplause, then go back to talking. TRIPLETTE has never been \n\texposed to anything quite like this before and stands a little in \n\tawe of the situation.\n\n\tWhen the twirling and tricking and music stop, BARBARA JEAN \n\tdescends the stairs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tBud, tell them to move the horses. \n\t\t\tPromised this strip would be spic \n\t\t\tand span.\n\n\tHe smiles and winks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tREESE\n\t\t\tListen, we'll go get the car and \n\t\t\tcome back. This'l1 be going on for \n\t\t\ta while.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tYou bet. She's probably talking to \n\t\t\tsomebody about their sick child. You \n\t\t\tknow how she is.\n\n\tThey wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. \n\tBehind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars \n\tand horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.\n\n18\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tBARNETT comes over to REESE, TRIPLETTE, HAVEN, BUD and PEARL \n\twhile BARBARA JEAN continues to greet fans.\n\n19\tEXT. AIRPORT NEAR PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n\tWhile the BARBARA JEAN arrival takes place on the runway NORMAN \n\tfinds BILL and MARY. NORMAN speaks softly and out of breath, \n\ttrying to pretend he's on time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\tHi.\n\n\tBILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILL\n\t\t\tHi, Norman.\n\n\tNORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\tSure is nice to see you all again. \n\t\t\tI never thought I'd see you again \n\t\t\tafter the last time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILL\n\t\t\tOh, Norman, you worry too much.\n\n\tMARY takes NORMAN'S hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\tNorman, how are you?\n\n\tShe kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to \n\tsomeone else.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\tFine. Just fine.\n\n\tAs they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top \n\tof it and clearly written door signs that read: \"Replacement \n\tParty\" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking \n\ttoward it, shaking hands with several people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\tSure have missed you all, though. \n\t\t\tOh, where's Tom?  Isn't he with you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILL\n\t\t\tDon't worry about old Tom.\n\n20\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tTOM and the stews walk to a VW with a sun roof.\n\n\tNearby REESE and TRIPLETTE get into their Cadillac, behind it the \n\tReplacement Party car. Coming from the loudspeakers a tape-\n\trecorded VOICE:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tHave you thought about your future \n\t\t\tand what America needs to examine...\n\n\tBehind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with \"Connie \n\tWhite\" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He \n\tcranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.\n\n21\tEXT. PARKING LOT\n\n\tNORMAN'S limo, with BILL and MARY, follows traffic as the \n\tTRICYCLE MAN fires up his machine. WADE'S car with SUELEEN also \n\tjoins the procession.\n\n22\tANGLE TOWARD RUNWAY\n\n\tThe orange ambulance has moved into the area near the plane and \n\tthere seems to be a great deal at activity.\n\n\tREESE and TRIPLETTE'S car stops, and they rush out and run into \n\tHAVEN, who is shouting for people to get the hell out of the way.\n\n23\tNEW ANGLE\n\n\tTwo ambulance ATTENDANTS cut through the crowd. HAVEN, TRIPLETTE \n\tand REESE rush near. BARNETT is on his knees over BARBARA JEAN, \n\twho has collapsed. The ATTENDANTS lean over her with ammonia. \n\tThey test her reflexes, etc..\n\n\t\t\t\t\tATTENDANT\n\t\t\tHow long was she out?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARNETT\n\t\t\tNot too long. But she keeps \n\t\t\tpassing out.\n\n\tShe comes to and looks at them all.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARBARA JEAN\n\t\t\t\t (oblivious)\n\t\t\tJust give your manna that vitamin \n\t\t\tE. Makes a world of difference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAVEN\n\t\t\tHere she is again.\n\n\tShe resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tATTENDANT\n\t\t\tOkay, let's get her to the wagon.\n\n\tA stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT \n\tclimbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on \n\tDELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. \n\tDELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance \n\tspeeds off, siren wailing.\n\n\tCUT TO:\n\n24\tEXT.

I've been closer, \n\tcloser than this, but my Nash broke down and somebody kept \n\tstealing my things. I wanted to get him the day before, then Mr. \n\tGreen's wire died, so this was the right time. I love the \n\tPresident of the United States. I love him.\n\n\tGuards grab the speaker, KENNY, in an instant. He shoots a \n\tpoliceman's foot by accident. Men swallow him up. Someone \n\tyells, \"sing.\"\n\n211\tANGLE - STAGE\n\n\tThe choir has no direction to go in. ALRUQUERQUE suddenly is \n\twith microphone..
