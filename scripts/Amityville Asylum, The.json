The home is a classic piece of Americana,\r\n          two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on\r\n          the Amityville River.

RONALD DEFEO\r\n          JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH. He sits on\r\n          a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television\r\n          that displays white static.\r\n                         \r\n          There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the\r\n          sofa. It reads 3:14am. We hold on the clock and the time\r\n          changes to 3:15am.

His eyes snap\r\n          open.\r\n          A hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the\r\n          shadows. The figure carries a .35 caliber lever action\r\n          Marlin 336C rifle. Hands clad in black leather gloves, the\r\n          mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch. A\r\n          voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be\r\n<b>                         INHUMAN:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>                          FIGURE\r\n</b>           Kill them.

RONALD DEFEO SENIOR, age forty three, is a\r\n          heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is\r\n          a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair.\r\n          Both are lying flat on their stomachs. Without hesitation,\r\n          Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the\r\n          trigger. The BLAST is deafening. The first shot rips into\r\n          his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting\r\n          through his chest. Butch fires another round, again hitting\r\n          his father in the back. This shot pierces the base of Ronald\r\n          Senior's spine, and lodges in his neck.Louise DeFeo's eyes\r\n          open, but she barely has a few seconds to react. Butch aims\r\n          the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and\r\n          fires two shots in quick succession. The bullets shatter her\r\n          rib cage and collapse her right lung. Both bodies now lay\r\n          silently in fresh pools of their own blood.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>                         CUT TO:\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          5.INT.

So we're still building\r\n          our reputation. But I am very clear\r\n          on what I want that reputation to\r\n          be. I intend to make this\r\n          institution one of the foremost\r\n          centres for mental health treatment\r\n          in the country. If you look into my\r\n          history you'll know that I have a\r\n          stellar reputation in the field of\r\n          psychiatry and I want to use that\r\n          to help others. That is why I have\r\n          put my own money into the creation\r\n          of this institution. We are only\r\n          just starting out but we have a\r\n          long term ambition to be considered\r\n          the best. So what I require is that\r\n          every person who works at this\r\n          institution, in any capacity, must\r\n          be professional and sensitive to\r\n          the needs of the patients. Unlike\r\n          other institutions, the welfare and\r\n          care of our patients comes first\r\n          here.\r\n<b>           9.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>                          LISA\r\n</b>           I really admire that and I promise\r\n           I would not let you down if I was\r\n           given this job.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          MIXTER\r\n</b>           I'm sure you wouldn't.\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa's face quickly contorts.

The cell is very basic,\r\n          white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable\r\n          looking bed and a toilet without a seat.

This next inmate is\r\n           even worse.\r\n          Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next\r\n          door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside.\r\n          Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man\r\n          stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his\r\n          back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes\r\n          that stare at Lisa. He smiles.

First of\r\n           all he was like Missus Hardesty\r\n           upstairs-catatonic. Then a few\r\n           weeks later he started to respond\r\n           to Doctor Mixter and the nurses\r\n           through facial expressions and\r\n           gestures. But soon, he got violent.\r\n           Very violent. He'd have bursts of\r\n           rage and beat other patients. One\r\n           day he appeared to have a seizure\r\n           and collapsed. A young doctor tried\r\n           to take his vital signs. Patient X\r\n           here throttled him so hard he\r\n           crushed his larynx.

A drop of\r\n          blood pierces the blessed water. As Lisa walks down the\r\n          aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and\r\n          she is moving in slow motion. White feathers cover the\r\n          aisle, bouncing around her bare feet. An open Bible rests on\r\n          the Lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong\r\n          breeze blowing them. Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the\r\n<b>           39.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n          wall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares\r\n          at her. Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down\r\n          Christ's face. As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a\r\n          female figure sat in the front pew. Lisa ebbs closer.

(Reading) In\r\n           the 18th Century there existed a\r\n           group of Native Americans in\r\n           Amityville known as \"The Satchem\r\n           Tribe\" led by Satchem Takapausha,\r\n           the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem\r\n           in Massachusetts to escape\r\n           persecution by the Christians who\r\n           were persecuting members of the\r\n           tribe because of their Witchcraft\r\n           practices. These practices included\r\n           a ritualistic human sacrifice of\r\n           six people (The significance of Six\r\n           being related to the biblical\r\n           number of man and creation) in\r\n           order to induce the spirit of their\r\n           God, The Dark Master, who they\r\n           believed manifested his powers\r\n           through his devoted followers,\r\n           giving them immortality. The\r\n           hundred strong tribe settled in\r\n           Amityville but were later chased\r\n           off the land by local Christians.\r\n           Satchem accused the Christians of\r\n           not properly compensating his tribe\r\n           for the land. A war started and the\r\n           Christians hired a hunter called\r\n           John Underhill from Salem. At the\r\n           site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue\r\n           was later built in Amityville,\r\n           Underhill killed all of the tribe.\r\n           The Indians were buried in a mass\r\n           grave on the site. Before he died\r\n           Satchem vowed revenge. According to\r\n           local legend, Chief Satchem is\r\n           believed to have subsequently\r\n           haunted the land. Various\r\n           parapsychologists and mediums have\r\n<b>           65.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n           claimed that Satchem's vengeful\r\n           spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo\r\n           murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue\r\n           and the haunting of the subsequent\r\n           owners.

But that never\r\n           occurred to me. I feel that people\r\n           should be brought closer by tragedy\r\n           and the Staff and I have definitely\r\n           become closer, both as colleagues\r\n           and friends, since the incident.\r\n           That bond makes for a better\r\n<b>           87.\r\n</b>                         \r\n                         \r\n           institution in my opinion, so we\r\n           will continue to go from strength\r\n           to strength.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          PRESENTER\r\n</b>           You mentioned there that some\r\n           people wanted the place to close. I\r\n           know many were also resistant to\r\n           the opening of the institution in\r\n           the first place given that it was\r\n           built on the site of the infamous\r\n           house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered\r\n           his family in the seventies. I know\r\n           a lot of people associated with\r\n           that case were accused of\r\n           exploiting it for their own ends.\r\n           You've also faced some criticism\r\n           for that, particularly as we heard\r\n           last week that you have sold the\r\n           movie rights to this book.

Each staff member gets\r\n           their own chapter in the book so\r\n           that the readers can get a full\r\n           picture of what wonderful people\r\n           they were.
