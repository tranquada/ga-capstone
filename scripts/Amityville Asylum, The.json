We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch\r\n          Colonial house. The home is a classic piece of Americana,\r\n          two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on\r\n          the Amityville River. There are quarter round windows on the\r\n          top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at\r\n          us.\r\n                         \r\n          A signpost in the front yard reads \"HIGH HOPES\", a testament\r\n          to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          2.INT. BASEMENT \u00ad 112 OCEAN AVENUE \u00ad CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          We move slowly through the basement, past various crushed\r\n          beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we\r\n          reach a bearded man in his early twenties. RONALD DEFEO\r\n          JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH. He sits on\r\n          a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television\r\n          that displays white static.\r\n                         \r\n          There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the\r\n          sofa. It reads 3:14am. We hold on the clock and the time\r\n          changes to 3:15am. We can see DeFeo's breath drift from his\r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          lips as cold air sweeps through the room. His eyes snap\r\n          open.\r\n          A hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the\r\n          shadows. The figure carries a .35 caliber lever action\r\n          Marlin 336C rifle. Hands clad in black leather gloves, the\r\n          mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch. A\r\n          voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be\r\n                         INHUMAN:\r\n                         \r\n                          FIGURE\r\n           Kill them. Kill them all.\r\n                         \r\n          Butch stands and takes the rifle. The figure retreats back\r\n          into the shadows.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          3.INT. HALLWAY \u00ad CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          The house is silent. Butch quietly stalks the hallways, the\r\n          rifle grasped tightly in his hands.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          4.INT. MASTER BEDROOM \u00ad CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents\r\n          as they sleep. RONALD DEFEO SENIOR, age forty three, is a\r\n          heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is\r\n          a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair.\r\n          Both are lying flat on their stomachs. Without hesitation,\r\n          Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the\r\n          trigger. The BLAST is deafening. The first shot rips into\r\n          his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting\r\n          through his chest. Butch fires another round, again hitting\r\n          his father in the back. This shot pierces the base of Ronald\r\n          Senior's spine, and lodges in his neck.Louise DeFeo's eyes\r\n          open, but she barely has a few seconds to react. Butch aims\r\n          the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and\r\n          fires two shots in quick succession. The bullets shatter her\r\n          rib cage and collapse her right lung. Both bodies now lay\r\n          silently in fresh pools of their own blood.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          5.INT.

He walks between their\r\n          two beds as they lie on their stomachs, sleeping soundly.\r\n          Standing directly above his two helpless brothers, Butch\r\n          fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping.\r\n                         \r\n          The bullets tear through their young bodies, ravaging their\r\n          internal organs, laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of\r\n          them. Mark lays motionless, while John, whose spinal cord\r\n          has been severed by his brother's heartless attack, twitches\r\n          spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          7.INT.

She looks up just\r\n          as Butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger.\r\n          Butch then aims his weapon at Dawn's head and squeezes the\r\n          trigger again, literally blowing the left side of her face\r\n          off. Both girls die instantly. The white sheets and walls\r\n          are splattered with blood and brain matter. Butch is unmoved\r\n          and expressionless. He surveys the carnage for a moment,\r\n          then calmly walks out of the room.\r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          9.INT.

It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family in a\r\n          group, hugging each other with smiles on their faces. The\r\n          sound of children singing the nursery rhyme \"Ring Around a\r\n          Rosie\" in a slow, haunting manner echoes through the house.\r\n          We push in on the photograph and:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          FADE TO BLACK\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         FADE IN:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          10.EXT.

I've done a lot of\r\n           them.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Well an institution such as this\r\n           one is a very different\r\n           proposition.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Oh yes. Yes I know. You'll see I've\r\n           also worked cleaning a school, so I\r\n           am used to big areas.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Yes I've seen that. When I say this\r\n           is a different proposition I mean\r\n           in terms of the sensitivity\r\n           required due to the nature of what\r\n           we do here.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Oh yes, yes of course.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           You would mainly be working night\r\n           shifts at a time when patients are\r\n           on lock down. But many of our\r\n           patients here have psychological\r\n           disturbances so there may be\r\n           situations where you have to clean\r\n           up things you may not be used to\r\n           cleaning up. If you know what I'm\r\n           saying.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           I know what you mean, yes.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Would that bother you?\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           It may be strange at first but I\r\n           actually have some experience in\r\n                          8\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          that area. I would clean my mother\r\n          when she lost control of her bodily\r\n          functions during her illness. It's\r\n          something I got used to very\r\n          quickly. It became routine.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n          I see. How is your mother now?\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          Well... she passed away.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n          I'm sorry to hear that. So... it's\r\n          important to me that every employee\r\n          here, whether they are a\r\n          psychiatrist, an orderly or a\r\n          cleaner, needs to fully understand\r\n          what our mission statement at this\r\n          hospital is.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          Okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n          High Hopes was only built two years\r\n          ago and as an institution we have\r\n          only been running for just over a\r\n          year now. So we're still building\r\n          our reputation. But I am very clear\r\n          on what I want that reputation to\r\n          be. I intend to make this\r\n          institution one of the foremost\r\n          centres for mental health treatment\r\n          in the country. If you look into my\r\n          history you'll know that I have a\r\n          stellar reputation in the field of\r\n          psychiatry and I want to use that\r\n          to help others. That is why I have\r\n          put my own money into the creation\r\n          of this institution. We are only\r\n          just starting out but we have a\r\n          long term ambition to be considered\r\n          the best. So what I require is that\r\n          every person who works at this\r\n          institution, in any capacity, must\r\n          be professional and sensitive to\r\n          the needs of the patients. Unlike\r\n          other institutions, the welfare and\r\n          care of our patients comes first\r\n          here.\r\n           9.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           I really admire that and I promise\r\n           I would not let you down if I was\r\n           given this job.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           I'm sure you wouldn't.\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa's face quickly contorts. Mixter looks puzzled. Suddenly\r\n          Lisa sneezes. It shoots out so rapidly she has no time to\r\n          cover her mouth and nose. She sneezes all over Mixter. Lisa\r\n          looks horrified.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Oh my God, I'm so sorry!!\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa rushes to Mixter's side and grabs a tissue from a\r\n          Kleenex box on his desk. She frantically wipes the saliva\r\n          and snot from his face.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           It's quite alright, please sit\r\n           down, I can take care of it.\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa, completely mortified, sits back down. An unimpressed\r\n          Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue. When\r\n          he's done he stares at Lisa.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Okay... well thanks for coming in.\r\n           I'll let you know.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Look I'm so sorry, I really am!\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           It's fine.

RECEPTION AREA \u00ad HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa enters the hospital. A man in his thirties dressed in a\r\n          boiler suit is stood on a step ladder. He is attempting to\r\n          change a light bulb in the hallway but seems to be making\r\n          hard work of it. The bulb drops from his hand and smashes to\r\n          the ground. Lisa looks up at him.\r\n                          14\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          MAN\r\n           Gswno!\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa averts her eyes but the man is now aware of her\r\n          presence.

STORAGE CUPBOARD \u00ad LATER\r\n          Delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and Lisa\r\n          are silhouetted in the doorway. Delaney pulls a string\r\n          hanging near the door and a light comes on. The cupboard is\r\n          packed with various cleaning products.\r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           This is the storage cupboard.\r\n           Everything you will need for each\r\n           15.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          task is here, each shelf is\r\n          labelled.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          Okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n          The most obvious task is hoovering.\r\n          This is our hoover here, it's\r\n          straight forward. You'll be\r\n          surprised that although it's\r\n          powerful it's very quiet, because\r\n          we are working when everyone's in\r\n          bed so obviously we don't want to\r\n          wake them up! It has a Telescopic\r\n          suction tube and six stage filter\r\n          system. So a lot more powerful than\r\n          you may be used to.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          Okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n          The mop and bucket is here, we\r\n          usually use standard bleach to mix\r\n          with the water so that's straight\r\n          forward. But there is this\r\n          specialist stain remover that you\r\n          must use if there are any stains on\r\n          the floor or carpet. It needs to be\r\n          sprayed and left to set for twenty\r\n          minutes before scrubbing or\r\n          mopping. It's a special formula for\r\n          tea, coffee, water marks and other\r\n          yellow and brown discolourations on\r\n          the carpets or floors. It's pretty\r\n          strong so wash your hands after you\r\n          use it!\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n                         OKAY\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n          One of the worst parts of the job\r\n          is we have to remove chewing gum\r\n          from lots of surfaces. They don't\r\n          just stick it underneath the\r\n          tables, it ends up everywhere!\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          Gross!\r\n                          16\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           Yes! I think a lot of the time it's\r\n           the staff doing it, not the\r\n           patients! But we have this GumCart,\r\n           which is a bit complicated but it's\r\n           easier than just scraping the gum.\r\n           The steam is super heated to one\r\n           hundred eighty degrees and\r\n           delivered at seven point zero bar\r\n           pressure. It can produce a hundred\r\n           and fifteen litres of superheated\r\n           steam per minute.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Is it okay if I watch you use it a\r\n           few times first so I know exactly\r\n           what I'm doing? I don't want to end\r\n           up burning myself or any furniture!\r\n                         \r\n          Delaney smiles.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           No problem. Now here we come to the\r\n           most dangerous chemical we have.\r\n           This is a concrete cleaner, very\r\n           toxic stuff, so you have to wear\r\n           the face mask and gloves we have\r\n           here, okay?\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           This is for cleaning and descaling\r\n           brick, stone and concrete and for\r\n           metal de-rusting. For concrete you\r\n           must mix it one part to four parts\r\n           water. Brush or spray it on with\r\n           the equipment here then leave it\r\n           five to ten minutes to set, then\r\n           rinse it off. But for those\r\n           stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use\r\n           it neat!\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           Don't worry if anything seems\r\n           complicated, you'll get used to it.\r\n           But you'll mostly be mopping and\r\n           hoovering in your first few weeks.\r\n           17.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Yeah that's fine.\r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          20.INT. WARD B \u00ad LATER\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa follows Delaney into the communal area of Ward B. The\r\n          walls are white and clinical. Various patients are scattered\r\n          across the room, each with a look of resignation in their\r\n          eyes. Many stare blankly out of the window.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           This is Ward B, one of two wards\r\n           you'll be responsible for cleaning\r\n           each evening. Essentially the main\r\n           duties will be emptying the bins,\r\n           hoovering the carpeted areas and\r\n           mopping the hallways. The patients\r\n           in here are Category B. They're\r\n           mainly people who have had nervous\r\n           breakdowns and those who are\r\n           catatonic. They're harmless. Like\r\n           Missus Hardesty here.\r\n                         \r\n          Delaney and Lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still\r\n          in the chair. Her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           Hello Missus Hardesty.\r\n                         \r\n          No response or acknowledgement of other people's presence.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           She hasn't spoken a word in all her\r\n           time here. The orderlies just lift\r\n           her from the bedroom to the day\r\n           room and back again every day.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Why did you just talk to her?\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           We've still got to treat them like\r\n           human beings. Otherwise they just\r\n           become like furniture and we all\r\n           lose our humanity. I like to think\r\n           she can hear me, even if she won't\r\n           talk to me. See you later Missus\r\n           Hardesty.\r\n                          18\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Missus Hardesty continues to stare into nothingness.

WARD X \u00ad CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Delaney and Lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of\r\n          thick metal doors either side. Two light bulbs hang from the\r\n          ceiling at each end of the corridor, providing only minimal\r\n          illumination. Lisa's nose twitches.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           What's that smell?\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           It always hangs in the air. No\r\n           matter how much we bleach the floor\r\n           there is always that smell of\r\n           death.\r\n                          20\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Lisa looks concerned.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           These patients are dangerous?\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           Yes. But don't worry, we never have\r\n           to interact directly or anything\r\n           like that. You will just be mopping\r\n           the corridor and dusting.\r\n                         \r\n          Delaney walks over to the first door on the right. There is\r\n          a hatch on the door. Delaney slowly slides it open and\r\n          beckons Lisa over. She peers inside. The cell is very basic,\r\n          white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable\r\n          looking bed and a toilet without a seat. There are thick\r\n          iron bars on one small window. A skinny man in his thirties\r\n          sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth.\r\n          He has wild hair and a scraggly beard.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           That's Jerry Kimble. He was\r\n           convicted of stabbing a young\r\n           mother forty-nine times in front of\r\n           her two year-old son, then killing\r\n           and sexually assaulting a woman\r\n           before smothering her four-year-old\r\n           daughter. They call him the Green\r\n           Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing\r\n           but was certified insane and his\r\n           lawyer got him transferred here. He\r\n           doesn't make any noise or fuss, but\r\n           he is a dangerous man. Especially\r\n           towards women. This next inmate is\r\n           even worse.\r\n          Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next\r\n          door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside.\r\n          Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man\r\n          stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his\r\n          back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes\r\n          that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch\r\n          shut.\r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as\r\n           The Long Island Cannibal. He was\r\n           abused as a child so his targets\r\n           were always paedophiles and\r\n           rapists. He'd track them down and\r\n           torture them. He would eat parts of\r\n           their body while they were still\r\n           alive.\r\n           21.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           That's horrible.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           The most horrible thing is that a\r\n           lot of the public thought he was a\r\n           hero.\r\n                         \r\n          Delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the\r\n          hallway. He slides open the hatch.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           Sadie Krenwinkel.\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa looks inside. Inside the basic cell a woman sits cross\r\n          legged on her bed. She has long flowing black hair, intense\r\n          eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead. She looks up\r\n          and smiles at Lisa. Delaney slides the hatch shut.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           What's her deal?\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           She was a member of a Witchcraft\r\n           cult. They kidnapped six people for\r\n           a demonic ritual. Five were killed\r\n           but one got away and led police to\r\n           the cult. She turned her trial into\r\n           a circus, talking about lots of\r\n           crazy stuff. The media enjoyed it\r\n           but she got certified insane by the\r\n           court. She's been around a few\r\n           institutions since. Now she's here.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Some strange stories here.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           Well those aren't the strangest.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Really?\r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           This last patient is the strangest\r\n           case.\r\n          Delaney walks over to the last door on the left. He slides\r\n          open the hatch. A singular shaft of light coming from a tiny\r\n          barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell.\r\n          Lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows.\r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           This is our resident John Doe.\r\n           Sometimes we have people with\r\n                          22\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           amnesia. Often we find out who they\r\n           are. Not so with this man.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Why is he down here?\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           They first brought him in about six\r\n           months ago. No one knows where he\r\n           came from, he literally just turned\r\n           up late one night. An orderly found\r\n           him wandering the grounds. First of\r\n           all he was like Missus Hardesty\r\n           upstairs-catatonic. Then a few\r\n           weeks later he started to respond\r\n           to Doctor Mixter and the nurses\r\n           through facial expressions and\r\n           gestures. But soon, he got violent.\r\n           Very violent. He'd have bursts of\r\n           rage and beat other patients. One\r\n           day he appeared to have a seizure\r\n           and collapsed. A young doctor tried\r\n           to take his vital signs. Patient X\r\n           here throttled him so hard he\r\n           crushed his larynx. It took six\r\n           orderlies to restrain him. Now they\r\n           won't even let him out for the\r\n           obligatory hour a day exercise. We\r\n           still don't know who he is.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Oh God.\r\n                         \r\n          Delaney stares at Lisa.\r\n                         \r\n                          DELANEY\r\n           God has nothing to do with this\r\n           man.\r\n          Delaney slams the hatch shut.

WARD X \u00ad CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa pushes open the door to Ward X. She peers down the dark\r\n          hallway. The girl is nowhere to be seen.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Little girl?\r\n          Lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors.\r\n          She can hear whispering. Lisa is drawn to the last door on\r\n          the left. She approaches with caution. Stood in front of the\r\n          door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside. John\r\n          Doe sits in the corner, cloaked in shadow. Lisa peers down\r\n          and in the centre of the floor, illuminated by a single\r\n          shaft of light from the small window, is a TEDDY BEAR. Lisa\r\n          slides the hatch shut and walks backwards. She is seriously\r\n          unnerved. As she steps back from the door she hears a\r\n          whispering from Kimble's cell. She edges closer to his cell\r\n          door and listens.\r\n           KIMBLE (O.S)\r\n           Palmer... Hey Palmer...\r\n                         \r\n          Palmer can be heard from the next cell. His voice is calm,\r\n          in stark comparison to Kimble's which sounds extremely\r\n          agitated.\r\n                         \r\n           PALMER (O.S)\r\n           Yes?\r\n                         \r\n           KIMBLE (O.S)\r\n           My cock is so hard Palmer.

Then he stops suddenly. Lisa leans\r\n          closer to the cell door and she hears Kimble sniffing. THUD!\r\n          Lisa jumps back as Kimble kicks the cell door.\r\n                         \r\n           KIMBLE (O.S)\r\n           I know you're out there girlie. I\r\n           can smell your pussy. How about you\r\n           join me in here. Come on!\r\n                         \r\n          Kimble bangs the door continuously. The racket echoes\r\n          through the corridor. Sadie soon joins in, her and Kimble\r\n          laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors. A horrified\r\n          Lisa rushes towards the exit.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          43.INT.

The morning sun bursts through the window,\r\n          filling the room with an orange hue. Lisa shuts the curtains\r\n          and slides under the duvet cover into the welcome sanctuary\r\n          of her bed. Lisa drifts to sleep.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          44.INT. BEDROOM \u00ad LISA'S HOME \u00ad EVENING\r\n          Lisa is sleeping fast as night falls outside. All we can\r\n          hear is the rhythm of her breathing and the gentle ticking\r\n          of the clock by her bedside table.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly her EYES snap open. We pull back and see that Lisa\r\n          is now stood in front of LARGE WOODEN DOORS. The doors open\r\n          and she steps inside.\r\n                         \r\n          45.INT. CHURCH \u00ad NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Lisa enters a Church full of powerful religious imagery. On\r\n          the right side of the entrance she notices a Font. A drop of\r\n          blood pierces the blessed water. As Lisa walks down the\r\n          aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and\r\n          she is moving in slow motion. White feathers cover the\r\n          aisle, bouncing around her bare feet. An open Bible rests on\r\n          the Lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong\r\n          breeze blowing them. Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the\r\n           39.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          wall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares\r\n          at her. Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down\r\n          Christ's face. As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a\r\n          female figure sat in the front pew. Lisa ebbs closer. The\r\n          figure turns. It's LISA'S MOTHER.\r\n                          LISA'S MOTHER\r\n           Don't you grieve for me?\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Of course I do.\r\n          Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks.\r\n          Lisa's mother reaches out a hand. Lisa stretches her arm out\r\n          to grab her mother's hand. Everything is in slow motion, it\r\n          seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand.\r\n          Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm. She\r\n          turns to see a HOODED FIGURE, face shrouded in darkness,\r\n          standing next to her. A deep voice echoes around the church:\r\n                         \r\n                          FIGURE\r\n           Kill them.

I believe God and Satan\r\n           are within all of us. God is our\r\n           human side. Satan is our animal\r\n           side.

(Reading) In\r\n           the 18th Century there existed a\r\n           group of Native Americans in\r\n           Amityville known as \"The Satchem\r\n           Tribe\" led by Satchem Takapausha,\r\n           the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem\r\n           in Massachusetts to escape\r\n           persecution by the Christians who\r\n           were persecuting members of the\r\n           tribe because of their Witchcraft\r\n           practices. These practices included\r\n           a ritualistic human sacrifice of\r\n           six people (The significance of Six\r\n           being related to the biblical\r\n           number of man and creation) in\r\n           order to induce the spirit of their\r\n           God, The Dark Master, who they\r\n           believed manifested his powers\r\n           through his devoted followers,\r\n           giving them immortality. The\r\n           hundred strong tribe settled in\r\n           Amityville but were later chased\r\n           off the land by local Christians.\r\n           Satchem accused the Christians of\r\n           not properly compensating his tribe\r\n           for the land. A war started and the\r\n           Christians hired a hunter called\r\n           John Underhill from Salem. At the\r\n           site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue\r\n           was later built in Amityville,\r\n           Underhill killed all of the tribe.\r\n           The Indians were buried in a mass\r\n           grave on the site. Before he died\r\n           Satchem vowed revenge. According to\r\n           local legend, Chief Satchem is\r\n           believed to have subsequently\r\n           haunted the land. Various\r\n           parapsychologists and mediums have\r\n           65.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           claimed that Satchem's vengeful\r\n           spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo\r\n           murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue\r\n           and the haunting of the subsequent\r\n           owners. Although such assertions\r\n           are widely disputed.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           So the legend has basis in\r\n           historical fact?\r\n                         \r\n                          GLORIA\r\n           Absolutely.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          72.INT.

She shares the beliefs of the\r\n           Satchem Tribe.

The patients on Ward X\r\n           spend twenty three hours a day in\r\n           the cell. They get an hour of\r\n           exercise in a small yard guarded by\r\n           six of our staff. There's no way\r\n           71.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          that any of those patients have\r\n          access to the internet or any\r\n          paraphernalia.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          Then someone is helping her get\r\n          access to this stuff! Someone who\r\n          works here! Please Doctor Mixter.\r\n          Just check out her cell and speak\r\n          to her. If I'm wrong about this and\r\n          it's all just her delusions then\r\n          fine. I'll accept that. But I had\r\n          to tell you. You testified at her\r\n          trial didn't you?\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n          Yes I did. What are you implying?\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          Nothing. I just meant you know how\r\n          dangerous she is.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n          Yes, I understand how dangerous she\r\n          is and I appreciate you coming to\r\n          express your concerns. One thing\r\n          you need to bear in mind Lisa is\r\n          that there are some very sick\r\n          patients at this institution. We do\r\n          our best to help those who can be\r\n          helped but unfortunately the\r\n          patients on Ward X are beyond help.\r\n          Their personality disorders are too\r\n          advanced, their delusions are too\r\n          grandiose. I worry that perhaps you\r\n          have been rather taken in by one of\r\n          those delusions.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n          I know that it might sound like\r\n          that. But can you check her cell\r\n          and speak to her? Look at the blog\r\n          on the internet, see if you can\r\n          connect the IP number of the writer\r\n          with a computer here at the\r\n          hospital.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n          Okay look. That does take time and\r\n          resources I don't necessarily have.\r\n          But as you've come to me with a\r\n          concern of patient infraction and\r\n          potential threat of violence, I am\r\n          duty bound to investigate.\r\n                          72\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           In fact, I'll order a cell search\r\n           immediately. Stay here for a\r\n           moment, I'll be right back.\r\n                         \r\n          Mixter exits. Lisa leans forward and a file on the desk\r\n          catches her eye. She stands up and reaches over for it. Her\r\n          NAME is on it. Lisa opens it up. Inside is a form Committing\r\n          her to the hospital as a PATIENT. Lisa looks down and the\r\n          reason stated is PARANOID DELUSION. The date on the form is\r\n          November 13th. Today. Lisa slams the file shut and the office\r\n          door opens. She turns to see Mixter stood there with\r\n          Hardcastle and another orderly.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           What the hell are you doing??\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           This is for your own good Lisa. You\r\n           need treatment.\r\n                         \r\n          The orderlies approach her. Lisa lashes out but the two men\r\n          overpower her, grabbing her arms and then tripping her. She\r\n          hits the floor with a thud. Mixter produces a syringe from\r\n          behind his back.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           This is for your own good Lisa.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Fuck you!!!\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Mixter plunges the needle into her neck.

She SLAMS the door behind\r\n          her. She clicks the lock. Lisa steps back from the door. She\r\n          JUMPS as Patient X POUNDS on the door from the other side.\r\n          Lisa looks around for a weapon. She limps toward the cutlery\r\n          drawer below a sink. She rustles inside and finds a large\r\n          butcher knife. Suddenly the door EXPLODES, a large hole\r\n          blown through the middle of it by the GUN SHOT. Patient X\r\n          reaches through, groping for the lock. Lisa reaches a large\r\n          window in the room. She tries to lift the window. After an\r\n          unsuccessful attempt at opening it she realises the window\r\n          is nailed down.\r\n                          LISA\r\n           Fuck!!\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Patient X reaches for the lock.

Lisa faces the door, bracing herself with the\r\n          knife held upwards. Everything is quiet. Suddenly the door\r\n          SHAKES as Patient X THUMPS on it. The door cracks as Patient\r\n          X SMASHES against it. Lisa crouches down with the knife at\r\n          the ready.\r\n                          82\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          The gun BLOWS a HOLE right through the door. Patient X leans\r\n          through the hole, peering down at Lisa crouched on the\r\n          floor. He aims the gun through the hole and prepares to\r\n          fire. Lisa brandishes the knife and thrusts it forward with\r\n          all her might. The blade RIPS through Patient X's right eye.\r\n          He SCREAMS and drops the gun in the cupboard before\r\n          stumbling backwards into the staff room. Patient X clasps\r\n          his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood. Lisa\r\n          grabs the gun and stands up. Patient X looks at her with his\r\n          remaining eye. Lisa aims the rifle through the hole in the\r\n          door.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA\r\n           Lights out, you son-of-a-bitch!!\r\n          BANG!

She is dressed in a\r\n          clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds.\r\n          Allison takes the hand of PATIENT X's corpse. The WHITE\r\n          LIGHT swarms over Patient X's body and he rises to his feet.\r\n          His head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. He\r\n          looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile. Allison\r\n          walks with Patient X through a doorway filled with a\r\n          blinding WHITE LIGHT.

Doctor Mixter, good\r\n           morning.\r\n                         \r\n          Mixter is sat opposite, in a very expensive suit.\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Morning Katherine, how are you?\r\n                         \r\n                          PRESENTER\r\n           I'm good thank you. So Doctor, can\r\n           you tell us a little more about the\r\n           book?\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Well, it features a blow by blow\r\n           account of the evening. It was\r\n           obviously a very harrowing\r\n           experience and for me it was rather\r\n           therapeutic to deal with my\r\n           feelings about what happened in\r\n           writing.\r\n                         \r\n                          PRESENTER\r\n           How has it affected the hospital\r\n           Doctor?\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Obviously we were all left very\r\n           numb by events for a long time and\r\n           I know a lot of people in the town\r\n           felt we should close the\r\n           institution. But that never\r\n           occurred to me. I feel that people\r\n           should be brought closer by tragedy\r\n           and the Staff and I have definitely\r\n           become closer, both as colleagues\r\n           and friends, since the incident.\r\n           That bond makes for a better\r\n           87.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           institution in my opinion, so we\r\n           will continue to go from strength\r\n           to strength.\r\n                         \r\n                          PRESENTER\r\n           You mentioned there that some\r\n           people wanted the place to close. I\r\n           know many were also resistant to\r\n           the opening of the institution in\r\n           the first place given that it was\r\n           built on the site of the infamous\r\n           house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered\r\n           his family in the seventies. I know\r\n           a lot of people associated with\r\n           that case were accused of\r\n           exploiting it for their own ends.\r\n           You've also faced some criticism\r\n           for that, particularly as we heard\r\n           last week that you have sold the\r\n           movie rights to this book. How do\r\n           you respond to that criticism?\r\n                         \r\n                          MIXTER\r\n           Well I know that some people accuse\r\n           me of hurting the memory of the\r\n           victims but I feel I'm helping the\r\n           memories of those involved live on.\r\n           Granted, some victims were\r\n           criminally insane but other victims\r\n           were loyal staff who had families\r\n           and I'm determined that they not be\r\n           forgotten. Each staff member gets\r\n           their own chapter in the book so\r\n           that the readers can get a full\r\n           picture of what wonderful people\r\n           they were. I always say that all\r\n           forms of media, whether it be\r\n           books, newspapers, TV or movies,\r\n           are a preservation of life. Our\r\n           physical bodies may die but our\r\n           images live on when we are famous.\r\n           Our work and our passion is\r\n           preserved, therefore it's as if our\r\n           souls are preserved. Through all of\r\n           these forms of media we are, in\r\n           effect, immortal.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Mixter looks straight into the camera and smiles.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          CUT TO BLACK\r\n                          88\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          The sound of children singing the nursery rhyme \"Ring Around\r\n          a Rosie\" in a slow, haunting manner echoes around our ears.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         CREDITS ROLL\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nAmityville Asylum, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Andrew Jones\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:21.126018"}
