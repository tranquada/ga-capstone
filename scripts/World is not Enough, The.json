HALLWAY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY\n\n       An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the \"private\n       banking institute\" within.\n\n       INT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY\n\n       JAMES BOND, dressed impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by\n       three THUGS in Armani suits.  They remove A GUN from inside\n       his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them\n       on the desk that separates Bond and...\n\n       LACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind him,\n       three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden.\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                 Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond,\n                 but you understand, a man in my\n                 position..\n\n                           BOND\n                 Which is neutral, no doubt.\n\n       Lachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped.  Gestures for\n       Bond to sit.\n\n       A GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped\n       suit.  She pushes a cart. On it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of\n       EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and Bond.\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                 It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the\n                 money.  No doubt Sir Robert will be\n                 pleased to see it again.\n\n       The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond,\n       setting it in his lap and opening it up...inside is a good\n       deal of CASH in pound sterling.\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                 In the current exchange rate, minus the\n                 fees, of course, and certain\n                 unforeseeable expenses.

Bond reaches for the metal case on the\n       desk...the THUGS TENSE...\n\n                           BOND\n                 My glasses.\n\n       Lachaise nods.  Bond can have his glasses.\n\n       He puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd\n       number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny:\n\n       3,030,303.03.\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                 It's all there.\n\n       Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he\n       removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise.\n\n                           BOND\n                 I didn't come for the money. The report\n                 you sold him was stolen from an MI-6\n                 agent, who was killed for it.\n\n       He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk.\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                 I did not get the report from an MI-6\n                 agent.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Who did you get it from?\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                 I am just a middle man. I am doing the\n                 honourable thing and returning the money\n                 to its rightful owner...\n\n                           BOND\n                 And we know how difficult that can be for\n                 the Swiss.\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                     (controlled fury)\n                 Your last chance.

An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun...\n\n                           BOND\n                 Perhaps you failed to take into account\n                 my...hidden assets.\n\n       Bond's mouth edges into a smile.  A flicker of doubt on\n       Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the\n       tiny arm of his glasses and...\n\n       KABOOM!  The pistol on the table FLASHES...blinding those\n       around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief\n       effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his\n       opening...\n\n       He KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun.\n       Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face and throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW\n       just as they're getting their bearings.  Now he nestles the\n       barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's\n       cheek.\n\n                           BOND\n                 The name?\n\n                           LACHAISE\n                 I can't tell you...\n                     (Bond cocks the gun)\n                 Alright, alright! But you must protect\n                 me!\n\n       And he freezes.  The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking\n       out of his neck.  Bond looks up, catches sight of the CIGAR\n       GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE ROOF.\n\n       Bond rushes to the window...\n\n       EXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY\n\n       She swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly\n       disappearing into shadows.\n\n       Bond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to...\n\n       THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door,\n       casually slipping that cigar into his pocket...\n\n       Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in\n       hand.  He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT\n       appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet\n       zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart.\n\n       Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out.\n\n       INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY\n\n       Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by\n       the elevator.  Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the\n       stairs.  Hears the elevator cage start from below.\n\n       Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into\n       the lift shaft, watches the elevator COUNTERWEIGHT as it\n       comes down.  Almost nonchalant, he steps out...\n\n       INT. STAIRWELL/ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY\n\n       As the cageful of police rises, Bond is now standing on the\n       counterweight, DESCENDING.\n\n       EXT. STREET - GENEVA\n\n       Lunchtime.  Faceless business crowds heading for their brief\n       moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one of them,\n       with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face,\n       troubled.\n\n       INT. HOTEL - GENEVA - DAY\n\n       The Cigar Girl enters a huge, high-ceilinged room. Edgy, she\n       approaches a BIG MAN standing on a balcony overlooking the\n       city.  Propped against the doorframe, an assassin's RIFLE\n       with LASER-SIGHT attached. BINOCULARS are on a tripod,\n       trained on the rooftop below where we can see cops examining\n       the shattered office windows.\n\n       The man turns. Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut.\n       There is a raised, red scar of an ENTRY WOUND at his temple.\n       It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression,\n       like an insect living just beneath his skin. One EYE seems\n       slightly drooping, deadened. The other eye is sharp and black\n       as anthracite.  It is a frightening face. This is RENARD.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 What's his name? Our friend from MI-6?\n\n                           CIGAR GIRL\n                 James Bond.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 One of M's more accomplished tin\n                 soldiers.\n\n                           CIGAR GIRL\n                 He could identify me.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 If it concerns you...kill him.\n\n       He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two\n       glasses of wine.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 Let's toast this James Bond.  We're in\n                 his hands now...\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n       EXT.

MI-6 - LONDON - DAY\n\n       Tate Gallery in background, the seaplane moors beneath the\n       vast stepped cake that is MI-6.  Bond exits with the\n       suitcase.\n\n       INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - DAY\n\n       CAMERA MOVES with Bond as he enters this secret, hi-tech\n       world.  He passes through countless security procedures,\n       watched by an attentive staff.\n\n       Bond scoops the money out of the suitcase.  Three million\n       sterling in tightly bundled hundreds makes quite a sight.  He\n       flicks his finger through the last wad, tosses it down\n       wistfully.  A blue light scans it on three axis.\n\n       The money is bundled into a clear plastic bag, put on a tray\n       and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into the\n       SECURE ROOM.  Bond hands the suitcase to a STAFF MEMBER.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Have this checked, see what you can get\n                 off it.\n\n       INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY\n\n       Bond appears, hiding something behind his back.  Moneypenny\n       brightens.\n\n                           MONEYPENNY\n                 James.

M'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY\n\n       Bond enters.  SIR ROBERT KING is perched on the edge of M's\n       desk.  Two glasses, a bottle of scotch open.\n\n                           M\n                 Sir Robert King, James Bond.\n\n       King moves toward Bond with an easy, patrician smile. Bond\n       notes a TINY BADGE in his lapel -- like the glass eye of a\n       stuffed snake.\n\n                           SIR ROBERT\n                 Thanks for getting my money back --never\n                 expected to see it again.

Bond notices it is in\n       Russian, with a SEAL from a Russian military agency in the\n       corner: MIRATOM.\n\n                           M\n                 It's a report on weapons security in the\n                 former Soviet Union, which, as you know,\n                 is shaky at best.  He's had several\n                 instances of sabotage at the pipeline,\n                 and he's understandably concerned. He\n                 called me the moment he realized its\n                 sensitive nature.\n\n       She pours a scotch for Bond.

He wore it everyday\n                 of his life.\n\n       She swallows back emotion. Looks in his eyes, with a sad half-\n       smile that unsettles him.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Are you trying to break my heart?

Inside is a tiny\n                 electrical detonator. We have reason to\n                 believe the assassin had an inside\n                 accomplice, someone who worked at this\n                 company.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 If you've come here to look after me, Mr.\n                 Bond, thank you, but no thank you.

They're\n       following a huge pipeline, passing a blighted petrified\n       forest of twisted iron:  derelict oil derricks.\n\n       Elektra gestures at the oil fields they're now leaving\n       behind.  Receding into the distance, a DELTA OF ROADWAYS\n       perched on rusting stilts juts out into the sea.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 My mother's people discovered oil here\n                 ninety years ago.

CONSTRUCTION CAMP, FOOTHILLS OF THE CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS\n       (CAPPADOCIA, THE VILLAGE OF ZELVE) - DAY\n\n       The jeep reaches a break in the pipe: a SURVEY CAMP, flags,\n       strings.  The SURVEY CREW cower behind a 4WD, local tribesman\n       are stoning them from a village carved into the rock.  A lot\n       of SHOUTING.\n\n       Before Bond can stop her, Elektra gets out, moves toward the\n       tribesmen.  The stoning ceases. They know who she is.  She\n       begins to speak quietly -- in their own tongue.\n\n       INT. CHAPEL, ZELVE - DAY\n\n       A stunning pre-Byzantine chapel hewn from the rock.  Flames\n       illuminate beautiful mosaics and paintings on the cavern\n       wall.  A COPTIC PRIEST proudly shows Elektra about, jabbering\n       in his mother tongue.  She answers in his language.\n\n       Bond watches her, impressed.\n\n       EXT.

Paraski four, the chute\n       tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to\n       maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward\n       PARASKI #2: both of them having set their course for Bond,\n       they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER...\n\n       IN THE GULLY BELOW\n\n       Bond meets up with Elektra as above them...\n\n       The two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above\n       and tumbling down, end over end.\n\n       Bond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain\n       down on them.\n\n       Then...silence.

The men stand.\n\n                           DOCTOR\n                 She's fine. Contusions.

ELEKTRA'S BEDROOM - SUNSET\n\n       Bond enters. Elektra is standing by the window watching the\n       golden ball of the sun sink into the sea. She wears nothing\n       but a silk embroidered robe; the sun shows through it,\n       outlining her naked body in soft, shadowy curves.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Are you alright?\n\n       He nods.

Who is trying to kill me?\n\n       Bond looks at her; vulnerable, fragile, trying to be strong.\n       He cannot tell her the truth.\n\n                           BOND\n                 I don't know. But I will find him.\n\n       She stares at him, sensing he is withholding something.

All\n       she has to do is tilt her mouth upward...she kisses him.  His\n       hands come up across her back, pressing her toward him, her\n       body melting into his, and then...\n\n       He pulls back. Has to physically step away from her.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 What is it?\n\n                           BOND\n                 ...you should rest.\n\n       That was exactly the wrong thing to say.

He takes out\n       the Q glasses, slips them on, surveys the room --\n\n       HIS X-RAY POV\n\n       He can see all the WEAPONS carried by the players.  All sizes\n       of pistol, even the odd grenade.  The obvious side-effect of\n       this view -- he can see through clothes.\n\n       His eyes alight on two girls walking away from him.  One of\n       them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display.  She\n       returns Bond's smile.  Her friend turns to look.  Bond's\n       smile grows:  she has a small pistol concealed over one\n       breast.\n\n       INT.

They are like two cats,\n       moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and\n       sexy, all eyes on them. He takes note as she passes...MINIMUM\n       $100, then $500, $1000...\n\n       She finally stops at the 'No limit' table.  Crowded with the\n       nastiest and richest of the high rollers, Armenians, Turks,\n       South Americans, a computer nerd American and a Russian\n       industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink.\n\n       ZUKOVSKY is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the\n       center.\n\n                           ZUKOVSKY\n                 We've kept your father's chair free.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 And his account?\n\n                           ZUKOVSKY\n                 You have a credit line of a million and a\n                 half.\n\n       He gestures to the Dealer, who pushes ten towering stacks of\n       CHIPS toward her. A WAITRESS is right there to take her\n       order.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Vodka martini.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Two.

Now I'm\n                 looking for a bigger thrill.\n\n       She pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them\n       stand on her bet.  The whole table exhales. Then, it starts:\n       bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival.\n\n       Bond scans the room, vigilant, nervous...\n\n       HIS P.O.V.  He zeroes in on Davidov, sidling off, away from\n       the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this\n       way and that...he looks suspicious as hell.\n\n       Bond watches, his blood running, and then...\n\n       Davidov slips into the HOSTESS BAR.  A HOOKER is soon\n       wrapping herself around him. After a few words, she leads him\n       off toward the back.\n\n       Bond returns to the game, shaking his head.  He watches as\n       THE DEALER DEALS FROM THE SHOE.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n       INT. SALON PRIV\u0090 - NIGHT\n\n       A small room.

He faces a\n       small ornate mirror over the sink, in which he can see THE\n       HOOKER behind him, on the bed.\n\n                           HOOKER\n                 You want to be...on top, or not on top?\n\n                           DAVIDOV\n                 On top.\n\n       She slowly pulls a pair of SILK ROPES out from her bra and\n       DANGLES THEM.\n\n                           HOOKER\n                 Tied up, or not tied up?\n\n       Davidov smiles, struggling with his belt.

They're entwined between the sheets.  This is\n       something slow, languorous, not to be rushed.  We can't make\n       out the mechanics, but they're beaded with sweat.\n\n       Her fingers trace the contours of his torso.

Pulls her lush hair back...\n\n       The lower half of her ear is gone, reduced to a misshapen\n       clump of scar tissue. It is the only mark on her perfect\n       body.

He carries a\n       briefcase from the car to the front door of the security\n       office. He looks around furtively before he disappears\n       inside.\n\n       The parking area is dark and silent and then:\n\n       JAMES BOND sits up in the driver's seat of his BMW.\n\n       INT.

He flicks\n       another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system\n       activates in his WINDSCREEN...\n\n       He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the\n       security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE\n       BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK.\n\n       He goes back inside.\n\n       BOND gets out of the BMW.  He moves stealthily to the Russian\n       vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the\n       lock on the trunk.  It pops open.\n\n       Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING\n       ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside:\n\n       A MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped\n       forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet\n       ...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD\n       EYES.\n\n       Bond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket.\n\n       It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and\n       Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR.  On the corner of\n       the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the\n       report.  Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it.\n\n       AT THE OFFICE\n\n       Davidov is coming out...\n\n       Bond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car.\n\n       AT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE\n\n       Davidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian\n       car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then...\n\n       HE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks\n       AROUND the entire car.  When he gets to the rear...\n\n       THE TRUNK IS CLOSED.  Bond is not there.  No evidence he ever\n       was.\n\n       Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n       EXT.

CAR\n\n       Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded\n       area.\n\n       EXT. CAR\n\n       Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and\n       opens the trunk.\n\n       He removes the briefcase.  Then the duffle bag.  He looks\n       down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before...but\n       something is different, the clothes not quite right and then:\n\n       THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps...\n\n       It IS JAMES BOND.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Problem, comrade?\n\n       Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is\n       quicker.  With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the\n       head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes\n       go wide and he crumbles, dead.\n\n       Bond climbs out of the trunk.  Crouches to examine Davidov.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Old habits die hard.\n\n       He straightens.  Picks up the briefcase.  It is locked.  He\n       searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.  He\n       opens the lock.\n\n       INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:  FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.  Documents\n       headed with the official crest of Miratom.  A new security\n       tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's\n       name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags --\n       and a polaroid-type camera.\n\n       He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the\n       camera.  Points at himself, takes a shot.  Punches in\n       'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.  Out comes a brand new pass.\n\n       Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but...\n\n       A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP.\n\n       HIS P.O.V.  A Russian military jet appears over the trees,\n       flying low, its red landing lights blinking.\n\n       EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT\n\n       A door opens on the sinister-looking plane.  A hydraulic step\n       unit folds out of it.  A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits\n       in the doorway.\n\n       BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge\n       and picks up the briefcase.  He has NO IDEA what he's walking\n       into.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Here goes nothing.\n\n       He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to\n       the plane.  He starts up the steps:\n\n       THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him\n       IN RUSSIAN.\n\n       Bond pauses.  And then, thinking, says:\n\n                           BOND\n                 Romashka.\n\n       The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon.\n\n       INT. PLANE\n\n       Four soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two\n       young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a\n       big, thick-necked tough.\n\n       They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or\n       do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the\n       briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY.\n\n       The Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still\n       stare at him.  The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that\n       sounds like...\"where's the rest?\"\n\n       Bond swallows.  Thinks, without showing it.  He decides to\n       OPEN THE DUFFLE BAG.  He looks inside. Pauses, then reaches\n       in and takes out...A BOX OF NIKE SHOES.\n\n       The thin soldier smiles. That's the ticket. Bond hands out\n       shoes to the rest of the guys.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n       EXT. TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAWN\n\n       A red dawn.

TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY\n\n       They turn the corner and see trucks marked IDA, several\n       Kazakhstan army personal carriers, soldiers dotted around,\n       IDA (International Decommissioning Agency) scientists and\n       personnel quietly going about their business.  A vast\n       protective 'bubble' is inflated at the front of the building.\n\n       INT.

CHRISTMAS JONES is mid-twenties, shortish\n       hair, hot right now.  In one movement she unzips and steps\n       out of the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off\n       shorts, heavy duty boots.  A nasty-looking hunting knife\n       strapped around her hips.  She has a deep tan and an\n       incredible figure.\n\n       She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles.\n\n       Bond tosses an arched brow to Akakievich, who nods bitterly,\n       also unable to take his eyes off her.  He spits on the floor\n       and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear.\n\n                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH\n                 Not interested in men.

TEST CHAMBER ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR - LATER\n\n       The elevator creaks to a halt.  He slides the elevator doors\n       OPEN revealing...\n\n       TWO SOLDIERS waiting for the elevator.

A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more\n       open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming\n       there.\n\n       Bond starts down the passageway.\n\n       INT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Ahead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a\n       NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit.\n\n       Blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring\n       equipment.\n\n       Bond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment. Then, he comes\n       to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the\n       opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in\n       Russian Army fatigues.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Corporal?\n\n       The man turns...\n\n       IT IS RENARD.\n\n       He smiles.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 I see my friend Davidov ran into some\n                 difficulty.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Indeed.\n\n       Renard starts toward him.

I'm already dead.\n\n       He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a\n       ROBOT DEVICE beginning to lower it into the pit.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 Go ahead.  Shoot.  My men will still\n                 steal the bomb, and the shot will bring\n                 them directly to you.\n\n       Renard gestures into the pit.\n\n       BOND'S P.O.V.  TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware of\n       what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One\n       of them is using a manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN\n       REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner.\n\n       Bond aims his gun at Renard's head.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?\n\n       Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the\n       pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 To die by a man who can't even grasp what\n                 he's caught up in...\n\n       Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove\n       a SMALL DEVICE from inside the bomb.  It is the size and\n       shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on\n       it...the man slips it into his pocket.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's\n                 clever is getting someone else to pay for\n                 it.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 Not many people in this world have that\n                 kind of fortune.\n\n       Bond cocks the pistol.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Who is it?\n\n                           RENARD\n                 You think I fear death? I welcome it. I\n                 get on my knees and pray for it. You, on\n                 the other hand, you have something to\n                 live for, no?\n                     (closer now)\n                 She's beautiful isn't she? You should\n                 have seen her before. Flawless, and still\n                 so innocent, not such a whore in bed...\n\n       Bond's eyes flare in fury.  He shoves Renard into the wall\n       and presses the gun to his temple.\n\n                           BOND\n                 You will never touch her. You will never\n                 get near her.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 Have you forgotten who saved your life in\n                 Geneva?\n\n                           BOND\n                 Consider me ungrateful.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 It's I who should thank you -- for taking\n                 that money back to MI-6.  So distressing\n                 for M.  An explosion inside her lair.\n\n                           BOND\n                 She'll get over it.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 You even brought the plane for us.  We\n                 really couldn't have done it without you.\n\n       Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol.  Renard\n       drops to his knees.  He touches his temple, looks at the\n       blood curiously, feeling no pain.\n\n                           RENARD\n                 A man tires of being executed.\n\n       As Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun:\n\n                           RENARD\n                 But then again...There is no point in\n                 living if you can't...feel alive.\n\n       Bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...IT FREEZES\n       HIM, just a beat, but it is enough...\n\n       SUDDENLY, the noise of footsteps -- CHRISTMAS JONES, with\n       COLONEL AKAKIEVICH and two armed soldiers.\n\n       We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and\n       see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard --\n       classic execution stance:\n\n                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH\n                     (to Bond)\n                 Drop your gun.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Keep away, Colonel.\n\n       The soldiers' guns are trained on Bond.\n\n                           CHRISTMAS\n                 He is an impostor.\n                     (clutching a printout)\n                 There's no Davidov at Miratom.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Here's your imposter. He's paid off the\n                 men on the plane outside.  They're not\n                 taking the bomb to any Russian facility,\n                 they're flying it wherever he tells them.\n\n       Christmas is listening, but Akakievich cocks his rifle.\n\n                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH\n                     (to Bond)\n                 I said drop it.\n\n       And he means business.  Bond delays ... but has no choice.\n       He pulls the clip from his gun, tosses it down.\n\n                           RENARD\n                     (to Christmas)\n                 Well done -- he would have killed us all.\n                 I suppose you\n                     (to Akakievich)\n                 were you the one who allowed him down?\n\n       Colonel Akakievich looks suitably stung.  But Renard is\n       looking past him now, as with a quiet WHIRR, the BOMB raises\n       into view on a trolley.  Renard's team is ready to move.\n\n                           RENARD\n                     (to Akakievich)\n                 Take him away, I don't want him around as\n                 we move the bomb.\n                     (whispered, to Bond)\n                 You had me.  I knew you couldn't shoulder\n                 the responsibility...\n\n       And Renard jams his hand onto Bond's shoulder, squeezing his\n       collar-bone hard...  Pain jolts through Bond, he drops to his\n       knees in agony. He shoves Bond down.  Bond's hand goes to his\n       shoulder, his mind now racing -- how did he know to hurt him\n       there?\n\n       Renard's men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving\n       passageway.  It's all too much for Colonel Akakievich:\n\n                           COLONEL AKAKIEVICH\n                 No -- the bomb does not go anywhere until\n                 I am satisfied.  All of you to the\n                 surface, now...\n\n       Renard stops and turns.  Bond sees him nod to two of his men:\n       one quietly slopes off down the tunnel.  The other innocently\n       opens a container...\n\n       INT. CONTAINER\n\n       Camera shows the INSIDE of the container's lid; the man\n       releases a false lining to reveal several MACHINE GUNS...\n\n       INT.

We will all go up.\n\n       One of Colonel Akakievich's men gestures with his gun that\n       Bond should get up.  Knowing it's now or never, Bond PUSHES\n       him away, yanks a PISTOL from his holster, GRABS Christmas,\n       LEAPS down into the bomb PIT just as\n\n       RENARD'S MEN open fire...  Akakievich dies straight away.  So\n       do two of his men.  The gunfire RICOCHETS around the chamber\n       and ceases.\n\n       Renard hangs back.  His radio crackles a message:\n\n                           RENARD\n                     (nods, into radio)\n                 Shut them.\n\n       THE GUY ON THE OTHER END OF THE RADIO\n\n       Right next to the ELEVATOR.  He turns a switch that activates\n       two sets of red buttons and two sets of green.\n\n       He punches one green button...\n\n       INSIDE TEST CHAMBER\n\n       Heavy doors close all exits but that to the tunnel.\n\n       INT. THE PIT\n\n       Bond and Christmas know they are being sealed in.\n\n                           CHRISTMAS\n                 Melt-down doors.  If he gets them closed,\n                 they won't be opened again for forty-\n                 eight years.\n\n       Bond peers over the edge -- sees Renard and his men working\n       the nuclear device into THE PASSAGEWAY.\n\n       INT. THE PIT\n\n       If Bond doesn't get through now, they're trapped forever.  He\n       points his wrist watch toward the cat walk above and presses\n       a button...THE TINY GRAPPLING HOOK shoots out, Q's super\n       filament wire that can hold up to 800 pounds is\n       attached...Bond uses the rope to RAPPEL UP THE SIDES OF THE\n       PIT and into\n\n       INT. TEST CHAMBER\n\n       Where he LEAPS ON TOP OF Renard's last man.  They fall\n       THROUGH THE IRIS, it SHUTS behind them.  The man swings his\n       machine gun at Bond -- it hits the wall next to him, breaks\n       apart.  Bond grabs a broken section and kills him with one\n       strike.\n\n       He pauses at his dead body and reaches into his jacket,\n       retrieving...THE CARD-LIKE DEVICE.\n\n       INT. PIT\n\n       Christmas looks around, desperate to help.  Using Bond's\n       wire, she climbs up to the CLOSED IRIS DOOR.  She pries open\n       a panel next to it and reveals complex WIRING...\n\n       INT. PASSAGEWAY\n\n       Up ahead of Bond, the bomb disappears down the passageway. He\n       can see it is attached to A PULLEY above, helping the men to\n       move quickly, Renard, pulling, the two men pushing\n\n       Renard signals one of them to drop back to cut off Bond...\n\n       Machine-gun fire turns the wall next to Bond to dust -- Bond\n       dives to a recess.  An overhead LIGHT SHATTERS.  His section\n       of the tunnel darkens.\n\n       INT. PASSAGEWAY - BOND'S END\n\n       Bond looks up at the broken LIGHT.  Takes careful aim at the\n       next one along.  BLAM.  It disintegrates.  Again...\n\n       INT. PASSAGEWAY - RENARD'S END\n\n       The other guy answers with another spray of bullets.  Watches\n       uneasily as Bond takes out light after light.  A funnel of\n       darkness coming to swallow him -- concealing Bond's approach.\n       Nervous, he fires, muzzle flash and sparks illuminating the\n       void.  To keep it lit, he keeps firing...\n\n       INT. PASSAGEWAY\n\n       WITH BOND as the bullets cease with a loud CLICK...  What\n       Bond was waiting for.  He moves.  The gunman frozen in the\n       light, grappling to fit another clip --\n\n       BLAM!  He goes down.  Bond not wasting bullets.\n\n       INT. OTHER END OF PASSAGEWAY\n\n       Renard is loading the bomb it into the ELEVATOR. He flicks a\n       switch on the panel by the elevator.  The IRIS starts closing\n       on Bond...\n\n       INT.

He makes a spectacular leap\n       to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus,\n       dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the\n       overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks.\n\n       ON THE BUS\n\n       Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him.\n       They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus\n       speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy\n       over...\n\n       The thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS...\n\n       Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has\n       climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with\n       his gun when...\n\n       THE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug\n       Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly\n       ELECTROCUTED.\n\n       Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond\n       time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE\n       BUS...\n\n       EXT. STREET\n\n       Thug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast\n       moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van\n       and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR.\n\n       ON THE BUS\n\n       Bond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them.\n\n       The bus is hissing to a stop.\n\n       The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck.  Bond rushes\n       forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi.  The taxi\n       jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to\n       the street.  He springs to his feet.\n\n       Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for\n       traffic.  The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley.\n\n       EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEY - DAY\n\n       The Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water\n       pipes and drink coffee.  The Boa is nowhere to be seen.\n\n       Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his\n       leg so as not to alarm the civilians.  He steps into the\n       cafe.\n\n       EXT. ISTANBUL - CAFE - DAY\n\n       Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the\n       back.  He looks inside - just a few children  at play.  Bond\n       is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which\n       brings him to his knees.  He struggles to bring up his gun -\n       but the Boa knocks it out of his hand.\n\n       The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from\n       behind.  Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail.\n       He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach.\n\n       Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it.\n       Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across\n       the room.  He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear.\n\n                           BOA\n                 For years I was told I could never take\n                 the great James Bond and his Walther PPK.\n                 What good is your gun now, Bond?\n\n       Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim.  He slumps\n       forward, his left hand touches something hot.  It's the iron\n       basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite.  Bond's\n       fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top.  He\n       grabs it and with his last reserves -\n\n       Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side\n       of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT\n       SKILLET.\n\n       The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of\n       his face.  Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying\n       to clear his head.\n\n       The Boa runs out the back door.  Bond finds his gun, holsters\n       it and follows.\n\n       EXT. ISTANBUL - SIDE STREET - DAY\n\n       Bond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND\n       SHOPPERS.  Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the\n       crowd to...\n\n       EXT. ISTANBUL - FERRY TERMINAL - DAY\n\n       RUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo.  Bond enters square in\n       time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian\n       steamer.\n\n       As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to\n       the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo\n       net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom.\n\n       EXT. RUSSIAN STEAMER - DAY\n\n       Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck.  He lumbers across it\n       but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by\n       Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck\n       house.  The Boa goes sprawling.  As Bond comes for him he\n       scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and\n       swings at Bond.  But Bond is ready for him.  He wards off the\n       blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.  He\n       traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks\n       in the solar plexus.  He Boa stages back to the railing.  A\n       final kick from Bond sends him over the side...\n\n       THE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A\n       SICKENING THUD.\n\n       Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his\n       neck broken.\n\n       Bond sighs, turns...\n\n       GABOR is there. Gun trained on him.\n\n                           GABOR\n                 Welcome aboard, Mr. Bond.\n\n       BOND'S P.O.V.  A thug steps into sight below, holding\n       CHRISTMAS hostage as well.\n\n       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY\n\n       A magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the Bosphorus.\n\n       An innocent-looking launch coasts up to it.  A tarp is raised\n       and Bond and Christmas are revealed, hands bound.  They are\n       helped out, led inside by a number of henchmen.\n\n       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - DAY\n\n       Elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open.  Kisses Bond\n       on the cheek as she eyes Christmas.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 James Bond and his amazing resurrection.\n                 If only you'd kept away, we might have\n                 met again in a few years, become lovers\n                 once more.\n\n       Christmas eyes Bond anew as Elektra leads him to an ornately\n       carved chair, covered in silk.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                     (to guards)\n                 Take her to Renard.\n\n       Bond and Christmas exchange a look as the guards start her\n       towards some steps.\n\n       Elektra indicates for him to sit.  Behind him, the whole of\n       Istanbul is visible through a large curved window.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Pretty thing.  You had her too?\n\n       Bond ignores her.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 I could have given you the world.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Not interested.\n\n       This cuts. She casually reaches behind his neck, flips up a\n       wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar.  A GAROTTE.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 They were digging near here and they\n                 found some very pretty vases.  They also\n                 found this...\n                     (meaning the garotte)\n                 I think we ignore the old ways at our\n                 peril, don't you?\n\n       Bond recoils as she fastens the collar...  She steps back.\n\n                           BOND\n                     (ignoring her)\n                 Where's M?\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Soon she'll be everywhere.\n\n       Bond keeps his cool:\n\n                           BOND\n                 All this, because you fell for Renard?\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Five more turns and your neck will break.\n\n       She moves to the back of the chair, twists the screw ONE\n       NOTCH.  The effect on Bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts\n       into the back of his neck, tilts his head back.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Since I was a child, I've always had a\n                 power over men. When I realized my father\n                 wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, I\n                 knew I had to form a new alliance.\n\n                           BOND\n                     (realizing)\n                 You turned Renard.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                     (smiling)\n                 Just like you...only you were even\n                 easier.\n\n       She pulls the jewel from her ear, reveals the ugly scar:\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 I told him he had to hurt me, he had to\n                 make it look real. When he refused I told\n                 him I would do it myself.\n\n       She turns the screw again.\n\n                           BOND\n                 So you killed your father.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 He killed me! He killed me the day he\n                 refused to pay my ransom.\n\n       A flicker of emotion.  Bond is getting to her.\n\n                           BOND\n                 Was this all about the oil?\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 It is my oil!  Mine and my family's!\n\n       Her eyes are shining.  She moves toward the view, gazing out\n       at this spectacular cradle of civilization.  Bond works his\n       wristbinds feverishly.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.\n                 I'm going to redraw the map.\n                 And when I am through the whole world\n                 will know my name, my grandfather's name,\n                 the glory of my people.\n\n                           BOND\n                 No-one will believe this melt-down was an\n                 accident.\n\n       She eyes him, impressed that he's worked out her plan.\n       Tightens the screw again.  Her confidence amazing.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 They will believe.  They will all\n                 believe.\n\n       Tightening the screw again:\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 You understand? Nobody can resist me.\n\n       Now she straddles him.  She puts the jewel back on her ear.\n       All the time, he's working that wristbind.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Know what happens when a man is\n                 strangled?\n\n                           BOND\n                 Elektra, it's not too late.  Eight\n                 million people needn't die.\n\n       She smiles, twists the screw again.  A nasty, grinding sound.\n       Sweat trickles from his brow.  She licks it away.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 You should have killed me when you had\n                 the chance.  But you couldn't. Not me.  A\n                 woman you've loved.\n\n       She pushes her hips into his.  Turns the screw.  The bolt is\n       jammed right into the back of his neck.  His face is angled\n       upwards.  Breathing is difficult.  He glares up:\n\n                           BOND\n                 You meant ... nothing ... to me.\n\n       She fingers the bolt.  Prepares to turn it the last\n       time...His hand strains at its binding...\n\n                           BOND\n                 One... last... screw?\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                     (kissing his ear)\n                 Oh James.\n\n       She begins to turn the screw...\n\n       ... when SEVERAL GUNSHOTS are heard outside.\n\n       Bond is on the edge of consciousness.\n\n       Elektra freezes.  Gets off him.  Moves to a window.\n\n       EXT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY\n       HER POV:\n\n       Big, battered and bloody, Valentin Zukovsky is leaving a\n       boat, moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of\n       his men.  Two bodies in his trail.  He's on course for\n       Elektra and nothing is going to stop him, even as his\n       henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire.\n\n       INT. MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - DAY\n\n       Elektra moves to her gun.  Just then, Gabor crashes through a\n       stained glass window, neck broken.\n\n       TWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors\n       burst open.  Zukovsky stands there.  A bloody giant.\n\n       They open up with machine guns, but two shots from Zukovsky\n       take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder.  Right\n       now, he's unstoppable.\n\n       A shocked silence after the shooting.  He eyes Bond in the\n       chair.  To the room:\n\n                           ZUKOVSKY\n                 I'm looking for a submarine.  It's big\n                 and black, and the driver is a friend of\n                 mine.\n\n       Then his eye falls on the HAT Renard had brought up from\n       below.  He knows at once what it means.\n\n                           ZUKOVSKY\n                 Bring it to me.\n\n       She picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun\n       beneath it).  She proffers the hat...\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 What a shame.  You just missed him.\n\n       BLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat.\n\n       He staggers back.  Stares.  Slumps down.  Lowers his head to\n       the ground.\n\n       She walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses down,\n       smiling a half-psychotic smile.  The gun is pinned.\n\n       Zukovsky is dying.\n\n       But he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun\n       a millimetre off the ground, his outstretched arm already\n       pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as\n       Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger:  he's going\n       to shoot Bond!\n\n       Bond stares back.  Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for\n       extreme accuracy...\n\n       BLAM! The SHOT hits the binding at Bond's wrist.  Splinters\n       the wood there.\n\n       ELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky.  She didn't see where the bullet\n       went, just that it missed Bond.  She watches his head slump\n       further, staring at Bond...\n\n       A look passes between the two men.  Comrades in arms.  The\n       merest of smiles.  Then the light fades from his eyes.  Dead.\n\n       ELEKTRA\n\n       turns back to Bond.  Smiles.\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Excuse me.\n\n       She picks up a walkie-talkie, speaks into it:\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Everything's under control up here.  Are\n                 you ready?\n\n                           RENARD\n                     (filtered)\n                 Yes.  Au revoir...\n\n       Lost for a moment, she breathes heavily.  She glances at\n       Zukovsky's corpse.  Slightly puzzled, to Bond:\n\n                           ELEKTRA\n                 Zukovsky really hated you.\n                     (beat)\n                 Time to say goodnight.\n\n       And she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer\n       twist...\n\n       One super-fast movement:\n\n       Bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight.  He holds\n       her, their faces close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls\n       her backwards, her hand scratching at his face.\n\n       Ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet.  Moves\n       to Zukovsky, checks his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his\n       fingers.\n\n       Turns back, to see Elektra disappearing upstairs.  A moment's\n       dilemma:  should he race below to the sub -- or up to\n       Elektra?\n\n       He takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n       EXT.

Clutches Zukovsky's bloody wet gun.\n\n       He heads up in the semi-darkness -- and suddenly swings to\n       his right, at an unexpected but familiar Voice:\n\n                           M\n                 Bond --\n\n       Bond kicks open a door and enters...\n\n       M'S PRISON ROOM\n\n       He fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her.

ROOF, ISTANBUL - NIGHT\n\n       A magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul.\n       Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger.\n\n       FIREWORKS explode above. They clink glasses.  He looks out at\n       the cityscape.\n\n                           BOND\n                 I love Christmas in Turkey.\n\n                           CHRISTMAS\n                 So isn't it time you unwrapped your\n                 present?\n\n       INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n       Tanner and Q look at a SATELLITE THERMAL IMAGE OF ISTANBUL.\n\n                           TANNER\n                 That's strange.\n\n       The satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a\n       side street.  We can just make out Bond's ASTON MARTIN.\n\n                           TANNER\n                 He must be nearby.\n\n       M comes over.\n\n       The image moves from the car, closes on the garden rooftop.\n       The thermal image is multi-coloured, difficult to decipher.\n\n                           M\n                 Where?\n\n                           Q\n                 This picks up body heat.  Humans should\n                 be orange.\n                     (searching)\n                 There.\n\n       And he points to ONE orange figure lying on the rooftop.\n\n                           M\n                     (to Tanner)\n                 I thought you said he was with Doctor\n                 Jones?\n\n       They all look back to the image.  The figure is turning RED,\n       almost glowing.\n\n                           M\n                 It's getting redder.\n\n       Tanner, Q and M realize as one that this is an image of two\n       people, one atop the other.  And getting hotter.\n\n                           M\n                 Bond.\n\n       Q switches the screen off, clears his throat.\n\n                           Q\n                 Could be a premature form of the\n                 Millennium Bug.\n\n       EXT.
