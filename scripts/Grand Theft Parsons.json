PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          A phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the\n          open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It\n          sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty\n          bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays.\n          EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT\n          \n          A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the\n          night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly,\n          its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels\n          sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver\n          fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and\n          he's in a hurry.\n          \n          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT\n          \n          Two figures are struggling on the floor. The male is\n          naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent,\n          her breath fast. They appear to be having sex.\n          \n          EXT. TRIKE. DAWN\n          \n          The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show\n          desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering\n          neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.\n          \n          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a\n          bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there\n          is also a man's shape, which now moves.\n          \n          INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT\n          \n          A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and\n          woman are struggling. There is fear on her face.\n          \n          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly\n          off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the\n          sleep away and looks for the damn phone.\n          \n                                                                 2.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT.

He is motionless underneath her.\n          \n          EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN\n          \n          The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the\n          driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in\n          one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped\n          'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.\n          \n          INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          The man finally answers the phone.   At last the ringing\n          stops.\n                               PHIL\n                    Hello?\n          \n          EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT\n          \n          The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking\n          quickly through the room.\n          \n          As he searches, we hear:\n          \n                              WOMAN'S VOICE\n                    Oh my God please help me!

Then get out\n                         of there. Okay? Okay?\n          \n                                   WOMAN'S VOICE\n                         Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...\n          \n          He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and\n          glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and\n          for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.\n          \n          EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING\n          \n          The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital.\n          There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a\n          reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background.\n          Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks\n          to the entrance.\n          \n          INT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          We move through the reception area up to the nurses'\n          station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a\n          nurse's uniform.\n          \n                                   NURSE\n                         You wanna run that by me again,\n                         sir?\n          \n                                  PHIL\n                         Okay. I'd like to see Gram\n                         Parsons.\n          \n          They stare at each other.\n          \n                                                                4.\n          CON TINUE D:\n          \n                                   NURSE\n                         You want to see Gram Parsons?\n          \n                                   PHIL\n                         Yes. Alone, if possible. And\n                         would you have a gurney standing\n                         by in case I need to move him?\n          \n          She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from\n          under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is\n          wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked\n          cigar.\n          \n                                   NURSE\n                         And you are.... his physician?\n                         Or perhaps a close relative?\n          Phil clears his throat.\n          \n                                   PHIL\n                         Actually, I'm his road manager.\n          \n          The big nurse smiles mirthlessly.\n          \n                                   NURSE\n                         So you're not his physician or a\n                         close relative?\n          \n          A beat.\n          \n                                   PHIL\n                         No.\n          \n                                   NURSE\n                         Mister Parsons is awaiting a post\n                         mortem. He will then be\n                         delivered to his family. I\n                         suggest you speak to them if you\n                         wish to pick through his personal\n                         effects. Sir.\n          \n          She turns away.\n          \n                                   PHIL\n                         Now listen here...\n          \n                                   NURSE\n                         No, you listen here. Mister\n                         Parsons is dead and no longer\n                         appears to need a road manager.\n                         Which makes two of us.\n          \n          The nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits\n          until she's gone and then walks through a door marked\n          'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'.\n          \n                                                                  5.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM. MORNING\n          \n          Phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash.\n          He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a\n          hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door.\n          \n          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING\n          \n          Phil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and\n          checking signs. He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'.\n          \n          INT. HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB. MORNING\n          \n          The room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on\n          trolleys. Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils\n          at whatever it is which lies beneath.\n                              PHIL\n                    Sheesh!\n          \n          He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet.   He\n          stares down at the body, visibly moved.\n          \n                              PHIL (CONT'D)\n                    Hello buddy. How you been?\n          \n          He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking\n          down at his friend. Then he snaps out of it.\n          \n                              PHIL (CONT'D)\n                    Well, I can't stand around here\n                    chatting with you all day.\n                    Things to do...\n          \n          He wheels the gurney towards the door.\n          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING\n          \n          Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit.\n          A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a\n          clipboard.\n          \n                              DOCTOR\n                    Can I help you?\n          \n                              PHIL\n                    Naw, I'm cool thanks.\n          \n          The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe.\n          \n                              DOCTOR\n                    What are you doing?\n          \n                               PHIL\n                    Just taking some stiff down to\n                    neurology.\n          \n                                                                  6.\n          CON TINUE D:\n          \n                                   DOCTOR\n                         We don't have a neurology\n                         department.\n          \n                                    PHIL\n                         Urology.\n          \n          The doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the\n          doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes\n          his head in frustration.\n          \n                                   PHIL (CONT'D)\n                         Okay. Just hold your horses -\n                         I'll go check the paperwork.\n          \n          The doctor holds up his clipboard.\n                                   DOCTOR\n                         I have the paperwork.\n          \n                                   PHIL\n                         No. You have your paperwork. I\n                         need to go check my paperwork.\n          \n          He slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly     for\n          a few seconds, and then pushes open the door.\n          \n                                    DOCTOR\n                         Hello?

MORNING\n          Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction.      To\n          the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the\n          left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it\n          skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying\n          across the road.\n          \n          NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through\n          the desert, set to music.\n          \n          EXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAY\n          \n          The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two\n          enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant\n          Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six\n          foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets\n          out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his\n          pocket.\n          \n                                                                 7.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT.

We\n          see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips\n          through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is\n          SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes.\n          \n                                 SUSIE\n                    Guess who?\n          \n                              PHIL\n                    Martin Luther King.\n          \n                              SUSIE\n                    Try again...\n          Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a\n          long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes\n          kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull\n          away with little success.\n          \n                              PHIL\n                    This.... ...isn't.... ...the\n                    best time... ...Baby....\n          \n          Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to\n          resist.

Phil's shoulders sag\n          and he slumps against the wall. Then Susie reappears with\n          a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses. She\n          pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil.\n          \n                                   SUSIE\n                         Come here...\n          \n          After a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room.\n          \n          INT.

As you travel around\n                         the circle, white or black will\n                         increase until the opposite color\n                         is almost gone.

Let me give you an\n                    example: To truly know good, you\n                    must first know evil, and without\n                    good as a comparison, nothing can\n                    be evil. So by allowing Yin to\n                    flourish, you welcome Yan. By\n                    letting go of Yin, you are\n                    waiting for its return. Another\n                    example is...\n          \n          There is a crash, and the car slams to a halt. Larry is\n          thrown forward, but manages to grab the wheel.
