SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FADE UP:\r\n          Moving through a tract development. The houses are like\r\n          Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just\r\n          mixed differently.\r\n          A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern\r\n          emerges...\r\n          Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut\r\n          brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and\r\n          pizza joint flyers.\r\n          Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly\r\n          abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.\r\n          A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence:\r\n\r\n          VOICE (O.S.)\r\n          Defy reason. Defy everything you\r\n          know.\r\n          Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the\r\n          block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows.\r\n\r\n          INT. SUBURBAN HOME/VARIOUS -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Inside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The\r\n          living room is empty, but the TV's on.\r\n\r\n          ON THE TELEVISION\r\n          A commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution,\r\n          he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie\r\n          imagery.\r\n          Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a\r\n          girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man.\r\n\r\n                         TELEVISION ANNOUNCER\r\n          Peter Vincent's \"FRIGHT NIGHT.\"\r\n          The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left\r\n          of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.\r\n\r\n          TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)\r\n          Something's moving in the dark.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n          Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress.\r\n          \"Magic, the Gathering\"... Elves and Wizards.\r\n\r\n          TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)\r\n          Only at The Hard Rock. Nightly\r\n          Wednesday Through Sunday.\r\n          Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT\r\n          coming from another room.\r\n\r\n                         DISTANT VOICE\r\n          Get off her!!\r\n          More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly\r\n          domestic scene.\r\n          We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps\r\n          through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes\r\n          toward us.\r\n          He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind\r\n          terror.\r\n          We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A\r\n          teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping.\r\n          We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if\r\n          something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it.\r\n          We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered,\r\n          as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the\r\n          wall, which Adam nearly falls over.\r\n\r\n          INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDING/BEDROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          ADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse -\r\n          - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed.\r\n          Blood on pale pink sheets.\r\n          ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see\r\n          Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd\r\n          hidden under the bed.\r\n          ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the\r\n          gun. It's just beyond his grasp.\r\n\r\n                         ADAM\r\n          Come on, come on, come on...\r\n          He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in\r\n          his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n                         ADAM (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on, come on!\r\n          He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking\r\n          hands.\r\n          THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is\r\n          exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms over\r\n\r\n                         HIM --\r\n          Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin...\r\n          Human but not quite.\r\n          Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead.\r\n          HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:\r\n\r\n           DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)\r\n           .we're looking at a nice day here\r\n           in Clark County, hitting a season\r\n          low of only 89 degrees...\r\n\r\n          EXT. SHADOW HILLS - DAY\r\n\r\n          MUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH\r\n          ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before.\r\n          In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even.\r\n          Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes\r\n          in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat.\r\n\r\n          DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)\r\n          .so get out there and enjoy this\r\n          beautiful Wednesday, people.\r\n          We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing\r\n          MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the\r\n          rear window.\r\n          The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so\r\n          foreboding now.\r\n          We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL\r\n          that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time\r\n          that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT.\r\n          In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas\r\n          proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked\r\n          Pleasure Island.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CLOSE ON:\r\n          The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street.\r\n          WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as\r\n          fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          (to the bike/pissed)\r\n          You want me to take you apart, huh?\r\n          Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who\r\n           just recently came into his body and good looks.\r\n          He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite\r\n          trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          (still talking to bike)\r\n          I will. I'll sell you for parts.\r\n          Don't think I won't--\r\n          Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches\r\n           him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to\r\n          the curb.\r\n          She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her\r\n          ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike,\r\n          amused.\r\n\r\n                         DORIS\r\n          Nothing doing, huh?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          The thing's got no ambition.\r\n          (re: trash cans)\r\n          Can I -- uh, give you a hand?\r\n\r\n                         DORIS\r\n          I got it. Thanks.\r\n          She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word \"LUCKY\" across\r\n          the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice\r\n          his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Don't leer at the neighbors, kid.\r\n          Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE\r\n          brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n          He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship\r\n          which has only recently started to have more edge.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          She's the one who put a word on her\r\n          butt. I'm just reading it.\r\n          Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in\r\n          front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Is he ever going to move that\r\n          thing?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          You need to get over it, Mom.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n\r\n                         (WATCH IT)\r\n          Attitude.\r\n          (observes him/then)\r\n          You've been tense or something.\r\n          School?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          School's great, actually.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Amy?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Good. Hasn't dumped me yet.\r\n          He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          That'll teach you to get so tall\r\n          and handsome.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Getting what you want is stressful.\r\n          Especially when you're not used to\r\n          it. More to lose.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Are you reading those books again?\r\n          The Power of Whatever the Hell?\r\n          She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          They're not working. You're still\r\n          flipping out about a big box.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n          Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN\r\n          HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk. Charlie stands there. She\r\n          shoots him a look -- then he helps her load.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          It's an eyesore. I'm trying to\r\n          convince people to move in, not\r\n          join the legions leaving town--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          If you say \"mortgage crisis\" again\r\n          I'm getting a new mom.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          The guy moves in and puts a giant\r\n          trash can in his yard! When the\r\n          Perry's lived there--\r\n          Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          The Perry's were the greatest\r\n          neighbors ever. But they moved. I\r\n          thought you were happy their place\r\n          finally sold.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          (back on the neighbor)\r\n          He's not digging a pool. Where do\r\n          you think all that concrete's\r\n          coming from?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          You're spying on the guy now?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          He's thirteen feet from our house.\r\n          That's not spying, that's\r\n          observing.\r\n          A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot\r\n          friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Hi, Mrs. Brewster.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Hi honey. Hi girls.\r\n          ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful\r\n          -- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          7.\r\n          But Charlie is. And he can't believe his luck. Which puts\r\n          him off his game. She makes him feel like he's always\r\n          playing catch up.\r\n          Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.\r\n\r\n                         JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh hey -- Ed called. Again.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Okay.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          I'm tired of making excuses,\r\n          Charlie. If you don't want to talk\r\n          to him, would you please tell him?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Kinda defeats the purpose.\r\n          He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Still can't get the bike started,\r\n          huh?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Wow. No faith.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          So you don't need a ride.\r\n          Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs\r\n          his backpack and RACES after her.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No, hey, stop--\r\n          She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she\r\n          drives again.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on! Hey!--\r\n          Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst. The\r\n          girls are laughing.\r\n\r\n                         ON JANE\r\n          Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          8.\r\n\r\n          INT/EXT. AMY'S CAR -- DAY\r\n\r\n          The Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban\r\n          paradise.\r\n          Charlie's in the front seat now.

And even though he's playing it off, we\r\n          see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a\r\n          bitch. Mark calls after him--\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          You don't even have a car!\r\n\r\n          INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Later.

Stops when he\r\n          sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him.\r\n          EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been\r\n          picked on by bullies his whole life.\r\n          He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And\r\n          his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS.\r\n\r\n                         TEACHER (CONT'D)\r\n          Nick Straley?\r\n\r\n                         (NOTHING)\r\n          Nick?\r\n          Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye.

CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Charlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie\r\n          a picture on his phone.

For dinner?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          You're eating right now, you know.\r\n          As you speak. You literally just\r\n          forced me to get you a smoothie so\r\n          large they named a planet after it--\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHS)\r\n          I ran six miles. What did you do?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I -- watched you. But not in a\r\n          creepy way.\r\n          Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          So don't judge. You don't want me\r\n          to burn my big ole' booty off, do\r\n          you?\r\n          Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          What was that for?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I don't know you're just...\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          16.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n                         (PERFECT)\r\n          Nothing.\r\n          A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real.\r\n          They're about to kiss again when JANE'S GIRLISH LAUGH stops\r\n          them. They both turn and REACT AS THEY SEE...\r\n          A MUSCLED MALE, SQUATTING AND HUNCHED-OVER -- clad only in a\r\n          white wife-beater and jeans. We can't make out his face.\r\n          Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he\r\n          FIXES their sprinkler.\r\n          PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome\r\n          to the point of devastating. An all-American Adonis.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Wow.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Look at Mom.

If he followed her\r\n          home, you have to let her keep him.\r\n          Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK\r\n\r\n          ED paces anxiously in front of ADAM'S HOUSE. He has a duffle\r\n          bag over his shoulder. Keeps checking his phone.\r\n          He finally dials in a number. Talks--\r\n\r\n                         ADAM\r\n          Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's.\r\n          Remember the videos we all made\r\n          back when? You and me and Adam,\r\n          bro? In tights. Want your pals to\r\n          get a load of that?\r\n\r\n          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK\r\n\r\n          Amy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry. They overhear--\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          .so not a pool, what's the work\r\n          you're doing?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          17.\r\n          Jerry has an easy-going way about him. An inviting charm.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Foundation problems. I had to rip\r\n          up half the basement.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          These houses were built practically\r\n          overnight.

And\r\n          his -- do we say girlfriend now?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n                         (EMBARRASSED)\r\n          I guess.

I'm Amy.\r\n          He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She\r\n          enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie.\r\n          Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes\r\n          manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand\r\n          a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Hey.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Jerry's our new neighbor. The\r\n          Perry place.

I like them.\r\n           Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          So... I'd ask you guys inside, but\r\n          it's a mess.

Jerry moves\r\n          off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          19.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Why did you blow him off?

ADAM'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DUSK\r\n\r\n          Ed wriggles in through the DOG DOOR. He turns, lets Charlie\r\n          in. Charlie looks around.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          This is nuts.\r\n          It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely\r\n          righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's\r\n          proper place. It's perfect.\r\n          They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         21\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          Hello?

Anybody here?\r\n          They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's\r\n          parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty.\r\n          Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery.\r\n          Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him.\r\n          The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY\r\n          HIDING BEHIND the door.

Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.\r\n\r\n                         ED (CONT'D)\r\n          Ha!

He thrusts it at Charlie.\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          No, see, it's not just them. It\r\n          started -- there was this thing on\r\n          Channel 13, a lady escaped an\r\n          attacker who tried to bite her.\r\n          Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart.

It's REALLY DARK now.\r\n          Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a\r\n          residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the\r\n          lights in many of them are off.\r\n          Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark\r\n          corner is potentially the end of him.\r\n          A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps\r\n          GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS.\r\n          A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK,\r\n          Charlie's pal from school.\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          You crossed my yard.

Just do it!\r\n          Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow.\r\n          Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels.\r\n          The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has\r\n          experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to\r\n          shake Mark for a moment.\r\n          Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS\r\n          CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on\r\n          the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.\r\n\r\n                         ED (CONT'D)\r\n          Crap. Crap!\r\n          There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark\r\n          approaching in the dark.\r\n          He drops into a neighbor's backyard.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

FENCE -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence. Sees Ed's\r\n          VAMP HUNTING STUFF on the ground, laughs.\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          Unbelievable.\r\n          A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.\r\n          He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Calls out--\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          Forget it sucker! No invite!\r\n          BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door.

We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a\r\n          long chain.\r\n          JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat.\r\n          Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with\r\n          the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Ed races for the back gate--\r\n\r\n          AND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP.\r\n          Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing.\r\n          Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking\r\n          on it, the cross directly under his neck.\r\n          JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the\r\n          cross into the neighbor's POOL.\r\n          Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.\r\n          Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a\r\n          flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's\r\n          chilling.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Bit off more than you can chew.\r\n          Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          We'll see, man. I know my shit.\r\n          But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with\r\n          actual sympathy.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Really? Who's going to believe\r\n          you? You see the truth, but what\r\n          good is it when you're alone?\r\n          Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          Don't play that stuff. That mind\r\n          crap. Come on -- try me.

You're\r\n          nothing to him now.\r\n          Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a\r\n          step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less\r\n          conviction.\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          Get back!\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          It can be over.

Says to herself...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          30.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Good on his word.\r\n          A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Morning. Charlie?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          You try. My voice seems to be on\r\n          some frequency he can't hear.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n\r\n          CHARLIE!\r\n\r\n          CHARLIE (O.S.)\r\n          Coming!\r\n          Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the\r\n          island. Grins a little.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You\r\n          should facebook him.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          (shakes her head)\r\n          Temptress. I'm resolved.\r\n          Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated.\r\n          pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate. He's out of sorts.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Oversleep?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Didn't.\r\n          (off her look)\r\n          Weird dreams.\r\n          Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Amy and Charlie head to the car. Charlie turns -- looks back\r\n          at JERRY'S HOUSE. The blacked out windows...\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          What?\r\n          Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's\r\n          theories.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         31\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Nothing. That guy was such a tool.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n\r\n                         (HUMORING HIM)\r\n          Totally. Poser.\r\n          She gets in the car. Smiles a little.\r\n\r\n                         FADE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Charlie's in class. He's restless, agitated. On his pad, he\r\n          absently draws VAMPIRE images, blood...\r\n\r\n                         TEACHER\r\n          Sally Cabella?\r\n\r\n                         SALLY\r\n          Here.\r\n\r\n                         TEACHER\r\n          Ed Lee?\r\n          Nothing. Charlie looks up.\r\n\r\n                         TEACHER (CONT'D)\r\n          Edward Lee?\r\n          Charlie looks around. No Ed. And just like he said -- quite\r\n          a few other kids are missing. Charlie takes this in, looks\r\n          around.\r\n\r\n                         ABOVE CHARLIE\r\n          SEATS ALL AROUND HIM ARE EMPTY. This time it makes an\r\n          impact.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Charlie, Mark, Ben and the rest of the guys get ready for\r\n          practice. Mark's in the middle of a story, but Charlie is\r\n          distracted -- barely listening.\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          .she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude.\r\n          Like -- one zip and POP!\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Huh.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         32\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          What's up with you? Dreaming about\r\n          your little boyfriend?\r\n          Charlie takes this in, worried.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          You see him around today? Ed?\r\n\r\n                         BEN\r\n          I don't track \"it's\" whereabouts.\r\n          What did he want, anyway?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Nothing. Homework stuff.\r\n          But Charlie's clearly distracted.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Look, I have to go.\r\n\r\n                         MARK\r\n          Now? You're ditching? I'll bail\r\n          with you.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No -- I'm -- I don't feel so well.\r\n          He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ED'S HOUSE -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Another suburban development. Rows and rows of red tile\r\n          roofs, houses stacked right on top of one another...\r\n          Charlie rings the bell of a modest place. Not as big as\r\n          where Charlie and Jane live. But nice, well-tended for.\r\n          ED's mom, VICTORIA, answers. She's surprised to see him.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          Charlie!\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee.\r\n          Victoria breaks into a wide smile.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          God you're a sight for sore eyes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n\r\n          INT. ED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n           Victoria pulls Charlie in and hugs him, happy. Calls out--\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          Rick! Charlie's here!\r\n\r\n                         (TO CHARLIE)\r\n          Look at you. So handsome!\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Oh, I -- you don't have to--\r\n           Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Ed said you'd sprouted. And\r\n          you're, the--\r\n          Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Cleared up. Yes sir--\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          Ed will be so sorry he missed you,\r\n          But -- you should both be in school\r\n          now, shouldn't you?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          He's not here? Did you see him\r\n          today?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          He's usually up and out early.\r\n          Everything okay?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No, sure. We're working on a class\r\n          project. I guess we crossed paths.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed,\r\n          he'd be mad that I said so, but he\r\n          talks about you all the time.\r\n          This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yeah. That's... He's great.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Would it be okay if I went\r\n          upstairs? Ed has a book we need.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          34.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          Of course. Make yourself at home.\r\n          Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick --\r\n          \"that's good!\" They're both pleased.\r\n\r\n          INT. ED'S ROOM -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy\r\n          movies.\r\n          There's an art table where Ed has been working on some\r\n          illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel. Charlie stops\r\n          and looks at them. They're fantastic.\r\n          He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few\r\n          pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON A PHOTO\r\n          Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter\r\n          and thinner -- with really bad acne. Not cute. WAY not.\r\n\r\n                         ON CHARLIE\r\n          Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees--\r\n          PETER VINCENT'S \"FRIGHT NIGHT\" POSTER on a wall. Charlie\r\n          takes it in, laughs a little.\r\n          Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's\r\n          investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore\r\n          printed off the internet, books, etc.\r\n          If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more\r\n          of Ed's fictional world.\r\n          Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head.\r\n          It's all a fantasy -- nothing more.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          This is crazy.\r\n          He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on --\r\n          and one file stands out. \"THE JERRY DIARIES.\"\r\n          Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds\r\n          a bunch of Quicktime files.\r\n          He opens one. Stops.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON COMPUTER\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          35.\r\n          As BLURRY short clips play:\r\n          Jerry's truck, in motion but it looks like NOBODY'S DRIVING\r\n\r\n          IT.\r\n          DORIS the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody.\r\n          Over and over, it's appears that JERRY DOESN'T SHOW UP on\r\n          video.\r\n\r\n                         OFF CHARLIE\r\n          Taking this in. Chilled.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          It's dark as Charlie comes home. He looks warily at Jerry's\r\n          house as he searches for his keys.\r\n          BAM -- he walks right into JERRY.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Hey guy.\r\n          Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed\r\n          thought? Impossible, but...\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Hey. Guy.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          You could really do me a solid.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yeah? What kind.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          I have a girl on her way over for a\r\n          beer, and I'm totally out of beer.\r\n          They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the\r\n          kitchen.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Bummer.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Set me up, I'll pay you back two\r\n          times. A sixer for your mom, and\r\n          one for you.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Uh, yeah, sure.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          36.\r\n          Jerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door.\r\n          This is when Charlie should invite him in.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Let me see what Mom's got. She's\r\n          kind of a \"light domestic\".. .mom.\r\n          Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter.\r\n          Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the\r\n          refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in,\r\n          uninvited, Ed's theory is blown.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as\r\n          my place, huh?\r\n          Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE\r\n          THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit.\r\n          Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over\r\n          Jerry's face.\r\n          Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his\r\n          hand -- it hits the ground, explodes.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Fuck!\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Can I help you with that?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No! No. Thanks. I'll get it.\r\n          Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly\r\n          certain. He's been made.\r\n          Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the\r\n          doorway with the remaining beers.\r\n          Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          There you go. Uh...party down.\r\n          Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and\r\n          intimidating. A threat disguised as \"guy talk.\"\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          This girl tonight -- she's a\r\n          handful.

She's ripe. Must\r\n          be a line of guys dying to pluck\r\n          that. Your mom too -- you don't\r\n          see it, maybe you do -- she's\r\n          giving it off. It's on you to\r\n          watch out for them. You up for\r\n          that?\r\n          Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I think I can manage.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Good. Cause there are bad people\r\n          out there, man. Better keep an eye\r\n          on your women.\r\n          Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          Thanks for the beers.\r\n          Charlie watches him move into the dark.\r\n\r\n          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the\r\n          window.\r\n          His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and\r\n          sneakerhead stuff.\r\n          AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.\r\n          She's reading Wuthering Heights.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Where've you been? You told me to\r\n          meet you here an hour ago.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE'S POV\r\n          Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on\r\n          behind BLACKED OUT WINDOWS.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          38.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          Hello?\r\n          Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His\r\n          focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Sorry. You okay? Everything okay?\r\n          He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No, it should. Nothing.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          (re: her book)\r\n          You ever read this? It's good.\r\n          Sexy, actually.\r\n          Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          In a frustrated, unconsummated sort\r\n          of way.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Like us, you mean.\r\n          Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Kinda makes it hotter.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yeah, so you keep saying.\r\n          He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Am I boring you? What's up?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          What? No. I'm kind of wiped out,\r\n          that's all.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          I can fix that.\r\n          She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in\r\n          and turned on. She pulls back, serious.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          39.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          Want to get under the covers?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          -- now? Seriously?\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Calm down. Let's just... see how it\r\n          goes.\r\n          Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Believeme when I say--thereis\r\n          nothing in the worldI'dratherdo\r\n\r\n                         BUT--\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Charlie. Don't be nervous.\r\n          She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie\r\n          weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait...\r\n          Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God--\r\n          DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie\r\n          stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          You hear that?\r\n          He rushes to the window. Looks outside.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE'S POV\r\n          DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Shit.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          What?\r\n          JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's\r\n          flirting up a storm.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Shit, shit, shit--\r\n          Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          He's hot. She's a stripper. They\r\n          were bound to find each other.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n                         GO-GO DANCER--\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Take away two tiny pieces of cloth,\r\n          stripper.\r\n\r\n                         (LIGHTLY)\r\n          You jealous?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          What? No--\r\n          Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT\r\n          CHARLIE. It's chilling.\r\n          Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling\r\n          her down too.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          He looked right at us.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Maybe. Not a big deal--\r\n          Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No, it is a big. A very big. He\r\n          saw us and he was pissed.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Okay...\r\n          Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          If you're not into this, say so.\r\n          Don't do me any favors.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          What? No! I am, I totally am.\r\n          just -- I don't trust that guy.\r\n          He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used\r\n          to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          I'm going.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Amy. Don't--\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          No. You've got your neighborhood\r\n          watch thing.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Come on, don't be that way--\r\n          But she's gone.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Crap!\r\n          A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But\r\n          Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention.\r\n          He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows\r\n          moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.\r\n           Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up\r\n          the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up.\r\n          Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE.\r\n          Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry.\r\n\r\n                         FADE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Later. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window.\r\n          He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like\r\n          they are coming from Jerry's.\r\n          But are they screams of pleasure or pain?\r\n          Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's\r\n          all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam.\r\n          Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie\r\n          hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window.\r\n          Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off.\r\n          Off Charlie, unsettled.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A short while later. Charlie moves cautiously into Jerry's\r\n          backyard. He's wearing ALL BLACK and his dad's old winter\r\n          gloves. He looks at his iPhone.\r\n          ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. \"How to pick a lock.\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          42.\r\n          Charlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily\r\n          tries to pick the lock. After a moment or two, he realizes\r\n          he has no idea what he's doing.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Crap.\r\n          He walks away from the door, frustrated. Then turns and\r\n          impulsively tries to KICK IN the DOOR with his foot. Nothing\r\n          happens.\r\n          Then something occurs to Charlie. He goes into the garden.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          The Perrys...\r\n          Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK. Turns it over. It has a KEY in\r\n          it. Charlie's like -- duh.\r\n          He puts the key in the back door lock. It opens.\r\n\r\n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie moves through the first story of the house. He's\r\n          cautious, on edge.\r\n          At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical\r\n          \"guy pad\". Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt\r\n          water fish tank...\r\n          At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump\r\n          out at him. It's unbearably tense.\r\n\r\n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie looks upstairs. Moves through a plain white hallway,\r\n          finds an open door that leads to Jerry's office, where he\r\n          keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY.\r\n          On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated\r\n          with a strange INSIGNIA. Charlie takes a picture of it with\r\n          his phone.\r\n\r\n          INT. JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie goes into Jerry's bedroom - opens his closet. Sees a\r\n          variety of UNIFORMS. Cop, gas man, UPS, etc. Charlie\r\n          reacts, chilled.\r\n          Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway.\r\n          Charlie's in a panic. Jerry will be inside any moment.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          43.\r\n          There's no time to get out so Charlie ducks into the CLOSET.\r\n\r\n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- CLOSET -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go.\r\n          Leans against the back wall.\r\n          The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back\r\n          into a HIDDEN HALLWAY.\r\n          Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by\r\n          small rooms on either side.\r\n          It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room\r\n          has a small rectangular WINDOW, so you can see in.\r\n          Charlie reacts, sick. It looks like a prison. Despite the\r\n          danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms--\r\n\r\n          WHAM!!\r\n          A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Fuck! --\r\n          DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks\r\n          almost BLUE.\r\n\r\n                         DORIS\r\n          Help...\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Oh my God. Oh, shit--\r\n          Charlie tugs on the door. Locked.\r\n          He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The\r\n          FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.\r\n\r\n                         DORIS\r\n          Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here!\r\n          Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I'm -- I won't leave you--\r\n          But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.\r\n\r\n                         DORIS\r\n          Please! No! Don't go!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          44.\r\n          Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris,\r\n          moves behind the door.\r\n          JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding\r\n          place. Pauses near him.\r\n          The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his\r\n          breath.\r\n          Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body\r\n          from it.\r\n          Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.\r\n\r\n                          DORIS (CONT'D)\r\n          .no... . God, no... please...\r\n          The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of\r\n          Doris's body and face.\r\n          Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her.\r\n          Charlie watches helplessly, horrified.\r\n\r\n                         DORIS (CONT'D)\r\n          Please, please... don't kill me.\r\n          Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND\r\n          RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY. It's clear he's FEEDING ON HER,\r\n          although we can't see his face.\r\n          Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and\r\n          terrifying.\r\n          It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to\r\n          one side, her light fading.\r\n          A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement.\r\n          In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with CHARLIE.\r\n          She sees him, smiles weakly. Then mouths something -- too\r\n          weak to make much sound.\r\n\r\n                          DORIS (CONT'D)\r\n          Cha... Cha...\r\n          CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little\r\n          grimly, puts a finger to her lips. Silence.\r\n          After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied. He\r\n          tosses Doris aside and stands away from her.\r\n          Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually\r\n          wipes a spot of blood from his mouth.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          45.\r\n          Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key\r\n          and moves off toward the stairs. After a moment, he's gone.\r\n          The sound of a TV starts in Jerry's living room. Something\r\n          banal like \"The Real Housewives of Orange County.\"\r\n          Charlie knows this is his moment. With shaking hands, he\r\n          retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the \"HOW TO PICK A LOCK\"\r\n          screen.\r\n          Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's\r\n          breathing -- alive.\r\n          Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny\r\n          screwdriver on the lock.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Please... Please...\r\n          The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies\r\n          himself. Tries again.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on.\r\n          The tension is unbearable. Charlie can hear JERRY moving\r\n          downstairs.\r\n\r\n                         CLICK\r\n          The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he\r\n          grabs Doris and BOLTS.\r\n          Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's\r\n          feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet.\r\n          He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE.\r\n          His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back --\r\n          every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's\r\n          happening, let alone where she is.\r\n\r\n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- STAIRWELL/ENTRY -- DAWN\r\n\r\n          A moment later. Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs, near\r\n          the entry hall. They can see the front door -- and hear\r\n          Jerry moving in another room.\r\n          Charlie looks around, trying to get oriented.\r\n          JERRY emerges -- almost sees them. Charlie ducks into a\r\n          hiding spot and grabs Doris, covering her mouth.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          46.\r\n          A long beat as Jerry returns to the living room with a beer.\r\n          Settles in a chair facing away from the door.\r\n          Charlie considers his options. Says almost silently:\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Same floor plan.\r\n          He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.\r\n\r\n          INT.

HEAVY METAL MUSIC BLARES.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          53.\r\n          The whole scene is OVER THE TOP GOTH cheesiness. Lots of\r\n          stage effects and fire...\r\n          PAMELA ANDERSON look-alikes in skimpy outfits prance on stage\r\n          as another SEXY GIRL is handcuffed, S&M style, to a CIRCULAR\r\n\r\n          TORTURE BOARD.\r\n\r\n          ON THE AUDIENCE\r\n          We see that this is a run-through. Tech guys work light\r\n          boards, etc. A director and scattered others sit in the\r\n          seats.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Sneaks in one of the back doors. Silently moves close to the\r\n          stage.\r\n          He's WEARING THE STOLEN COAT.\r\n          The badge holder now has the SUN masthead logo inside. It\r\n          looks, at first glance, like a legit credential.\r\n\r\n                         ON STAGE\r\n          Peter reveals a tray full of SHARP DAGGERS. He raises them\r\n          to the audience.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          The knives are real.\r\n          He CUTS his OWN PALM with one, bleeds. Doesn't even wince.\r\n          Stud.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          The girl is real.\r\n          He GRABS HER, feels her up. She giggles.\r\n\r\n                         SEXY ASSISTANT\r\n          Ooooo!\r\n          Peter YANKS down on the circular board the assistant's tied\r\n          to -- sending her SPINNING.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          And if I miss, she'll really be\r\n          dead.\r\n          The music switches. It's all TENSION. Peter FLINGS a\r\n          dagger. SCHWACK! The assistant DUCKS as the KNIFE embeds in\r\n          the board behind her, this close where her head was.\r\n          She screams! Breaks character.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          54.\r\n\r\n                         SEXY ASSISTANT\r\n          Holy Shit! Pete!\r\n          Also out of character -- PETER speaks in a thick QUEEN'S\r\n\r\n          ACCENT.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          You can't say that!\r\n          (moves to her)\r\n          Stop the-- STOP. CUT!!\r\n          The music stops. The spinning board stops.\r\n\r\n                         SEXY ASSISTANT\r\n          You almost tore my extensions out!\r\n          Why do you have to throw a real\r\n          knife!?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n\r\n                         (RE: KNIFE)\r\n          It barely cuts! That board is like\r\n          butter.\r\n          He tears the MAKEUP appliance off his hand that made it look\r\n          like he cut himself. The assistant pulls out of her VELCRO\r\n          straps.\r\n\r\n                         SEXY ASSISTANT\r\n          Everybody else fakes it!\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          But this looks authentic--\r\n\r\n                         SEXY ASSISTANT\r\n          Then learn how to throw!\r\n          She stomps off the stage. Peter can't believe it.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Screw this.\r\n          He starts to stalk off stage. CHARLIE rushes toward him.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Mr. Vincent! Mr. Vincent--\r\n          A tech guy moves in on Charlie.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Charles Brewster. From the Sun?\r\n          We had an appointment.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I don't think so. Talk to my guy.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         55\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          We're doing a piece -- \"Vampires.\r\n          Separating myth from fact.\"\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          You want a comment? That's a shit\r\n          idea for an article.\r\n          Peter starts to move off. Charlie, anxious, follows.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Please. I really -- I need your\r\n          expertise. You're the man on this\r\n          stuff, right?\r\n          Peter sees how desperate Charlie is. Stops.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          What is this, like your first\r\n          assignment?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Actually -- yeah.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          (takes this in/then)\r\n          Ten minutes.\r\n\r\n          INT. PETER VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Peter lives in a two story penthouse at the top of one of the\r\n          casino hotels that he works in. It's lavish, floor to\r\n          ceiling windows, etc.\r\n          Still, goth influence reigns. The decor is tacky Haunted\r\n          Mansion all the way.\r\n          Charlie is shown into the \"museum\" by Peter's ASSISTANT,\r\n          ARTHUR, who looks and sounds A LOT LIKE PETER.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n          Don't touch anything, dude.\r\n\r\n          INT. PETER'S \"MUSEUM\"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie enters -- comes face to face with a SNARLING\r\n          WEREWOLF. He starts. Then realizes it's a life-size model.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Ho -- wow.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          56.\r\n          Charlie stands back, takes in the place. It's an amazing\r\n          combination of FANTASY memorabilia and ACTUAL occult weapons\r\n          and objects. It seems to go on and on.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR\r\n          Got rooms of this crap. Ebay.\r\n          Charlie examines a case that holds all kinds of TORTURE\r\n          DEVICES and battle axes, as well as SPIKED BALL MACES, etc.\r\n          Cases hold ancient texts and scrolls, haunted objects, etc.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Amazing.\r\n          Charlie is genuinely impressed. The geek in him can't help\r\n          it. Peter enters, talks to Arthur--\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Midori me.\r\n          Arthur pours Peter a green drink as Peter pulls off his black\r\n          wig (bandana attached) and peels off a nude body shirt that\r\n          has a bunch of TATTOOS printed on it.\r\n          He steps out of his boots, with three-inch LIFTS. Collapses\r\n          into an arm chair. He's just another balding, middle-aged\r\n          guy with bad eyes.\r\n          Peter downs his drink. Arthur hands him the bottle. Peter\r\n          looks at Charlie.\r\n          In truth, Peter's isolated himself to the point that he\r\n          actually welcomes a visitor -- though he'd never admit it.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (RE: MIDORI)\r\n          Looks like pee but I'm hooked. You\r\n          want?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No, thanks. Not...on the job.\r\n          Peter scratches avidly at his crotch.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Leather, it doesn't breath. You\r\n          know? Fucking rashes are killing\r\n          me... So I'm your expert, huh?\r\n          For your vampire thing.\r\n\r\n                         (BITTER)\r\n          They're all the rage, huh.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          57.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yeah. I guess... So -- say I want\r\n          to kill one. But really. How how\r\n          would you do it?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Depends. You got fire, beheading.\r\n          Or go classic -- stake through the\r\n          heart. Bam!\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          So all that actually works?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          How the fuck do I know.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I thought you're--\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I read books, man. You think I'm\r\n          hanging out with Dracula and the\r\n          Easter Bunny?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Sorry. No.\r\n          Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more.\r\n\r\n                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n           I -- I have a personal interest in\r\n          this story.\r\n          (off Peter's look)\r\n          A friend's missing, actually. I\r\n          think one of them got him.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Them, meaning a \"vampire.\"\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Jerry. He lives next door to me.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          \"Jerry?\"\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I know.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          But it's no joke. If you look at\r\n          these clips, you'll see. They take\r\n          some time to load but...\r\n          Charlie moves to Peter, shows him his phone. Digs into his\r\n          pocket.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          58.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          And I printed up some photos I\r\n          took. In his place. Or lair...\r\n          Charlie put the photos in front of Peter on the table.\r\n          Peter's expression closes. He stands, pissed.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Arthur!\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No, come on, I'm--\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          You're a nutjob. Arthur!\r\n          Charlie deflates -- his desperation showing again.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him\r\n          kill a girl. She burned up in my\r\n          hands. You have to tell me how to\r\n          stop him.\r\n          Arthur enters.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Get this loser out of my sight.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I know what I saw.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          No you don't. See this guy?\r\n          He gestures to ARTHUR.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          My cousin, Art. He's \"me\" on\r\n          stage. That's how I teleport.\r\n          People see what they want to see.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n                         (URGENT)\r\n          This is what you've been looking\r\n          for, I promise. I can take you to\r\n          him, to his place.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          In Clark County Nevada. A hot bed\r\n          of supernatural activity.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          59.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yes! It's genius. A transient\r\n          population. A town where people\r\n          work all night, sleep all day...\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          A town full of con-artists.\r\n          (not buying it)\r\n          No. You're working me, or\r\n          somebody's working you.\r\n          Charlie's getting angry now.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          He already got my friend! I know\r\n          how I sound. But I'm not crazy. I\r\n          didn't want this. I don't want to\r\n          know this. Just tell me what to\r\n          do!\r\n          Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks\r\n          genuinely conflicted. But his expression hardens.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Run.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          You heard me.\r\n          He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to\r\n          ARTHUR, nods.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          So I save my own skin so he can\r\n          keep killing!? I won't. We have\r\n          to kill him! Please!--\r\n          Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him.\r\n\r\n          INT. PETER VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE -- OUTER HALL -- DUSK\r\n\r\n          Charlie stands, shut out. What the hell is he going to do\r\n          now?\r\n\r\n                         FADE TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          60.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE/JERRY'S HOUSE -- DUSK\r\n\r\n          Moving in on the Brewster home, an odd sight is revealed.\r\n          Every window is draped with strings of GARLIC.\r\n          Charlie's revealed in his window -- hammering up another long\r\n          rope of the stuff.\r\n          His gaze falls on JERRY'S HOUSE and we follow it.\r\n\r\n          INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DUSK\r\n\r\n          Now we find that Charlie's entire room is decked out in anti-\r\n          vamp decor. Not just the garlic but crosses and other\r\n          religious pictures, etc.\r\n          Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's\r\n          grimly focused as he starts sharpening a STAKE.\r\n          A knock. Jane doesn't enter this time.

But Charlie just nods.\r\n          Jane's disappointed. Then--\r\n\r\n                         JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          Don't use tape on the walls.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Oh.

MOM.\r\n          Jane looks at him -- can feel that he's telling the truth.\r\n          Charlie's looking around as they speed down the highway, in\r\n          the rearview. NO JERRY anywhere.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Where is he? Where'd he go?\r\n          Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car.\r\n          BAM! Jerry's hand SHOOTS up through the FLOORBOARD under\r\n          Jane's feet.\r\n          Jane and Amy SCREAM!\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR\r\n          JERRY'S EYE glares through the small hole. It's all BLACK.\r\n          No pupil. Freaky.\r\n          He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car,\r\n          where he's clinging -- face up.\r\n          The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face.\r\n          His veins and eyes are BLACK. His nose snout-like. And his\r\n          fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth, like a SHARK.\r\n          It's shocking, horrible.\r\n\r\n          ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR\r\n          As Jerry drags over the highway, the pavement grinding away\r\n          at his clothes and flesh.\r\n          He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down\r\n          on the FLOOR BREAK. The car SCREECHES to a sudden halt.\r\n          ON CHARLIE, AMY and JANE\r\n          Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The\r\n          car is REAR-ENDED by another vehicle. It's a MINIVAN.\r\n          JANE's car is SLAMMED -- the back is a crush of glass and\r\n          metal.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          69.\r\n          A GRIM MOMENT -- only the sound of hissing air and groaning\r\n          steel as everyone assesses the damage.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Oh... Are you-- Jane?\r\n          Jane is woozy.

The guy inside,\r\n          a FAMILY MAN, is stunned and pissed. Gets out of his car--\r\n\r\n                         FAMILY MAN\r\n          What the hell do you think you're\r\n          doing!--\r\n          Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          NO! Hey man, stay in your--\r\n          But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry,\r\n          hideously torn and bleeding, who appears from UNDER JANE'S\r\n\r\n          CAR.\r\n          In a flash, Jerry grabs the guy and VAMPS, ripping the family\r\n          man's NECK OUT.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON MINIVAN\r\n          As those \"cute\" stick figure family decals are splattered\r\n          with BLOOD.\r\n\r\n          AMY AND JANE\r\n          Now out of the car, react. JERRY IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE.\r\n          Jerry drops the business man, who's dead as he hits the\r\n          ground. He moves toward them.\r\n          Charlie looks at Amy and Jane. I told you so.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Yeah.\r\n          Charlie urgently grabs them. Shoves them down the highway.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Get out of here. Run.

I'll catch up! She's hurt,\r\n          get out of here!\r\n          They back off.\r\n          Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it\r\n          as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting\r\n\r\n                         HIM--\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Let them run. Just makes them\r\n          easier to kill when I'm done with\r\n          you.\r\n          Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the\r\n          warning bell rings over and over...\r\n          CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry,\r\n          backing him off.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I repel you with the power of\r\n          Christ the Lord.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Do you? Really? When did you take\r\n          your last confession?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Get back...\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          That's a mighty big cross you have\r\n          there. Question is -- do you\r\n          actually know how to use it?\r\n          Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's\r\n          open car door.\r\n          But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from\r\n          Charlie and shatters it with his hand.\r\n          Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then\r\n          crumples to the ground.\r\n          Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp,\r\n          splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest.\r\n          The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          71.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          Ever take one of these in the\r\n          chest? I have.\r\n          Charlie struggles, terrified.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          But they missed the heart.\r\n          Rigggght... . here. Easy\r\n          measurement.\r\n          Jerry positions the \"stake\" right over Charlie's heart.\r\n          Charlie winces. Terrified and overpowered.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          Shouldn't have been so nosey.\r\n          Jerry's about to plunge the STAKE through Charlie's heart\r\n          when a THICK WOOD STAKE comes through Jerry's SHOULDER.\r\n          Jerry HOWLS, falls off Charlie and we see that he's been\r\n          staked by the business end of a REAL ESTATE SIGN.\r\n          JANE stands over them, quaking with fear and adrenaline.\r\n          Amy's right behind her with a CROWBAR.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Leave my kid alone.\r\n          Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the\r\n          back of her head.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Mom!\r\n          Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out\r\n          of his shoulder.\r\n          Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car.\r\n          Amy dives into the car with them.\r\n          Charlie presses the accelerator. Will it still drive?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on come on come on...\r\n          IT LURCHES forward, then goes. Metal scraping the ground,\r\n          raining glass... but it RUNS.\r\n          They start to bolt when BAM! JERRY STANDS UP right in front\r\n          of the car, LUNGES AT THEM. CHARLIE RUNS OVER JERRY'S BODY\r\n          AGAIN. They speed off.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         72\r\n          Jerry writhes in the middle of the road. But even as he\r\n          does, he HEALS. His body knitting itself back together...\r\n\r\n          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie's giving a report to a pair of uniformed cops.\r\n\r\n                         COP #1\r\n          So a gas leak caused the fire at\r\n          your home and...\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          My mom didn't feel right, we were\r\n          trying to get her to the hospital.\r\n          It was stupid to let her drive.\r\n\r\n                         COP #1\r\n          Yeah it was. And driver who rear-\r\n          ended you, you get the exact make\r\n          and name of the van?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          It wasn't there when you got there?\r\n\r\n                         COP #2\r\n          Hit and run. Happens all the time.\r\n          Charlie stifles his surprise. Nods.\r\n\r\n          ANGLE ON AMY\r\n          On her cell, pacing as she eyes Charlie with the cops.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          We won't stay up all night. Bee\r\n          and Cara need help with Trig --\r\n          it's not a party. Okay. Okay...\r\n\r\n                         (THEN/EMOTIONAL)\r\n          Mom?

Charlie, finished with the cops, joins her.\r\n          They're both pained as they look at Jane.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          Maybe you should have said\r\n          something to the police.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         73\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Like what? A vampire moved next\r\n          door, borrowed some beer, ate a\r\n          stripper and then blew up our house\r\n          because we wouldn't invite him in?\r\n          Amy looks at him.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Okay.\r\n          The DOCTOR approaches.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          You should get some rest.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          She's going to wake up, right?\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Assuming the swelling is minimal, I\r\n          hope so.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          But you don't know.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Not yet. We need to give it time.\r\n          The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves.\r\n          Charlie turns away, upset. Amy watches, feeling helpless.\r\n\r\n          INT. PETER'S \"MUSEUM\"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Peter, in a bathrobe, looks out his floor-to-ceiling windows\r\n          at the lights of the strip.\r\n          The ASSISTANT from the show toddles out on high heels and a\r\n          ridiculous mini-dress. Her hair is messy, post sex.\r\n\r\n                         ASSISTANT\r\n          Bye babe. Good show tonight.\r\n          He's barely paying attention.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          You were late again on \"The Devil's\r\n          Torture Chamber.\"\r\n          But she's gone.\r\n          A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he\r\n          does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          74.\r\n          Absently, he sifts through them.

Hidden inside are a bunch\r\n          of personal items. Some from his childhood. Old photos of\r\n          his mother and father...\r\n          And a hand-drawn sketch, in a youthful scrawl, of THE\r\n          INSIGNIA. He puts the two side by side. They MATCH.\r\n          Off PETER, looking at the sketches. Haunted.\r\n\r\n          INT. HOSPITAL -- JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie and Amy sit on a tiny couch.

None of it makes sense.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          He did talk a lot of demented crap.\r\n          (but.. )\r\n          He was my best friend. He asked\r\n          me, begged me, to believe him.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          People change. Everybody--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yeah they do.

Yells to Amy--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n          GO!\r\n          Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on\r\n          another case that holds the battle axe. He grabs the weapon.\r\n          Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands.\r\n          Charlie and Ed face off.\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          Mano e...one mano.

Charlie yells, but holds his ground.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I didn't pick--\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          You didn't think.\r\n          Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I know. I'm sorry.\r\n          Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING\r\n          around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to\r\n          walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING.\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n          Steeeerike! Call that a swing,\r\n          Slugger?\r\n          Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him.\r\n          Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies,\r\n          Charlie can't look -- anguished.\r\n\r\n           ED (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on!

He's\r\n          grinning even as he bleeds everywhere. It's macabre,\r\n          horrible.\r\n          Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails.

Charlie DUCKS and AMY\r\n          smashes ED in the head. Hard.\r\n          Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden\r\n          cabinet.\r\n          Ed is on the ground.

He spots a\r\n          nightclub -- \"REFLECTIONS\".\r\n          The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit\r\n          diamond.\r\n\r\n                         ON JERRY\r\n          Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club.\r\n\r\n          INT. REFLECTIONS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The inside of the club is made up of MIRRORS AND WINDOWS.\r\n          The dance floor is PACKED. All writhing bodies and sweaty\r\n          abandon.\r\n          It's dizzying, disorienting.\r\n          Charlie sees JERRY enter, look around for them. The best bet\r\n          to get lost is to dive into the crowd.\r\n          Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the\r\n          different levels of the club are like a maze. Glass\r\n          staircases lead to mirrored balconies...\r\n          A hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony, starts throwing t-\r\n          shirts into the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         DJ\r\n          Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh!\r\n          The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward...\r\n          Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Charlie!\r\n          Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to\r\n          dance with him.

Instead the crowd parts as if by magic.\r\n          Jerry's heading straight toward--\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd.

She turns, relieved, to find--\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Holding her with a firm grip.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          No. No!\r\n          Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from\r\n          CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor.\r\n          Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         AMY (CONT'D)\r\n          Help!!\r\n          A GUY in the crowd high-fives him.

Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he\r\n          exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on.\r\n          He grips her harder, sways with her to the music.

You'll see.\r\n          It can be like a dream.\r\n          Jerry draws a nail over his wrist, draws a line of blood. He\r\n          puts his mouth over the cut, bloodying it.\r\n          He forces her into a DEEP KISS. She struggles mightily --\r\n          but then her body relaxes, as if she's been sedated.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          90.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          That's it...

Then she's liking it.\r\n          Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          You don't understand!--\r\n\r\n                         DOORMAN\r\n          ID. Then you can tell me your\r\n          whole sad story--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          No! There's no time-- Amy!!\r\n          Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the\r\n          doorman has a good grip, pulls him back.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Sees that CHARLIE is restrained.\r\n          Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs\r\n          exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          No! NO!\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE'S POV\r\n          As he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY.\r\n          It's a nightmare.\r\n          Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no\r\n          helping her.\r\n\r\n                         FADE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. PETER'S HIGH RISE -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Peter packs a bag, getting out of town.\r\n\r\n          CHARLIE (O.S.)\r\n          I see you got my message.\r\n          Peter turns. Sees Charlie standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          How'd you get in here?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Security's a little lax. Everybody\r\n          got their throat ripped out.\r\n          Peter backs away as Charlie moves in.\r\n          Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a\r\n          decade in one night.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          You too? He change you?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Look at your monitor.\r\n          PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie\r\n\r\n          SHOWS UP ON THE SCREEN.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          I don't know if Amy's alive or dead\r\n          or turned -- but he's got her.

There's only\r\n          surviving, if you're lucky--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          You call this surviving? If you\r\n          live and we all die, you think\r\n          you'll ever be able to get us out\r\n          of your head?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          I know I won't. I never could --\r\n          not after the first time.\r\n          This stops Charlie.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          I told myself I probably made it\r\n          up. I was a kid. Maybe it was\r\n          easier to believe in monsters...\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Made what up?\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          The vampire who killed my parents,\r\n          my brothers. But not me. I hid.\r\n          Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense.\r\n          Peter continues, haunted--\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          I didn't collect all this stuff for\r\n          fun. I thought maybe I could find\r\n          the tribe, \"avenge\" my people.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          So do it. We'll go in at dawn.\r\n          He's got to rest sometime--\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n\r\n                         (HARD)\r\n          It's not like that. When I was a\r\n          kid, I hid because I wanted to\r\n          live. I still do! This isn't the\r\n          comics. You want to be a dead\r\n          hero. Good for you. But I'm out.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          You think I'm a coward. I'm just a\r\n          realist.\r\n          Moment of hesitation for Charlie. Has he been affected by\r\n          Peter's words? Then--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          So you bail on people, erase them.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          I don't want to make it to\r\n          tomorrow, not if you're the kind of\r\n          man I have to be.\r\n          A moment. Peter is full of self-loathing, but resolved.\r\n          Charlie turns to leave.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Wait.\r\n          Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from\r\n          WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          Blessed by Saint Michael. Kill a\r\n          vampire with it -- it's supposed to\r\n          turn his victims back. If Amy's\r\n          changed, you can still save her.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n                         (RE: STAKE)\r\n          If it's for real.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Who knows what's for real any more.\r\n          Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          There's no guarantee he'll be\r\n          asleep during the day. He's\r\n          housebound, not hibernating.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          I'll figure it out.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          No, you need a plan. To stake him,\r\n          you have to get close -- he's\r\n          stronger than you.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Holy water?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         94\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Slow him down.

Disgusted with himself.\r\n\r\n          INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT/DAY\r\n\r\n          Charlie sits by Jane's bedside. She's still comatose.\r\n          We move closer and see that Charlie's drawing a MAP OF\r\n          JERRY'S HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from\r\n          memory as best he can.\r\n          He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA\r\n          As Charlie plots, he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Those rooms upstairs, that's\r\n          probably where he's got Amy.\r\n          I get her out, assuming she's--\r\n\r\n                         (NOT DEAD)\r\n          Then I have to get him on the\r\n          ropes.\r\n          He thinks... Then looks up, an idea occurring. Jane lies\r\n          there peacefully.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          I have to go.\r\n          More energized, Charlie stands and gathers his things.\r\n          He stops, contemplates his mother for a moment -- regretful.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          95.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm coming back for you, Mom.\r\n\r\n          INT. ARMY/NAVY STORE -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Charlie buys FIREPROOF CLOTHING, a small open-flame lighter,\r\n          and a SPRAY CANISTER like the kind an exterminator uses.\r\n          The guy at the counter looks Charlie up and down. Charlie\r\n          takes this in. Finally, Charlie's like -- fuck it.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Going to kill a vampire.\r\n          The guy looks at him.

JERRY'S HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n          ON JERRY'S HOUSE\r\n          LOOMING, silhouetted against early morning light. Next to\r\n          it, Charlie's house stands in charred ruins.\r\n          CHARLIE stands on the front lawn, contemplating the houses.\r\n          He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped\r\n          to him, holsters made out of duct-tape...\r\n          Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister. And he holds\r\n          a crowbar in a free hand. He looks like something out of one\r\n          of Ed's graphic novels.\r\n          Before he enters, Charlie DOUSES HIMSELF IN HOLY WATER.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Let's do this shit.\r\n          He swallows hard, scared but determined.\r\n\r\n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- FIRST FLOOR -- DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS\r\n          Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house.\r\n          The blacked-out windows give the place a gray, stifled air.\r\n          Behind Charlie, we see that the front door has been broken\r\n          open with the crow bar.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          96.\r\n          Charlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting\r\n          him to jump out and go for his throat...\r\n          He takes the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time.\r\n\r\n          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Charlie moves down the hall, stops at some of the small\r\n          rooms. Looks in.\r\n\r\n                         NO AMY\r\n          Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the\r\n          door for yet another room.\r\n          AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's\r\n          not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n                         AMY--\r\n          Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns...\r\n          And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck -- she looks\r\n          normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE--\r\n          She reaches through the window.

No, wait -- it's PETER.\r\n          He's not wearing his wig, etc. But he's cleaned up and\r\n          standing tall.

There's barely any\r\n          light.\r\n          They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt\r\n          and the main story of the house is held up by numerous\r\n\r\n          SUPPORT POSTS.\r\n          At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to\r\n          another room/storage area.\r\n\r\n                         ON CHARLIE\r\n          As he sees something.

I'll light him\r\n          up, then stake him.\r\n          Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.\r\n          Peter looks at him.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Flame retardant.\r\n          They're standing over the grave now.

No--\r\n          CHARLIE stops JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO TOSS the match.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          Who is that?\r\n          IT'S ADAM, sleeping in a shallow dirt grave.\r\n          Charlie reacts. Holy shit. He pushes his mask back.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Adam. I know him. Knew him.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Shh.

A beat.\r\n          They're both petrified as they move toward the door.\r\n          Peter readies the gun again.

Done for.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Worth a shot. \"Master of\r\n          illusion.\"\r\n          Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He\r\n          dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n\r\n                         (TO CHARLIE)\r\n          You think that's going to stop me?\r\n          Time to man up.\r\n          Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          106.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          Now.

Like a pro.\r\n          Amy smiles a little. Jerry GRABS CHARLIE, lifts him off his\r\n\r\n                         FEET--\r\n          Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER --\r\n          right in the eyes.\r\n          Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN.\r\n          Jerry's over it. He's on CHARLIE in a flash, FANGS BARED.\r\n          About to RIP HIS NECK OUT.\r\n\r\n          BLAM!\r\n          PETER has the gun again -- has managed to pull himself up\r\n          into a sitting position.\r\n          He BLOWS away ONE OF THE SUPPORT BEAMS.\r\n          BLAM! And ANOTHER.\r\n          BLAM! And ANOTHER.\r\n          BLAM -- he misses.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Fuck.\r\n\r\n          BLAM! AND ANOTHER.\r\n          Charlie DIVES for SAFETY as the CEILING COLLAPSES in part of\r\n          the basement. SUNLIGHT STREAMS in -- forcing JERRY, AMY and\r\n          the other vamps into a corner.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO JERRY)\r\n          Fuck yeah! Nice sweater, loser!\r\n\r\n          BLAM!\r\n          Another BEAM collapses. BURYING JERRY, AMY and the others\r\n          under DEBRIS from the floor above.\r\n          A stunned beat.\r\n          Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          107.\r\n          Charlie looks at him -- amazed.\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (WEAK)\r\n          I'm better with stationary targets.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Yeah you are.\r\n          Peter looks at him, sad.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          Get out of here.

JERRY BURSTS OUT OF THE RUBBLE, attacks Charlie.\r\n          Charlie falls back, PULLING JERRY with him into THE LIGHT\r\n          Jerry BURSTS INTO FLAME -- but holds Charlie tight\r\n          AMY and the other vamps start to claw their way OUT of the\r\n          rubble.\r\n          Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES now\r\n\r\n                         PETER (CONT'D)\r\n          Charlie!\r\n          Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help.\r\n          Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle.\r\n          Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the\r\n          ground as they fight. Trying to put out the flames.\r\n          Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- he's about to EXPLODE into\r\n          bits. Charlie's stake is now ON FIRE.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n\r\n          NO!\r\n          A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to\r\n          burn away.\r\n\r\n          HE STAKES JERRY.\r\n          AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it\r\n          seems. The vampire is being burned out of her.\r\n          PETER cries out too, reacting less violently. But in pain.\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in\r\n          his CHEST. Right through the heart.\r\n          He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like\r\n          Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR.\r\n          For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air...\r\n\r\n                         JERRY\r\n          Blow me.\r\n\r\n          THEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES.\r\n\r\n          ON CHARLIE AND PETER\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          109.\r\n          Thinking fast, PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in\r\n          flames. They tumble into one of the open graves.\r\n          DIRT pours in around them, extinguishing the fire.\r\n\r\n                         ON AMY\r\n          Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the\r\n          edge of the open grave.\r\n\r\n          ABOVE THE OPEN GRAVE\r\n          Peter pulls Charlie's mask back. Charlie is burned,\r\n          unconscious.\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n          Charlie!\r\n          She crawls into the grave.

Finally,\r\n          Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly...\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Blow me? Seriously?\r\n          Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Those are his last words? What a\r\n          tool.\r\n          We pull away, leaving this tableau...\r\n          UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe\r\n          emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked.\r\n          A beat.\r\n\r\n          MS. GRANADA\r\n          Let's agree to never talk about\r\n          this.\r\n\r\n                         FADE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse.

The childish part of them long\r\n          gone.\r\n          He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.\r\n          SOMETHING BEEPS, talks...\r\n\r\n                         VOICE\r\n          \"Frak!\" \"Frak!\"\r\n\r\n                         AMY\r\n\r\n                         (PULLS BACK)\r\n          What is that?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Charlie, a little sheepish, shows her.

So here's what I'm\r\n          thinking. We faced the beast and\r\n          we won.

But\r\n          werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get\r\n          proof, catch something -- we could\r\n          build a stage act around that, you\r\n          wouldn't believe. We'd blow those\r\n          Cirque bitches away!\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          An act? Seriously? What about\r\n          saving people from evil? What\r\n\r\n                         ABOUT--\r\n          A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And\r\n          somehow familiar.\r\n          Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.\r\n\r\n                         PETER\r\n          It happens. All this stuff...\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE\r\n          Ever think about collecting\r\n          something else? Snow globes or--\r\n          Charlie stops, catches sight of something MOVING IN THE\r\n\r\n          REFLECTION ON THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOW.\r\n          Just a wisp, a phantom. The face - is it ED? His features\r\n          twisted in a grimace of fear and pain... It's CHILLING.\r\n          Charlie's spooked. But he looks again and the face is gone.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Yeah, definitely get new stuff.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          113.\r\n          Peter leads CHARLIE OUT, back to the ladies in the other\r\n          room.
