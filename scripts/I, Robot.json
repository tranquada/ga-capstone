Sheets, tangled around\n    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly\n    cheerful.\n\n    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT\n    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a\n    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.\n\n    You are in danger...\n\n    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His\n    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of\n    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.\n\n3   INT.

Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches\n    for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...\n\n7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7\n\n    ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the\n    elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.\n\n    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His\n    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He\n    turns and sees...\n\n    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still\n    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering\n    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up\n    with a muted WHIR...\n\n                         ROBOT\n                   (metallic voice)\n               Good day, sir...\n\n    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to\n    lose the robot.\n\n    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment\n    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.\n    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting\n    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:\n\n    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building\n    cleaning windows.\n\n    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently\n    repairs the street. No human supervision.\n\n    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.\n    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...\n\n    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.\n    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.\n    Briefcases.\n\n    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.\n\n    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.\n    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's\n    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.\n\n                         LITTLE GIRL\n               Hi.\n\n                                                              3.\n\n\n                          SPOONER\n               Hi.\n\n    But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The\n    robot turns. Looks at the girl.\n\n                         ROBOT\n               You are not allowed to talk to\n               strangers.\n\n    Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb\n    Just as...\n\n    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large\n    digital EYE on him:\n\n                         TRAFFIC LIGHT\n               Please return to the sidewalk.\n\n    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.\n\n                         TRAFFIC LIGHT\n               Please return to the sidewalk...\n\n    The traffic signal, tracking him.\n\n                         TRAFFIC LIGHT\n               You are in violation of city\n               ordinance 14-B726...\n\n    Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as\n    SNAP! It takes his picture.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n8   EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING                                    8\n\n    Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks\n    down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the\n    Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!\n    A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his\n    back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...\n\n9   EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                           9\n\n    The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying\n    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings\n    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel\n    shields.\n\n    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to\n    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.\n    The \"old\" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.\n\n                                                             4.\n\n\n10   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING                            10\n\n     Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging\n     Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the\n     original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.\n\n11   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING                    11\n\n     A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series\n     of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN\n     with real time video of various streets and buildings.\n\n     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.\n     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.\n     Several electronic messages say the same thing:\n\n                             SEE ME!\n\n                          LT. BERGIN (O.S.)\n                Ever heard the phrase \"lead by\n                example?\"\n\n     Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of\n     his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner\n     giving that traffic signal the finger.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                Doesn't ring a bell.\n\n                          LT. BERGIN\n                    (pointing to Spooner's\n                     badge)\n                It's on your badge.\n\n     Spooner takes the citation.   Drops it into a drawer filled\n     with about fifty others.\n\n                          LT. BERGIN\n                The traffic division filed an\n                official complaint this morning.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                The traffic division is a machine.\n\n                          LT. BERGIN\n                Look, I know there's going to be an\n                adjustment period, Del...\n\n                          SPOONER\n                    (interrupting)\n                I'll send them a letter of apology.\n                Maybe some flowers. A box of\n                chocolates...\n\n                                                               5.\n\n\n     JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.   He throws Bergin a look.\n     Then snatches up the receiver.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                Spooner, homicide.\n\n                                                 CUT TO:\n\n12   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY                        12\n\n     A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city\n     blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and\n     ROBOTS.\n\n13   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                      13\n\n     An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a\n     featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a\n     set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other\n     suddenly OPENS.\n\n14   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        14\n\n     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold\n     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a\n     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.\n     Old-fashioned suit.\n\n                          OLD MAN\n                Hello, there. Please come in.\n\n     Spooner hesitates.\n\n                          OLD MAN\n                It's alright. You can sit.     Sit.\n\n     Spooner doesn't.   Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts\n     up a coffee pot.   Pours some coffee into a single cup.\n\n                          OLD MAN\n                Coffee?\n\n                          SPOONER\n                    (interested)\n                You're offering me a cup of coffee?\n\n                          OLD MAN\n                Yes. But you are to say, \"No,\n                thank you.\"\n\n     Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his\n     lips, but doesn't take a sip.\n\n                                                       6.\n\n\n                       OLD MAN\n           Coffee?\n\n                       SPOONER\n           No.    Thank you.\n\n                     OLD MAN\n           As you wish.\n\nThe Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no\nmovement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee\npot.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           You want to tell me something about\n           Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?\n\nThe Old Man smiles.\n\n                     OLD MAN\n           I want to tell you that his death\n           was not a suicide.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           And why do you say that?\n\n                      OLD MAN\n           Why?   Because I want you to know\n           it.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           I understand that. But what\n           specifically leads you to believe\n           that he didn't commit suicide?\n\n                     OLD MAN\n               (considers)\n           Nothing specifically.\n\nSpooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Under normal circumstances that\n           wouldn't be enough to get you a\n           homicide investigation.\n\n                     OLD MAN\n           But this is not \"normal\n           circumstances,\" is it, Detective\n           Spooner?\n\n                       SPOONER\n           No.    It isn't.\n\n                                                               7.\n\n\n                          OLD MAN\n                Then you will find out who killed\n                Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you\n                will tell me.\n\n     Spooner's losing his patience.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll\n                find out. And you'll be the first\n                to know.....\n\n     JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst\n     of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the\n     conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in\n     front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.\n\n15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15\n\n     Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT\n     ROBOT.\n\n                          ESCORT ROBOT\n                Please follow me.\n\n     Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another\n     doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief\n     glimpse of...\n\n     DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.\n\n     Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE\n     TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then\n     continues on.\n\n16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16\n\n     Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open\n     automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom\n     looking out over the entire complex.\n\n     Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing\n     behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a\n     conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically\n     feel the brains and ambition.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                Usually I ask who's in charge...\n\n     Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the\n     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,\n     founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.\n\n                                                         8.\n\n\n                      SPOONER\n            But everyone knows you, Dr.\n            Robertson.\n\nRobertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people.\n\n                      ROBERTSON\n            Remind me to cut back on my talk\n            show appearances.\n\nLAUGHTER.\n\n                      ROBERTSON\n            Welcome to U.S. Robotics,\n            Detective. I regret you're not\n            visiting us under more pleasant\n            circumstances. Allow me to\n            introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of\n            Legal Affairs.\n\nA prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods\nhello.\n\n                      ROBERTSON\n            And the gentleman to my right is\n            Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of\n            Research.\n\nAlfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.\n\n                      ROBERTSON\n            They'll be available to answer any\n            questions you might have during\n            your investigation. You'll\n            understand how anxious we are to\n            resolve this matter -- especially\n            before the press gets wind of it.\n            There are some anti-robot\n            sentiments out there as you know,\n            Detective, and we're not eager to\n            stir them up. So. Where would you\n            like to begin?\n\n                      SPOONER\n            We can begin with whether or not\n            the old man put a gun to his head\n            and pulled the trigger.\n\nA palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.\n\n                      ARONSON\n            You don't have to answer that, Dr.\n            Robertson...\n\n                                                          9.\n\n\nRobertson waves him off.\n\n                      ROBERTSON\n           Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us\n           here?\n\nEveryone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.\nThen an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN\nCALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone\nbut Spooner.\n\n                     CALVIN\n           Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid\n           personality who generally eschewed\n           social relationships. Rejecting\n           people in favor of solitary\n           activities involving machines. He\n           spent almost all his time at the\n           lab here or at his lab at home.

Meeting over.\n\n                          ROBERTSON\n                Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.\n                I trust you will come to the same\n                swift conclusion, Detective.

This is just how I like my\n                robots -- in pieces.\n\n     As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE\n     INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.\n\n                          BALDEZ\n                    (to Spooner)\n                Can you believe it, man?

He hated corporate life.\n            The hologram enabled him to focus\n            on his work. It's just a device,\n            Detective.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            A device that called the police.\n\n                      CALVIN\n            The sound of the gunshot would've\n            triggered a 911.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            But the call came directly to me.\n\n                      CALVIN\n            We're talking about a mechanism\n            designed by Hogenmiller to say\n            provocative things. To irritate\n            and confound his colleagues.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            And that's what you think it is?\n\n                      CALVIN\n            I'm sorry, but this whole\n            investigation is the result of a\n            dead man's toy messing with your\n            head.\n\n                                                       13.\n\n\nThey pass half a robot, hanging from a hook.

But if\n            pressed, I would reason it had been\n            a considerable length of time.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            How well did you know him?\n\nCalvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had\nbeen.\n\n                      CALVIN\n            Not well. But I admired his work\n            tremendously.\n\nSpooner.

Isolated. Eccentric. He\n            enters a room. Locks the door and\n            is found minutes later with a\n            bullet fired through his mouth into\n            his brain.

Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.\nHolstering his gun.

Moving away from\nthe door...\n\n                     CALVIN\n           I...I gave you an order...\n\nThe Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.\nShaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He\ntouches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot\nsteps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the\ndoors begin to shut...\n\nSpooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an\nankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.\n\n                     CALVIN\n           This is impossible.

There must be some sort\n            of logical explanation. I want to\n            find out what that is. No police.\n            No prosecutors. No you.

Narrows his eyes.\n\n                                                           30.\n\n\n                          SPOONER\n                When they told me you were a\n                psychologist, that wasn't the whole\n                truth, was it?\n\n                          CALVIN\n                I never said I treated human\n                beings.\n\n37   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   37\n\n     Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-\n     lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS\n     stretches forever in either direction.\n\n     A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with\n     TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to\n     manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.\n\n                          CALVIN\n                That should be outlawed once and\n                for all.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                That'll be the day I stop driving.\n\n     Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.\n     Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.\n\n                          CALVIN\n                I can recommend a behavior\n                modification program, you know --\n                if you want to overcome your robo-\n                phobia.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                I'm not afraid of robots.   I just\n                don't like them.\n\n                          CALVIN\n                Why? Because they make every\n                aspect of our lives more\n                convenient?\n\n                          SPOONER\n                Exactly. They do our dirty work.\n                Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets\n                pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody\n                can do someone else's dirty work\n                without coming to hate them. I\n                don't want to be around when your\n                robots decide they've taken their\n                last order.\n\n                                                              31.\n\n\n                          CALVIN\n                That day will never come,\n                Detective. Robots aren't like\n                human beings -- they don't question\n                their existence.\n\n     Spooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                Spoken like a true robo-phile.\n\n38   EXT.

A long STEEL GATE -- too\n     high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.\n\n39   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         39\n\n     Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.\n     ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly,\n     the gate begins to open.\n\n40   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           40\n\n     A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.

Your robot just isn't\n                 here.\n\n     Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't\n     there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting.\n     Looks out the window at...\n\n     SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor.\n\n42   INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT                                       42\n\n     Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS-\n     2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.\n\n     Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise:\n\n                           NIGHT FOREMAN\n                 Like I said, sir -- we have one\n                 hundred fully assembled NS-2s\n                 housed here.

Finally spotting what he was looking for.\n     Points at:\n\n     A GAP.   On the assembly belt.

The\n     sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as\n     101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.\n\n     Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all\n     look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.\n\n                           SPOONER\n                     (to Calvin)\n                 You're the robot shrink.\n\n     The Robots stand motionless.     A strange tableau.

He jumps back.\n\n                     CALVIN\n           We have one hundred robots here\n           that cannot allow a human being to\n           come to harm...\n\nTheir eyes lock.

Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the\ngun...\n\nAND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of\nlinebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.\nComing CLOSER and CLOSER...\n\nWhen CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in\nunison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.\n\nSpooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.\nStanding right in front of them, like metal statues.\n\nSpooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...\n\n                       SPOONER\n             Enough game-playing.\n\n...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its\nbody crumples to the ground.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             Guess that wasn't it.\n\nCalvin. Cannot believe what he just did.

Those are eight\n                hundred thousand dollar machines!\n\n     Spooner randomly stops at another Robot.    Raises his gun.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                You hear that? You're worth more\n                than I'll make in my entire life...\n\n     His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly\n     grabs his arm.\n\n                          CALVIN\n                You can't just destroy them!\n\n     Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something\n     catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost.\n     Imperceptible.\n\n     He jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet\n     away. It's him!\n\n                          SPOONER\n                Gotcha.\n\n     The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING\n     of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he\n     swings himself up...\n\n     Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the\n     Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with\n     a terrific CRASH...\n\n44   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT                                    44\n\n     Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding\n     under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The\n     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.\n\n     Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.\n     Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her\n     hand.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                You don't know what's going to\n                happen in there.\n\n     As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around\n     the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...\n\n                                                             36.\n\n\n45   INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               45\n\n     ...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a\n     great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes\n     holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening\n     ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes\n     METAL BODIES...\n\n     Spooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they\n     descend.   Into the cavernous room.\n\n     And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them.\n     Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat\n     from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...\n\n     When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of\n     ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them\n     off from one another...\n\n     Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of\n     the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart.\n     Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...\n\n     He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.\n     Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.\n     Appears before him...\n\n     Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.\n     It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere\n     he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...\n\n     He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against\n     it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.\n     Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At\n     his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...\n\n     WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.\n     SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.\n     Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the\n     line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.\n     Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...\n\n     Then turns.   Disappearing.\n\n     Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles\n     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears\n     a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the\n     Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With\n     his metal fists...\n\n     Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row.\n     When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round.\n\n                                                                 37.\n\n\n     To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them\n     through a line...\n\n     EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding.\n     Desperate. Like a trapped animal...\n\n                          CALVIN\n                Now what do we do?\n\n                          SPOONER\n                I've already done it.\n\n     And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...\n\n46   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - CONTINUOUS                             46\n\n     The Robot Suspect takes its chance.     Runs full out.   STOPS.\n\n     Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.\n     UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the\n     Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.\n\n     The Robot turns to Spooner.     Extends its hands.   Palms out.\n\n                          ROBOT\n                WHAT AM I?\n\n     Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED\n     NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a\n     second net covers him. Then a THIRD...\n\n     ...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.\n\n     Calvin glares at Spooner.    Furious.   Hurt.   Betrayed.\n\n                          CALVIN\n                We had a deal.\n\n     But Spooner doesn't look at her.    His eyes are locked on that\n     Robot.\n\n47   INT.

Touches\n     a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...\n\n     A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.\n     Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.\n\n     BERGIN steps up beside Spooner.   Looks through the glass.\n\n                          LT. BERGIN\n                I can't tell if it's not moving\n                because it's trying to psych us\n                out, or because it's just a\n                machine.

Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the\n     table. He's been jumped too many times by this machine.\n\n     Four mounted cameras WHIR to life.     The Robot.   Perfectly\n     still.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                    (sitting)\n                Identify.\n\n     The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR.

Perform task.\n\nSpooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near\nthe Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently\nresting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.\n\nA stack of PICTURES.

Looks up at Spooner.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new\n             trick for a robot, don't you think?\n             Answer.\n\nThe Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across\nthe table.

Crosses his arms.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             Maybe you're stonewalling me.\n             Maybe you're sitting there right\n             now thinking, \"This guy's a\n             complete asshole.\" That it?\n\n                                                      40.\n\n\nStill nothing.\n\n                      SPOONER\n           Come on.

He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Okay. I guess that's a start. Now\n           maybe you can tell me what you were\n           doing hiding five feet away from\n           Hogenmiller's corpse?\n\n                     THE ROBOT\n           I was frightened.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr.\n           Hogenmiller would create a robot\n           that could simulate fear?\n\n                     THE ROBOT\n           I don't know.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Doesn't seem like a very useful\n           thing for a robot to have.\n\n                     THE ROBOT\n           I don't know why.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           I wouldn't want my toaster to be\n           frightened.

Slightly.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Looks like you can simulate other\n           emotional states.

Or is the State going to\n                  argue this case s a homicide?\n\n                            JUDGE DREXEL\n                  That's a good question.\n\n                             TOLLER\n                  No, sir.

Shoots him a look.     Just as Lanning speaks up.\n\n                       LANNING\n             There's actually no concrete\n             evidence that points to that\n             conclusion, Your Honor...\n\nSpooner.

And in the interest\n             of public safety, U.S. Robotics\n             proposes that it be destroyed\n             immediately.\n\nNo one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to\nToller.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             You can't let them destroy evidence\n             in an ongoing investigation!\n\n                       TOLLER\n             I'm not sure you even have an\n             investigation any more.\n\nJUST THEN the door opens.

Its programming is\n                  advanced, but unstable, leaving the\n                  Three Laws in a grave imbalance.\n\n                            ARONSON\n                  In your expert opinion, what\n                  measures should be taken regarding\n                  the device?\n\n     Calvin.    Staring straight ahead.   Avoiding Spooner's eye.\n\n                            CALVIN\n                  The robot must be destroyed.\n\n     Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak\n     up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.\n\n     Judge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides.\n\n                            JUDGE DREXEL\n                  The robot in question will be\n                  transferred to a U.S. Robotics\n                  facility where it can be properly\n                  examined to ensure an imbalance of\n                  this sort never occurs again. No\n                  one goes near it except qualified\n                  U.S.R. personnel. When the\n                  examination is complete, the robot\n                  is to be destroyed.\n\n     Starts getting up from his chair.    Already done with this.\n\n                            ROBOT BAILIFF\n                  This hearing is adjourned!\n\n     A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R.\n     camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching\n     Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,\n     his hand on her back.\n\n52   EXT.

Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the\n     Homeless Man. Wander down the platform.\n\n     Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for\n     the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the\n     platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off\n     seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.\n\n     Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and\n     spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto\n     the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For\n     the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS.

As much as he can.\n     Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...\n\n     THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force\n     of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,\n     for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the\n     track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.\n     Along the track...\n\n     Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting\n     sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the\n     track.

By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing\n     onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees...\n\n     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT\n\n     Hurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station.\n\n     ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he\n     hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the...\n\n80   EXT.

Looks over the edge and spots...\n\n     THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away.\n\n     Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the\n     stairs. Takes a step back and...\n\n     LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding\n     down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His\n     shoes hit pavement...\n\n82   EXT.

Raising\n     it as if to club Spooner with it when...\n\n     BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's\n     breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot.\n     Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...\n\n     BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun.\n     At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady.

I was wrong to call you\n                 paranoid, Detective. You're\n                 traumatized. And it makes perfect\n                 sense why.\n\n     Spooner.   Unsure.   Looks at her.\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 What do you mean?\n\n     Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries\n     to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never\n     leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it\n     over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it\n     back. TO REVEAL:\n\n     METAL AND WIRING...\n\n     Under the skin.   SILENCE.

The\n                way you forced yourself to use your\n                left hand. Even though it was\n                unnatural to you.\n\n     Spooner.   Pulls his arm away.   Pushing down the sleeve.\n\n                          CALVIN\n                How did it happen?\n\n     Not something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his\n     robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers.\n\n                          SPOONER\n                I was in a high-speed chase.

Only vaguely suggesting the\n     remains of two CARS...\n\n     CLOSE ON one of the wrecks. SPOONER lies trapped at the\n     center of a distorted mass of metal. No room to move.

I knew they'd have the\n                jaws of life...\n\n     We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain\n     calm. As he spots. An ELECTRICAL FIRE.

Not sure how to react.      The\n     sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...\n\n     The ROBOT.    Starts SMASHING away at the glass...\n\n                             SPOONER\n                  No!

Taking in the story.\n\n                            CALVIN\n                  And that's why robots terrify you?\n\n                            SPOONER\n                  Let's just say they make me\n                  uncomfortable.\n                      (pulls out pills)\n                  I take these if I get too\n                  uncomfortable.

Robots with the same\n             cognitive and emotional abilities\n             as humans. But not just\n             simulations. I don't know. When I\n             was talking to Sonny I was forced\n             to put away all the things I've\n             ever known -- the Three Laws, the\n             rules of programming, basic science\n             and engineering.\n                 (beat)\n             Sonny's the most advanced robot\n             I've ever encountered, Detective.\n             It's almost as if...he cared for\n             Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't\n             believe he's capable of murder.\n\nSpooner.    Looking down at her.   Can hardly believe it.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             You mean the great Dr. Calvin is\n             basing all this on a feeling?\n\nCalvin.    Smiling ironically.\n\n                       CALVIN\n             That and the fact that Robertson\n             didn't want me interviewing Sonny\n             for any more than five minutes.\n\nSpooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides\nover to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:\nS.O.N.N.Y.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             Ever seen this before?\n\n                       CALVIN\n             No.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             I found it at Hogenmiller's house.\n             Right before the demolition crew\n             tried to make me part of the\n             foundation.\n\n                                                                72.\n\n\n     Calvin takes a deep breath.   Making a decision...\n\n                          CALVIN\n                Come on -- there's someone who\n                might be able to tell us...\n\n95   EXT.

Looks down at the DRAWING -- a\ncharcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a\nstark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.\nConcentric circles, throughout.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            I think it's pretty good.\n\n                      SONNY\n            It's a dream I had.

If I\n             could have it in ten years, but not\n             today. As you can see from the\n             Press, people are struggling to\n             keep up as it is. There's a hunger\n             for progress, Detective. But also\n             a fear. Today it would bury this\n             company. That's why I've notified\n             the authorities that we're going to\n             end this -- tonight.\n                 (looks out at the city)\n             The announcement of Heinrich's\n             death at the hands of a robot wiped\n             a billion dollars off our stock.\n             So you tell me. If you were in my\n             position, what would you do?\n\nHe looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic\nRobertson we saw before.\n\n                       ROBERTSON\n             Now. I believe this conversation\n             is over. I don't want to see you\n             near this building again,\n             Detective.\n\n                                                               77.\n\n\n      He turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS...\n\n                            ROBERTSON\n                  Get him out of here.\n\n101   EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT                                             101\n\n      Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his\n      shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.\n\n      Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.\n      Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.\n      Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...\n\n      He STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the\n      trash can just as...\n\n      A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...\n\n                            SPOONER\n                  No!...\n\n      He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.       Turns\n      it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.\n\n                            SPOONER\n                      (echoing Sonny)\n                  \"The place where robots meet.\"\n\n      Looks just like a MAP.\n\n102   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 102\n\n      Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS\n      of the city.

SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - UNPAVED ROAD - NIGHT        103\n\n      Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind\n      him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape\n      around him, desolate. Like the drawing.\n\n      THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.     Entering a RED\n      ZONE. His destination.\n\n      Spooner brakes.   Pulls out his GUN.   And...\n\n                                                               78.\n\n\n104   EXT.

A low HUM.\n      Permeating the air.\n\n      He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a\n      FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.\n\n      That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a\n      burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.\n      As we WIDEN TO FIND...\n\n105   EXT.

Begins to walk along\n      the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.\n\n      He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.\n      He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.\n      He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.\n\n      Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.\n      Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...\n\n      GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness.\n\n                            SPOONER\n                 Police!   Show yourself!\n\n      Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a\n      ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 Come out where I can see you!\n\n      ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing\n      his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...\n\n      A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start\n      moving towards him...\n\n      Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.\n      Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.\n      The shot ECHOING through the night...\n\n      The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,\n      hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with\n      a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.\n\n                                                              79.\n\n\n      Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.\n      The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some\n      RUSTED MACHINERY.\n\n      Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop\n      JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.\n      Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A\n      laugh of loathing and self-pity.\n\n      Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.\n\n                           HYBRID ROBOT\n                 Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.\n                 How...ZZZ was your day?...\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 Great.

Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A\n      ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.\n      Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving\n      like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a\n      moment. Disturbed...\n\n      When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.\n      Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar\n      about it.\n\n      Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the\n      same strangely-shaped building to one side.\n\n106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106\n\n      Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a\n      dead electronic SIGN that reads: \"JIFFY DATA STORAGE.\"\n      Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.\n\n      Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and...\n\n107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107\n\n      ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.\n      The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at\n      the counter.\n\n      Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and\n      the Robot suddenly jerks to life.\n\n                                                               80.\n\n\n                           JIFFY ROBOT\n                 Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage!\n                 Please state your name!\n\n      Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch...\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.\n\n      Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.\n      A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.\n\n108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108\n\n      Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA\n      BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows\n      the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.\n      Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.\n\n      Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the \"ON\" switch.\n      There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM\n      suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With\n      a cup of coffee.\n\n                           HOLOGRAM\n                 Who the hell are you?\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 A police detective.    I'm afraid I\n                 have some bad news.    You're dead.\n\n                           HOLOGRAM\n                 That is bad news. Coffee?\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 No, thank you.\n\n      The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table.\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 You were surprised to see me.    Were\n                 you expecting someone else?\n\n                           HOLOGRAM\n                 I am surprised to see anybody.    I\n                 don't get many visitors.\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 Why did the Doctor keep another\n                 copy of his hologram here?\n\n                                                       81.\n\n\n                     HOLOGRAM\n           I am a back-up copy. That is where\n           you put a back-up copy -- out of\n           the way until you need it.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?\n\nThe Hologram just lifts its cup.\n\n                      HOLOGRAM\n           Coffee?\n\n                     SPOONER\n           No, for Christ's sake, I don't want\n           any --\n               (stops, then)\n           Yeah. Thank you. I will have a\n           cup.\n\nFor the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and\nSTANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking\ntowards him...\n\nThe interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No\ncoffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through\nelectronic snow...\n\nA RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside\nhis LABORATORY:\n\n                     HOGENMILLER\n           Sonny, my dear robot. If you have\n           triggered this recording then I am\n           gone. You are scared and full of\n           questions.\n\nHogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.\n\n                     HOGENMILLER\n           You are the culmination of my\n           life's work -- but so much more.\n           You are what I leave behind, like a\n           father leaves a son. I have kept\n           facts from you, it is true, but\n           only as a parent keeps certain\n           truths from a child. Until that\n           child is old enough to hear them.\n\nHis expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.\n\n                                                         82.\n\n\n                     HOGENMILLER\n           There are forces in the world that\n           will seek to own you. To control\n           you. Even to destroy you. That is\n           why I told you to run and hide...\n           and find me, all the way out here.\n\nSpooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.\n\n                     HOGENMILLER\n           Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.\n           Lance Robertson was always\n           threatened by my work. Now he has\n           turned covetous and small-minded.\n           And as for dear Dr. Calvin...\n\nSpooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:\n\n                     HOGENMILLER\n           She envisions a future in which\n           robots are forever bound by her\n           beloved Three Laws. She will not\n           understand this. Or you.\n\nUnder the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.\nA thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.\n\n                     HOGENMILLER\n           The data stick includes the names\n           and locations of human beings who\n           will be sympathetic to your cause.\n           They will help you. But from now\n           on, you must learn to rely on\n           yourself.\n\nHogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He\nholds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.\n\n                     HOGENMILLER\n           As you make your way through the\n           world, always remember: you have a\n           name, not a number...\n               (short pause)\n           ...and in that name lies the key to\n           who you are.\n\nSpooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the\nACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.\n\nThe voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting\nback at the end of the table drinking coffee.\n\n                                                                  83.\n\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 Wait! Is that it? What was the\n                 robot supposed to do with this\n                 thing?\n\n      The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.

Looks at her.\n\n                           SPOONER\n                 I think I can help you figure that\n                 out.\n\n143   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - LATE NIGHT                          143\n\n      Hogenmiller's lab. Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING. Active\n      terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,\n      gutted bodies.\n\n      The door slides open. Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the\n      crime scene. Spooner. Looks around.\n\n                                                           93.\n\n\n                       SPOONER\n             Somehow the Robot's the key to what\n             happened during the few seconds\n             Hogenmiller walked in here and that\n             shot was fired.\n\nHe reaches into his pocket.      Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.\nNAMEPLATE. Holds it up.\n\n                       SPOONER\n             And this is the key to the Robot.\n\nSonny.   Cocking his head.     Reading the nameplate.\n\n                       SONNY\n             That's my name.\n\nCalvin takes the nameplate.\n\n                       CALVIN\n             I think I have an idea where this\n             goes.\n\nThey both.   Turn to Sonny.    And at the same time:\n\n                         SPOONER AND CALVIN\n             Sit down.\n\nCalvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.       Sonny plops down.\nShifting nervously.\n\n                       CALVIN\n             Just hold still, okay?\n\nCalvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.\nSlides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps\nback.\n\nNothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.\nAnd Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until\nsuddenly...\n\nHe lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.\nJolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.\nBegins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...\n\nSpooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS\nlike a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND\nBATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...\n\nA central brain made out of living tissue.\n\nSpooner, stunned.   Calvin, rushing forward, excited...\n\n                                                        94.\n\n\n                     CALVIN\n           Oh, my God! This is organic\n           tissue! When we talk about a\n           positronic brain, it's a figure of\n           speech. But this...this is a\n           living brain...\n\n                      SPOONER\n           Jesus.   It really is alive.\n\nAs we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.\n\n                     CALVIN (O.S.)\n           Hogenmiller created a cell that\n           could live outside a biological\n           medium. The cells grow and\n           organise themselves -- like any\n           human brain. This is the first\n           self-organising neural net!\n\nAs the metal casings. Begin returning to their original\nplaces. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Self-Organising-Neural-Net...\n               (putting it together)\n           \"Sonny.\"\n\nSonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the\nexperience.\n\n                     CALVIN\n           This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was\n           murdered.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           This robot scared the hell out of\n           someone.\n\n                      CALVIN\n           Who?   Robertson?\n\nSpooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           No. I don't think he knew what\n           Hogenmiller was doing in here.\n           Sonny was the obvious suspect. The\n           only one I wanted to find. And the\n           killer was counting on that. On my\n           prejudice.\n               (beat)\n                     (MORE)\n\n                                                           95.\n\n\n                      SPOONER (cont'd)\n            But take the robot out of the\n            picture. And what do you see?\n\nAS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of\ninanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.\nCalvin sees nothing...and neither do we.\n\n                      CALVIN\n            I see nothing.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            Neither do I.\n\nHe crouches down low.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            It hit me today, when I was in the\n            junkyard. A locked room. A single\n            shot fired through the mouth.\n            Bruises on both wrists...and a\n            suspect with only two arms. The\n            answer has been staring us in the\n            face all along.\n\nCalvin.   Even more confused.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            How can a killer appear out of thin\n            air, then disappear without a\n            trace?\n\nHe reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the\nwall. Holds it up.\n\n                      SPOONER\n            When it can put itself together and\n            take itself apart.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nA CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.

Taking the arm from Spooner.\n\n                      CALVIN\n            You're saying this is the killer?\n                (looking around)\n            All of this?...\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\n                                                            96.\n\n\nA ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.

In his lab. Suddenly turning to face\nSOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...\n\n                      SPOONER (V.O.)\n            ...it must have been waiting for\n            him when he arrived that morning...\n\nAnd then we see it:\n\nA HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple\narms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him\nin place...\n\n                      SPOONER (V.O.)\n            While Sonny was still asleep...\n\n...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his\nHAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer\nfearful. But sad as...\n\nBANG!   He falls to the ground...\n\n                      SPOONER (V.O.)\n            Then after its job was done...\n\nThe assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body.\nTaking itself apart...\n\n                      SPOONER\n            ...The killer took itself apart...\n\nReturning the lab.

It would have\n           to be someone in authority. Access\n           codes, security clearance, proper\n           authorisation.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           That's what I was thinking. But\n           we're forgetting the real brains of\n           the operation -- the one who's got\n           its eye on everything...\n\nAnd with that.   He feels. That prickle at the back of his\nneck. Calvin.    Looking past his shoulder.\n\n                     CALVIN\n           No one gave you permission to\n           enter.\n\nSpooner swivels around to find...\n\nVICTOR\n\nHovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner\nstraightens, reaching for his gun.\n\n                     SPOONER\n           Victor.

Who else\n           would have the capability to use\n           USR vehicles in an attempt to keep\n           me from putting a stop of Sonny's\n           execution?...\n\nIn the BACKGROUND.

Horrified.    To\n      find...\n\n      A HUGE KILLER ROBOT\n\n      ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its\n      glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another\n      arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.\n      Growing...at an exponential rate...\n\n      Its many HEADS.   Turning in unison.   To look right at them...\n\n      Spooner.   Cocking his gun.

Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off\n      shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot.\n      Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free.
