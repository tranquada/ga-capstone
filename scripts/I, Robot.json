His face,\n    covered in sweat.\n\n    PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around\n    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly\n    cheerful.\n\n    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT\n    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a\n    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.\n\n    You are in danger...\n\n    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His\n    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of\n    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.\n\n<b>3   INT.

A river of humanity.\n\n    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His\n    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He\n    turns and sees...\n\n    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still\n    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering\n    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up\n    with a muted WHIR...\n\n<b>                         ROBOT\n</b>                   (metallic voice)\n               Good day, sir...\n\n    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to\n    lose the robot.\n\n    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment\n    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.\n    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting\n    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:\n\n    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building\n    cleaning windows.\n\n    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently\n    repairs the street. No human supervision.\n\n    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.\n    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...\n\n    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.\n    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.\n    Briefcases.\n\n    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.\n\n    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.\n    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's\n    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.\n\n<b>                         LITTLE GIRL\n</b>               Hi.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                              3.\n</b>\n\n<b>                          SPOONER\n</b>               Hi.\n\n    But it's not her father.

He steps off the curb\n    Just as...\n\n    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large\n    digital EYE on him:\n\n<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT\n</b>               Please return to the sidewalk.\n\n    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.\n\n<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT\n</b>               Please return to the sidewalk...\n\n    The traffic signal, tracking him.\n\n<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT\n</b>               You are in violation of city\n               ordinance 14-B726...\n\n    Spooner throws up his hand.

Soaring, gravity-defying\n    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings\n    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel\n    shields.\n\n    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to\n    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.\n    The \"old\" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                             4.\n</b>\n\n<b>10   EXT.

On the other side a GIANT SCREEN\n     with real time video of various streets and buildings.\n\n     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.\n     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.\n     Several electronic messages say the same thing:\n\n<b>                             SEE ME!\n</b>\n<b>                          LT.

U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        14\n</b>\n     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold\n     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a\n     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.\n     Old-fashioned suit.\n\n<b>                          OLD MAN\n</b>                Hello, there.

I\n                 thought you weren't programmed with\n                 the Three Laws.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                  108.\n</b>\n\n<b>                     SONNY\n</b>           Let's just say I wrote some of my\n           own laws today, Detective: a robot\n           must protect a friend from\n           harm...as long as he's not a\n           complete asshole.\n\nSpooner smiles.\n\n<b>                     SPOONER\n</b>           Well, that's certainly a start,\n           Sonny.\n\nSonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.\n\n<b>                      SONNY\n</b>           Sonny.   You called me Sonny.\n\n<b>                     SPOONER\n</b>           Don't get used to it.\n\nSonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then\ntakes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a\n<b>HANDSHAKE.\n</b>\n<b>                     SONNY\n</b>           Detective Spooner, I...\n\n<b>                     SPOONER\n</b>               (anticipating)\n           Let's just save the thanks, okay?\n\nSonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape.\n\n<b>                     SONNY\n</b>           I don't know what I'm going to do\n           now.\n\n<b>                     SPOONER\n</b>           Good -- That's one of the perks of\n           freedom.\n\nSonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then\nhesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.\n\nCalvin and Spooner.   Watching them go.\n\n<b>                     SPOONER\n</b>           You're going to have a hell of a\n           time explaining this.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                              109.\n</b>\n\n<b>                           CALVIN\n</b>                 Don't worry. I have a feeling that\n                 U.S. Robotics will be needing my\n                 services very badly in the future.\n\n      She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then\n      suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely\n      surprised.\n\n<b>                           CALVIN\n</b>                 I am the only robo-psychologist\n                 around.\n\n      She turns on her heel and heads back inside.    Spooner smiles.\n\n<b>160   INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT             160\n</b>\n      Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S\n      HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.\n\n<b>                            HOLOGRAM\n</b>                 So.   You found out who killed me.\n\n<b>                           SPOONER\n</b>                 I started to wonder about Victor\n                 the second I met him.\n\n<b>                           HOLOGRAM\n</b>                 Why is that, Detective?\n\n<b>                           SPOONER\n</b>                 Too much access. Too much\n                 knowledge. Plus -- he smiled\n                 whenever your death was mentioned.\n                 Those models are programmed to\n                 frown at bad news.\n\n<b>                           HOLOGRAM\n</b>                 Hah! Then even in this day and\n                 age, catching the killer all comes\n                 down to pure instinct!\n\n      Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled.      He gets up.\n      Walks over to the window. Stares out...\n\n<b>      EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN\n</b>\n      Sonny walking along deserted streets.   Looking over his\n      shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                             110.\n</b>\n\n<b>                           SPOONER (V.O.)\n</b>                 Victor thought that by letting your\n                 robot exist, I'd be condemning the\n                 human race as we know it to\n                 extinction.\n\n<b>                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)\n</b>                 Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But\n                 why are you so worried? We will\n                 both be dead long before then --\n\n<b>161   EXT.

The power\n      lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the\n      burned-out husks of industrial machinery.\n\n      Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting\n      louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT\n      emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.\n\n      But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.\n      Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and\n      broken bodies, straightening out as...\n\n      DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a\n      large circle. As they all turn to look at:\n\n      SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.\n      Looking out at the vast junkyard below.\n\n      CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,\n      creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite\n      possibilities.\n\n      The robots.   Staring up at him.   Eager for what comes next.\n\n<b>                                                FADE OUT\n</b><b>\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/I,-Robot.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>I, Robot</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Hillary Seitz\" title=\"Scripts by Hillary Seitz\">Hillary Seitz</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/I, Robot Script.html#comments\" title=\"I, Robot comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:51.387279"}
