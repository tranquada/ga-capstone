Old pine trees poke through the snow cover that\n      blankets the neighborhood.  HOWARD (30s), a burly outdoors type, is trying to\n      unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup.  TED WATTERS (late\n      20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat, walks down the street. He stops by\n      Howard's driveway.\n\n                                  TED\n              Need a hand?\n\n                                  HOWARD\n                        (turning)\n              Yeah.  Could ya grab me those two by eights?\n\n      Ted walks up the driveway, grabs the wood slats, makes a ramp by leaning\n      them against the rear bumper.\n\n                                  HOWARD (cont'd)\n              Thanks.\n\n      Howard maneuvers the snowmobile down the ramp, his back turned toward\n      Ted -- who has taken out a small cam-corder and is taping Howard.\n\n                                  HOWARD (cont'd)\n              I tell ya, it may look fast but it sure ain't light.

A\n      Miami Dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration.\n\n      As the tape finishes, a smattering of APPLAUSE from his colleagues.  Ted\n      gives a small wave over the cubicle wall.\n\n                                  TED (cont'd)\n              Thank you.

The phone\n      RINGS.  Ted picks up, his eyes never wavering from the gore intensive\n      computer game.\n\n                                  TED (cont'd)\n              Claims, Ted Watters.

With no\n              actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must\n              be missing for seven years before he or she can be\n              legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an\n              investigation period where concerned parties can\n              take up to another year to file interventions\n              concerning the motion.  So, even though your\n              brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's\n              really very little we can do for you.\n\n      Ted flips the file shut.  Case closed.  Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's\n      demeanor, forces a smile.\n\n                                  BRANCH\n              Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss.\n\n      Branch looks at Ted.

But that's miles away.  Here on the outskirts is a rapidly\n      failing five store strip mall; a \"Porn-a-copia\" XXX Video store, hair stylist,\n      small engine repair shop, fish and chips joint and the \"Barnell Great Escapes\" \n      travel agency.  We might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner.  Paul's car,\n      a Ford Taurus, pulls onto the parking pad.\n\n12    INT.

His mug falls, the lid pops and the\n      coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers.\n\n                                  PAUL (cont'd)\n              Great.\n                        (back into phone)\n              No, I'm not...

Distracted for a moment, the phone slips and falls\n      into the trash.\n\n      Paul, muttering, leans in to get it.  He pushes aside an orange garbage bag,\n      guided by the faint sound of the other person STILL TALKING. And then--\n\n      PAUL'S POV: of THE BODY-- a 40-ish White (well, a little blue) male dressed in\n      a cheap suit.  Paul's phone lies across the corpse's mouth, like the dead guy is\n      talking.\n\n                                  THE CELL PHONE\n              Mr. Barnell?  Mr. Barnell?\n\n15    EXT.

He takes a moment to compose himself, then\n      realizes his phone is still in there.\n\n      He opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in, grabs his cell and\n      hurries off.  The lid CRASHES shut.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        (into the phone)\n              Hello?\n\n      Hung up.

He stands there, thinking.\n\nA15   INT. \"BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL\" - LATER                                  A15\n\n      Paul back in his office, staring out the window with a perfect view of the\n      dumpster.  He can't take his eyes off it.\n\n      Behind him, the Repo-Men are picking up a newish computer monitor and\n      walking toward the door.  He's oblivious.\n\n      At the sound of a TRUCK, his head snaps around.  It's a garbage truck, but\n      instead of heading to the dumpster, it rumbles past on the road.

Behind the\n\n      beverages, a garage where Paul struggles with the lifeless body.  He props the\n      man against the hood of his car, gives him a quick once over, pockets, obvious\n      wounds.  Nothing.\n\n      Paul moves to the fridge, starts to pull things out.\n\n17    INT. ATTACHED SUBURBAN GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                    17\n\n      Jodie, an annoyingly small dog, enters the garage from the house and starts\n      sniffing around the body.

Paul moves back to the fridge, opens\n      the door and, with great effort picks up the dead man and tries to stuff him\n      inside.  Only problem...\n\n      The man's legs don't want to fit.  Paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative\n      appendage.  He grits his teeth, looks away as he kicks at the knee.  It SNAPS\n      sideways.\n\n      Paul fights nausea.  But with the leg now out of joint, the man fits.  Paul,\n      breathing heavy, leans against the door.\n\n                                  PAUL (cont'd)\n              OK then.  OK.\n\n      He packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles.  Then, just before\n      he shuts the door, Paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from 1 to 9\n      (the coldest setting).\n\n      A padlock and chain come from the base of a propane BBQ.  It goes around the\n      fridge, the lock SNAPS it in place.  Paul spots some leftover drink cans.  He\n      kicks them to the corner and walks into the house, trying to sound casual.\n\n                                  PAUL (cont'd)\n              Hey Honey.  Any mail?\n\n18    EXT.

As she puts her hand on the\n      latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor.\n\n      She tugs on the door.  It opens just a crack before the chain stops it.  The\n      frozen head peeks through the slight gap.\n\n      Margaret SIGHS, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way.\n      She gives the door a hip check.

The laughter stops.\n\n                                  MARGARET (O.S.)\n              Leave him alone, ball licker!\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              And shut that thing --\n\n      The screen turns to snow.

Paul, obviously behind the camera, watches\n      as Margaret takes a tropical drink from a WAITER'S tray, who promptly dumps it\n      all over her.  But instead of the expected burst of profanity, Margaret just\n      LAUGHS.\n\n                                  MARGARET\n              That's okay, don't worry about it.\n                        (as the waiter walks off)\n              I'd like the next one in a cup, please.\n\n      Paul puts aside a faded hotel postcard from Hawaii and digs out an insurance\n      policy out of the box.  On the last page is a list of the payouts.  Loss of a limb:\n      $100,000.  Loss of thumb: $5,000. Accidental death: $1,000,000.\n\n      And, as an extra bonus, Raymond's birth certificate.  Perfect. Paul takes out the\n      credit card application from work, and starts to write...\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        (to himself)\n              Raymond...

WHERRY\n              Paul, sorry to hear about your brother.\n                        (Paul gives a sad smile)\n              You moving in?\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Just for a bit.\n\n                                  MRS. WHERRY\n              She'll come to her senses.  They always do.  Oh, the\n              septic lines are frozen, so you'll have to use the\n              outdoor commode.\n\n      Paul waves as he enters the mobile home, closing the door behind him.  A\n      light goes on.  It starts to snow.\n\n90    INT.

Edible Panties.  He\n      puts them on top of a stack of porno mags, neatens the pile, then heads out.\n\n      INT. BEDROOM - LATER\n\n      HIGH ANGLE ON: Paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in the same position\n      we've seen him in when he sleeps with Margaret.  An electric heater glows\n      beside him.\n\n91    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - CONTINUOUS                                         91\n\n      TIGHT ON: Car tires as they pull to a stop on the main road.  A pair of heavy\n      men's boots get out, start to make their way toward the mobile home.\n\n92    INT. MOBILE HOME - LATE NIGHT                                                 92\n\n      There's a KNOCK on the door.  Paul heads to the door.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Who is it?\n\n                                  MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n              State Police.  Is there a Mr. Barnell here?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        (as he unlocks it)\n              Yes, is there something wrong--\n\n      As he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open.  The force of the\n      blow sends Paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall\n      where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head.\n      RAYMOND BARNELL (40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up Paul and throws\n      him through the serving kitchen serving hatch.  Raymond leans through the\n      hole.\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              Hello brother.\n\n      He walks around, takes a copy of \"USA Today\" and throws it at Paul.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Raymond?  Is that...\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              Page 16, Paul. That's why I love \"USA Today\", news\n              from every fuckin' state.  Don't you want to read it?  I\n              was eaten by wild fuckin' animals.  But ya know,\n              despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper.\n\n      Paul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with Raymond\n      right on his heels.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.  We\n              all thought you were...\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              Dead?  Yeah, I got that impression.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              But you had dropped off the face of the earth.\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              And you just decide to make it permanent?\n\n                                  PAUL\n              But there were no records of you anywhere.  I\n              checked.\n\n      With that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs.  Paul doubles over,\n      gasping for breath.\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using\n              your actual ID can be a hinderance.  But despite the\n              reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth\n              certificate to fall back on.  Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was\n              pretty pissed.\n\n      Raymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging\n      him to stop.  Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a\n      sitting position.\n\n                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)\n              But then I start to think, Paul's no idiot.  He woulda\n              told 'em it's not me.  Unless...\n\n      Paul can only sit there and WHEEZE.  Raymond sits beside him on the floor,\n      pulls out a cigarette and lights it.\n\n                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)\n              So what is it?  Frame job, lawsuit...\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Life insurance.\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              Figured.  So where's my money?\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Your money?\n                        (a beat)\n              They're still... investigating.\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              What you get?\n\n      Paul considers whether or not Raymond would even remember.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Fifty thousand.\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n                        (with a shrug)\n              Almost worth coming back for.  What's the split?  I\n              get half?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        (not quite trusting him)\n              Okay.  Sure.\n                        (changing the subject)\n              You look good.  Lost some weight?\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              Gave up carbs.  So what are you doing out here?\n              She not go along with it?\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Who?  Margaret?\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              How she hold up, anyway?\n\n                                  PAUL\n              She's fine.  Actually, we're not doing so good right\n              now.\n\n                                  RAYMOND\n              Any kids?\n                        (off his look)\n              Still can't get one by the goalie, huh.\n\n93    INT. BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - LATER                                           93\n\n      Gary and Margaret sit in silence, Gary taking Margaret's pulse.

He looks as Ted's car pulls up.  As Ted walks\n      toward him...\n\n                                  PAUL\n              Mr. Watters.  You said on the phone something\n              about a resolution in our claim?\n\n                                  TED\n              Mr. Barnell.

Then, finally...\n\n                                  PAUL\n              My wife and I, we're having some problems.\n\n                                  TED\n              Kind of understandable I guess.  Seeing as how you\n              killed that man and dumped his body out in the\n              woods.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              You mean Raymond?\n\n                                  TED\n              No.  Not Raymond.  Definitely not Raymond.  I\n              thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing\n              me...\n\n                                  PAUL\n              I'm not sure I appreciate your tone.\n\n                                  TED\n              My tone, Mr. Barnell?  You are going to jail.  I will\n              personally see to that.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              I really think you should go now.\n\n                                  TED\n              You are a liar and thief.\n\n      Paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to Ted.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              You know Mr. Watters, I've had a pretty rough night,\n              so if you wouldn't mind just leaving.\n\n      Paul tries to guide Ted away, but slips and falls on the snow.  Ted, rolling his\n      eyes, reaches down to help him up.\n\n                                  TED\n                        (noticing the bruises)\n              Hey.

WHERRY (O.S.)\n              What's say you just move away from him.\n\n      Ted, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs. Wherry, from her porch, a\n      compound bow aimed at his forehead.\n\n                                  MRS. WHERRY (cont'd)\n              You all right there, Paul?\n\n                                  PAUL\n              I'm fine, Mrs. Wherry.

Really.\n                        (turning to Watters)\n              I think you'd better go.\n\n      Ted backs to his car, gets in and drives off.  Paul brushes the snow from his\n      jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the\n      wound).\n\n                                  MRS. WHERRY\n              I've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that.\n\n      Paul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips.  An idea slowly\n      takes hold.\n\n95    INT.

Ted, sullen, picks up the shell and turns\n      it over in his hands.  Avis enter from the back.

Ted takes the envelope with the check, hands it to Paul\n      but doesn't let go.  Paul tries to pull it free.  He looks at Ted who looks right\n      through him.  Just then, the lights go out.

Saw some dolphins\n              today.  Frisky little buggers.  They were even playing\n              our song in the bar.  Have been pondering about\n              your question, and I think my answer is \"yes.\"  After\n              all, it's no fun in the sun without...\n\n                                  MARGARET (O.S.) (cont'd)\n              Paul, you ready?\n\n      Paul looks up to see Margaret.  Dressed in a coat, she is standing in the\n      middle of the living room, now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor\n      lamp.\n\n      Paul flips Margaret's letter over, and we now see it is the faded Hawaiian Hilton\n      postcard from the box in his den.\n\n      Paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes, and tucks it under his\n      arm.  Margaret picks up Jodie, whose in his carrying case, and walks over.\n\n      A CAR HORN sounds from outside.  It's their cab.  As they walk to the door...\n\n                                  PAUL\n              How you feeling?\n\n                                  MARGARET\n              Pretty damn good.\n\n                                  PAUL\n              I can tell.\n\n                                  MARGARET\n              Can you?\n\n      Paul takes her hand and gives it a squeeze.  They head out.\n\n169   EXT.
