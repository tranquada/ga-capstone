CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO\n\nAgain, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he\nlooks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The\ntwinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD\nBATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly\nshows them to a shitty table.\n\n                    HARRY (V.O.)\n\n          There you have it. The story in a\n          nutshell.

Harry's\nbehind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next\nto him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An \"IT\" Girl. Smart,\nsexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.\nHer hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year\nage difference between them. Her name is MARIN.

No, I have it.\nHarry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'\nshe caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that\ncard. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've\nreached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass\nand the ocean stretch before them.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (all business)\n          Make a right, left at the second\n          fence.\nMarin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just\ncame over her, looks out the window.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Have I mentioned how gorgeous your\n          breasts look in this sweater?\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (blushing)\n          Yes you have actually.\n\n                     HARRY\n\n          So it would be too much to mention it\n          again. . .\nMarin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,\ndriving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Wow. It's the perfect beach house.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          I know.

She looks over at him but he's\ngrabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at\nher with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say\nsuch a lovely thought.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (trying to keep up with\n               him)\n          Yeah, okay, right...\nThey both grab their H\n                     overnight bags and step out of the car.\n\n                     ARRY\n\n          So, what are we gonna do out here,\n          just the two of us, for two whole\n          days?\nMarin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms\naround his neck.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          Tell me the truth, are you at all\n          glad we waited?\n\n\n\n\n                                                            6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       HARRY\n\n             I'm incredibly glad we're finally\n             going to do it.\n                 (she's a bit disappointed)\n             If that's the same as being glad we\n             waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.\nMarin smiles then kisses him.

No smoking in the house.

HOUSE\n\nIt's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm\nwith spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around\nthe rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight\npants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to\nundress.\n\n                       MARIN\n\n                 (TAKING OFF her belt)\n             The fabulous living room, perfect for\n             entertaining an intimate group of friends\n             or that special someone.\n                 (DROPS her belt then\n                  UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)\n             Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck\n             complete with pool and ocean view.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    MARIN (CONT'D)\n\n              (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)\n          Your pants, please...\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Ladies first.\nMarin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of\nthem.

She turns, her EYES\nWIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down\nto his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (smiling)\n          ..

Do we like it? Going\n          once, going twice ...\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Sold.\nHarry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO\nTHE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her\nass.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          You know when I first started\n          auctioneering someone told me if I was\n          nervous to just picture everyone in the\n          audience in their underwear. This sort of\n          gives that a whole new meaning.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Why? You're not nervous now, are you?\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          I'm always a little nervous.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n              (removing his hands)\n          So put on your bathing suit.

Catches his breath. He\nsits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his\nthroat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a\nstiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that\nyoung man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\nNow wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the\nLiving ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into\nhis bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in\nthe mirror, sucks in his gut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\nWell stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the\nfridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS\nand TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively\nconversation.\nOne of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's\nYounger Sister, ZOE.\nERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.\nIt's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not\nbecause she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and\nright. Erica is the \"girl most likely\" who went beyond\nexpectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of\nherself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she\njust is.\nHer sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She\nwears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, \"BOYS LIE\".\nThe Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR\nIS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking\n\n                     E\n\nout from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.\n\n                     RICA\n\n          Oh God. What is this?\nErica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.\nHarry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.\n\n                    ERICA\n\n              (in control)\n          Okay, stay right where you are.

You\n          h~ving chest pain right now?\n\n                    H\n\n\n                     ARRY\n\n          No, and the pain I was having was\n          sharp, not like before.\n\n                    . DR. MARTINEZ\n\n          That's good. Not like before is we\n          like to hear.\n              (reads EKG)\n          Give him aspirin.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        99.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)\n\n          Based   on what I see so far, your\n          heart   is not in distress but I'm\n          gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be\n          sure.    What were you doing at the\n          onset   of the pain?\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can\n          a woman give you chest pain?\n\n                    DR. MARTINEZ\n\n          Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you\n          heard?\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I\n          never got any.\n\n                    DR. MARTINEZ\n\n              (confused at how literal\n               he is)\n          All right, well you're battin' a thousand\n          here. Your enzymes look perfect, your\n          EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound\n          like the kind of pain we worry about. I\n          think what you experienced was normal\n          chest pain associated with stress.\n\n                      HARRY\n\n          Stress?\n\n                    DR. MARTINEZ\n\n          And incase you haven't heard, that can\n          give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I\n          donlt know what you're up to gallivanting\n          out and about at this hour, but if you\n          were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,\n          in bed, recuperating.\n\nINT.

Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing\nHarry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the\nwhile, tears flood her eyes.\n\nMORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE\n\n\nERICA\n\nwakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.\nWhile in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS\nBREAKFAST, a downpour.
