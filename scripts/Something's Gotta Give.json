He waits a sec then stands with a\nstiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that\nyoung man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>INT. LIVING ROOM\n</b>\nNow wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the\nLiving ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into\nhis bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in\nthe mirror, sucks in his gut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>INT. KITCHEN\n</b>\nWell stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the\nfridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS\nand TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively\nconversation.\nOne of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's\nYounger Sister, ZOE.\nERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.\nIt's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not\nbecause she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and\nright. Erica is the \"girl most likely\" who went beyond\nexpectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of\nherself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she\njust is.\nHer sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She\nwears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, \"BOYS LIE\".\nThe Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR\nIS WIDE OPEN.
