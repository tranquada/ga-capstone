The CAMERA MOVES UP to a HEAD \n               CLOSEUP of one of them. It is Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas), a \n               well-dressed, intelligent, attractive looking young man.\n\n                                     BILL\n                         I suppose you're wondering what all \n                         this has to do with Mr. Blandings \n                         and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell \n                         you. Jim Blandings is part of the \n                         fabric of this town. Born and raised \n                         right here, he's as typical a New \n                         Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet. \n                         At least he was.\n                              (confidentially)\n                         And if you want to know the real \n                         story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's \n                         my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer \n                         and quote, best friend, unquote. \n                         Jim's one of those bright young men \n                         from Yale. Advertising business, \n                         lovely wife, two fine kids, makes \n                         almost fifteen thousand a year. Want \n                         to know why? Just look up there.\n\n               A BILLBOARD\n\n               A billboard -- against a white background is a large ham. In \n               large letters across the ham is printed:\n\n                                          WHAM!\n                                    (A WHALE OF A HAM)\n\n               And below this in quotes:\n\n                         \"WHEN YOU'VE GOT THE WHIM, SAY 'WHAM!'\"\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         \"When you've got the whim, say \n                         'Wham!'\"... Jim Blandings wrote that \n                         slogan. Seven magic words that shine \n                         like a beacon light for the American \n                         housewife!\n                              (impressive; almost \n                              reverently)\n                         \"When you've got the whim, say \n                         'Wham!'\" Jim Blandings' contribution \n                         to the American Scene.\n\n               EXT. A LARGE NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               As CAMERA MOVES UP it and TOWARD a window:\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         For fourteen years Jim and Muriel \n                         had been living in their apartment \n                         over on East Seventy-fourth Street. \n                         It was just another of those wonderful \n                         crisp September mornings and the \n                         Blandings were still asleep. Just \n                         like millions of other people in \n                         good old Manhattan -- New York City -- \n                         U.S.A.\n\n               The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:\n\n               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep \n               in twin beds.\n\n               The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression \n               of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, \n               oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge \n               take up an inordinate amount of space.\n\n               SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself \n               into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for \n               the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing \n               his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous \n               path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails \n               going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously \n               pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping \n               over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the \n               chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the \n               alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get \n               the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking \n               morning of his life.\n\n               Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes \n               with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them, \n               however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward \n               the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is \n               sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and \n               shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and \n               starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears.\n\n               We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of \n               the Blandings' daily routine.\n\n               Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, \n               can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens \n               the door.\n\n               INT. THE CLOSET\n\n               This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended \n               to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel \n               Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms, \n               it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns, \n               slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit \n               or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf \n               above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an \n               orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance.\n\n               Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one \n               out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small \n               for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put \n               it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between \n               two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down \n               and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled \n               under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it, \n               leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at \n               Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom \n               and into the narrow hall.\n\n               INT. THE HALL\n\n               A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off \n               it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room \n               and the foyer.\n\n               Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom \n               door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.\n\n                                     BETSY'S VOICE\n                         Okay, dad.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Mm.\n\n               Jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the \n               children's room, knocks. No sound. He opens the door and \n               enters.\n\n               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM\n\n               A small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements \n               of adolescence. Joan, an eleven-year-old is asleep in one of \n               the twin beds. Jim automatically pulls the covers clear off \n               Joan's bed. She awakens, cocks an eye at him.\n\n                                     JOAN\n                         Okay, dad.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Mm.\n\n               As she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, Jim exits \n               into the hall.\n\n               INT. THE HALL\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room, \n               on through the very small combination dining and breakfast \n               nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. Gussie, the \n               colored cook, greets him heartily.\n\n                                     GUSSIE\n                         'Morning, Mr. Blandings!\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (a feeble attempt at \n                              a smile)\n                         Mm.\n\n               Gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon, \n               stirs and hands it to Jim who gulps it down, makes a slight \n               face and pats his stomach. Gussie hands Jim a cup of black \n               coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.\n\n               INT. THE HALL\n\n               Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the \n               door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he \n               pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe, \n               towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She \n               disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down \n               the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to \n               the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the \n               way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and \n               shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud. \n               Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.\n\n               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM\n\n               Muriel is still asleep as Jim enters, walks over, nudges \n               her.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Muriel.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Mm?\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Coffee.\n\n               Muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, \n               takes the cup.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Thank you, dear.\n\n               They kiss briefly. Muriel starts to sip the coffee as Jim \n               goes to his chest of drawers. It consists of several rows of \n               small drawers above and large drawers below. Jim ruffles \n               through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of \n               underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look \n               through the other drawers.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Looking for something, dear?\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (briefly)\n                         My socks.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Why don't you look in your sock \n                         drawer?\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (with restraint)\n                         That's where I found my underwear.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Oh.\n                              (brightly)\n                         Well, try your underwear drawer.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         I'm in my underwear drawer.\n\n               He reaches in and holds up one of Muriel's silk slips.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                              (sipping coffee)\n                         Well, they must be somewhere.\n                              (attempt at morning \n                              cheeriness)\n                         Socks just don't get up and walk \n                         away by themselves.\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (strained patience)\n                         Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a-\n                         half drawers were to be mine!

As he does so, \n               all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket \n               from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to \n               explode, he looks at Muriel.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort \n                         to be a little less clumsy.\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (barely containing \n                              himself)\n                         I'll try, dear.\n\n               Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts \n               the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where \n               they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes \n               the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks \n               and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is \n               a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a \n               look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his \n               mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, \n               takes another sip of coffee.\n\n               INT. THE HALL\n\n               Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He \n               quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment \n               later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe \n               around her.\n\n                                     JOAN\n                              (sharply)\n                         Father, just one morning I wish you'd \n                         knock!\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (to her back as she \n                              walks away)\n                         'Morning, dear.\n\n               Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.\n\n               INT. THE BATHROOM\n\n               Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, \n               yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. \n               He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, \n               scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines \n               the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. \n               Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about \n               to use, frowns.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE\n\n               WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in \n               the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls \n               up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small \n               amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously \n               to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free \n               hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he \n               opens.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with \n               medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - JIM\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top \n               shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate \n               one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the \n               iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops \n               out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle \n               of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it \n               back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, \n               contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He \n               finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and \n               steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, \n               scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full \n               cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries \n               the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet \n               hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray \n               Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He \n               starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of \"Home \n               On The Range.\"\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               JIM\n\n               Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. \n               Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is \n               singing a lusty chorus of \"Home On The Range.\" Jim picks up \n               his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, \n               as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary \n               resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. \n               As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he \n               gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs \n               freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that \n               the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation \n               toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach \n               for a towel, start to dry herself.\n\n               The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During \n               this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes \n               into scene.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                              (reaching for \n                              toothbrush)\n                         Excuse...\n\n               She takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get \n               the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to \n               squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he \n               continues shaving.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet \n               and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to \n               her brush.\n\n               JIM AND MURIEL\n\n               Jim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel \n               closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his \n               original position as he follows the mirror.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Excuse...\n\n               Muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They \n               both hum \"Home On The Range\". Her mouth full, Muriel taps \n               Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves \n               to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her \n               face in the mirror.\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (impatiently)\n                         If you don't mind, dear.\n\n               As he steps back in front of the mirror, Muriel continues to \n               look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. She decides \n               she needs a little skin lotion.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                              (as she steps in front \n                              of him)\n                         Sorry.\n\n               She again opens the cabinet. Jim once more follows the mirror \n               around, nicks his face, gives up, stands glaring arms folded. \n               Muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Moment, dear.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Take your time.

Hurry \n                         up, dear, you'll be late for \n                         breakfast.\n\n               Muriel exits. Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a \n               few deft strokes finishes shaving. As he reaches for the \n               water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed \n               in the middle. Reacting with annoyance, he meticulously \n               smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. He opens \n               the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. \n               The iodine bottle pops out. He grimly catches it, studies \n               his problem, has a solution. With his right hand he starts \n               slowly to close the mirror door. Just before it closes, he \n               slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly \n               slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle.

If the roof seems to sway a \n               little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the \n               overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady, \n               charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy \n               years come next April. However, the overall effect is \n               definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty.

Jim, limping, is \n               aided and abetted by a cane. Apollonio is a stolid, New York \n               construction man, replete with derby, blue serge suit, and \n               cigar. A short rule sticks out of a back pocket. As they \n               emerge, the Blandings are hopefully enthusiastic; Apollonio \n               is thoughtfully noncommittal.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         It has charm, hasn't it, Mr. \n                         Apollonio?\n\n                                     APOLLONIO\n                              (through his cigar)\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Of course, any small changes would \n                         have to conform with the character \n                         of the countryside.\n\n                                     APOLLONIO\n                              (through his cigar)\n                         Mm-hmm.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         And yet still be functional.\n\n               Apollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house, \n               kicks an exposed beam. It crumbles, apparently rotted by \n               termites. Two shingles fall off.

He takes the cigar from his mouth.\n\n                                     APOLLONIO\n                         Tear it down.\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (appalled)\n                         Tear it down??!\n\n                                     APOLLONIO\n                         If your chimney was shot and your \n                         sills was okay, I'd say go ahead, \n                         fix her up.

The room is in quiet, good taste, a \n               flagstone fireplace, modern steel casement windows, window \n               seats, etc. The walls are crammed with books and photographs \n               of Simms' handiwork. There are a couple of gold medal \n               citations of his work conspicuously spaced around the room.\n\n               Simms is a tweedy, pipe-smoking, conservative New Englander, \n               a distinguished-looking local architect. He puffs thoughtfully \n               on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old Hackett \n               place, an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the \n               window frame.\n\n                                     SIMMS\n                         Of course you could fix up that old \n                         house.

A steam shovel in \n               action, a bulldozer, the sawing of wood, and intermittently \n               the loud, earth-shaking crash of a well-digger's rig.\n\n               As the CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see the machines and workmen at \n               their various tasks.

ROAD AND COVERED BRIDGE - DAY\n\n               Two moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is \n               the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the \n               children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause, \n               over this, we hear:\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         So-came thirty days -- and they moved.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BRIDGE.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - Entrance to bridge. As the cavalcade passes \n               through we see in the rear of the trailer, jammed among the \n               household effects, Gussie and a very uncomfortable Mr. Bill \n               Cole.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         I mean -- we moved.\n\n               OTHER END OF BRIDGE AND FORK\n\n               The moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn. \n               Jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he \n               impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite \n               direction. Over this:\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                              (as Jim would say it)\n                         That's the wrong road! Any fool knows \n                         that!\n\n               Jim starts his car up leading the way.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               EXT. ROAD AT THE HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway. Jim stops \n               his car and they all look off at the house, react with \n               pleasant surprise.\n\n               WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE IS RAPIDLY NEARING \n               COMPLETION.\n\n               WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - The house is rapidly nearing \n               completion. A half dozen men are finishing the exterior \n               painting, planing down doors, etc. In front, a couple of men \n               from the nursery are working on the landscaping. For the \n               first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as \n               a clean, bright and very attractive new house.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Well, there she is, bright and shining -- \n                         and just about complete -- the \n                         residence of Mr. and Mrs. James H. \n                         Blandings.\n\n               INT. THE CAR - DAY\n\n               MOVING SHOT - Jim and Muriel are visibly affected by the \n               sight of their Dream House. They exchange a warm intimate \n               smile.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Not bad at that.\n\n               EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE - DAY\n\n               MED. SHOT.

As Jim and Muriel walk toward \n               the house away from us and Bill, Muriel sentimentally reaches \n               out, takes Jim's hand.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Guess you can't blame them for feeling \n                         just a little bit proud.\n\n               At the door, Jim stops, indicates that he'd like to carry \n               Muriel across the threshold.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                              (sentimentally)\n                         Look -- he wants to carry his wife \n                         across the threshold.

I guess I meant \"corny.\"\n\n               GROUP SHOT. OVER MURIEL'S PLAYFUL PROTEST\n\n               GROUP SHOT. Over Muriel's playful protest, Jim starts to \n               pick her up.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Uh-uh. Watch that sacroiliac. Fifteen \n                         years since you've done this sort of \n                         thing.\n\n               Jim manages to lift Muriel.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Whew! Nice work, Tarzan. Now, let's \n                         see if you can make it into the hall.\n\n               Jim carries Muriel over the threshold and into the foyer.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         That's right. Go right in. Don't pay \n                         any attention to the sign.\n\n               The CAMERA PANS TO a LOW SHOT of a sign on the floor of the \n               foyer. It reads:\n\n                                       WET VARNISH\n\n               FULL SHOT - FOYER.\n\n               FULL SHOT - foyer. In the b.g. is a painter, varnishing the \n               floor. He looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly \n               varnished floor being violated. After a couple of steps, Jim \n               stops, suddenly aware of the painter. The painter rises, \n               throws down his brush, says something caustic.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                              (imitating painter)\n                         Don't mind me, buddy, I just got \n                         through varnishing that floor.\n\n               Jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish \n               practically holding it to the floor. Jim says something.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Whose bright idea was this?\n\n               The painter says something, points at Muriel. Jim looks darkly \n               and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of \n               guilt.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         She just wanted everything to be \n                         nice and shiny on the day they moved \n                         in.\n\n               Jim turns and shouts something to the painter.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Stop painting that floor and put \n                         some planks down in here, or some \n                         thing!\n\n               The painter shouts back.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Okay, mister, but take it easy. The \n                         Republicans ain't in yet, you know.\n\n               Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately \n               trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps. \n               Each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.\n\n               EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE - DAY\n\n               As Jim appears, still carrying Muriel, Betsy and Joan catch \n               his attention, indicate the front wall of the house which is \n               complete except for the windows. Jim reacts.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Oh, fine! A house without windows! \n                         We'll just see about that!\n\n               Abruptly handing Muriel to Bill he starts off. Ahead of him \n               and unnoticed are a layer of newspapers which have been spread \n               out.\n\n                                     BILL'S VOICE\n                         Look out for those papers!\n\n               But Jim has stepped on the papers. They stick to his feet. \n               After a few steps he is aware of it, tries to get rid of \n               them. After a few hectic but futile attempts, he disgustedly \n               disappears around a corner of the house, the newspapers \n               flapping behind him.\n\n               EXT.

REAR OF HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Simms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against \n               the wall.

Jim, a sober look on his face, rises, takes \n               a steaming kettle from the stove.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Where are you going?\n\n                                     JIM\n                         To shave.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Tonight??\n\n                                     JIM\n                         While I can still trust myself with \n                         a razor. At six o'clock in the morning \n                         I'd probably cut my throat. Goodnight.\n\n               Jim abruptly exits.

THE BLANDINGS' BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Jim, in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving.

As Muriel puts the paste on her brush, \n               replaces the tube, shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her \n               teeth, Jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Excuse...\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Muriel, do you have to do that now?!\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         There's no need to be so irritable \n                         just because you have to shave at \n                         night.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         I'm not irritable!\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Well, you're certainly something! \n                         You haven't said a civil word all \n                         evening.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Sometimes a man doesn't feel like \n                         talking.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                              (solicitously)\n                         What is it, dear?

It looks like an all \n                         night session.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (concerned)\n                         What did he say?\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (wearily, seating \n                              himself at desk)\n                         Tomorrow morning.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (sighs)\n                         Well, I guess you'll just have to \n                         dream something up -- good or bad.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         I rather got the impression it had \n                         better be good.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (raised eyebrow)\n                         Oh.\n\n               He picks up a pencil, nibbles on it thoughtfully. The silence \n               in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the \n               window. It strikes a note in Jim's subconscious. He swivels \n               around in his chair and stares soberly out the window.\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (ruminatively, almost \n                              to himself)\n                         Funny how you look forward to the \n                         little things. Rain, for instance.\n\n               Mary looks at him curiously. He turns to her.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         For a month now, I guess I've been \n                         looking forward to the first rainy \n                         night at the house.\n                              (looks at Muriel's \n                              picture)\n                         Big blazing fire. Muriel knitting. \n                         Me in my new smoking jacket... with \n                         my pipe and slippers, reading my \n                         paper...\n                              (sighs)\n                         Oh, well.\n\n               As he starts to work.\n\n                                                                   DISSOLVE\n\n               INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Note: The house is painted and almost completely furnished.\n\n               A hard rain beats on the windows. There is a blazing fire in \n               the fireplace. Muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, \n               comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one \n               Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, \n               pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole. \n               Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes \n               are hanging up to dry. The cozy tranquillity is broken by a \n               sharp RINGING of the front doorbell.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                              (with relief)\n                         Thank heavens! The children.\n\n                                     BILL\n                              (rising)\n                         Stay put. You look too comfortable.\n\n               The CAMERA FOLLOWS Bill to the front door. He opens it. A \n               man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving \n               rain. The man enters as Bill struggles to get the door shut \n               against the wind.\n\n                                     MR. JONES\n                         Whew! What a night! I'm Jones, from \n                         down the road.

Cole's \n                         the name, Bill Cole.\n\n               He sees Jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an \n               explanation is necessary.\n\n                                     BILL\n                         Friend of the family. Wet clothes. \n                         Just came in out of the rain.\n\n               Muriel walks into scene. Jones takes in the bathrobe, again \n               looks skeptically at Bill.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         I'm Mrs. Blandings.\n\n                                     JONES\n                         How do. Mrs. Williams just called. \n                         Says your phone's out of order.

Girls'll spend the night over \n                         at her place.\n\n                                     MURIEL\n                         Thank you. I was beginning to get \n                         concerned.

JIM'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING\n\n               The CAMERA COMES IN ON a package of cigarettes. A finger \n               impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses \n               that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, \n               disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt \n               from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty \n               he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently \n               stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the \n               window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods \n               the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully \n               out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his \n               fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting \n               on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (selling; a note of \n                              desperation in his \n                              voice)\n                         \"Compare the price, compare the slice, \n                         Take our advice -- Buy Wham!\"\n\n               Mary critically shakes her head \"no\", closes her eye. Jim \n               wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with \n               his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose, \n               throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he \n               reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         \"If you'd buy better ham. You'd better \n                         buy Wham!\"\n\n                                     MARY\n                         It's Boyle Petroleum. \"If you'd buy \n                         better oil, You'd better buy Boyle.\"\n\n               Her eye closes. Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping \n               over the edge of the couch. It encounters a crumpled piece \n               of paper, earlier work. He smoothes the paper, scans it, \n               kind of likes it. He gets up, comes over, snaps fingers. \n               Mary looks up.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         \"This little pig went to market As \n                         meek and as mild as a lamb.

I don't know.\n\n               Mary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what \n               to say. As the CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the emotionally \n               distraught Jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his \n               desk of Muriel and the children. He picks it up, looks at it \n               with affection. Suddenly he gets an idea. Rising with \n               determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (startled)\n                         Where are you going?\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Home, to get some sleep -- and I'd \n                         advise you to do the same.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         But -- but you haven't --\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Suppose I haven't!

THE BLANDINGS' HOME - DAY\n\n               It is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. A rural-\n               looking taxi deposits a weary Jim, who pays the driver. As \n               the cab drives off, Jim looks speculatively at Simms' car, \n               which is parked there, yawns, stretches, opens the door and \n               enters.
