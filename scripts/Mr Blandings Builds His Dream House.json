Well, I'll tell \n                         you. Jim Blandings is part of the \n                         fabric of this town. Born and raised \n                         right here, he's as typical a New \n                         Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet. \n                         At least he was.\n                              (confidentially)\n                         And if you want to know the real \n                         story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's \n                         my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer \n                         and quote, best friend, unquote. \n                         Jim's one of those bright young men \n                         from Yale. Advertising business, \n                         lovely wife, two fine kids, makes \n                         almost fifteen thousand a year. Want \n                         to know why?

Just \n                         like millions of other people in \n                         good old Manhattan -- New York City -- \n<b>                         U.S.A.\n</b>\n               The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:\n\n<b>               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\n               Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep \n               in twin beds.\n\n               The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression \n               of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, \n               oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge \n               take up an inordinate amount of space.\n\n               SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself \n               into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for \n               the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing \n               his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous \n               path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails \n               going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously \n               pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping \n               over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the \n               chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the \n               alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get \n               the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking \n               morning of his life.\n\n               Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes \n               with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them, \n               however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward \n               the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is \n               sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and \n               shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and \n               starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears.\n\n               We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of \n               the Blandings' daily routine.\n\n               Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, \n               can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens \n               the door.\n\n<b>               INT. THE CLOSET\n</b>\n               This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended \n               to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel \n               Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms, \n               it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns, \n               slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit \n               or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf \n               above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an \n               orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance.\n\n               Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one \n               out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small \n               for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put \n               it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between \n               two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down \n               and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled \n               under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it, \n               leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at \n               Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom \n               and into the narrow hall.\n\n<b>               INT. THE HALL\n</b>\n               A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off \n               it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room \n               and the foyer.\n\n               Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom \n               door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.\n\n<b>                                     BETSY'S VOICE\n</b>                         Okay, dad.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                         Mm.\n\n               Jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the \n               children's room, knocks. No sound. He opens the door and \n               enters.\n\n<b>               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n               A small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements \n               of adolescence. Joan, an eleven-year-old is asleep in one of \n               the twin beds. Jim automatically pulls the covers clear off \n               Joan's bed. She awakens, cocks an eye at him.\n\n<b>                                     JOAN\n</b>                         Okay, dad.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                         Mm.\n\n               As she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, Jim exits \n               into the hall.\n\n<b>               INT. THE HALL\n</b>\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room, \n               on through the very small combination dining and breakfast \n               nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. Gussie, the \n               colored cook, greets him heartily.\n\n<b>                                     GUSSIE\n</b>                         'Morning, Mr. Blandings!\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (a feeble attempt at \n                              a smile)\n                         Mm.\n\n               Gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon, \n               stirs and hands it to Jim who gulps it down, makes a slight \n               face and pats his stomach. Gussie hands Jim a cup of black \n               coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.\n\n<b>               INT. THE HALL\n</b>\n               Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the \n               door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he \n               pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe, \n               towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She \n               disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down \n               the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to \n               the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the \n               way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and \n               shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud. \n               Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.\n\n<b>               INT.

Muriel starts to sip the coffee as Jim \n               goes to his chest of drawers. It consists of several rows of \n               small drawers above and large drawers below. Jim ruffles \n               through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of \n               underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look \n               through the other drawers.\n\n<b>                                     MURIEL\n</b>                         Looking for something, dear?\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (briefly)\n                         My socks.\n\n<b>                                     MURIEL\n</b>                         Why don't you look in your sock \n                         drawer?\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (with restraint)\n                         That's where I found my underwear.\n\n<b>                                     MURIEL\n</b>                         Oh.\n                              (brightly)\n                         Well, try your underwear drawer.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                         I'm in my underwear drawer.\n\n               He reaches in and holds up one of Muriel's silk slips.\n\n<b>                                     MURIEL\n</b>                              (sipping coffee)\n                         Well, they must be somewhere.\n                              (attempt at morning \n                              cheeriness)\n                         Socks just don't get up and walk \n                         away by themselves.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (strained patience)\n                         Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a-\n                         half drawers were to be mine!

As he does so, \n               all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket \n               from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to \n               explode, he looks at Muriel.\n\n<b>                                     MURIEL\n</b>                         Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort \n                         to be a little less clumsy.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (barely containing \n                              himself)\n                         I'll try, dear.\n\n               Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts \n               the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where \n               they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes \n               the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks \n               and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is \n               a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a \n               look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his \n               mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, \n               takes another sip of coffee.\n\n<b>               INT. THE HALL\n</b>\n               Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He \n               quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment \n               later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe \n               around her.\n\n<b>                                     JOAN\n</b>                              (sharply)\n                         Father, just one morning I wish you'd \n                         knock!\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (to her back as she \n                              walks away)\n                         'Morning, dear.\n\n               Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.\n\n<b>               INT. THE BATHROOM\n</b>\n               Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, \n               yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. \n               He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, \n               scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines \n               the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. \n               Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about \n               to use, frowns.\n\n<b>               WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE\n</b>\n               WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in \n               the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE\n</b>\n               CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls \n               up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small \n               amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously \n               to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free \n               hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he \n               opens.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET\n</b>\n               CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with \n               medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - JIM\n</b>\n               CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top \n               shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate \n               one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the \n               iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops \n               out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle \n               of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it \n               back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, \n               contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He \n               finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and \n               steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, \n               scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full \n               cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries \n               the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet \n               hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray \n               Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He \n               starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of \"Home \n               On The Range.\"\n\n<b>                                                                   DISSOLVE\n</b>\n<b>               JIM\n</b>\n               Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. \n               Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is \n               singing a lusty chorus of \"Home On The Range.\" Jim picks up \n               his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, \n               as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary \n               resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. \n               As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he \n               gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs \n               freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that \n               the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation \n               toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach \n               for a towel, start to dry herself.\n\n               The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During \n               this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes \n               into scene.\n\n<b>                                     MURIEL\n</b>                              (reaching for \n                              toothbrush)\n                         Excuse...\n\n               She takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get \n               the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to \n               squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he \n               continues shaving.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL\n</b>\n               CLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet \n               and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to \n               her brush.\n\n<b>               JIM AND MURIEL\n</b>\n               Jim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel \n               closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his \n               original position as he follows the mirror.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                         Excuse...\n\n               Muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They \n               both hum \"Home On The Range\". Her mouth full, Muriel taps \n               Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves \n               to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her \n               face in the mirror.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (impatiently)\n                         If you don't mind, dear.\n\n               As he steps back in front of the mirror, Muriel continues to \n               look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. She decides \n               she needs a little skin lotion.\n\n<b>                                     MURIEL\n</b>                              (as she steps in front \n                              of him)\n                         Sorry.\n\n               She again opens the cabinet.

Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a \n               few deft strokes finishes shaving. As he reaches for the \n               water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed \n               in the middle. Reacting with annoyance, he meticulously \n               smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. He opens \n               the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. \n               The iodine bottle pops out.

The silence \n               in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the \n               window. It strikes a note in Jim's subconscious.

There is a blazing fire in \n               the fireplace. Muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, \n               comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one \n               Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, \n               pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole. \n               Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes \n               are hanging up to dry.

A \n               man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving \n               rain.

A finger \n               impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses \n               that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, \n               disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt \n               from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty \n               he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently \n               stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the \n               window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods \n               the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully \n               out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his \n               fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting \n               on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                              (selling; a note of \n                              desperation in his \n                              voice)\n                         \"Compare the price, compare the slice, \n                         Take our advice -- Buy Wham!\"\n\n               Mary critically shakes her head \"no\", closes her eye. Jim \n               wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with \n               his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose, \n               throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he \n               reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                         \"If you'd buy better ham.

He smoothes the paper, scans it, \n               kind of likes it.
