GLASS-ENCLOSED AREA - DAY\n\n               It's the Cleveland Indians' conference room. Three men are \n               seated around the table; CHARLIE DONOVAN. the manager, PHIL \n               BUTLER, public relations head, JERRY SIMMONS, operations \n               director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel \n               Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for \n               somebody.\n\n                                     DONOVAN\n                              (checking his watch)\n                         Thirty minutes late. Think she'll \n                         show?\n\n                                     MATTHEWS\n                         She's got to.

She was having \n                         a guava facial.\n\n               As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the \n               conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY-\n               BODYGUARD enters, clearing the way for MRS. RACHEL PHELPS, a \n               flashy, striking woman in her early forties. Despite the \n               designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something \n               less refined about her. She carries a Pekinese dog, CHA-CHA \n               on her left hip.\n\n                                     RACHEL\n                         Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to \n                         another season of Indians' baseball.\n\n               The men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. The \n               Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the \n               table and Rachel sits.\n\n                                     RACHEL\n                         I know that it may not seem the same \n                         without Donald here this year, but I \n                         promise you by the end of the season \n                         this team will have made history.\n\n               Several eyes roll up around the room.\n\n                                     RACHEL\n                              (picking up a newspaper)\n                         Unfortunately there are some in the \n                         press who feel that...\n                              (reading from the \n                              page)\n                         \"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps \n                         has no business being the owner of a \n                         major league baseball team.\"\n\n               Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away.\n\n                                     RACHEL\n                         Obviously, Donald didn't feel that \n                         way or he wouldn't have left the \n                         team to me.

DONOVAN'S NEW OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Donovan, carrying a boxful of belongings under each arm, \n               pushes open the door of his new office and walks inside. The \n               basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full \n               of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk \n               accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed. Suddenly, \n               there's a voice at the door.\n\n                                     BODY-BUILDER ASSISTANT\n                         Mr. Donovan, Mrs. Phelps would like \n                         to see you.\n\n               OMIT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               INT.

The weather's lousy, \n                         downtown is a pit, the stadium's \n                         falling apart, and we can't draw \n                         dick.

We go \n               to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and \n               blasts on by to win by five. This kid is fast. Brown and \n               Pepper give each other the \"Who was that Masked Man\" look.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         Get him a uniform.\n\n               EXT.

He glances over in \n               disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano, who are doing them like \n               pistons in competition with each other. Cerrano even starts \n               doing them one-handed.\n\n               Hayes isn't doing them at all; merely pulling his head up \n               and down while leaving his body on the ground.\n\n                                     HARRIS\n                         C'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right.\n\n                                     HAYES\n                         Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no \n                         pain.\n\n               EXT.

BATTING CAGE - DAY\n\n               Brown is watching batting practice.\n\n               Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual \n               worthy of Babe Ruth -- rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, \n               knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. A real \n               slugger's routine.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All \n                         Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.\n\n               Hayes gets in and takes his stance. On the first pitch, he \n               takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher's mound. \n               We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches. Hayes takes \n               prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop-\n               ups, none out of the infield. Brown calls a halt.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         Well, you may run like Mays, but you \n                         hit like shit.\n\n                                     HAYES\n                         My stroke'll come back once I get \n                         warmed up.\n\n                                     TEMPLE\n                              (referring to some \n                              stats)\n                         Never did get warmed up last year. \n                         Hit .211 at Maine.

Let's see what you got.\n\n               Brown and Pepper stand behind Taylor for a better view. Vaughn \n               goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that \n               Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch. The \n               ball rockets an inch over Brown's head, and slams into the \n               backstop.\n\n               Brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with \n               eternity, then turns to Pepper.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         Nice velocity.\n\n                                     PEPPER\n                         Sounded like it.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Sorry, Lou, I wasn't quite expectin' \n                         that much octane.\n\n               Brown turns to the Clubhouse Man who's holding a speed gun.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         How much?\n\n                                     CLUBHOUSE MAN\n                         96 miles an hour.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                              (to Pepper)\n                         Better teach him some control before \n                         he kills somebody.\n\n               RODGER DORN\n\n               fielding grounders at third base.

I need to load up \n                         the ball a little, I just wipe my \n                         nose.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                              (revolted)\n                         You put snot on the ball?\n\n                                     HARRIS\n                         At my age, you put anything you can \n                         find on it. I haven't got an arm \n                         like yours.\n\n               Vaughn just looks at him incredulous.\n\n               TAYLOR AND CARRANO\n\n               Taylor is undressing, but his attention is diverted by Cerrano \n               whose stall is right next to him. Cerrano has set up an altar \n               in his locker. In front of his bats, which are lined up like \n               sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball \n               players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in \n               the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth.\n\n               Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats. He finishes \n               an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         What are you doin' there, Pedro?\n\n                                     CERRANO\n                         Bats. They are sick.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         So are mine. Is somethin' goin' \n                         around?\n\n                                     CERRANO\n                         No hit curve ball. Straight ball, \n                         hit it very much. Curve ball, bats \n                         are afraid. I ask Jo-Buu to come. \n                         Take fear from bats.\n\n                                     HAYES\n                         Jo-Buu?\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Maybe he's the pagan saint of \n                         baseball.\n\n                                     CERRANO\n                         I offer him cigars and gin. He will \n                         come.\n\n               Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to \n               the fetish doll. Harris has been listening to all this. \n               Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers.\n\n                                     HARRIS\n                         I wouldn't leave this gin sittin' \n                         around out here with this group.\n\n                                     CERRANO\n                              (with a certain gravity)\n                         Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin. \n                         Is very bad.\n\n               Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving \n               everyone to wonder just how bad.\n\n               OMIT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               MONTAGE SEQUENCE\n\n               compressing and detailing the progress of spring training. \n               We see:\n\n               A) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound. A tin replica of a batter \n               has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the \n               plate to delineate the strike zone. Vaughn fires a pitch and \n               hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him.\n\n               B) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at \n               several curve balls.\n\n               C) HAYES\n\n               doing push-ups at night. He's the only one left on the field, \n               except Temple, who supervises.\n\n               D) TAYLOR\n\n               doing the \"scramble\" drill -- blocking down balls purposely \n               thrown in the dirt, one after another. When it ends, he can \n               hardly get to his feet.\n\n               E) CERRANO\n\n               waving a ten-foot BOA CONSTRICTOR in the sign of the cross \n               in front of his locker before opening it. No red tag greets \n               him. Hayes watches from a safe distance.\n\n               F) VAUGHN\n\n               holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a \n               peek inside to see if there's a red tag there.\n\n               G) DORN\n\n               taking a hard ground ball off the chest. Brown applauds. \n               Dorn is pissed.\n\n               H) VAUGHN\n\n               throwing at the \"ropes\" again. The tin batter is dented in \n               every conceivable place now. Vaughn whips in another fast \n               ball. This one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it \n               completely off.\n\n               I) TAYLOR\n\n               in an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. \n               Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- \n               on a bounce. The ball skips into center field.\n\n               J) HAYES\n\n               also in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping \n               it up behind the plate. He just drops in his tracks and starts \n               to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him.\n\n               K) CERRANO\n\n               flailing away again at a curve ball. This and the remaining \n               shots are all in exhibition games.\n\n               L) HAYES\n\n               waving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker. Even \n               at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but \n               it works its magic. No red tag.\n\n               M) VAUGHN\n\n               with a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four \n               feet over Taylor's head. The run scores.\n\n               N) HAYES\n\n               attempting to steal second. He goes into a hell-bent-for-\n               leather head first slide. Unfortunately, he comes up two \n               feet short of the base. The second baseman, who's waiting \n               for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. \n               Hayes flips him the bird.\n\n               O) LOU BROWN\n\n               on the bench. He turns to Pepper with a look that says, \"Can \n               you believe this shit?\"\n\n               P) TAYLOR\n\n               waiting for a throw at the plate. Just as he's about to catch \n               it, the runner knocks him flat.\n\n               Q) BROWN\n\n               his head in his hands. As Taylor gets up and goes to the \n               wrong dugout, the MONTAGE ENDS.\n\n               EXT. INDIANS' PRACTICE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Players are filing off the team bus after the game. We PICK \n               UP Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn as they head toward the locker \n               room.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         This is final cut down day, right?\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Yeh, better get your snake ready, \n                         Hayes.\n\n                                     HAYES\n                         No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My \n                         hands are too screwed up to hold it \n                         anyway.\n\n               Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         If you're gonna use that head first \n                         slide, you better get yourself some \n                         gloves or you're not gonna have any \n                         skin left on your hands.\n\n               They've reached the locker room now.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         I don't wanna go in there.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Whatever happens, keep it to yourself \n                         until you're outta the locker room. \n                         Don't celebrate in front of guys who \n                         just died.\n\n                                     HAYES\n                         What if we're one of the deceased?\n\n               Taylor goes into the locker room. Hayes and Vaughn hang back.\n\n               Cerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this \n               time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch \n               of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a \n               symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white \n               paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk.\n\n               Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers \n               inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor \n               shakes it and breaks a weary smile.\n\n               GENTRY\n\n               opens locker, slumps on stool. He's a goner.\n\n               HAYES AND VAUGHN\n\n               the two rookies, are still hanging back.\n\n                                     HAYES\n                         C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts \n                         here. If they cut us, we'll just \n                         sign with the Yankees.\n\n               Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This \n               doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes \n               closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one \n               eye.\n\n               Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the \n               locker room, as if he had to get to the john.\n\n               He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around \n               like a wild man.\n\n               VAUGHN\n\n               drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker \n               and whips it open. There hanging from the top hook is the \n               \"red death.\" Vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly \n               closes his locker.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. BROWN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Vaughn goes right in without knocking and leans on Brown's \n               desk.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You \n                         haven't heard the last of me. You \n                         think I'm shit now, but someday you'll \n                         be sorry you cut me. I'm gonna catch \n                         on somewhere else, and every time I \n                         pitch against you, I'm gonna stick \n                         it up your ass.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         Good, I like that kinda spirit in a \n                         player. The only problem is, I didn't \n                         cut you.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         What do you mean?\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         I think somebody's been havin' fun \n                         with you.\n\n               We GO TO Vaughn, his faced a mask of anger and embarrassment.\n\n               THE LOCKER ROOM AGAIN\n\n               Vaughn charges across the room and jumps Dorn. The men grapple \n               and fight all over the room, until Taylor finally gets them \n               separated.\n\n                                     DORN\n                              (to Vaughn)\n                         What's the matter, little lady? Can't \n                         you take a joke?\n\n               Vaughn gives Dorn a look that indicates this isn't over. Lou \n               Brown enters the room.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         Can I have your attention, please? I \n                         counted up your ballots for team \n                         captain and I think you chose the \n                         right guy.

Mr. C for \n                         the year -- Jake Taylor.\n\n               The team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor's name \n               is announced. Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about \n               it. As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates, \n               he turns to Vaughn.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Forget about Dorn.

Breaking into his home \n               run trot, he circles the bases, slapping the third base \n               coach's hand and exchanging low fives with his teamates as \n               he reaches the plate.\n\n               Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause. \n               He turns and looks in the dugout, where Hayes and Vaughn are \n               giving him a hand.\n\n                                     HAYES\n                         Really got all of that one.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         What was it?

We see:\n\n               A) THREE FIELDERS converging on a short pop fly into left \n               field. They all collide and go down in a heap as the ball \n               drops untouched.\n\n               B) DORN playing a grounder off his hip. He fumbles it, picks \n               it up, fumbles it again. No play.\n\n               C) TAYLOR crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, \n               ready to throw. We hear the voice of his thoughts.\n\n                                     TAYLOR'S VOICE\n                         Guy's goin'. Gotta be goin'... get \n                         the throw up. Don't bounce the damn \n                         ball.\n\n               The runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in. Taylor \n               catches the ball and fires down to second. The ball sails \n               three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center \n               field. Taylor stands there, disgusted.\n\n                                     TAYLOR'S VOICE\n                         Nice throw, dickhead.\n\n               D) CERRANO striking out on a curve ball. He bawls his bat \n               out on the way to the dugout.\n\n               E) THE THREE FIELDERS we saw before, converging on another \n               pop fly into short left. This time all three dive off at the \n               last instant to avoid a collision. Once again the ball drops \n               untouched.\n\n               END MONTAGE.\n\n               THE SCOREBOARD\n\n               It shows Yankees 4, Indians 0 after five innings.\n\n               DOYLE UP IN THE BOOTH\n\n               There are two empty Coca-Cola cups near the mike.

Doesn't hurt to \n                         put the fear of God in a hitter.\n\n               Vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as Pepper and \n               Taylor leave. The Yankee Hitter steps in.\n\n               Vaughn winds and fires a screamer. Taylor has to leap high \n               to come down with it.\n\n                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n                         First pitch is a little high...\n\n               The Yankee Hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch.\n\n                                     YANKEE HITTER\n                         This guy kinda wild?\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         I figure you got a 30% chance to \n                         survive this at bat.\n\n               ANOTHER PITCH to the Yankee hitter.

The \n               next hitter, COLEMAN, steps in. Vaughn gets up on the rubber, \n               his face set. He winds up and fires one right into Coleman's \n               back.

Vaughn \n               comes down to protest, but Pepper quickly grabs him and \n               hurries him off the field.\n\n                                     PEPPER\n                         C'mon, kid. As soon as Coleman gets \n                         up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.\n\n               Coleman finally gets to his feet, still a little shaken. He \n               looks around for Vaughn, but he's already disappeared into \n               the dugout. Coleman walks down to first under his own power.\n\n               Brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides \n               begin to return to the benches.\n\n               VAUGHN\n\n               walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room.

He scrunches down a bit as Lynn \n               comes out of the building and heads for her car. She gets in \n               and we...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SERIES OF SHOTS OF LYNN\n\n               driving through the city with Taylor following at a discrete \n               distance. Finally, Lynn pulls up outside an expensive-looking \n               townhouse.

Lynn is \n               uncomfortable with this whole situation. Janice moves a bit \n               closer to Taylor.

In one swift motion he slams the knife down on \n               it, cutting it into two perfect halves. Taylor and the others \n               are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this. As the yolk \n               spreads out on the altar, Brown emerges from his office.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         All right, let's hit the field.\n\n               The locker room quickly empties, leaving one man behind -- \n               Harris. He looks around to make sure everyone is gone, then \n               tiptoes over to Cerrano's locker. Screwing up his courage, \n               he picks up Jo-Buu's cup of gin.\n\n                                     HARRIS\n                         Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu.\n\n               He bolts it down, then backs into the middle of the room, \n               waiting at the ready, as if half-expecting a bolt of \n               lightning. When nothing happens, he gloats at the fetish \n               doll in triumph.\n\n               HARRIS\n\n               strutting out of the dugout, feeling like a million bucks. \n               As he emerges onto the field, a Hitter in the batting cage \n               swings and misses, the bat slipping out of his hands. Away \n               it flies, whirling off down the third base line in a wide \n               arc. It hits Harris in the back of the head and knocks him \n               cold.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               HARRIS\n\n               watching the game from the dugout, a zip-lock baggie full of \n               ice-cubes strapped to his head.\n\n                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n                         We're in the ninth, two down, man on \n                         first and the Indians clinging to a \n                         one run lead.

Finally up on the rubber, he gets the sign from Taylor, \n               goes to his stretch, checks the runner and fires to the plate.\n\n               THE OAKLAND BATTER\n\n               swings and hits a grounder between third and short. Dorn \n               moves to his left, but the ball goes past his glove and into \n               left field. There is some question as to whether Dorn really \n               gave it a full effort.\n\n                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n                         Bouncing ball, Dorn can't get to it, \n                         into left field, base hit.

He glares \n               at Dorn a beat before getting back on the mound. Dorn's face \n               is non-commital.

Taylor smiles back, and trots off toward the plate.\n\n               THE BLEACHER BAND\n\n               Bobby and Vic are doing a two-man wave.

Hell of a \n                         dancer. You must be very proud.\n\n               Rexman is trying to ignore Taylor, but failing badly. Taylor \n               flashes a sign to Vaughn. Vaughn goes into his windup.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         But that guy she was with...

Maybe if the \n                         wind comes up.\n\n               Taylor moves out two steps and makes the catch easily, ending \n               the game.\n\n               Taylor rushes out to congratulate Vaughn. The players exchange \n               handshakes and high fives, as Brown watches from the dugout.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         It's startin' to come together, \n                         Pepper.

CLEVELAND ATHLETIC CLUB - NIGHT\n\n               Lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area, \n               deserted this time of night. She wears a racing suit, but \n               lets her hair hang free. The pool glows like a sheet of \n               emerald glass. She shakes down a beat, curls her toes around \n               the coping, slowly bends at the waist, and then launches \n               into a full-out racing dive.\n\n               We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first \n               the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and finally \n               freestyle. We condense the time, of course, SHOOTING some \n               underwater, some SLO-MO, as she knives through the water, \n               her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium. \n               The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her strokes \n               and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, \n               its synthesis of power and form.\n\n               As she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the \n               pool next to her. It's Jake, and he's racing her the final \n               lap. She immediately responds to the challenge, digging \n               harder, picking up her kick. They go neck and neck for 20 \n               yards, but Lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a \n               body length at the wall.

Taylor, of course, thinks he's gone \n               undetected.\n\n               We begin a SHORT SEQUENCE during which Lynn tries to lose \n               Taylor in a chase through Cleveland, car vs. batting helmet.\n\n               The logistics will have to be worked out in Cleveland, but \n               suffice it to say, by the end of the chase she appears to \n               have ditched him.\n\n               EXT.

She feels sure \n               she's shaken Taylor.\n\n               The apartment is full of packing boxes. Tired from the chase, \n               Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch. \n               It's obvious she's not all that happy to have lost Taylor. \n               She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some \n               sign of him.\n\n               Seeing nothing, she turns away from the window disappointed, \n               and starts back to the couch, when something stops her.

THE SHEFFIELD ARMS - DAY\n\n               We pick up Taylor, Hayes and Vaughn coming into their \n               dilapidated hotel room. Peeling walls and ceilings, rickety \n               furniture, rusted bathroom fixtures. Taylor sprawls down on \n               one of the cots.

As Taylor pumps the ball down \n               to second, Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Hey, jailbird!\n\n               Vaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is \n               dressed in a striped prison uniform. He also wears long \n               earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. Vaughn tries \n               to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken.\n\n               Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. He winds \n               and fires. The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to \n               the wall in right center. Hayes runs it down and guns it \n               back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. The convict \n               whoops it up.\n\n               Vaughn gets back up on the rubber. As he comes to the stretch, \n               he catches sight of the convict again. The guy is doing a \n               pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much \n               to the delight of his teammates. Vaughn throws his pitch in \n               the dirt and all the way to the backstop. The runner on second \n               goes to third.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                              (throwing the ball \n                              back)\n                         C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.\n\n               Vaughn gets ready again. The convict finishes picking the \n               lock and then is suddenly arrested. He puts his hands against \n               the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking \n               up the whole bench. Vaughn is getting a little steamed. His \n               next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a \n               run.\n\n               THREE SHOTS OF VAUGHN\n\n               throwing pitches, followed by:\n\n               SHOTS\n\n               of the THIRD HITTER lining a double down the right field \n               line, the FOURTH HITTER a triple off the center field wall, \n               and the FIFTH HITTER a single to right. The scoreboard now \n               reads 4 to 0 Yankees. Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         What's the problem, Rick? You're \n                         throwin' basketballs up there.

Who will start \n                         that game is still a matter of some \n                         conjecture.\n\n               As Ross talks, Dorn walks INTO THE FRAME in the far background \n               with his arm around a YOUNG LOVELY. They're nuzzling and \n               hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background. \n               Suzanne doesn't miss it though. She moves closer to the screen \n               to get a better look.\n\n               Dorn and the Girl get in an elevator together, obviously \n               going upstairs. As the elevator closes, Suzanne hits the off \n               button. She sits there a second in shock, and then her face \n               begins to harden.\n\n               INT.

She puts her leg up on \n               the bed to unhook her stockings. Taylor is about to take off \n               his pants, but stops.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Darla, I don't think I can do this.\n\n                                     DARLA\n                         What do you mean?

She \n               turns to say goodbye to Jake, who is still bare-chested.\n\n                                     DARLA\n                         So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna \n                         devote a whole chapter to you in my \n                         book.\n\n               As Darla gives Jake a goodbye peck, the elevator door opens \n               across the hall, and out steps Lynn. She's obviously rattled \n               by the sight of Taylor and Darla together.\n\n                                     LYNN\n                         Excuse me.

He \n               then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs.\n\n               TAYLOR\n\n               running down the stairs and into the lobby. Seeing no sign \n               of Lynn, he races out the front door to see her pulling out \n               in a taxi. He can only stand and watch her disappear into \n               the night.\n\n               INT.

I just wanted to tell you \n                         that I'm startin' Harris tomorrow \n                         against the Yankees, even though \n                         it's your turn in the rotation.\n\n               Vaughn says nothing, but he's clearly disappointed.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         He's got more experience and a little \n                         better record against the Yankees.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         Yeh, sure. Whatever's best for the \n                         team.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         Don't read anything into it, Rick. \n                         You're one of the guys that got us \n                         here.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         Yeh, okay.\n\n               Vaughn turns and walks back up the aisle. Brown watches him \n               go, knowing he's still upset.\n\n               EXT. MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY\n\n               The Indian bus pulls up outside the Stadium, where a group \n               of several thousand fans wait. The players are showered with \n               cheers and applause as they file out.\n\n               INT. BAR - NIGHT\n\n               Vaughn sits in the bar alone, nursing a beer, still troubled \n               by his demotion. He hears a sexy VOICE behind him.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         You mind if I join you?\n\n               Vaughn turns around to see Suzanne Dorn. She's dressed to \n               draw blood, looking better than we've ever seen her. She \n               slides into the booth.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         I don't think I'd be very good company \n                         tonight.\n\n                                     SUZANNE\n                         Why not?\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         Nothin'. Job problem.\n\n               Vaughn falls silent. Suzanne stares at him with a devastating \n               combination of sexual heat and tender admiration. She's \n               pulling out all the stops. Vaughn's a little flustered.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         I'm, ah, a ball player.\n\n                                     SUZANNE\n                         I know, but that's not why I came \n                         over. I don't chase ball players.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         Why did you come over then?\n\n                                     SUZANNE\n                         Because you're the sexiest man I've \n                         ever laid eyes on, and you look like \n                         you could use a... friend.\n\n               We GO TO Vaughn. Forget it. He's a goner.\n\n               INT. VAUGHN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Vaughn has dozed off in the bed. Suzanne, is getting dressed. \n               Vaughn wakes up as she finishes.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         Where you goin'?\n\n                                     SUZANNE\n                         I've gotta get home.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         I didn't even get your name.\n\n                                     SUZANNE\n                         Suzanne. Suzanne Dorn\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                              (having heard that \n                              name someplace before)\n                         Suzanne Dorn?\n\n                                     SUZANNE\n                         Mrs. Suzanne Dorn.\n                              (kissing him on the \n                              forehead)\n                         So long. You're a great kid.\n\n               With that she walks on out, leaving Vaughn dazed by the \n               knowledge of who he's just slept with.\n\n               THE HALL OUTSIDE VAUGHN'S ROOM\n\n               Taylor is coming back from the bathroom down the hall as \n               Suzanne comes out of Vaughn's room.\n\n                                     SUZANNE\n                              (nonchalant)\n                         Hello, Jake.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Hello, Suzanne.\n\n               Taylor is amazed by what he's just seen. As soon as Suzanne \n               is out of sight, he goes to Vaughn's room and opens the door.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Vaughn?\n\n               Vaughn is sitting on his bed in a state of disbelief.\n\n                                     VAUGHN\n                         I swear to God I didn't know who she \n                         was.\n\n               Taylor nods that it's all right even though he doesn't believe \n               it.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               OMIT\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               THE LIMO\n\n               pulling up outside the church. Lynn is helped out of the car \n               by her Father. As she starts up the steps, she sees that \n               both sides are lined by the entire Cleveland Indians team in \n               uniform. They form an arch of bats as she passes. At the top \n               of the steps is Taylor. Lynn stops as her father ushers her \n               mother on into the church.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         You look beautiful.\n\n                                     LYNN\n                         Thank you. I didn't think you'd come.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         I can't stay.\n                              (indicating the team)\n                         We gotta get to the park.\n\n                                     LYNN\n                         Good luck today, Jake.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Yeh, you too.\n                              (pause)\n                         Tell me one thing. The night you \n                         came up to my hotel -- was there \n                         really a library conference?\n\n                                     LYNN\n                         No, I came to see you.\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Too bad it didn't work out better. I \n                         just wanna say I'm sorry for all the \n                         things I've put you through over the \n                         years.\n\n                                     LYNN\n                         Even for last night?\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         Can't be sorry for that. Nothing \n                         happened.\n\n               He says this with absolute conviction. Despite herself, Lynn \n               senses that he's telling the truth.\n\n                                     LYNN\n                         Then you weren't defending my honor \n                         again?\n\n                                     TAYLOR\n                         I didn't have to. She knew she was \n                         outclassed.\n\n               Lynn smiles. He gives her a kiss and watches as she goes \n               inside. He stands there a long beat, then turns and walks \n               slowly down the steps past his teammates.\n\n               INT. RACHEL PHELPS' OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Rachel is looking out at the empty stadium.

We couldn't afford \n                         anything better. Donald left the \n                         team nearly bankrupt. If we'd had \n                         another losing season, I would have \n                         had to sell the team. I knew we \n                         couldn't win with the team we had, \n                         so I decided to bring in new players \n                         and see how they'd do with the proper \n                         motivation. There was never any offer \n                         from Miami.

But I \n                         didn't, did I?\n\n               Brown has no comeback for this. He knows now that she's \n               telling the truth.\n\n                                     RACHEL\n                         You think this was all an accident? \n                         I personally scouted every member of \n                         this team, except Hayes, of course. \n                         He was a surprise. They all had flaws \n                         which concealed their real talent, \n                         or I wouldn't have been able to get \n                         them. But I knew if anyone could \n                         straighten them out, you could. And \n                         if you tell them any of this, I will \n                         fire you.\n\n               Brown can only shake his head at this whole thing.\n\n                                     RACHEL\n                         I love this team, Lou. Go get 'em \n                         tonight.\n\n               The two shake hands. Brown looks at Rachel a beat, still \n               looking for some sign of duplicity. Finally he gives her a \n               grudging smile of respect.\n\n               INT. THE TURK - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are getting ready to \n               board the bus to the stadium.

He looks away to \n               see Haywood in the on-deck circle smiling out at him.\n\n               Meanwhile, the CROWD has gone nuts at the sight of Vaughn. \n               Bobby, Vic and Johnny are blasting out \"Wild Thing\" on the \n               tom-toms and the whole stadium, 75,000 strong, is singing \n               it.

Vaughn gives it to him. Dorn rubs it up, staring long \n               and hard into Vaughn's eyes.

While Dorn trots back to his \n               position, Vaughn turns his back to the plate for one last \n               moment of concentration.

Taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the \n               bat and bunts Duke's pitch down the third base line.\n\n               The Yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges \n               the ball frantically.\n\n               TAYLOR\n\n               barreling down the line toward first on his sore legs, giving \n               it everything he's got.\n\n               THE THIRD BASEMAN\n\n               scooping up the ball barehanded and firing on the run to \n               first.\n\n               TAYLOR\n\n               pounding down the line. He strains for the bag as the Yankee \n               first baseman stretches to his limit for the throw. Taylor \n               and the ball arrive at almost the same time. Taylor hits the \n               bag and then sprawls in the dirt as his knees give out.\n\n               The umpire brings up his arms, and spreads them wide. Safe. \n               Taylor's beaten it.\n\n               The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes \n               fear into his heart across the field. It's...\n\n               HAYES\n\n               streaking for home, trying to score all the way from second \n               on a bunt.\n\n               The first baseman fires to the plate, as the catcher positions \n               himself for the throw. Hayes launches into a flying feet-\n               first slide. The catcher brings the tag down. Hayes hooks to \n               the outside, his trailing foot reaching for the plate.\n\n                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n                         Hayes is gonna try to score! Here \n                         comes the throw. He slides. He is...\n\n               Hayes' foot catches the corner of the plate. The umpire puts \n               the palms down and whips them apart. It's all over, folks. \n\n               SLOW MOTION ENDS\n\n                                     DOYLE\n                         ...Safe. The Indians win it. The \n                         Indians win. Oh my God, the Indians \n                         win it!!\n\n               Pandemonium breaks loose in Municipal Stadium. Rachel hugs \n               Donovan, dances around, punches the air, then hugs Donovan \n               again. Everywhere people are hugging and kissing each other. \n               Bobby, Vic and Johnny are going berserk in the bleachers. \n               Thelma sits quietly, a tear rolling down her cheek.\n\n               QUICK CUTS\n\n               of our other fans. We see...\n\n               A) The Business Executive stand up and yell \"Yes!\" in the \n               middle of the opera. Several other men stand up and express \n               their excitement as well.\n\n               B) The Longshoremen whoop it up in their bar -- exchanging \n               fives and hugs with the punkers and heavy metal kids.\n\n               C) The various apartment dwellers dancing, clapping, yelling \n               out the windows.\n\n               D) The two Korean Groundskeepers just shaking their heads in \n               amazement.\n\n               E) Elsewhere in the stadium, the joyous exultation continues \n               unabated. The crowd pours onto the field as Hayes runs toward \n               Taylor and literally leaps into his arms.\n\n               F) The two spin around throwing their fists in the air.\n\n               G) Cerrano and Harris embrace. Dorn gives Vaughn a hug, then \n               steps back and decks him with a right hand.\n\n               H) Dorn pulls Vaughn back to his feet, and they hug again.\n\n               I) Up in the stands, Rachel watches all this with tears in \n               her eyes.\n\n               Taylor starts off the field when he sees something that \n               catches his eye. Standing by the field rail is Lynn. She \n               holds up her left hand and smiles. There's no ring on it. \n               Taylor races over to her as she jumps down from the rail and \n               hugs herself to him. We HOLD on the celebration as it swirls \n               all around them, and...\n\n               ROLL CREDITS\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nMajor League\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David S.
