Dorn and Gentry a \n               good 10-yard lead, but Hayes is coming like a bullet.

As Harris takes off his jersey we \n               see three SPLOTCHES OF GREASY SUBSTANCES on his chest, just \n               inside the button line.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHN\n</b>                         What is that stuff?\n\n<b>                                     HARRIS\n</b>                              (pointing to them in \n                              order)\n                         Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil.

Cerrano has set up an altar \n               in his locker. In front of his bats, which are lined up like \n               sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball \n               players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in \n               the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth.\n\n               Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats. He finishes \n               an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll.\n\n<b>                                     TAYLOR\n</b>                         What are you doin' there, Pedro?\n\n<b>                                     CERRANO\n</b>                         Bats.

He will \n                         come.\n\n               Cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to \n               the fetish doll. Harris has been listening to all this. \n               Cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers.\n\n<b>                                     HARRIS\n</b>                         I wouldn't leave this gin sittin' \n                         around out here with this group.\n\n<b>                                     CERRANO\n</b>                              (with a certain gravity)\n                         Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin. \n                         Is very bad.\n\n               Cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving \n               everyone to wonder just how bad.\n\n<b>               OMIT\n</b>\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n<b>               MONTAGE SEQUENCE\n</b>\n               compressing and detailing the progress of spring training. \n               We see:\n\n               A) Vaughn on the pitcher's mound. A tin replica of a batter \n               has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the \n               plate to delineate the strike zone. Vaughn fires a pitch and \n               hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him.\n\n               B) Cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at \n               several curve balls.\n\n<b>               C) HAYES\n</b>\n               doing push-ups at night. He's the only one left on the field, \n               except Temple, who supervises.\n\n<b>               D) TAYLOR\n</b>\n               doing the \"scramble\" drill -- blocking down balls purposely \n               thrown in the dirt, one after another. When it ends, he can \n               hardly get to his feet.\n\n<b>               E) CERRANO\n</b>\n               waving a ten-foot BOA CONSTRICTOR in the sign of the cross \n               in front of his locker before opening it. No red tag greets \n               him. Hayes watches from a safe distance.\n\n<b>               F) VAUGHN\n</b>\n               holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a \n               peek inside to see if there's a red tag there.\n\n<b>               G) DORN\n</b>\n               taking a hard ground ball off the chest. Brown applauds. \n               Dorn is pissed.\n\n<b>               H) VAUGHN\n</b>\n               throwing at the \"ropes\" again. The tin batter is dented in \n               every conceivable place now. Vaughn whips in another fast \n               ball. This one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it \n               completely off.\n\n<b>               I) TAYLOR\n</b>\n               in an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. \n               Jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second -- \n               on a bounce. The ball skips into center field.\n\n<b>               J) HAYES\n</b>\n               also in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping \n               it up behind the plate. He just drops in his tracks and starts \n               to do push-ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him.\n\n<b>               K) CERRANO\n</b>\n               flailing away again at a curve ball. This and the remaining \n               shots are all in exhibition games.\n\n<b>               L) HAYES\n</b>\n               waving a ten-inch garter snake in front of his locker. Even \n               at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but \n               it works its magic. No red tag.\n\n<b>               M) VAUGHN\n</b>\n               with a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four \n               feet over Taylor's head. The run scores.\n\n<b>               N) HAYES\n</b>\n               attempting to steal second. He goes into a hell-bent-for-\n               leather head first slide. Unfortunately, he comes up two \n               feet short of the base. The second baseman, who's waiting \n               for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. \n               Hayes flips him the bird.\n\n<b>               O) LOU BROWN\n</b>\n               on the bench. He turns to Pepper with a look that says, \"Can \n               you believe this shit?\"\n\n<b>               P) TAYLOR\n</b>\n               waiting for a throw at the plate. Just as he's about to catch \n               it, the runner knocks him flat.\n\n<b>               Q) BROWN\n</b>\n               his head in his hands. As Taylor gets up and goes to the \n               wrong dugout, the MONTAGE ENDS.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Hayes and Vaughn hang back.\n\n               Cerrano is already at his locker. He's got two snakes this \n               time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. He sprays a patch \n               of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a \n               symbol door. No tag. He kisses the snake, leaving some white \n               paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk.\n\n               Taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers \n               inside. He's made it, too. Cerrano offers a hand. Taylor \n               shakes it and breaks a weary smile.\n\n<b>               GENTRY\n</b>\n               opens locker, slumps on stool.

If they cut us, we'll just \n                         sign with the Yankees.\n\n               Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. This \n               doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes \n               closed. He stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one \n               eye.\n\n               Seeing no tag, he turns and walks double-time out of the \n               locker room, as if he had to get to the john.\n\n               He comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around \n               like a wild man.\n\n<b>               VAUGHN\n</b>\n               drawing strength from Hayes, walks resolutely to his locker \n               and whips it open.

We condense the time, of course, SHOOTING some \n               underwater, some SLO-MO, as she knives through the water, \n               her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium. \n               The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her strokes \n               and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, \n               its synthesis of power and form.\n\n               As she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the \n               pool next to her.

Peeling walls and ceilings, rickety \n               furniture, rusted bathroom fixtures. Taylor sprawls down on \n               one of the cots.

He also wears long \n               earrings, high heels, and of course, glasses. Vaughn tries \n               to ignore the guy, but his concentration is broken.\n\n               Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch. He winds \n               and fires. The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to \n               the wall in right center. Hayes runs it down and guns it \n               back to the infield to hold the guy to a double. The convict \n               whoops it up.\n\n               Vaughn gets back up on the rubber. As he comes to the stretch, \n               he catches sight of the convict again. The guy is doing a \n               pantomime, sneaking up to a car and picking the lock, much \n               to the delight of his teammates. Vaughn throws his pitch in \n               the dirt and all the way to the backstop. The runner on second \n               goes to third.\n\n<b>                                     TAYLOR\n</b>                              (throwing the ball \n                              back)\n                         C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.\n\n               Vaughn gets ready again. The convict finishes picking the \n               lock and then is suddenly arrested. He puts his hands against \n               the wall and spreads his legs for a weapons check, cracking \n               up the whole bench. Vaughn is getting a little steamed. His \n               next pitch is hammered into left for a single, scoring a \n               run.\n\n<b>               THREE SHOTS OF VAUGHN\n</b>\n               throwing pitches, followed by:\n\n<b>               SHOTS\n</b>\n               of the THIRD HITTER lining a double down the right field \n               line, the FOURTH HITTER a triple off the center field wall, \n               and the FIFTH HITTER a single to right. The scoreboard now \n               reads 4 to 0 Yankees. Taylor comes out to talk to Vaughn.\n\n<b>                                     TAYLOR\n</b>                         What's the problem, Rick?

C'mon, Ricky, let's \n                         get nasty.\n\n               Vaughn nods as Taylor trots back behind the plate.\n\n               Vaughn gets set again as his old nemesis, Haywood, steps \n               into the batter's box. Haywood has a sly smile on his face.\n\n               As Vaughn comes to his stretch, the convict goes back into \n               his act. He's in jail now, struggling against the bars. \n               Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles, while one of his \n               teammates humps up against him, pretending to bugger him. \n               This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics.\n\n               Vaughn has lost it now. He fires to the plate and Haywood \n               creams another tape measure job into the upper deck. Hayes \n               doesn't even bother to run back to the wall. He just watches \n               it go. 6-0 Yankees.\n\n<b>                                     BROWN\n</b>                         I thought now that Vaughn had some \n                         control, he was ready for the Yankees.\n\n<b>                                     PEPPER\n</b>                         Not quite yet.\n\n               Brown makes his way to the mound to take Vaughn out.\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n</b>                         So, Vaughn pitches in some tough \n                         luck here as the Yankees put together \n                         as few squib hits and take a 6-0 \n                         lead.\n\n<b>               DOYLE\n</b>\n               in the press box.

We're going \n                         to go back now to Ross Farmer who's \n                         standing by at the Hotel Stanley \n                         where the Indians are staying in \n                         Detroit. Ross?\n\n               The scene shifts to...\n\n<b>               THE LOBBY OF THE STANLEY HOTEL\n</b>\n               where Ross Farmer stands, microphone in hand. Behind him \n               several players can be seen partying in the bar.\n\n<b>                                     FARMER\n</b>                         Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the \n                         Indians are in high spirits tonight, \n                         looking forward to their showdown \n                         with the Yankees. Who will start \n                         that game is still a matter of some \n                         conjecture.\n\n               As Ross talks, Dorn walks INTO THE FRAME in the far background \n               with his arm around a YOUNG LOVELY. They're nuzzling and \n               hugging, unaware they're on camera, albeit in the background. \n               Suzanne doesn't miss it though. She moves closer to the screen \n               to get a better look.\n\n               Dorn and the Girl get in an elevator together, obviously \n               going upstairs. As the elevator closes, Suzanne hits the off \n               button. She sits there a second in shock, and then her face \n               begins to harden.\n\n<b>               INT. TAYLOR'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Taylor and DARLA are undressing, preparatory to getting into \n               bed.

She puts her leg up on \n               the bed to unhook her stockings. Taylor is about to take off \n               his pants, but stops.\n\n<b>                                     TAYLOR\n</b>                         Darla, I don't think I can do this.\n\n<b>                                     DARLA\n</b>                         What do you mean?

He \n               then sprints to the end of the hall and down the stairs.\n\n<b>               TAYLOR\n</b>\n               running down the stairs and into the lobby. Seeing no sign \n               of Lynn, he races out the front door to see her pulling out \n               in a taxi. He can only stand and watch her disappear into \n               the night.\n\n<b>               INT.

Hayes \n               smiles, snaps his black gloves out of his hip pocket, and \n               carefully pulls them on over his hands.\n\n               The Duke does not care for this kind of showmanship.\n\n               Brown comes over to talk to Taylor, who's been watching Duke \n               from the on-deck circle.\n\n<b>                                     BROWN\n</b>                         Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch-\n                         hit for you here. You're 0 for 18 \n                         against Duke. Plus you're beat to \n                         shit you can hardly walk, there's no \n                         way you can get around on this guy's \n                         fast ball. So I want the absolute \n                         truth here. Can you beat this guy?\n\n<b>                                     TAYLOR\n</b>                         Yeh.\n\n<b>                                     BROWN\n</b>                         Okay.\n\n               Taylor starts for the plate, as Duke finishes his warmups. \n               Brown comes down the dugout steps.\n\n<b>                                     BROWN\n</b>                              (to Pepper)\n                         Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't \n                         want Taylor takin' too many strikes.\n\n               Pepper begins flashing signs out to Hayes. Duke gets up on \n               the rubber and takes his stretch. Hayes leads away, crouching \n               low. Duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman \n               slapping a hard tag on Hayes, but Hayes is back.\n\n               The crowd is on its feet again. The \"GO\" chant starts, \n               punctuated by thousands of black-gloved hands punching the \n               night air.\n\n               Duke comes set again. Hayes leads away. Duke watches him, \n               checks him again. We go to SLOW MOTION as Duke kicks and \n               comes to the plate.\n\n               Hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground. \n               Taylor swings and misses. The Yankee catcher comes up \n               throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. Hayes \n               leaves his feet diving for the bag. The second baseman snaps \n               down the tag. Too late. Hayes is in there.\n\n               The stadium is really rockin' now. Duke prowls the mound. \n               Taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to Brown.\n\n<b>                                     PEPPER\n</b>                         What's he doing?\n\n<b>                                     BROWN\n</b>                         Flashing some signals. That's a hell \n                         of an idea.\n\n               Brown flashes a sign out to Hayes. A hint of a smile comes \n               over Hayes' face as he dusts himself off.\n\n               Taylor steps back in as Duke gets up on the rubber. Taylor \n               digs in his back foot, then points to the left field bleachers \n               ala Babe Ruth.\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n</b>                         What's this? Taylor is pointing to \n                         the bleachers, calling his shot.\n\n               The crowd, electrified by Taylor's gesture, remains on its \n               feet. Duke stares in at Taylor, comes to his stretch and \n               then lets go a steaming fast ball right at Taylor's head. \n               Taylor goes down in a swirl of dust, the ball missing him by \n               inches. The stadium explodes with BOOS, but as soon as Taylor \n               picks himself up, the crowd begins to ROAR again.\n\n               Bobby, Vic and Johnny are pounding out a heavy beat on the \n               TOM-TOMS. Everyone in the stadium begins to CLAP in unison \n               with the DRUMS.\n\n               Taylor steps back in and once again points to the bleachers.\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n</b>                              (Taylor points again)\n                         Unbelievable. They're on their feet \n                         here, stomping, clapping. C'mon, \n                         join in wherever you are out there. \n                         Let's hear you, Cleveland.\n\n<b>               THE LONGSHOREMEN\n</b>\n               and several of their friends at their bar, huddled around \n               the RADIO with the punks and heavy metal kids we saw before. \n               Slowly they begin to clap in time with the tom-toms which \n               are audible on the T.V.\n\n<b>               THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE\n</b>\n               at the opera with his wife, a radio earplug in his ear. His \n               hand taps on his leg in sync with the TOM-TOMS.\n\n<b>               THE TWO KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS\n</b>\n               (Sc 222 before scene 221) beating on their shovels in the \n               bullpen.\n\n<b>               LARGE APARTMENT BUILDING\n</b>\n               FRAMED against the Cleveland skyline. In several of the lit \n               windows we see people banging things or clapping.\n\n<b>               THE STADIUM AGAIN\n</b>\n               Duke gets back on the hill. Getting the sign he wants, he \n               comes to his stretch, checking Hayes at second.\n\n               As Duke starts his delivery to the plate, we go to SLOW \n               MOTION. The clapping in the stadium stops as everyone hushes \n               to watch the pitch. We...\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               THE LONGSHOREMEN, THE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE, THE GROUNDSKEEPERS \n</b><b>               AND THE APARTMENT DWELLERS\n</b>\n               They've all stopped too in anticipation of the pitch.\n\n<b>               THE STADIUM\n</b>\n               Everything from here on will continue to be in SLOW MOTION. \n               As Duke whips his arm toward the plate, Hayes takes off for \n               third. Taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the \n               bat and bunts Duke's pitch down the third base line.\n\n               The Yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges \n               the ball frantically.\n\n<b>               TAYLOR\n</b>\n               barreling down the line toward first on his sore legs, giving \n               it everything he's got.\n\n<b>               THE THIRD BASEMAN\n</b>\n               scooping up the ball barehanded and firing on the run to \n               first.\n\n<b>               TAYLOR\n</b>\n               pounding down the line. He strains for the bag as the Yankee \n               first baseman stretches to his limit for the throw. Taylor \n               and the ball arrive at almost the same time. Taylor hits the \n               bag and then sprawls in the dirt as his knees give out.\n\n               The umpire brings up his arms, and spreads them wide. Safe. \n               Taylor's beaten it.\n\n               The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes \n               fear into his heart across the field. It's...\n\n<b>               HAYES\n</b>\n               streaking for home, trying to score all the way from second \n               on a bunt.\n\n               The first baseman fires to the plate, as the catcher positions \n               himself for the throw. Hayes launches into a flying feet-\n               first slide. The catcher brings the tag down. Hayes hooks to \n               the outside, his trailing foot reaching for the plate.\n\n<b>                                     DOYLE (V.O.)\n</b>                         Hayes is gonna try to score!

The umpire puts \n               the palms down and whips them apart. It's all over, folks. \n\n<b>               SLOW MOTION ENDS\n</b>\n<b>                                     DOYLE\n</b>                         ...Safe. The Indians win it.

Rachel hugs \n               Donovan, dances around, punches the air, then hugs Donovan \n               again. Everywhere people are hugging and kissing each other. \n               Bobby, Vic and Johnny are going berserk in the bleachers. \n               Thelma sits quietly, a tear rolling down her cheek.\n\n<b>               QUICK CUTS\n</b>\n               of our other fans.

The crowd pours onto the field as Hayes runs toward \n               Taylor and literally leaps into his arms.\n\n               F) The two spin around throwing their fists in the air.\n\n               G) Cerrano and Harris embrace.

Standing by the field rail is Lynn. She \n               holds up her left hand and smiles. There's no ring on it. \n               Taylor races over to her as she jumps down from the rail and \n               hugs herself to him.
