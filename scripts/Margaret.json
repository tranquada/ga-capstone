She steps off the curb toward us --\r\n          A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened\r\n          perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But\r\n          the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to\r\n          and fro through the frame.\r\n\r\n          CREDITS BEGIN OVER:\r\n\r\n          2 EXT. ANOTHER CORNER.

HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4\r\n\r\n          An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,\r\n          one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive\r\n          schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A\r\n          sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids.\r\n          The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.\r\n\r\n                         MR AARON\r\n          Abrams...

Not the best-looking girl in her\r\n          class but definitely in the top five.

Haven't you ever developed an \r\n          interest in something you didn't initially\r\n          think you were going to develop an interest\r\n          in?\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          Um, no, not really.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement.

So what's the big\r\n          difference-between using a book and like, I\r\n          don't know, using somebody else's mind\r\n          who's like, really good at math? It's not\r\n          like this person did the whole test for me.\r\n\r\n                         MR AARON\r\n          Oh no?\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          No. I did some of it.\r\n          She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.\r\n\r\n                         MR AARON\r\n          Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you\r\n          did all of it.

But I don't want it to become the\r\n          summation of her life. Because it's not.\r\n          When her Lisa died I said to her, \"How can\r\n          you stand it?\" And she said. \"First of all\r\n          I can't.

Because they weren't.\"\r\n          So despite the fact that she got -- ripped\r\n          off, I do think it's important to remember\r\n          that Monica got a lot out of life. She was\r\n          the most fully developed person I\r\n          personally have ever known.

What do you think Shakespeare\r\n          is saying about human suffering here?\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          I don't know.

That's not good enough.\r\n          Shakespeare wrote something: What's your\r\n          response?

I think he's\r\n          saying that human beings don't mean any\r\n          more to the gods than flies do to little\r\n          boys who like to torture them for fun.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 74\r\n\r\n                         96 CONTINUED: 96\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)\r\n          Like as far as the gods are concerned we're\r\n          just ants. Nothing.

Yeah, I agree. Only\r\n          it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's\r\n          Gloucester. Maybe another character would\r\n          have a different point of view.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN\r\n          OK: That's a valid point. Just because\r\n          Shakespeare has one of his characters say\r\n          it doesn't mean he personally agrees with\r\n          it. Yes: David?\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the\r\n          gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying\r\n          there's a higher consciousness that we\r\n          can't see. That the gods' perception of\r\n          reality is so much more developed than ours\r\n          that compared to their perception, our\r\n          perceptions are like comparing flies to\r\n\r\n                         BOYS\r\n\r\n                         JOHN\r\n          OK...I don't think that's what he's getting\r\n          at...I think what he's getting at here is a\r\n          very dark view of the arbitrary nature of\r\n          human suffering.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing\r\n          human consciousness to divine\r\n          consciousness, and he's saying that even\r\n          though it seems to us that human suffering\r\n          is just arbitrary, that's just because\r\n          we're limited by our viewpoint. \r\n\r\n                         JOHN\r\n          Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test\r\n          David's hypothesis. \"We are to the gods as\r\n          flies to wanton boys. They kill us for\r\n          their sport.\" I have to agree with Matthew,\r\n          that seems pretty unambiguous.\r\n\r\n                         DAVID\r\n          Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher\r\n          purpose that we can't see. He's saying that\r\n          what seems like them killing us for sport\r\n          could just be because our consciousness\r\n          isn't developed enough to see what the\r\n          higher wisdom of their killing us is.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 75\r\n\r\n                         96 CONTINUED: (2) 96\r\n\r\n                         JOHN\r\n          OK, but -- I still don't think that's what\r\n          he's trying to say.

HIGHWAY ONE POLICE STATION - MITCHELL'S DESK - LATER 120\r\n\r\n          Lisa sits across from Mitchell.\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          So now you're sayin' he ran the light. \r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road.\r\n          And I was definitely trying to get his\r\n          attention...\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin'\r\n          with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs\r\n          the light, hits the decedent, she dies on\r\n          the scene...the both of youse lie to me on\r\n          both of your statements, and then\r\n          somewheres in there you turn around, decide\r\n          the guy belongs in jail. That right? That\r\n          about right?\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          I don't have any control over if he goes to\r\n          jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I\r\n          just want to set the record straight, so\r\n          that if he gets away with this I won't have\r\n          been a part of it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           100\r\n\r\n                         120 CONTINUED: 120\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          And what do you think I should do with you?\r\n          Just gimme\u00e2\u0080\u00a2a clue. 'cause I'm just a little\r\n          bit lost over here...:\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          Do whatever you want. I know what I did. \r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa,\r\n          anybody will tell you that just because he\r\n          ran a red light is not a criminal offence. \r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          Even if he kills someone?\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n\r\n                         (SIMULTANEOUS) \r\n          Even if you cause an accidental death, \r\n          that's right. For this to be a criminal\r\n          offense, the law says you need two \r\n          aggravating circumstances. Like he ran a red\r\n          light and he was speeding. Or he ran a red\r\n          light and he was --\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          (On 2nd \"red\")\r\n          So he's not liable to be prosecuted for\r\n          manslaughter? Or second degree murder?\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          No. He could be charged with reckless\r\n          driving, and fillip' out a false police\r\n          report. Which, that's no joke --\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          That's unbelievable! What does he have to\r\n          do? Kill her on purpose?\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          Yes. Because that's the definition of\r\n          murder. Killin' somebody on purpose.\r\n          You're not sayin' he ran her over on\r\n          purpose, are you?\r\n          Pause.\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          No.\r\n          Pause.\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          All, right, look. Lemme take another\r\n          statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,\r\n\r\n          OK?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           101\r\n\r\n                         120 CONTINUED: (2) 120\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          You're kidding.\r\n\r\n                         MITCHELL\r\n          No. I'll go over it with my sergeant,\r\n          probably pull this guy in again.\r\n          Reinterview him.

And I know a lot\r\n          of people feel that teenagers are really\r\n          naive, which they are, many of them. But\r\n          they still haven't had a chance to get\r\n          burned out by the disappointments and the\r\n          harsh realities of learning how to play the\r\n          game.

I also think they tend\r\n          to adhere to ideologies really easily\r\n          without having actually bothered to think\r\n          them through for themselves.--\r\n\r\n                         LEWIS\r\n          Such as what?\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          Such as what?

Mom, that's the one...\r\n          Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as\r\n          people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see\r\n          their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two\r\n          dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at\r\n          them and drives past with a short wave.\r\n          Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.\r\n\r\n                         JOAN\r\n          Come on.

METROPOLITAN OPERA -- OUTDOOR TERRACE. NIGHT. 172\r\n\r\n          Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out\r\n          over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her,\r\n          but Lisa won't look at her or interact.\r\n\r\n                         JOAN\r\n          Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I\r\n          ever heard.\r\n\r\n                         LISA\r\n          What do you mean?

METROPOLITAN OPERA - GRAND STAIRCASE. NIGHT 172A \r\n\r\n           Lisa comes down the stairs and goes into -- \r\n\r\n          173 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA. NIGHT. 173\r\n\r\n           Lisa hurries down the long aisle. The LIGHTS DIM. The \r\n           audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way \r\n           past the other patrons in the row, whispering \"Excuse me\" and\r\n           takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. \r\n           Lisa stares straight ahead. \r\n\r\n           The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the \r\n          barcarole \"Belle Nuit.\" It's very beautiful.\r\n          Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,\r\n          but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and\r\n          wipes them away, but they keep coming.\r\n          Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.\r\n          Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,\r\n          clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts\r\n          crying too out of sympathy.\r\n\r\n          As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa\r\n          crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand\r\n          and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that\r\n          the spell has been broken.\r\n\r\n          The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n                         THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nMargaret\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Kenneth Lonergan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:30:40.704820"}
