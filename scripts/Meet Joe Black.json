ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM\n\n\tA patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.  BACK\n\tFARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to\n\tmassive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River\n\tmanor house; the country estate of William Parrish.\n\n\tINT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM\n\n\tMOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into\n\tan expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with\n\tBierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists\n\tand trees and small boats and distant humans.\n\n\tINT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM\n\n\tMOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-\n\ted with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping\n\toccupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a\n\tman of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.\n\n\tAlthough asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.\n\tParrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity\n\tof the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes\n\tup, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the\n\twind itself:\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\t... Yes.\n\n\tParrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is\n\tnot sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,\n\tthe discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.\n\n\tHe rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze\n\toutside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes\n\tup:\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\tYes...\n\n\tIt is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has\n\theard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He\n\tcan't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild-\n\tered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,\n\ttrying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't\n\theard; he is not sure.\n\n\tHe pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his\n\teyes.\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tParrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one\n\tthere, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,\n\tshould he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute\n\tstillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a\n\tlight FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but\n\tthen they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and\n\tfinally, exhausted, falls back asleep.\n\n\tEXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING\n\n\tThe great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-\n\trolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and\n\tadding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,\n\tspeakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's\n\tolder daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she\n\trelishing every moment.\n\n\tA Painter approaches.\n\n\t\t\t     PAINTER\n\t\tThe big tent, Miss Allison --\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\tPaint is rust and moss green.\n\t\tMedieval colors -- Daddy's like\n\t\tan old knight.\n\n\tA Florist stops her.\n\n\t\t\t     FLORIST\n\t\tThe head table --?\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\tWhat about it?\n\n\t\t\t     FLORIST\n\t\tThe flowers, ma'am--?\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\tFreesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy\n\t\tloves freesia -- and you, over there,\n\t\tlights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking\n\t\tfor a saffron glow -- sort of tea-\n\t\tdance twenties.\n\n\tEXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING\n\n\tParrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-\n\ting the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his\n\twatch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family\n\tretainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish\n\tpasses.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tWhat do you think of all this, May?\n\n\t\t\t     MAY\n\t\tIt's going to be beautiful.  And\n\t\tMiss Allison says the President may\n\t\tcome.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tOh, the President's got better\n\t\tthings to do than come to my\n\t\tbirthday party.\n\n\t\t\t     MAY\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\tParrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who,\n\ton catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\tDaddy!\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tHi, Allison --\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\tHave you got a minute?\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tNot much more.

ASTAR HELICOPTER - DAY\n\n\tThe configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front\n\tof them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats.\n\tJust as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache\n\tcase and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the\n\tpilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up\n\tand heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances\n\tover at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.\n\tHe motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks\n\tthat Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into\n\ther carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the\n\twork that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tI thought you were in a meeting--?\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI am.

A counterman,\n\twith a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front\n\tof her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for\n\tthe day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her\n\tspeaking into the pay phone.\n\n\tAn attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at\n\this feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\t...Honey, you've got to go on...\n\t\tthere's a time to sow and a time to\n\t\treap, you sow now and forget about\n\t\thim... yeah, I liked him, I don't\n\t\tlike him anymore... because you're\n\t\tmy honey and anybody messes with you\n\t\tmesses with me -- I'm on a plane in\n\t\ta minute... as soon as I get my\n\t\tphone in, you're my first call,\n\t\tthat's a promise... where you going\n\t\tnow?... good, hit the books, get that\n\t\tdegree, one day we'll hang out a\n\t\tshingle together... you bet, honey...\n\t\tlater.\n\n\tThe Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an\n\toverflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the\n\tcounterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the\n\tbreakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take\n\ther eyes off him.

PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n\tAlone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately\n\tchanges.  Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares\n\tout through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the\n\tManhattan skyline: cogitates.\n\n\tHe takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he\n\tflinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp\n\tbut brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he\n\tignores it.\n\n\tParrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the\n\tpain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to\n\tmassage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands,\n\ttrying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some-\n\tthing is unmistakably wrong.  Now a SOUND which he has\n\tcome to recognize, makes itself heard:\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tFrozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the\n\tsource of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction,\n\tyet surrounds him.  Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply\n\tintensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a\n\tcorner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other\n\tclutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently\n\tseized the upper part of his body.  He breaks out in a sweat,\n\this pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself:\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE (V.O., cont'd)\n\t\t...Yes.\n\n\tParrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him\n\ton the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer,\n\teach aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself,\n\tconsumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a\n\thallucination but which he is certain is not.  Parrish is\n\tpossessed.  He angles his face in every direction, arbi-\n\ttrarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously,\n\tenrage, responds to the Voice.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\t'Yes' what?\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE\n\t\t'Yes' is the answer to your\n\t\tquestion.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI didn't ask any question.\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE\n\t\tI believe you did.\n\n\tParrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and\n\tconsternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence\n\tand reality.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tWho are you?\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH (cont'd)\n\t\tGoddammit, what is going on?!\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE\n\t\tI think you know --\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI don't!\n\n\t\t\t     VOICE\n\t\tTry.

Parrish searches the corner, but the\n\troom has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by\n\tthe VOICE, it is now just Parrish's office.  Faint SQUEALS of\n\ttraffic from the street, then a KNOCK at the door.\n\n\tParrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is\n\tstill wet with sweat, the KNOCK again.

THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NEXT DAY\n\n\tA large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of\n\tcoffee and half-eaten pastries.  The Board of Parrish\n\tCommunications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince.\n\tFelicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes.\n\n\t\t\t     DREW\n\t\t...I know you're all as uncomfor-\n\t\ttable as I am to be meeting without\n\t\tBill, but I got a call last night\n\t\tfrom John Bontecou.  Not only is he\n\t\tstill interested, he is sweetening\n\t\this offer.\n\t\t\t(a moment)\n\t\tAlthough it pains me to say it, in\n\t\tmy opinion Bill Parrish dealt with\n\t\tus peremptorily in dismissing any\n\t\tdeal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm\n\t\tsorry to say that if we are to exam-\n\t\tine this new offer responsibly as\n\t\tthe Board of Directors of Parrish\n\t\tCommunications, we must do so with-\n\t\tout its Chairman.\n\t\t\t(another moment)\n\t\tOh yes, there is one additional\n\t\telement: Bontecou is so anxious to\n\t\tget us, he said he'd take Parrish\n\t\tCommunications with our Chairman or\n\t\twithout.\n\n\tThe Board falls silent.  Sloane, a peer of Parrish's,\n\tfidgets.  Drew milks the moment.\n\n\t\t\t     DREW (cont'D)\n\t\tIt's no surprise if I suggest to you\n\t\tthat the Bill Parrish we know is not\n\t\tthe Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.\n\t\tYou heard that speech -- some strange\n\t\temotional rationale to buttress a\n\t\tknee-jerk rejection of a legitimate\n\t\toffer.  Does it not strike you that\n\t\tsomething is possibly affecting this\n\t\tman's judgement?  More specifically\n\t\t-- his judgement to make a critical\n\t\tbusiness decision?\n\n\tSilence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.\n\n\t\t\t     DREW (cont'D)\n\t\tIt's not pleasant to say the follow-\n\t\ting, but I would be remiss, in this\n\t\tcrisis, if I did not.  When we pre-\n\t\tsent Bill with the improved Bontecou\n\t\toffer, and if he refuses to let us\n\t\tconsider it -- once more makes an\n\t\tadamant or emotional rejection -- we\n\t\twill have no choice but to seek an\n\t\talternative.\n\n\t\t\t     SLOANE\n\t\tAnd what would that be?\n\n\t\t\t     DREW\n\t\tBill's birthday is the day after\n\t\ttomorrow.

Crisis\n\t\t-- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-\n\t\tpany, crisis for us.  I came about\n\t\twith the arrival on the scene of --\n\t\tMr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe\n\t\tBlack.  He attends our Board meet-\n\t\tint, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-\n\t\tsides in his office.  Never leaves\n\t\this side.  And, in my opinion, is\n\t\talways in his ear.  Telling him what\n\t\tto do and Bill is listening.  Who is\n\t\tJoe Black?  What is his relationship\n\t\tto Bill Parrish?  And most important,\n\t\twhat is behind his influence on our\n\t\tChairman?\n\n\t\t\t     SLOANE\n\t\tYou're building this thing up too\n\t\tmuch, Drew.  He's had advisors be-\n\t\tfore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.\n\n\tThe door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur-\n\tprised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.\n\n\t\t\t     DREW\n\t\tThank you for coming.\n\n\t\t\t     SLOANE\n\t\tHello, Quince.\n\n\t\t\t     QUINCE\n\t\tHi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know\n\t\teverybody was going to be here, what\n\t\ta nice surprise.

Won't you\n\t\tshare with our Board the information\n\t\tyou gave me last night?\n\n\tQuince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.\n\tHe nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the\n\tBoard.\n\n\t\t\t     QUINCE\n\t\tWell, I'm happy to tell you I've got\n\t\tgood news.  As I was telling Drew,\n\t\tI've been making a little hay while\n\t\tthe Bontecou sun was shining -- two,\n\t\tpossibly three new and boiling hot\n\t\tprospects for merger.\n\n\t\t\t     DREW\n\t\tHow did Bill react to the leads\n\t\tyou've developed?\n\n\t\t\t     QUINCE\n\t\tHe was interested.\n\n\t\t\t     DREW\n\t\t\t(prompting)\n\t\t-- But he was concerned about the\n\t\ttiming?\n\n\t\t\t     QUINCE\n\t\tThe timing -- yes.

A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each\n\tother, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes\n\tas such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but\n\thas no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are\n\tinstinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-\n\tgers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This\n\texcites her because she senses his untutoredness and the\n\tvery sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other\n\tare intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-\n\tledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions\n\tare such that they never beg the question -- has he done it\n\tbefore.\n\n\tStrange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-\n\ting his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-\n\ting are so real that an emotional exchange between he and\n\tSusan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land\n\tof feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet\n\tat the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being\n\tlured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but\n\tis deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing\n\tis putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.\n\tThe powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in\n\tthe end there is the knowledge they have together made a\n\tjourney, they both have been swept away in a stream of events\n\tthey have created; and they don't care about the consequences.\n\n\tSpent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tIt's so wonderful to make love to\n\t\tyou.  It's like making love to some-\n\t\tone who has never made love before.\n\n\tJoe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has\n\tsaid, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself.\n\tHe weighs, then resists, the impulse.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tThank you.\n\n\tHer head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his\n\tcomforting her without knowing that he is doing so.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tDid you like making love to me?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tI loved it.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tMore than you love peanut butter?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tYes!\n\n\tShe laughs at the earnestness with which he answers.\n\n\tJoe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for\n\tthe first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone\n\tto some distant, distant land.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tWhere are you going?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tNowhere?  I'm...here.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tFor how long?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tOh, I hope a long, long time.\n\n\tA moment.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tMe, too.\n\n\tAnother moment.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tWhat do we do now?\n\n\tShe smiles.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tIt will come to us.\n\n\tINT.

PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON\n\n\tThe Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area.\n\tThe Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and\n\tJoe disembark.  Following the Butler, they make their way\n\tthrough the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for\n\tmusic groups, portable pools with clusters of florists\n\tleaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.  Parrish\n\tand Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking\n\tto one another.  Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder,\n\tthere is a distance between them.  They walk on past chan-\n\tdeliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven\n\tthrough their branches.  Adding to the confusion, the AStar\n\tlifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling\n\tfrom the blast of the rotors.  May, the housekeeper, appears.\n\n\t\t\t     MAY\n\t\t\t(to Parrish)\n\t\tTelephone call, sir.  Mr. Sloane\n\t\tfrom New York.\n\n\tParrish nods, starts up for a wing off the main house, Joe\n\tright at his side.  Parrish stops.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tExcuse me.\n\n\tJoe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates,\n\tand Parrish strides away.  Joe does not follow.\n\n\tINT.

Okay?\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tOkay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for\n\t\tthe memory.\n\n\tParrish clicks off the SPEAKERPHONE, turns around and looks\n\tout the window again, the party preparations in full swing,\n\tcolored lights are tested, they flicker on and off.\n\n\tEXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON\n\n\tAllison is everywhere, Parrish emerges from his wing, she\n\tcatches his eye immediately, the calm director of a DeMille-\n\tlike epic, politely giving workers instructions, making\n\tlightning decisions.\n\n\tParrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain\n\tencircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-\n\tCyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men\n\tcarefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each\n\tletter.  A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected\n\tlull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\tHi, Daddy, what do you think?\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tIt's starting to grow on me.  But\n\t\twhat do the 'B' and 'P' mean?\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\tThe fountain is the Caspian Sea and\n\t\tthe Sea is serving up caviar.  The\n\t\t'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for\n\t\tPetrossian.  Of course, they also\n\t\tstand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tDo they, m'dear?\n\n\t\t\t     ALLISON\n\t\t-- Plus we've got a baritone with a\n\t\tbalalaika coming from The Russian\n\t\tTea Room.

Susan slants through the\n\tguests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha-\n\ttter float on the wind, \"He, Susie!\",  \"What a party\",  \"You\n\tlook great\", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.\n\n\tJoe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful,\n\tunfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is\n\tnot certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.\n\n\tEXT.

He heads towards her,\n\tthey are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tWhat a night.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI'm having a helluva time.\n\n\tA moment.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tYou were right about Joe, he is\n\t\tgoing somewhere --\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\t\t(gently)\n\t\tI'm sorry.\n\n\tSusan is examining Parrish very closely.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tAre you relieved?\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tYes, but --\n\n\tParrish hesitates.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tBut what?\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI want you to know how much I love\n\t\tyou.  That you've given a meaning\n\t\tto my life that I had no right to\n\t\texpect, and that no one can ever\n\t\ttake from me.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tDaddy --\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tNo -- I love you so much and I want\n\t\tyou to promise me something.  I\n\t\tdon't want you to ever worry about\n\t\tme.  If anything should happen, I'm\n\t\tgoing to be fine and everything's\n\t\tgoing to be all right.\n\t\t\t(a moment)\n\t\t-- And I have no regrets.\n\n\tSusan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH (cont'd)\n\t\tAnd I want you to feel that way,\n\t\ttoo.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tI love you, Daddy --\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tThat's why it's okay.\n\n\tThey drift into silence.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH (cont'd)\n\t\tNo regrets?\n\n\tAfter a moment.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\t'No regrets'.\n\n\tA long silence, Susan smiles.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tIt's a good feeling, isn't it?\n\n\tSilence again.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tEverybody's saying goodbye...\n\n\tThey regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an\n\tunderstanding.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI'm still here.\n\t\t\t(a moment)\n\t\tWould you like to dance with me,\n\t\tSusan?\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tOh, yes --\n\n\tHe starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tIf you don't mind dancing with an\n\t\told fogey like me.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tOh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll\n\t\tnever be old.\n\n\tHe takes her in his arms and they dance away.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tOn a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still\n\tcommands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.  His eyes are on\n\tParrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.\n\tA Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.\n\n\t\t\t     WAITER\n\t\tCan I get you anything, sir?\n\n\tJoe regards the Waiter for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tDo you have any peanut butter?\n\n\tThe Waiter hesitates.\n\n\t\t\t     WAITER\n\t\tI don't think so, sir.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tThank you, anyway.\n\n\tThe Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish and\n\tSusan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tOn the dance floor.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tWhat was that?\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tThe fireworks are about to start.\n\n\tParrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN (cont'd)\n\t\t\t(to Parrish)\n\t\tShall we?\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tYou go ahead, honey, I'm going to\n\t\tcatch my breath.\n\n\tSuddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at\n\thim, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she\n\tsmiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the\n\tfireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns\n\tand heads up towards Joe.\n\n\tJoe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tHappy Birthday, Bill.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tThank you.\n\n\tThey watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks.\n\tJoe's gaze lingers.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH (cont'd)\n\t\tDid you say goodbye?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tNot exactly.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI guess you have your reasons.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tNow that we have a moment, would you\n\t\tmind if I expressed my gratitude for\n\t\twhat you did for Susan?\n\n\tJoe waits.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH (cont'd)\n\t\tI never heard her speak of any man\n\t\tas she spoke of you -- It was always\n\t\twhat I wanted for her -- but what\n\t\thappens to her now?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tI wouldn't worry about it, Bill.\n\t\tThese things have a way of working\n\t\tout.\n\n\tJoe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish\n\thas accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:\n\n\t\t\t     JOE (cont'd)\n\t\tAnd would you mind if I expressed my\n\t\tgratitude...?\n\n\tParrish waits.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE (cont'd)\n\t\tFor you.  For the time you've given\n\t\tme.  For the person you are.\n\n\tA moment.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tDon't blow smoke up my ass, you'll\n\t\truin my autopsy.\n\n\tJoe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the\n\tcrowd below, searching.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH (cont'd)\n\t\tIt's hard to let go, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tThat's life.  What can I tell you?\n\n\tA silence, an understanding there is another more to say.\n\tJoe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say \"Shall we?\",\n\tParrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away\n\tfrom the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking\n\tthe river.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tDown below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial\n\tfireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest\n\tisn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over-\n\tpowering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a\n\tdistance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some-\n\tthing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens\n\ther, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the\n\tfireworks.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tUp the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH\n\t\tI'm getting a little dizzy, I can\n\t\tfeel my heart pumping --\n\n\tBut Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on\n\tup the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step\n\twith him.\n\n\t\t\t     PARRISH (cont'd)\n\t\tShould I be afraid?\n\n\tJoe stops, Parrish stops with him.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tNot a man like you.\n\n\tParrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides\n\tout again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue\n\ton and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage\n\tof fireworks lights up the sky.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tDown below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks\n\tup towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates,\n\tnow glides away from the party, her step quickens as she\n\twalks up towards the hill.\n\n\tSusan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from\n\tover the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.\n\tHe is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,\n\tseems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if\n\tpulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he\n\tkeeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tJoe...?\n\n\tHe smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right\n\tin front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so\n\tappealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet\n\tclose.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN (cont'd)\n\t\tYou're here...\n\n\tHe is trying to get his bearings.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\t-- You bet.\n\n\tSomething about him makes Susan slightly tentative.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tWhere did you go?\n\n\tJoe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of\n\ttime and place.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tI don't know -- y'know, I don't know\n\t\t-- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And\n\t\twould y'know what I mean if I said I\n\t\tdon't think it's worth figuring out?\n\n\tSome realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her\n\tlightheaded.\n\n\t\t\t     JOE (cont'd)\n\t\t...But now I'm back.\n\n\tSusan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an\n\tanswer.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\t\t(gently)\n\t\tThat's it?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tWell, I don't know what else to say.\n\t\tIt's a helluva party --\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tYou think so?\n\n\t\t\t     JOE\n\t\tYeah...and you're the prettier\n\t\tthing here.\n\n\tSusan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his\n\tjacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she\n\tregards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling\n\twith the last moments fades away.\n\n\tSusan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,\n\ta sudden intake of breath.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tHey, you all right?\n\n\tHis hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her\n\tsupport.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tThe coffee shop --\n\n\tThe Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tI asked you if I said something\n\t\twrong and you said it was so right\n\t\tit scared you.\n\n\tSusan holds herself very still.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)\n\t\tAnd forgive me for saying this --\n\t\tbut then you said -- and it's been\n\t\twith me ever since --\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tWhat has --?\n\n\tHe hesitates.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tYou said you liked me.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tNo --\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tY'didn't?\n\n\tA moment.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tI said I liked you so much.\n\n\tShe falls silent now, overcome by the last moments'\n\trevelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which\n\tis on the edge of pain.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tHey, everything's going great --\n\t\tdon't y'think?\n\n\tShe doesn't answer for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN (cont'd)\n\t\tDon't you feel that way?\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\t...We know so little about each\n\t\tother.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tBut we've got time.\n\n\tShe searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open,\n\tcompletely vulnerable, waiting for her response.  A long\n\tsilence, the words come out haltingly:\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\tI wish you could've known my\n\t\tfather...\n\n\tAnother moment.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tMe, too.\n\n\tSusan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are\n\tcompletely intent on each other.\n\n\t\t\t     SUSAN\n\t\t...What do we do now?\n\n\tA long silence.\n\n\t\t\t     YOUNG MAN\n\t\tIt will come to us.\n\n\tSusan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes\n\tup from below, the night fills with light.  The Young Man\n\tsearches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together\n\tthey start back towards the party.\n\n\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Joe Black\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Bo Goldman\u00a0\u00a0Ron Osborn\u00a0\u00a0Jeff Reno\u00a0\u00a0Kevin Wade\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Romance\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:30:57.414837"}
