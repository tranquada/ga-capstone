Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,\n          empty save for &amp; YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure\n          hunched over a laptop.\n          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build\n          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a\n          gentle, intelligent demeanor.\n          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his\n          glasses.

Neighborhood\n          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.\n          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first\n          floor marked by unlit neon: \"FLEURS DE SOLANGE.\" He ascends\n          the steps, his keys out --\n\n<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)\n</b>          Jonathan!\n          The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find\n          SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,\n          standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket.\n\n<b>          JONATHAN\n</b>          Solange, you're up so late?\n\n<b>          SOLANGE\n</b>          So early, Jonathan.

JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT\n</b>\n          Very modest. Furnishings are nice, but sparse. Jonathan hangs\n          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers.\n\n<b>          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n          Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster\n          and an old tennis trophy. Jonathan lies in bed, flipping\n          channels on a small TV. Typical late night stuff:\n          infommercials; CNN; a Brazilian soccer match; \"Channel J\"\n          (public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex.\n          Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks\n          back to, the roaring soccer crowd. He closes his eyes and\n          drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer..\n\n<b>          INT.

CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING .\n</b>\n          Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table,\n          rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop,\n          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-\n          its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes\n          us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming\n          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance.\n          Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before\n          him. Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank.\n\n<b>          INT.

He peers down and over, to\n          expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St. Journal spread on\n          the floor. Another KNOCK-KNOCK. Confused, Jonathan turns to\n          address the divider:\n\n<b>          JONATHAN\n</b>          Yes?\n\n<b>          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)\n</b>          Take a look at this.\n          The voice sounds youthful, energetic.

But it wasn't that. See, there\n          was always this boundary - this wall -\n          between Getz and everyone else. You could\n          argue we laid the foundation, but he built\n          it.

He assumed he could\n          never scale the wall, when the truth is he\n          was the only one guarding it. It never\n          occurred to him his anonymity could be an\n          asset. No one gets over like the guy who's\n          just a face, an impression. We are - all\n          of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be.\n\n<b>          JONATHAN\n</b>          So what happened to him?\n\n<b>          WYATT\n</b>          Who, James Getz?
