A beat of silence           -- is\n          broken by its abrupt RING... RING... RING... Move in tighter\n          on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827\n          RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to\n          a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The\n          hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find\n          a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series\n          is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING...\n\n          FADE TO BLACK.\n\n          FADE IN:\n\n          EXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT\n\n          We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over\n          which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys.\n\n          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT\n\n          A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek\n          conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,\n          empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure\n          hunched over a laptop.\n          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build\n          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a\n          gentle, intelligent demeanor.\n          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his\n          glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing.\n\n          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT\n\n          Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty\n          cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures\n          of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of\n          focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors.\n\n          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT\n\n          Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet?\n          The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.\n\n          OLD MAN\n          It is tomorrow.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Right. I forgot.\n          The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh\n          stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous\n          porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him --\n\n          OLD MAN\n          Anything else?\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Uh - no. No that's it, thanks.\n\n          EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT\n\n          Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood\n          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.\n          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first\n          floor marked by unlit neon: \"FLEURS DE SOLANGE.\" He ascends\n          the steps, his keys out --\n\n          WOMAN'S VOICE                                                   (O.S.)\n          Jonathan!\n          The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find\n          SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,\n          standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Solange, you're up so late?\n\n          SOLANGE\n          So early, Jonathan.

JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT\n\n          Very modest. Furnishings are nice, but sparse. Jonathan hangs\n          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers.\n\n          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM\n\n          Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster\n          and an old tennis trophy. Jonathan lies in bed, flipping\n          channels on a small TV. Typical late night stuff:\n          infommercials; CNN; a Brazilian soccer match; \"Channel J\"\n          (public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex.\n          Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks\n          back to, the roaring soccer crowd. He closes his eyes and\n          drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer..\n\n          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING\n\n          TWO CORPORATE LAWYERS are talking shop while pouring coffee.\n\n          JONATHAN                                                         (0.S.)\n          Excuse me.\n          Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely\n          give him a glance as they continue their conversation.\n\n          LAWYER 1\n          So, the Knicks win last night?\n\n          LAWYER 2\n          I'm pretty sure, yeah.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Actually, they lost by 4.\n          Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          It was supposed to be a good game though.\n\n          LAWYER 1\n          Oh.\n          (back to Lawyer 2)\n          Hey, so. did you get a chance to look over\n          that memo from Watkins?\n\n          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN CORRIDORS - MORNING\n\n          Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries his\n          coffee past ASSISTANTS and LAWYERS talking shop. He smiles\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return.\n\n          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING .\n\n          Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table,\n          rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop,\n          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-\n          its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes\n          us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming\n          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance.\n          Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before\n          him. Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank.\n\n          INT. MEN'S WASHROOM -- DAY\n\n          In a stall, Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the\n          stall's marble door -- when a sudden KNOCK-KNOCK on the\n          divider to his right startles him. He peers down and over, to\n          expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St. Journal spread on\n          the floor. Another KNOCK-KNOCK. Confused, Jonathan turns to\n          address the divider:\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Yes?\n\n          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)\n          Take a look at this.\n          The voice sounds youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his\n          Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division.\n\n          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)\n          The Japanese are developing a toilet that\n          can analyze your urine for glucose levels,\n          kidney disease, even cancer. They're\n          referring to it as the \"super bowl.\"\n\n          JONATHAN\n          That certainly is                                               - something.\n\n          MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n          Of course if you've ever been to Japan,\n          you know they're nuts about their toilets.\n          I'm talking web sites, symposiums...\n          Jonathan chuckles.\n\n          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)\n          You think I'm kidding. They have bowls\n          over there that cost more than a piano.\n          What I want to know is how you're supposed\n          to retrieve this analysis - you know, from\n          your super bowl.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Maybe they're developing a fly with a\n          nursing degree.

The sound of\n          zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening.\n\n          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)\n          So you're an accountant?\n          Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Audit manager, yeah.\n\n          MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n          So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires\n          Worth and Berman to give their blessing to\n          our books, and they send you?\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Have laptop, will travel.

He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a\n          day planner, stylus writes \"Clancey\" into next week. Other\n          than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank.\n\n          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Jonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain\n          on the tabletop.

I'm supposed to be out of\n          here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to\n          finish up. What about you?\n\n          WYATT\n          You kidding? This is an early night. Hard\n          to believe that once upona time a man's\n          success was measured by how little he had\n          to work. You know in Sweden the average\n          worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation?\n          (regards his stacked files)\n          Do-you like accounting?\n\n          JONATHAN\n          It's all right, if you enjoy working with\n          numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?\n\n          WYATT\n          It's all right. If you enjoy working with\n          assholes.\n          Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.\n\n          WYATT\n          Well, I'm probably disturbing you -\n\n          JONATHAN\n          No - it's okay.

I was\n          raised by a single mother, and she died\n          when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't\n          so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people\n          have had it worse.\n\n          WYATT\n          Not around here.

MIDTOWN - STREET - LATE NIGHT\n\n          Jonathan hurries in the cold. rain for the Times Square\n          subway. He's just about to descend - when across                7th Avenue\n          he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat,\n          clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street.\n          Jonathan gazes at her, almost gasping. She's surrounded by\n          pedestrians with umbrellas., she's the only one without one\n          and she's DRENCHED. But she seems content to entertain\n          herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the\n          umbrella in front of her.\n          Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the\n          subway below reminds him he'd better move.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          10.\n\n          INT.

Despite her business\n          attire, there's an almost childlike lightness. to her step.\n          Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can\n          make out the first letter of a monogram: \"S.\"\n          She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers\n          waiting, then decides life's too short. She continues past,\n          headed for the turnstiles.\n          Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase,\n          then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow\n          gap in the turnstile.\n          A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement.\n          Glancing up, she catches his eye, and blushes a mischievous\n          smile. Once she's through, she drops her money into his\n          collection - and slips out of view.\n          ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still stuck on line, staring at the space\n          she vacated.\n\n          INT.

Ten\n          yards away. He gazes at her. She's unwrapping some GUM. He\n          watches as she puts a piece in her mouth.\n          The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN. \"S\" heads for it, Jonathan\n          follows...\n          The train halts.

His cell phone hits the floor.\n          Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches\n          to a halt, nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell\n          phone a few feet along the grimy floor.\n          O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs\n          for his phone a second before it's stepped on. He hurriedly\n          stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and\n          paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet -\n          - to find the doors closing, and \"S\" gone.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          12.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          Devastated, he hurries to a window, searching the platform as\n          the train begins to depart...

RUTHERFORD STERN - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING\n\n          Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing Wyatt\n          enter, talking animatedly with Lawyers                          1   and 2. Caught up in\n          telling his joke, Wyatt doesn't seem to notice Jonathan.\n          Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance\n          up. His eyes meet Jonathan's.

MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY\n\n          Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play\n          mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's).\n          Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net\n          Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan\n          and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his\n          brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return.\n\n          SAME SCENE - LATER\n          A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt\n          returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball\n          back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it\n          back. Jonathan returns it with equal force.\n          A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back\n          each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely\n          managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his\n          racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball.\n          Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a\n          near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two\n          inches outside the opposite baseline.\n\n          WYATT\n          Out!\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          14.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air.

Jonathan crashes out on the\n          court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to\n          the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter.\n          The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net.\n\n          WYATT\n          They asked if we'd fancy a post-game\n          cocktail.

As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they\n          pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN                                   (50s) in a fine suit.\n\n          WYATT\n          t                                                               a                       uten Abend, Herr Kleiner.\n          (glances back)\n          This way, Jonathan.\n\n          INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT\n\n          Urban chic to a serious degree. Big terrace, funky furniture,\n          framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive\n          young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image\n          of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.\n\n          WYATT\n          Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner\n          downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he\n          hooked me up with the gallery in Munich.\n          Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,\n          pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are\n          like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by\n          one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair\n          bleached blonde and loosely spiked.\n\n          WYATT (O.S.)\n          Talk about a bad look.\n          Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right\n          behind him,. a slick, expensive SUIT draped over his arm.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          18.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          WYATT\n          Here, try this one.\n          (off Jonathan's hesitation)\n          What?\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off.\n\n          WYATT\n          You hope you can pull it off. You know who\n          you remind me of? James Getz.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Who?\n\n          WYATT\n          A guy I roomed with freshman year at\n          Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when\n          you loosened him up. Only from day one, he\n          just didn't fit in. For starters, he was\n          dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there\n          was always this boundary - this wall -\n          between Getz and everyone else. You could\n          argue we laid the foundation, but he built\n          it. Built it by believing the lie.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          What lie?\n\n          WYATT\n          That he was any different. The clothes,\n          the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all\n          one big masquerade. Anyone can get in,\n          you've just got to wear a costume. But\n          Getz never got that. He assumed he could\n          never scale the wall, when the truth is he\n          was the only one guarding it. It never\n          occurred to him his anonymity could be an\n          asset. No one gets over like the guy who's\n          just a face, an impression. We are - all\n          of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          So what happened to him?\n\n          WYATT\n          Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          (hesitates a beat)\n          You're pulling my dick, aren't you.\n          Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          19.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          WYATT\n          With both hands.\n          Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit.\n\n          CUT TO:\n          CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat.\n          He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders:\n\n          EMCEE\n          And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine,\n          the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you\n          to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour!\n\n          INT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT\n\n          An ultra-elite \"new burlesque\" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s\n          Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female,\n          sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE\n          performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease.\n          Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted\n          with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a\n          small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag\n          films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience.\n\n          WYATT\n          It's a little self-conscious, but I\n          thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's\n          that suit working out?\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Oh - great, actually.\n\n          WYATT\n          Keep it then.

I was flipping through money magazine\n          and saw this small ad in the back. It read\n          something like \"Are. you feeling all alone?\n          Looking to meet women but have forgotten\n          how?\" And-there was this number.\n\n          WYATT\n          And you called it? So what happened?\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Nothing actually. The phone just kept\n          ringing. And that's it.\n          Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Lame enough for you?\n\n          WYATT\n          You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine.\n          That is beyond lame.\n          Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table\n          lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then\n          picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          .Hello?\n          Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE\n          at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          .All right...

He looks over her shoulder to his table,\n          where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone.\n          Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud\n          smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself.\n          The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear...\n\n          BACK TO WYATT AND JONATHAN'S TABLE\n          Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan\n          returning alone, looking deflated.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          She's a hooker.\n          Wyatt shrugs, grinning.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Hold on - you knew?

We remain on the vacant street, hear his\n          FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his\n          cell phone.

Piece by piece.\n          Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to\n          break her long nails.\n          Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration.\n          She turns, looks him up and down - he feels a bit self-\n          conscious in his robe and bare feet.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Would you like some help, ma'am?\n\n          OLD WOMAN\n          I can manage, thank you.\n          Finally, her bucket is full and she goes on her way.\n          .Jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          59.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          Returning down the empty hall, ice bucket in one hand, key\n          card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers.\n          We see Room 518                                                 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on.\n          Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his\n          robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in\n          the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light\n          blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on\n          the door, calls out:\n\n          JONATHAN\n          I can't get the card to work.\n          He tries the card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears\n          something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel:\n          red.\n          He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          Hello?... Hello?\n          He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting\n          anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card\n          again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into\n          the door. Nothing.\n          Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns\n          green.                                                          - A millisecond's surprised hesitation - then he jerks\n          the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into\n\n          THE ROOM\n          He peers up into the small entryway: empty. Ahead of him we\n          glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets.\n          Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath\n          quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket.\n          Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed,\n          splattered all over the crumpled sheets...\n          Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just\n          as he senses something behind him and BANG!                     - something hits\n          him to the back of the head -- he goes down like a sack of\n          potatoes.\n\n          BLACKOUT.\n\n          TWO HOURS LATER\n          THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The ice has melted, a pool of\n          water seeps out... follow the flow to arrive at Jonathan's\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          60.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          fingers... slowly responding to the cold water... The TV\n          playing a different film now.\n          OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on the floor. He groans a little.\n          Rubs the back of his head. Checks his hand for blood.\n          Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet,\n          shaky. He looks around the room. It's EMPTY. No sign of \"S.\"\n          He runs into the bathroom. Also empty.\n          Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING\n          DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED.\n          He looks to where she'd draped her clothes and bag - every\n          trace of her is gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets\n          are still crumpled, only there's no blood an here on them.\n          He runs to the window looks down at the street. It's four in\n          the morning, no one around.\n\n          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY\n\n          Tripping over his own legs, Jonathan runs barefoot down the\n          corridor. He rounds a corner, another stretch of narrow\n          corridor. O.S. we hear the muted DING of an elevator.\n          Jonathan tears off in its direction...\n          He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are\n          located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor\n          indicator overhead: \"4\" slowly creeps to \"3\".\n\n          INT. STAIRWELL\n\n          His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each\n          floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip\n          their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing\n          to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and\n          continues to dash down...\n          BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he\n          lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in\n\n          THE LOBBY\n          His undershirt tugged and misshapen, boxers twisted around\n          his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the lobby, wild-\n          eyed and shaking. It's utterly vacant at this hour, the only\n          sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles' \"Yesterday.\"\n\n          SLAM!

When I came to, she was gone.\n\n          SECURITY 1\n          This woman you were with.

His\n          SCARF is gone too.\n\n          SECURITY 2\n          Maybe she took them.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          What?!\n\n          SECURITY 2\n          It happens.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          She didn't do this, okay?!

He runs to to pick it up: a Chinese Gum Wrapper.\n\n          JONATHAN\n          This                                                        -- this was hers...\n          Jonathan clutches it desperately, the lone trace of her\n          existence. The Guards exchange a look like he's INSANE.\n\n          SECURITY                                                    1\n          Sir - are these your clothes?\n          Jonathan nods absently.\n\n          SECURITY 1\n          How about putting them on.\n\n          INT. LOBBY - LATER\n\n          Jonathan arrives to find DETECTIVE RUSSO                    (female, mid-30s)\n          waiting by reception with a UNIFORMED OFFICER. Seeing\n          Jonathan, she sizes him up a moment, then approaches him.\n\n          RUSSO\n          Mr. Messer, I'm Detective Russo.\n\n          INT.

There was blood all over the\n          goddamn bed!\n          He becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy - when A\n          CELL PHONE RINGS: it's Russo's. She pauses, struck by the\n          genuine desperation in Jonathan's face. She finally picks up.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          64.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          RUSSO\n          Yeah.\n          (glances at Jonathan)\n          No, I don't think it's necessary...

JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT\n\n          Jonathan climbs up to the landing, fishes in the dark for a\n          boot. He tips it, a SPARE KEY falls out. As he starts back\n          down, he feels something in his coat pocket. He reaches in,\n          finds \"Duck On Bike\" where he'd pocketed it.\n\n          INT.

He approaches, peering down at\n          something that's caught his eye...\n          HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a\n          small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy\n          base, the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the\n          exposed area                                                    - as if the trophy had recently been moved.\n          Jonathan swallows tensely, staring at the cryptic dust mark -\n          (SOUND ADVANCE) BANG! of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          65.\n\n          A SPARE BEDROOM\n          Used for storage, including an old, gun-metal grey filing\n          cabinet.

He stuffs\n          it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a folder marked\n          \"CREDIT CARDS.\" Sorting through old statements, he finds the\n          line: \"To report a card lost or stolen...\"\n\n          INT.

He\n          steps back, stares at it a beat - when he notices something\n          on his desk,,resting under the phone: a manila file folder.\n                                                                          He frowns at it - clearly out of place here.

The waiter at\n          the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads.\n          Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a\n          discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a\n          headline: \"STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC.\" The\n          photo is of Simone Forester.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          79.\n\n          INT.

In his eyes a sense of paranoia, a mistrust of\n          every strange face.\n\n          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Isolated behind yet another wall of glass, Jonathan just\n          stares bleary-eyed at his laptop, unable to work.\n\n          EXT. CLUTE NICHOLS BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n          Jonathan exits, starts toward the sidewalk -- but hears\n          something: sandpaper SHUFFLE of shoes on pavement. Be spins     --\n          No one there. Just one of many large stone pillars adorning\n          the building. Jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar,\n          wavering. He steps closer, trying to glimpse behind it -\n          RING! of his cell-phone breaks the stillness. RING... RING...\n          He catches his breath, quickly picks up. A silent beat.\n\n          A WOMAN'S VOICE                                                 (O.S.)\n          Are you free tonight?... Hello?\n          He hangs up, chilled.
