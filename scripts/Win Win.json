He banks\r\n          around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is\r\n          MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard.

Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other\r\n          Wrestler off the mat. The Ref has seen enough. He quickly\r\n          issues Kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the\r\n          match.
