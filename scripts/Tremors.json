DESERT VALLEY - DAY                                   1\n\n               The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land-\n               scape stretching away to distant mountains.  The silence is\n               broken by hoof-beats.\n\n\n         2     EXT.  EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY                                    2\n\n               It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn.  EDGAR\n               DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking\n               his donkey around in circles.\n\n               Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an\n               old, sun-bleached Buick.  It stops and out leans OLD FRED\n               (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora.  The two friends nod.\n\n                                          OLD FRED\n                            How's she doing?\n\n                                          EDGAR\n                            She wants to lay down.  I'm a\n                            little worried.\n\n               Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.\n\n                                          OLD FRED\n                            Well, I brung her something I know\n                            she likes.\n\n                                          EDGAR\n                            Damn, Fred, you can't give away all\n                            those.\n\n                                          OLD FRED\n                            Forget it.  I got vegetables coming\n                            out my ears.  Usually the varmints\n                            eat up half my crop, but lately I\n                            ain't so much as seen a gopher or a\n                            jack-rabbit nowheres.\n\n                                          EDGAR\n                            If that ain't the truth.  And I\n                            count on them for a little bit of\n                            stew meat...Thank you, Fred.\n\n               Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.\n\n                                          EDGAR (cont'd)\n                            Here you go, Justine.  Look what\n                            Fred brought you.\n\n                                          OLD FRED\n                            We playing cards tonight?\n\n                                          EDGAR\n                            I think I'm gonna be sitting up\n                            with her.\n\n                                          OLD FRED\n                            I'd do the same.  Well, catch you\n                            Thursday.\n\n                                          EDGAR\n                            You bet.\n\n               The men nod, and Old Fred drives off.\n\n               CLOSE-UP of the donkey's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads\n               her to the barn.\n\n                                          EDGAR (cont'd)\n                            Let's get you out of the sun for a\n                            spell.\n\n                                          EDGAR (cont'd)\n                            I'll get you some fresh water.\n\n               But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its\n               hooves and braying.  Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an\n               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more\n               and more frantic.\n\n               The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from\n               the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles\n               rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.\n\n                                          EDGAR (cont'd)\n                            ...some kind of earthquake!?\n\n               Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild\n               panic.\n\n                                          EDGAR (cont'd)\n                            Justine, hang on! I'm coming!\n\n               Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.\n\n\n         3     INT.  EDGAR'S BARN - DAY                                     3\n\n               Dust swirls through the air.  But -- the barn in empty.  No\n               donkey.  Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers\n               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.  Then he sees,\n               splattered across the walls -- blood!\n\n                                          EDGAR\n                            What in the name of Jehovah...?\n\n               He raises his arms above the door frame.  When he lowers them\n               he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun.  He races outside, ready to\n               shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see.\n\n\n         4     EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN                                          4\n\n               The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000\n               feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the\n               top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow-\n               boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As\n               we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.\n\n               This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val\n               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He\n               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance\n               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on\n               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to\n               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.\n\n               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to\n               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the\n               door reads: \"V & E -- All Type's of Job's.\"  Indeed, the\n               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every\n               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his\n               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the\n               side of the truck.\n\n                                          VAL\n                                   (softly)\n                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is\n                            your wake-up call.  Please move\n                            your fat ass.\n\n               No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows\n               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He\n               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly\n               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the\n               truck violently.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                            STAMPEDE!  EARL, GET OUT OF THE\n                            WAY!\n\n               The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it.  It tumbles\n               out of the back of the pickup.  While Val laughs uproar-\n               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks\n               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless\n               cows.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            You dumb shit.\n\n               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,\n               drifting from job to job.  He knows why he hasn't accom-\n               plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won\n               wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is\n               advice.\n\n               Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes\n               through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a\n               lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with\n               cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy\n               always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it\n               out,  trading the necessary implements.\n\n               Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on\n               the tailgate.  But it's cold.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            You didn't cook breakfast?\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Did it yesterday.  Franks and\n                            beans.\n\n                                          EARL\n                                   (tries to recall)\n                            No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Hell you did.  Your turn.\n\n               Earl raises his fist.  This is The Challenge, and it instantly\n               triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They\n               solve all disputes using the children's game of \"scissors,\n               rock, paper.\"  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is\n               played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three,\n               Val mimes \"paper\" (open hand.  Earl mimes \"scissors\" (two\n               extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He\n               shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                            Well, when I'm your age I'll\n                            probably forget what I eat, too.\n\n\n         4A    EXT.  DESERT VALLEY - FENCE - DAY                          4A\n\n               Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly\n               endless, barbed wire fence.  A few bored cows watch them.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            How many cows does it take to make\n                            a stampede?  Is it like three or\n                            more?  Is there a minimum speed?\n\n                                          EARL\n                                   (shakes his head)\n                            I was in one.  A bolt of lightning\n                            blew up cottonwood tree.  Three\n                            hundred head going hell-bent for\n                            the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny,\n                            I can  tell you.\n\n               Earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his\n               thick glove.\n\n                                          EARL (cont'd)\n                            Ow!

JEEP TRAIL - DAY                                       5\n\n               Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas-\n               sable trail.  It takes full concentration as he fights the\n               steering wheel, shifts, rides the brake and leans out trying\n               to pick a decent route.  Earl braces his feet on the dash and\n               munches breakfast, a raw hot dog right out of the package.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every\n                            year.\n\n                                          EARL\n                                   (shrugs)\n                            Has a lot of rain.\n\n               Earl pulls a box of Hershey bars from under the seat.

Burt smiles patiently.  Just then\n               the compressor in Pham's ice cream freezer comes on.  It's a\n               loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal.\n\n                                          PHAM VAN\n                            Hey Val, listen.

The idea\n                            was: we were ripping you off.\n\n               Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside.  Burt's out the\n               door in a flash.  The others follow.\n\n\n         13    EXT.

Val and Earl laugh as\n               they climb into their truck.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Why don't his parents ever take him\n                            to Vegas with them?\n\n                                          EARL\n                            You gotta ask that?\n\n\n         14    EXT.  PIT - DAY                                              14\n\n               At one end of town, Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a\n               scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring\n               out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole.  Val sights\n               down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit.  The job\n               is done.  He signals Earl to cut the engine.  Both men have\n               kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with\n               dust.\n\n\n         15    ANGLE - TRUCK TRAILER - DAY                                  15\n\n               Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive, solid\n               steel kind used for heavy rock hauling.  Tires flat, mired in\n               dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years.  Now it\n               provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee.\n\n               NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up, surveying the pit with approval.\n\n                                          NESTOR\n                            It came out great, boys.

Lemme have your bill.\n\n               Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and\n               paper.  Earl comes up with various pieces of paper, Val with\n               three or four pens.  It's a moment before they realize each\n               has the other needed implement.  Earl writes out the bill\n               during:\n\n                                          NESTOR (cont'd)\n                            I'll have to send it to you the\n                            first of the month, boys.\n\n               Val and Earl exchange pained looks.\n\n                                          NESTOR (cont'd)\n                            Now, you know I'm good for it.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Yeah, Nestor, we know.  Don't worry\n                            about it.  Catch us when you can.\n\n               They amble over to their truck.  Earl takes the driver's side\n               -- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                            Are we too easy-going?\n\n                                          EARL\n                            No, we're not too easy-going.  This\n                            area is economically depressed.\n\n               Val realizes he has the key and hands it over.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            So what if we just did it...today.\n                            Pack up.

But we'd have\n                            to get really serious.  It's gonna\n                            cost twice as much to rent a place.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            So?  That car wash pays good, and\n                            they're always looking.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Car wash?!

Go ahead and plan\n                            it...for a year or two.\n\n\n         16    EXT.  VIOLA'S PLACE - DAY                                    16\n\n               CLOSE ON a stencilled sign: PHAM VAN'S U-RENT -- CESSPOOL,\n               SEPTIC TANKS.  PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a\n               portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted).  The aged\n               machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo.  The\n               intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more\n               tape than hose.  Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down\n               through the open top of Viola's cesspool.\n\n               Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill\n               not far from Pham Van's store.  Well-kept flower gardens\n               surround the place.  VIOLA, a sweet little old lady, watches\n               the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny\n               but ferocious dog.  The dog yaps continuously, lunging at\n               Val and Earl.\n\n                                          VIOLA\n                            Stop it!

Not having a plan is\n                            what keeps us doing jobs like this!\n\n               Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump\n               mechanism.  He and Val on stand either side of the intake\n               hose as it gurgles happily.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            What keeps us doing jobs like this\n                            is you dragging your feet.  I was\n                            up for going to Bixby.  I was\n                            getting excited.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            In the past year I must've said a\n                            hundred times \"We gotta get out of\n                            Perfection.

They react as if they'd been\n               shot; gagging, staggering, screaming obscenities.\n\n\n         17    EXT.   VAL AND EARL'S TRAILER - DAY                          17\n\n               Val and Earl's beat-up mobile home is just down the street\n               from Pham Van's store.  Val and Earl, now in cleaner clothes,\n               march out resolutely.  Val has a portable TV in one hand and\n               a framed COORS beer sign in the other.  Earl unhooks the\n               clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of\n               their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings.\n\n               They stare at each other for a moment.  This is it.  No going\n               back.  They leap into the truck.  As they drive off, Val leans\n               out and yanks their wooden nameplate (\"E. Basset -- V. McKee\")\n               off the mailbox.\n\n\n         18    EXT.

The guys pull their\n               hats low over their faces.  Earl swerves to the far side of\n               the street.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Uh oh, it's Nancy.

As he gets\n               nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of Edgar's\n               shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off.. Edgar is\n               strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his\n               hands.

PULL OUT to\n               see we're back at Old Fred's.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            What are you doing?\n\n               Earl is staring wide-eyed.  Val follows Earl's gaze and is\n               aghast when he sees --\n\n               The sheep pen -- it's a ghastly, bloody mess.  Scattered on\n               the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads\n               are all that remain of the flock.\n\n                                          VAL\n                                   (whispers)\n                            What the hell...?\n\n               Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Hey, Old Fred!  Fred!  Where are\n                            you?!\n\n               Earl dashes into Fred's house.  Val checks around outside.\n               Earl comes back out.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Not here.\n\n               Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden --\n               Old Fred's hat.\n\n               Still looking all around, Val squats distractedly to pick up\n               the hat.  He and Earl stumble backward in shock.\n\n               OLD FRED IS STILL WEARING HIS HAT!!  His mangled face stares\n               up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Oh, Jesus!!\n\n                                          VAL\n                            What the hell is going on?

Val and Earl drive up.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            You guys better get the hell outta\n                            here!

A real psycho.\n                            He's cutting people's heads off!\n                            I'm serious!  I'd high-tail for\n                            town if I was you!\n\n               Val and Earl speed away.\n\n                                          CARMINE\n                            They're drunk.\n\n                                          HOWARD\n                            Yeah...\n\n               But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel\n               pry-bar to keep within easy reach.\n\n               Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the\n               jackhammer.  Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the\n               road, something soft.  We hear a strange, unearthly shriek\n               from underground.  A weird orange goo gushes up around the\n               blade.  Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a\n               harpoon stuck in a whale!  Carmine gets tangled in the jack-\n               hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.\n\n               Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-\n               brush.  He hears Carmine screaming.\n\n                                          HOWARD\n                            Carmine!  What the hell is it?!\n                            Where are you?\n\n               But now there is only silence.  Howard crashes through the\n               brush.  All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which\n               suddenly sucks down into the ground.  He's momentarily\n               staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep\n               looking.  He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground.  Then\n               something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots\n               out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny\n               strength!  Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.\n\n               He clambers back onto the road.  But almost immediately\n               cracks form in the pavement around him.  More beak-things\n               break through the asphalt between him and his truck.\n\n               He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment.  He\n               clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd\n               they go?  Suddenly the dirt around him begins to \"bubble.\"\n               Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him\n               head first into the embankment.  Then the embankment gives\n               way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby\n               telephone pole and snapping the lines.\n\n\n         34    INT.

Ahead: the\n               collapsed embankment completely blocks the road.  It's\n               totally impassable.  The cowboys are dumbfounded.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Is some higher force at work, here?\n                            Are we asking too much of life?\n\n               But Val is in no mood for philosophy.  He leaps out and peers\n               into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed,\n               emergency lights still flashing.  There's nobody in it.  He\n               starts looking around.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Those assholes are supposed to be\n                            fixing the goddamn road!\n                                   (shouts)\n                            Hey!

Val!\n\n               Val looks where he's pointing -- Howard's bloodstained\n               hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide.  Val gets the\n               point.  Looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases\n               back into the truck.  Earl already has a pistol in his lap\n               and is digging through the glove compartment.\n\n                                          EARL (cont'd)\n                            Where are the bullets?

But as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange\n               grating clunk from underneath.  When he tries to pull\n               forward, the truck won't move.  The engine stalls.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Jesus!

The floodlight flickers.  Now the generator dies.\n               Darkness engulfs them.  The car radio music drones on\n               incongruously.\n\n                                          JIM (cont'd)\n                            Damn that thing!\n\n                                          MEGAN\n                                   (sarcastic)\n                            We could always buy a new\n                            generator.\n\n               Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the\n               generator.  Megan lies back, taking a welcome breather.\n               After a moment:\n\n                                          MEGAN\n                            Well, what's wrong with it?\n\n                                          JIM (V.O.)\n                            It's...gone...!\n\n\n         44    ANGLE - JIM                                                  44\n\n               Baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight.  Megan\n               joins him.\n\n                                          MEGAN\n                            You sure this is where it was?\n\n                                          JIM\n                            Am I sure?!\n                                   (points with flashlight)\n                            It was right there.  There's the\n                            cord.\n\n               The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped\n               depression in the dirt where the generator sat.  He hands her\n               the flashlight and kneels.  We watch tensely as he probes the\n               loose earth with his hands.\n\n                                          JIM (cont'd)\n                            Maybe the ground caved in.  There's\n                            a lot of old mines and stuff around\n                            here.\n\n               Megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back.\n\n                                          MEGAN\n                            Well don't then!  You don't want to\n                            fall in.\n\n               Suddenly, about ten feet away -- WHOOMP!!  The generator\n               shoots up out of the ground!  Jim and Megan dive for cover as\n               it sails through the air, and crashes to earth.  They stare,\n               transfixed.  The generator is dented and bent almost beyond\n               recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.\n\n                                          JIM\n                            What the...?\n\n               But Megan is all action.  She yanks him back.\n\n                                          MEGAN\n                            Come on.  Get away from it!\n\n                                          JIM\n                            God, what a stink!\n\n               We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound.  Jim stops,\n               sweeping the flashlight around them.\n\n                                          JIM (cont'd)\n                            Hear that?\n\n                                          MEGAN\n                            Never mind!  Let's go!  Let's just\n                            go into town or something!  Jim,\n                            please!\n\n               She hustles him bodily toward the car during:\n\n                                          JIM\n                            You know, I bet it's geological or\n                            something, like natural gas, or a\n                            geyser.  They stink like that.\n                            Remember in Yellowstone...?\n\n               Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!  Megan is thrown\n               off balance and tumbles to one side.  The flashlight falls,\n               lighting them at an eerie low angle.\n\n                                          JIM (cont'd)\n                            Something's got me!!\n\n               We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth.  He SCREAMS\n               in excruciating agony.\n\n                                          JIM (cont'd)\n                            Oh, God!  Get me Out!!  GET ME OUT!!\n\n               He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down!  Megan\n               slides a 2X4 over to Jim.  He grabs it like a drowning man,\n               trying to keep himself from being pulled down.  But he's\n               pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!\n\n               His head is going under.  Megan desperately tries to dig the\n               smothering earth away, but she's losing.  Now only his arms\n               are above ground.  She pulls with all her might, but he sinks\n               inexorably down, down.  She's pulled flat on the ground.\n               He's gone.\n\n               The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the\n               earth, missing Megan's face by inches.  She scrambles back\n               frantically.\n\n\n         45    ANGLE - STATION WAGON                                        45\n\n               LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as\n               she dives in through the open tailgate.  She slams it after\n               her.  The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.\n\n               Megan tumbles into the front seat.  Thank God the keys are in\n               the ignition.  She starts the engine.  But outside the \"snake\n               things\" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.  A rear\n               tire is totally shredded just as:\n\n               Megan floors it.  The car lurches forward but the mutilated\n               tire falls apart.  The wheel rim digs into the loose earth\n               and the car is stuck.  With no other recourse, Megan locks\n               the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of\n               the car, panting, sobbing.  The radio is still playing a\n               happy cowboy tune.  She peeks out.  They gave up?  She's\n               safe?  Nothing happens for a moment, then --\n\n               The car starts to shake and shudder!  Dust wells up around the\n               windows.\n\n               Outside we see a bizarre sight.  The earth around the rear of\n               the car is \"boiling,\" dirt flying in all directions -- and\n               the car starts to sink into the ground!!\n\n               Megan wildly honks the horn!  The car looks just like a ship\n               going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully.  The\n               back windows shatter, dirt pouring in!  Megan smashes the\n               windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out\n               on the hood.  But there's no hope.  The car keeps sinking,\n               titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a\n               precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.\n\n               Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the\n               same hopeless phrases:\n\n                                          MEGAN\n                            Stop it!  Stop it!  Somebody stop it...!\n\n\n         46    EXT.  DESERT - JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - VERY WIDE - NIGHT     46\n\n               The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams\n               skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky.  The\n               sound of the radio becomes muffled.  The headlights sink from\n               view -- and then Megan's scream floats across the desert.\n\n\n         47    EXT.  PHAM VAN'S STORE - DAWN                                47\n\n               Out front of Pham Van's, nervous Val and Earl saddle up the\n               horses while Pham loads their saddle bags with food.  Every-\n               one has gathered to see them off.  There's an air of tension.\n\n                                          VAL\n                                   (eyeing the horses)\n                            Pham, we don't want to be stuck on\n                            a couple of canners.

For all you know they\n                            could fly.\n\n               Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered\n               Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            You want the rifle or the Smith?\n\n                                          VAL\n                                   (definite)\n                            The rifle.\n\n               So does Earl.  He raises his hand.  They swiftly do a round\n               of scissors-rock-paper.  Earl loses.  He hands Val the rifle.\n               Just then, Burt and Heather pull up in their Blazer, climbing\n               out with their hunting rifles.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            You guys all set?\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Ready as we'll ever be.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Heather and I are going to drive\n                            around a little, see if we can find\n                            that college girl and tell her to\n                            get her ass back into town.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Good idea.

Suddenly there's a blood-curdling SCREAM!  The\n               door to Pham Van's flies open.  Out staggers Melvin, wrapped\n               in Pham Van's hook-tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.\n\n                                          MELVIN\n                            IT'S GOT ME!

Then everyone realizes it's a\n               sick joke.  Melvin collapses with laughter.  Burt is livid.\n               He almost shot Melvin.  He charges over and yanks the kid to\n               his feet, screaming:\n\n                                          BURT\n                            You stupid punk!

As people\n               calm down, Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert\n               before them.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Well...you fellas watch yourselves.\n\n                                          NANCY\n                            Come back with the Sheriff.\n\n                                          NESTOR\n                            Sheriff, like hell.

Constantly looking all around.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            You know, we can't possibly make\n                            Bixby by nightfall.\n\n               Val doesn't want to hear it.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            That means we're gonna be out here,\n                            like, in the dark.\n\n                                          VAL\n                                   (resentfully)\n                            Great.

JIM AND MEGAN'S HOUSE - DAY                            49\n\n               Val knocks on the door to the mobile home.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Hey, doctor, anybody here?\n\n               No answer.  He opens the door and peers inside.  Behind him\n               Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs.  Nobody\n               around.  Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows.\n               Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.\n\n                                          VAL\n                                   (spooked)\n                            Oh, man, I hate this shit.\n\n               They walk briskly to their horses.  Earl snatches Heather's\n               rifle from its saddle scabbard.  Val pulls out the\n               Winchester.  Earl tries to reassure himself.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Car's gone.

The ground here is all\n               torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from\n               underneath!  What the hell is going on?\n\n               Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the\n               headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, glaring\n               up at him.  He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt,\n               revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood -\n               soaked dirt which sticks to his hand.  He leaps away,\n               frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                            Oh, man...oh, man...\n\n\n         50    EXT.  DESERT - CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                          50\n\n               Val and Earl are riding at full gallop.  They race alongside\n               a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a\n               barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.\n\n\n         51    EXT.  DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY                       51\n\n               They ride along the fence during:\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Here's the plan...We don't even\n                            stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we\n                            keep right on going.  We'll walk\n                            the horses.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            That is the plan...I mean, goddamn\n                            it!  What the hell are those\n                            things?  How could they bury an\n                            entire Plymouth station wagon?\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Why would they do it?\n\n               Suddenly the horses stop short.  In a frenzy they wheel\n               around, rear up, refusing to go on.  The cowboys fight to\n               control them.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            I knew it!  Pham Van wouldn't know\n                            a decent horse if...!\n\n               But Earl's already drawing his rifle.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Shut up!  They got wind of\n                            something they don't like!\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Oh shit!\n\n               He draws his rifle.  They look wildly in all directions at\n               once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                            But I don't see anything!\n\n               They keep staring.  The horses keep pacing nervously.  Then\n               -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls!  Earl goes flying.\n               Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's\n               bruised and winded but basically unhurt.  They think Earl's\n               horse just tripped.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                            Hey, you okay?

Several \"snake things\" have engulfed the\n               horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping.  Val's horse goes\n               berserk and gallops for the horizon.\n\n                                          EARL (cont'd)\n                            What in the name...?\n\n                                          VAL\n                            That's how they get you!  They're\n                            under the goddamn ground!\n\n               Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could\n               come up under them!!  The cowboys scramble frantically away.\n               But nothing pursues them.  They pause, glancing back\n               nervously.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            What the hell are they?\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Sons of bitches!\n\n               Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one\n               of them.  Orange goo spurts out.  We hear a deafening shriek\n               as all the \"snake things\" instantly zip back underground.\n\n               Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!!\n               The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle.  They\n               roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                                   (gasps)\n                            There must be a million of them!!\n\n               The mound of earth turns toward them.  The ground splits open\n               and out rises -- a huge head!\n\n                                          EARL\n                                   (awestruck)\n                            Nope...just one.\n\n               The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine!\n               Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney\n               plates which close together to form a cork-screw point.\n\n               The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless\n               terror.  The creature slides toward them, pushing through the\n               earth like a whale through water.  Now it opens its mouth --\n               but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open\n               like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice!\n               And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue!\n               These are the \"snake things,\" not snakes at all but actually\n               the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag\n               their prey!\n\n               The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust,\n               sounding like a horrendous pig.  It sinks into the earth and\n               charges!  We see the hump of earth move toward them faster\n               and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper.\n\n               Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence.  The\n               creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below.\n               All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle.\n\n               The cowboys keep running.  The creature regroups and charges\n               after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird\n               sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost\n               musical twanging sounds.  Val looks back.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            It's gaining on us!!\n\n               And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble\n               ahead.\n\n\n         52    EXT.   CONCRETE DITCH - DAY                                  52\n\n               The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight\n               foot wide gap yawning dead ahead.  The creature churns like\n               a locomotive from behind.  They'll have to try to jump!  They\n               strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            We can do it, we can do it!\n\n               They leap and -- they don't do it!!  They smack into the\n               opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip,\n               only to tumble to its sloping bottom.  A split second later\n               the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the\n               foot-thick concrete wall!  The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT!  A\n               hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks!  Terrified\n               Val and Earl scramble away.  But the wall holds together.\n\n               And the, strangely, all is quiet.  The tentacle lays dead\n               still.  Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a\n               little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Stupid son of a bitch...knocked\n                            itself cold.\n\n               And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the\n               concrete.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Cold, my ass!

They whirl to see Rhonda, up\n               on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them.\n               She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small\n               folding shovel.\n\n                                          RHONDA\n                            Hi, guys, how're you doing?

The\n                            century?  Forget it.  History.\n\n               We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts:\n\n                                          VAL (V.O.)\n                            I got it!  Here's the other end!\n                            Just look at what we caught here!\n\n               Earl and Rhonda climb up.  CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the\n               whole animal!  Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel,\n               is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's\n               tail.  The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is\n               partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief.\n\n                                          EARL\n                                   (hushed)\n                            This is one big mother!\n\n                                          VAL\n                            So this is the guy that had your\n                            seismos working overtime?\n\n               She nods, stepping down to study the creature.  The body is\n               stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at\n               its thickest.  It's covered with hundreds of short, rear-\n               pointing, retractable spikes.  Rhonda gingerly jiggles one.\n               It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.\n\n                                          RHONDA (cont'd)\n                            It must push itself along with\n                            these.  Hundreds of them pushing at\n                            once.  That's how it can move so\n                            fast.  I mean this thing was\n                            tripping sensors all over the\n                            valley.  No wonder I couldn't...\n\n               A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence.  She springs\n               down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out\n               her seismograph printouts.  She studies them frantically\n               during:\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of\n                            anything like this before?\n\n                                          VAL\n                                   (elbows Earl)\n                            Sure, Earl, everybody knows about\n                            them.

The trio jogs toward the hill.\n\n\n         54    EXT.

Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee-\n               deep into the ground!  He screams.  Val wheels and bodily\n               yanks him up.  They back away from the small hole in the\n               ground, calming a little as they realize:\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Prairie dog burrow...\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Little sons of bitches.\n\n               Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft\n               scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper\n               cylinder.

Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up\n               onto the rock and stand there tensely.\n\n               In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the\n               base of the rock.  The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither\n               out, searching the rock base.  Shuddering, the humans move as\n               high as they can, well out of reach.

Then\n               she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly\n               over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away.  The\n               creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late\n               -- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears\n               into the ground.

She frantically starts the truck,\n               dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist.\n\n               As the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the\n               the muffler.  The engine thunders like a tank.  Val and Earl\n               sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see\n               Rhonda is driving upside down and blind.\n\n\n         62    EXT.

Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda\n               has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up\n               short and slams face down in a cloud of dust!\n\n               She can't get up!!  Something's got her!  She's caught in an\n               old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in\n               the weeds.  Some strands have come loose and are curled up\n               like vicious concertina wire.\n\n               Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in\n               under her!  She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles\n               snake up, missing her by inches!  She keeps rolling-crawling-\n               scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but\n               gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire.  She\n               freezes.  The creature feels around where she was.\n\n               She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working\n               tensely to free herself but --\n\n               The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence.  Like a spider\n               sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's\n               on to something.  Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare\n               three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out,\n               swallowing that three feet in a big \"gulp\" and yanking Rhonda\n               violently toward it!  She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed\n               and bleeding!  GULP!  She's dragged even closer.\n\n\n         79    EXT.  MAIN STREET - THE PICK-UP - DAY                        79\n\n               The truck shakes and shimmies as Val's creature tries to pull\n               it down.  Val sees that Rhonda's in trouble.  He searches\n               frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a CHAIN SAW!  He\n               leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground\n               running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord.\n\n\n         80    EXT.

The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her\n               within inches of a probing hook-tentacle!  Suddenly we hear a\n               nasty ROAR as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm-\n               ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere!  The creature\n               unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles\n               recoil.  The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake.\n\n               Val yanks off Rhonda's boots.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Come on!

Val\n               grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the\n               hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp.  It\n               slams to the ground, motor dying.  The monster readies itself\n               for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in.  Val grabs her under\n               the arms and pulls.  Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her\n               wire enmeshed pants.\n\n               The creature lunges!  Rhonda pulls free!  She and Val tumble\n               backward.  The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans.\n\n               The next instant the second creature explodes up through the\n               ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda!  They roll\n               sideways, come up running, and sprint for Pham Van's along an\n               old wooden sidewalk.\n\n\n         81    EXT.

There is a long silence.\n\n               Then suddenly -- ROAR!  The silence is shattered as Pham\n               Van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Jesus!  Shut it off!\n\n               Pham runs to the freezer.  Its on/off switch is buried behind\n               stacks of soft-drink cases.  He tears at them like a madman,\n               toppling them this way and that.  Earl and Val join him.\n\n               But right behind Pham, the floor BUCKLES UP, a monster's\n               snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs!  The\n               creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging\n               screaming Pham with it.  Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab\n               Pham's arms but are no match for the monster.  It shakes and\n               spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them\n               off, relentlessly pulling Pham down.\n\n               The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through!\n               As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward.\n               Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones\n               snap, ribs crack.  The others grab him again but are utterly\n               helpless.  With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks\n               his man mangled body down.  The last thing we see is his foot,\n               now folded back past his head, and he's gone.\n\n               Val is wild with helpless anger.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Son of a bitch!

Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the\n               store, knocking groceries everywhere.  Val and Miguel climb up\n               shelves which cover the rear wall of the store.\n\n               The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down\n               from the ceiling.  Flailing tentacles are everywhere,\n               slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air!\n\n               Val spots a hatch in the ceiling.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Everybody!

Val and Miguel\n               slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the\n               shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch.  Val pounds on\n               it frantically.\n\n               In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf,\n               trying to get closer to where Val is.  Soon she reaches the\n               last one, balancing precariously.  But a creature tips over\n               the first one!  The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing\n               toward Rhonda.  She is half catapulted, half jumps right\n               through an open window, ripping through the screen.\n\n               Val sees what's happened.

BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                101\n\n               Hearing that warning, Burt and Heather go into a well-honed\n               drill.  They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at\n               basement windows.  Burt scans with the binoculars.  He sees\n               nothing.  He glances at Heather.  She shrugs.  Nobody coming.\n\n                                          BURT\n                                   (into CB)\n                            We don't see anything, Val.

How do you explain these things?\n\n                                          VAL (V.O.)\n                            They're coming underground!

Now get the hell\n                            out!  Hurry!\n\n               Burt and Heather exchange looks.  Has Val gone nuts?  Then\n               they hear a low RUMBLE, growing louder and louder.  Tools\n               hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative\n               cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway --\n               and then -- everything stops.  Dead silence, except for the\n               humming of the case cleaner.\n\n               THEN THE WALL MOVES!!  The wood paneling bulges slightly.\n               Nails pop out.  The wall is pushed again; the paneling\n               cracks.  A cow skull falls.  Burt and Heather level their\n               rifles and --\n\n               A huge creature pushes right through the wall!  Fully half\n               its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the\n               room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles\n               lashing out.\n\n\n         102   EXT.

The men stare numbly.  Then, drifting\n               across the desert, a soft popping sound.  The men perk up;\n               they know what it is -- distant gunfire.\n\n\n         103   INT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                103\n\n               The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away.\n               Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature\n               pulls back a little.  The couple keeps firing until magazines\n               are empty.  The creature lunges forward again.\n\n               PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we\n               haven't seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand\n               guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns,\n               military guns, elephant guns.\n\n               Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines,\n               bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire!  A hook-tentacle\n               snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet.  Burt pumps\n               out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun,\n               severing the tentacle.  Heather is on her feet in an instant.\n               She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full\n               one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again.  Burt\n               grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her.  They lay down\n               massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and\n               smoke.  Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the\n               room.\n\n               The guns are empty.  THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING!  They back\n               down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after\n               another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun\n               which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth.\n               Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING\n               TOWARD THEM!\n\n               Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something\n               between them and it.  Burt smashes open a fancy glass case\n               holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun.  He slams in two\n               gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter.  He fires.\n               The concussion literally shakes the building.  The recoil\n               slams Burt back against the wall.\n\n               The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster.  Great\n               gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or\n               something.  The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses,\n               deflating like a beached whale.  Burt and Heather stagger\n               together and hug each other fervently.  They stare dumbfounded\n               at the massive dead horror.  Burt suddenly shouts vehemently:\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Broke into the wrong goddamn rec\n                            room, didn't you, you BASTARD!\n\n\n         104   EXT.

Water spills\n               over the top edge of the tank, drenching Rhonda.\n\n\n         147   EXT.  BULLDOZER - DAY                                        147\n\n               Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to\n               jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer.   Now he scrambles\n               back into the driver's seat.  He guns the engine, wrenching\n               the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds.\n               Ancient tires disintegrate.  Rusted wheels screech and\n               complain -- but it moves.  Val lets out a whoop and heads\n               full-tilt for town.  He's suddenly shocked as he sees:\n\n\n         148   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      148\n\n               Rhonda's in big trouble.  She scrambles to the high side of\n               the tower platform.  The tower's going to tip over at any\n               moment!  It's roof slides off and crashes into the street!\n\n               On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp\n               cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to\n               distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise\n               from the water.\n\n               In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed --\n               an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour.\n\n               The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose,\n               sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it.\n               She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank\n               splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal\n               wave down the street.\n\n               The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five\n               degrees.  The bulldozer grinds closer and closer.  Rhonda\n               tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the\n               tower keeps her dangling precariously.  Suddenly she falls!\n\n               And lands in the dirt.  The creatures zero in on her!  She\n               turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching\n               bulldozer.  The blade is only inches off the ground but Val\n               swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just\n               above the grasping tentacles!\n\n\n         149   EXT.  PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY                         149\n\n               As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer\n               over to Pham Van's and stops.  Almost as soon as he does,\n               creatures attack, a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides\n               of the massive earth-moving machine, slithering into the\n               treads.  Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and\n               Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective\n               steel belly of the semi trailer.\n\n               Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer\n               roaring forward.  It effortlessly tears loose from the\n               tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads.  The creature\n               shrieks in pain.  The humans cheer!  At last they've got the\n               upper hand!\n\n\n         150   EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     150\n\n               Melvin dances merrily, and noisily, on the metal rooftop.\n\n                                          MELVIN\n                            Way to go!  Dumb fucking worms!\n                            Now haul ass over here, man!  Me\n                            next!  Get me off of here...!\n\n               The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature\n               roars up inside.  The walls buckle out.  The whole structure\n               sags.  Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof.\n\n                                          MELVIN\n                            Oh shit!  Oh, God!  Help!\n\n               As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the\n               walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a\n               pancake.  Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps\n               screaming.  Val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread,\n               and reaches out to Melvin.  But just as they join hands, the\n               creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several\n               feet.  Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin\n               on the roof!\n\n               The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the\n               corrugated metal is both light and resilient.  It bends, but\n               the frustrated monster can't get enough \"bite\" to tear\n               through it.  Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof,\n               trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a\n               bronco.\n\n               Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads\n               after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring.\n\n               Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just\n               before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like\n               some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature!\n               Val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear-\n               crazed Melvin from tumbling off.\n\n\n         151   EXT.  DIRT DITCH - DAY                                       151\n\n               The roof zigs and zags, spins and twists.  Melvin and Val\n               won't be shaken loose.  Earl does his best to head it off,\n               but it's hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next.\n\n               The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage\n               ditch, then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the\n               edge.  Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom.  As they jump to\n               their feet:\n\n                                          VAL\n                            We got about three seconds!\n\n               Val sees, almost right above them, an exposed pipe which\n               spans the ditch.  He shoves Melvin toward it.  They leap up\n               and grab the pipe, pulling their legs up as high as they can.\n               An instant later, the creature blasts through one wall of the\n               ditch, roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite\n               wall!\n\n               Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Well, come on!\n\n\n         152   EXT.   NANCY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   152\n\n               Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof.  The upraised\n               scoop blade of the bulldozer comes INTO SHOT with Val riding\n               it.  He helps them step across into it.\n\n\n         153   EXT.  BURT & HEATHER'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY                    153\n\n               Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical\n               pipe to which his TV antenna was anchored.  Heather works\n               with the sections Burt has already cut off.  She is filling\n               them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering\n               the ends shut -- they're making bombs.\n\n               Then they hear rumbling.  What is it, more creatures?  They're\n               surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption\n               approaching.\n\n                                          BURT\n                                   (impressed)\n                            God damn!  Armored transport!\n\n               Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even\n               with Heather and Burt.  A creature occasionally slams into the\n               underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them\n               slightly, throwing up clouds of dust.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Let's go you two.  We're headed for\n                            the mountains.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            In a minute.\n\n               He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse.  He cuts off a\n               length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs\n               during:\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Come on, Burt, we can't hold still\n                            long.  They're damn smart and\n                            getting smarter by the minute.\n\n               Burt hefts the finished bomb.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            That's fine.  We've got some new\n                            things to teach them.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Damn it!  They'll sink this rig\n                            just like a boat!\n\n               Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures\n               digging dirt away beneath it.  Earl guns it forward out of\n               the depression they're making.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            See that?  They're doing it now!\n                            They try it every time we hold\n                            still.\n\n               Burt and Heather are impressed.  They rush around the\n               rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs,\n               handing them to impatient Val who hands them down to people\n               in the semi trailer during:\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Jesus Christ, we're only going nine\n                            miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Yeah, well those things are gonna\n                            be on our ass every foot of the\n                            way, right?\n\n               He holds up to rifles to Heather, the HK91 assault rifle and\n               another elephant gun.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            What do you think?  Max firepower\n                            or...?\n\n                                          HEATHER\n                            I'd go for penetration.  The 458\n                            shooting solids -- less ammo to\n                            carry anyway.\n\n               Burt nods.  Everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts:\n\n                                          TOWNSFOLK\n                                   (adlib)\n                            Come on!\n                            Who cares!\n                            Forget it!\n                            Let's go!\n\n               Dust flies up.  The bulldozer tilts.  Earl guns it forward\n               again.  Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down\n               into the semi trailer.\n\n                                          MELVIN\n                            Give me a gun!

Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Food for five years.

Val, Earl and\n               Rhonda are in the cab.\n\n\n         155   EXT.

We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle,\n               resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing\n               the mountains ahead.\n\n\n         156   EXT.

Earl calls back to the people in\n               the semi trailer.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Any sign of'em?\n\n                                          MIGUEL\n                            Maybe they just gave up, you know.\n\n                                          MELVIN\n                            Yeah, the bulldozer's too much for\n                            them, man.\n\n               As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            There we go, solid rock!\n\n               Everyone cheers.

Dirt is flying by the\n               ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground.  A huge\n               mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high.  The\n               creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why?\n\n\n         160   EXT.  DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY                               160\n\n               We watch the bulldozer rumbling along.  It seems unstop-\n               able.  The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --\n\n               when the EARTH CAVES IN!!  THE BULLDOZER PLUNGES NOSE FIRST\n               INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE!\n\n               The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle.  The semi\n               trailer is right on the edge of the pit.  Everyone is shaken,\n               bruised, bloodied.  Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for\n               Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop.  They're\n               relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit.  Val hauls\n               him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer.\n               As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            They...they dug a trap!  I can't\n                            believe this!\n\n               The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies.  There is a\n               moment's crushing silence.\n\n               Then the dreaded digging begins.  Dust boils up around the\n               semi trailer -- creatures digging from below!  The semi\n               trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking.  The people\n               huddle together in sheer panic.  Val and Earl grab the\n               nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope-\n               lessly, down at the dirt.  Ricochets whine into the distance.\n\n               Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his\n               pipe bombs.  He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the\n               fuse, looking for a target.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Hungry?!  Eat this!!\n\n               He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into\n               the semi trailer.\n\n                                          BURT (cont'd)\n                            Keep your heads down!\n\n               KABOOM!  The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and\n               rocks.  We hear a new, very strange sound of pain from the\n               creatures.  The semi trailer instantly stops shaking.  The\n               creatures have stopped digging.  All is quiet.\n\n               The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking\n               all around.

We'd need fifty of those\n                            things.\n\n               The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl,\n               and Rhonda.  After a moment:\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Well...that's it.

That's what they do.\n\n               As this sinks in, Burt loses his cool, igniting an argument.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            What?  Well, for chrissake, we\n                            could have made a stand at our\n                            place!

Everyone sits glumly.\n               Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:\n\n                                          BURT\n                                   (losing it)\n                            If it comes to starvation, I know\n                            what I'm doing.

DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          167\n\n               In the open desert, a rock lands.  Then another.  Val and\n               Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop.\n\n               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main\n               group to another section of the rock outcrop where\n               intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion.\n\n               Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's\n               knapsacks.  Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way\n               behind a ledge.  Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing\n               rocks.  Soon, the ground shifts.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            There!  Right straight out in front\n                            of you.\n\n               Burt has his coil of fuse.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            How much you think?\n\n                                          EARL\n                            I don't know...  They're pretty\n                            quick...fifteen seconds?\n\n               Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and\n               snipping it off.  As he stuffs it into the bomb:\n\n                                          EARL\n                            What the hell is that, anyway?\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Cannon fuse.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            What do you use it for?\n\n                                          BURT\n                                   (matter of fact)\n                            My cannon.\n\n               The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth.  Earl digs in his\n               pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it.  Val nervously\n               leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how\n               Earl is holding the rope.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Come on, you're not going to do\n                            your lasso thing...?\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Hey, just 'cause you're no good\n                            with a rope...\n\n               Val shakes his head and lights the fuse.  Earl whirls the\n               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out\n               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along\n               the ground like a fishing lure.  Rhonda stares at her watch\n               as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.\n\n                                          RHONDA\n                            Come on...come on...\n\n                                          BURT\n                            Take it...take the bait...\n\n               Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.  A\n               tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM!  Bullseye!  It's a\n               volcano of gory creature parts.  They splatter all over!  The\n               remaining creatures shriek and race away again.  The people\n               cheer wildly.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n\n         168   EXT.  DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER                          168\n\n               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt prepare to try again.  This time\n               Val has the rope and a new bomb.  Rhonda stands by him, ready\n               with the lighter.  Earl lobs rocks out into the desert.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Where the hell are they?  Hope they\n                            didn't wise up.\n\n                                          RHONDA\n                                   (pointing)\n                            Nope, there!  That's one.\n\n               Rhonda shakily lights the fuse.  Val heaves the bomb out and\n               starts trolling.  The creature swallows it.  Everyone drops\n               down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second\n               bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature\n               suddenly spits its bomb back out!  It sails back right over\n               their heads.  It strikes the rocks above them, skittering\n               down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!\n\n               Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter.  Burt dives backward over a\n               rock ledge.\n\n               BABABAMMM!!  All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every-\n               where.  The creatures streak away.  Val, Earl and Rhonda\n               sprawl into the dirt, half stunned.\n\n               When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are --\n               fifty yards out in open desert!  So is Rhonda, off at an\n               angle from them!  Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.\n\n               And the creatures are coming back fast!\n\n               The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the\n               creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's\n               path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off!  The creatures\n               roar toward their easy prey!\n\n               Val and Earl freeze.  The ground bulges as the creatures\n               \"skid\" to a halt not ten feet from them.  Rhonda stands stock\n               still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.\n\n               Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather\n               sizes up the situation.\n\n                                          HEATHER\n                            Make noise.  Everybody!  COME ON!\n\n               Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and\n               clapping.  Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks,\n               firing a pistol into the dirt.\n\n                                          BURT\n                            COME ON, YOU SLIMEBAGS!  OVER HERE!\n                            FRESH MEAT...!\n\n               The crowd keeps up the ruckus.  The creatures are distracted\n               by the noise, but this time they don't automatically go after\n               it.  Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that.\n               But they just stay where they are.  Their hook-tentacles\n               slide out, feeling all around.  Earl whispers:\n\n                                          EARL\n                            They're not falling for it!\n\n               Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.\n\n                                          HEATHER\n                            I'll make'em pay attention\n                            goddamnit...\n\n               But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from\n               view.  Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen.  What the hell is\n               going on?  Nothing happens -- then --\n\n               A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.  It sinks\n               back down as fast as it appeared.  It's like the creature\n               suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then\n               submerged again.  Another hump rises and falls right near Val\n               and Earl.  There's a pause as the men whisper:\n\n                                          VAL\n                            They're...they're trying to make us\n                            move!\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Or just knock us over.  Look, use\n                            the bomb!\n\n                                          VAL\n                            It's out last one.  We can't kill\n                            them all.\n\n               The creatures try another random \"barrage\" of humps, some\n               coming perilously close.  They know they'll eventually topple\n               their prey.  One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles\n               roll down its sides into their boots!\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Use the fucking bomb!\n\n                                          VAL\n                            So, we get back on that rock and in\n                            three days we're dead anyway.\n\n                                          EARL\n                                   (slowly; terrified)\n                            I want to live for the three days.\n\n               More humps rise and fall.  Val gives in.  He signals Rhonda,\n               gesturing with the bomb.  She understands.  He'll set it off,\n               driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the\n               outcrop.\n\n               Val digs for the lighter.  Doesn't have it.  Earl digs for\n               it, too.  But he doesn't have it either!  They go dead pale.\n               How can that be?  They look across fifty feet of deadly open\n               ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter!\n\n               Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts:\n\n                                          BURT\n                            What's wrong?  Use the bomb, for\n                            Godsake!\n\n               Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter.  She nods.  But\n               just before she does, A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER\n               HER!  She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep\n               from taking that single step which will instantly tell the\n               creatures where she is.\n\n               But there's no hope.  The hump jerks higher.  Her boots slip\n               down the gravelly side!  Instantly the creature twists toward\n               her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt.  She screams\n               and dashes for Val and Earl.  They run to meet her.  The\n               other creatures surface.  The trio is cut off from the rock\n               outcrop!\n\n               Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while\n               Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse.  But suddenly Val\n               yanks the bomb away.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            No wait!  This way!\n\n               He veers off in a new direction.  Startled Earl and Rhonda\n               have no choice but to follow.

He whirls to check\n               the progress of the advancing creatures.\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Get ready!\n\n               He holds the bomb out to Rhonda.

Finally Val\n               pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse.  Instantly he\n               hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures.\n\n                                          EARL\n                            Too far!  You threw it behind them!\n\n               The ground opens under their feet!  Tentacles snake toward\n               Val and Earl.  A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot.  She\n               screams as it starts to pull her down.\n\n               WHOOOM!!  The bomb explodes!

The huge,\n               shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment,\n               their grotesque bodies undulating in pain.  And then they\n               fall!

Then\n               he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him.  Where the hell\n               did he get an idea like that?  After a moment:\n\n                                          VAL\n                            Well, it just suddenly hit me, you\n                            know?  Stampede?\n\n               They turn and head back toward the others.  They laugh as\n               they realize how stealthily they are walking.  Val starts\n               taking big, exaggerated stomping steps.  Rhonda and Earl\n               follow suit.  The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n         173   EXT.
