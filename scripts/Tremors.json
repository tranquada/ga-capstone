Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an\n               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more\n               and more frantic.\n\n               The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from\n               the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles\n               rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.\n\n                                          EDGAR (cont'd)\n                            ...some kind of <u>earthquake</u>!?\n\n               Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild\n               panic.\n\n                                          EDGAR (cont'd)\n                            Justine, hang on!

Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers\n               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.  Then he sees,\n               splattered across the walls -- <u>blood</u>!\n\n<b>                                          EDGAR\n</b>                            What in the name of Jehovah...?\n\n               He raises his arms above the door frame.  When he lowers them\n               he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun.  He races outside, ready to\n               shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see.\n\n\n<b>         4     EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN                                          4\n</b>\n               The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000\n               feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the\n               top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow-\n               boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As\n               we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.\n\n               This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val\n               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He\n               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance\n               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on\n               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to\n               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.\n\n               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to\n               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the\n               door reads: \"V &amp; E -- All Type's of Job's.\"  Indeed, the\n               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every\n               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his\n               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the\n               side of the truck.\n\n<b>                                          VAL\n</b>                                   (softly)\n                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is\n                            your wake-up call.  Please move\n                            your fat ass.\n\n               No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows\n               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He\n               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly\n               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the\n               truck violently.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n<b>                            STAMPEDE!

While Val laughs uproar-\n               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks\n               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless\n               cows.\n\n<b>                                          EARL\n</b>                            You dumb shit.\n\n               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,\n               drifting from job to job.  He knows why <u>he</u> hasn't accom-\n               plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won\n               wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is\n               advice.\n\n               Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes\n               through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a\n               lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with\n               cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy\n               always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it\n               out,  trading the necessary implements.\n\n               Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on\n               the tailgate.  But it's cold.\n\n<b>                                          EARL\n</b>                            You didn't cook breakfast?\n\n<b>                                          VAL\n</b>                            Did it yesterday.

This is The Challenge, and it instantly\n               triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They\n               solve all disputes using the children's game of \"scissors,\n               rock, paper.\"  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is\n               played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three,\n               Val mimes \"paper\" (open hand.  Earl mimes \"scissors\" (two\n               extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He\n               shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.\n\n                                          VAL (cont'd)\n                            Well, when I'm your age I'll\n                            probably forget what I eat, too.\n\n\n<b>         4A    EXT.

Carmine gets tangled in the jack-\n               hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.\n\n               Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-\n               brush.

He's momentarily\n               staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep\n               looking.  He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground.  Then\n               something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots\n               out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny\n               strength!  Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.\n\n               He clambers back onto the road.  But almost immediately\n               cracks form in the pavement around him.  More beak-things\n               break through the asphalt between him and his truck.\n\n               He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment.  He\n               clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd\n               they go?  Suddenly the dirt around him begins to \"bubble.\"\n               Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him\n               head first into the embankment.

A country and western tune drifts to us\n               from it's radio.\n\n               As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a\n               small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away.\n\n               Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing\n               shingles from their station wagon.  Jim starts to lift a\n               package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate.\n\n<b>                                          JIM\n</b>                            I'm dead.

The floodlight flickers.  Now the generator dies.\n               Darkness engulfs them.  The car radio music drones on\n               incongruously.\n\n                                          JIM (cont'd)\n                            Damn that thing!\n\n<b>                                          MEGAN\n</b>                                   (sarcastic)\n                            We could always buy a new\n                            generator.\n\n               Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the\n               generator.

Jim and Megan dive for cover as\n               it sails through the air, and crashes to earth.  They stare,\n               transfixed.  The generator is dented and bent almost beyond\n               recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.\n\n<b>                                          JIM\n</b>                            What the...?\n\n               But Megan is all action.

They stink like that.\n                            Remember in Yellowstone...?\n\n               Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!  Megan is thrown\n               off balance and tumbles to one side.  The flashlight falls,\n               lighting them at an eerie low angle.\n\n                                          JIM (cont'd)\n                            Something's got me!!\n\n               We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth.

GET ME OUT!!\n\n               He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down!  Megan\n               slides a 2X4 over to Jim.  He grabs it like a drowning man,\n               trying to keep himself from being pulled down.  But he's\n               pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!\n\n               His head is going under.  Megan desperately tries to dig the\n               smothering earth away, but she's losing.  Now only his arms\n               are above ground.  She pulls with all her might, but he sinks\n               inexorably down, down.  She's pulled flat on the ground.\n               He's gone.\n\n               The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the\n               earth, missing Megan's face by inches.  She scrambles back\n               frantically.\n\n\n<b>         45    ANGLE - STATION WAGON                                        45\n</b>\n               LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as\n               she dives in through the open tailgate.  She slams it after\n               her.  The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.\n\n               Megan tumbles into the front seat.  Thank God the keys are in\n               the ignition.  She starts the engine.  But outside the \"snake\n               things\" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.  A rear\n               tire is totally shredded just as:\n\n               Megan floors it.  The car lurches forward but the mutilated\n               tire falls apart.  The wheel rim digs into the loose earth\n               and the car is stuck.  With no other recourse, Megan locks\n               the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of\n               the car, panting, sobbing.  The radio is still playing a\n               happy cowboy tune.  She peeks out.  They gave up?  She's\n               safe?  Nothing happens for a moment, then --\n\n               The car starts to shake and shudder!  Dust wells up around the\n               windows.\n\n               Outside we see a bizarre sight.  The earth around the rear of\n               the car is \"boiling,\" dirt flying in all directions -- and\n               the car starts to <u>sink</u> <u>into</u> <u>the</u> <u>ground</u>!!\n\n               Megan wildly honks the horn!  The car looks just like a ship\n               going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully.  The\n               back windows shatter, dirt pouring in!  Megan smashes the\n               windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out\n               on the hood.  But there's no hope.  The car keeps sinking,\n               titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a\n               precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.\n\n               Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the\n               same hopeless phrases:\n\n<b>                                          MEGAN\n</b>                            Stop it!

Fully half\n               its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the\n               room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles\n               lashing out.\n\n\n<b>         102   EXT.

The creature lunges forward again.\n\n               PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we\n               haven't seen until now -- a wall <u>covered</u> with guns -- hand\n               guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns,\n               military guns, elephant guns.\n\n               Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines,\n               bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire!  A hook-tentacle\n               snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet.  Burt pumps\n               out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun,\n               severing the tentacle.  Heather is on her feet in an instant.\n               She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full\n               one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again.  Burt\n               grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her.  They lay down\n               massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and\n               smoke.  Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the\n               room.\n\n               The guns are empty.  THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING!  They back\n               down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after\n               another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun\n               which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth.\n               Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING\n<b>               TOWARD THEM!\n</b>\n               Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something\n               between them and it.  Burt smashes open a fancy glass case\n               holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun.  He slams in two\n               gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter.  He fires.\n               The concussion literally shakes the building.  The recoil\n               slams Burt back against the wall.\n\n               The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster.  Great\n               gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or\n               something.  The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses,\n               deflating like a beached whale.  Burt and Heather stagger\n               together and hug each other fervently.

Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way\n               behind a ledge.  Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing\n               rocks.

Earl digs in his\n               pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it.  Val nervously\n               leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how\n               Earl is holding the rope.\n\n<b>                                          VAL\n</b>                            Come on, you're not going to do\n                            your lasso thing...?\n\n<b>                                          EARL\n</b>                            Hey, just 'cause you're no good\n                            with a rope...\n\n               Val shakes his head and lights the fuse.  Earl whirls the\n               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out\n               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along\n               the ground like a fishing lure.  Rhonda stares at her watch\n               as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.\n\n<b>                                          RHONDA\n</b>                            Come on...come on...\n\n<b>                                          BURT\n</b>                            Take it...take the bait...\n\n               Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.

Rhonda stands by him, ready\n               with the lighter.  Earl lobs rocks out into the desert.\n\n<b>                                          EARL\n</b>                            Where the hell are they?

Everyone drops\n               down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second\n               bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature\n               suddenly <u>spits</u> <u>its</u> <u>bomb</u> <u>back</u> <u>out</u>!  It sails back right over\n               their heads.

Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.\n\n               And the creatures are coming back fast!\n\n               The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the\n               creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's\n               path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off!  The creatures\n               roar toward their easy prey!\n\n               Val and Earl freeze.  The ground bulges as the creatures\n               \"skid\" to a halt not ten feet from them.  Rhonda stands stock\n               still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.\n\n               Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather\n               sizes up the situation.\n\n<b>                                          HEATHER\n</b>                            Make noise.

The creatures are distracted\n               by the noise, but <u>this</u> time they don't automatically go after\n               it.  Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that.\n               But they just stay where they are.  Their hook-tentacles\n               slide out, feeling all around.  Earl whispers:\n\n<b>                                          EARL\n</b>                            They're not falling for it!\n\n               Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.\n\n<b>                                          HEATHER\n</b>                            I'll make'em pay attention\n                            goddamnit...\n\n               But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from\n               view.  Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen.  What the hell is\n               going on?  Nothing happens -- then --\n\n               A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.  It sinks\n               back down as fast as it appeared.  It's like the creature\n               suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then\n               submerged again.  Another hump rises and falls right near Val\n               and Earl.

They know they'll eventually topple\n               their prey.
