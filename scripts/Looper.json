EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY\r\n\r\n          A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.\r\n          Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas\r\n          corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.\r\n          Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,\r\n          stands.\r\n          Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from\r\n          thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet\r\n          tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.\r\n          With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man\r\n          apart with a single cough of a shot.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.\r\n          Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars\r\n          of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.\r\n\r\n          EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)\r\n          Time travel has not yet been\r\n          invented. But twenty five years\r\n          from now it will be. Once the\r\n          technology exists, it will be\r\n          relatively cheap and available to\r\n          the public at large. And so. It\r\n          will be instantly outlawed, used\r\n          only in secret by the largest\r\n          criminal organizations. And then\r\n          only for a very specific purpose.\r\n          Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse\r\n          from the flatbed.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          It's nearly impossible to dispose\r\n          of a body in the future. I'm told.\r\n          Tagging techniques, whatnot. So\r\n          when these future criminal\r\n          organizations in the future need\r\n          someone gone, they use specialized\r\n          assassins in our present, called\r\n          loopers.\r\n\r\n          INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,\r\n          opens it, and dumps him in.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)\r\n          And so. Thirty years from now. My\r\n          employers in the future nab the\r\n          target, they zap him back to me,\r\n          their looper. And I do the\r\n          necessaries. So the target has\r\n          vanished from the future, and I've\r\n          just disposed of a body that\r\n          technically does not exist. Clean.\r\n          The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little\r\n          flare of angry red fire.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DINER - DAY\r\n\r\n          A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's\r\n          truck in front.\r\n\r\n          INT. DINER\r\n\r\n          Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A\r\n          waitress sets down coffee.\r\n          Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          Bon jour, Joe.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Bon jour, Beatrix.\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          How's the French?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Slow. How's the coffee?\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          Burnt.\r\n          Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized\r\n          city on the horizon.\r\n\r\n          INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY\r\n\r\n          Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a\r\n          basket labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSES\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with\r\n          a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Two, Jedd.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n          Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.\r\n          A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old\r\n          hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.\r\n          In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.\r\n          The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.\r\n          Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.\r\n\r\n                         DALE\r\n          Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Yup.\r\n          Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves\r\n          his gun and exits.\r\n\r\n                         DALE\r\n          Four, Jedd.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.\r\n          Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a\r\n          coffee table in place over it.\r\n          Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!\r\n\r\n          INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda\r\n          Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING\r\n\r\n          Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and\r\n          he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING\r\n\r\n          A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling\r\n          beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He\r\n          kicks it in frustration.\r\n          A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to\r\n          Joe's.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Walk around! Around, I'm not\r\n          kidding. Wide around, ya shit.\r\n          The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Seth.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Hi Joe.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          That's new.\r\n          Seth kicks the bike.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going\r\n          to the Belle?\r\n\r\n          EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS\r\n\r\n          Seth and Joe.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick\r\n          with rubber on the road.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,\r\n          they get respect.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          They get respect cause they run the\r\n          town. How much did that thing set\r\n          you back? How much?\r\n          Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          I was gonna pull up in it.\r\n          Tonight. Heads or tails, call it\r\n          in the air.\r\n          The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Congratulations. You're pulling up\r\n          with me instead.\r\n          Joe notices the floating quarter.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          And don't, if we're going in, don't\r\n          do that.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Chicks dig TKs.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          It's tacky, don't do it.\r\n          Seth catches the quarter, sullen.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          When the TK mutation started\r\n          appearing in the general populace\r\n          it was on every magazine - \u00e2\u0080\u009cNext\r\n          Step in Evolution, what's next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Everyone got tested. But turns out\r\n          this was it, and now it's just a\r\n          bunch of assholes thinking they're\r\n          blowing your mind by floating\r\n          quarters.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.\r\n          Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,\r\n          big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.\r\n          All trying very hard to be big time.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)\r\n          Big heads. Small potatoes.\r\n          Drives past, revving the engine.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PARKING LOT\r\n\r\n          Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE\r\n\r\n          A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth\r\n          ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.\r\n\r\n          INT. COAT CHECK\r\n\r\n          A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat\r\n          check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and\r\n          stops the two.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         BIG CRAIG\r\n          No loopers in the club on\r\n          Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only.\r\n          Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          We'll stick backstage, just meeting\r\n          up. In and out.\r\n\r\n                         BIG CRAIG\r\n          Packing your blunderbusses?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Hardly. Right Seth?\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Hardly. I'm with Joe.\r\n          Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.\r\n          DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.\r\n          Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth\r\n          struggles to keep up.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          So are we - hey -\r\n          Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.\r\n\r\n          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE\r\n\r\n          An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet\r\n          curtained doorway leads to back rooms.\r\n          Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,\r\n          SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off\r\n          through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.\r\n          A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.\r\n\r\n                         MADAME\r\n          No loopers on Wednesday, Joe.

BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast.\r\n          Curious, Joe follows.

Cuz, what-\r\n          Joe?\r\n          And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.\r\n\r\n          INT. STEEP STAIRS\r\n\r\n          A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young\r\n          loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         DALE\r\n          Zach. In there right now, with\r\n          Abe.\r\n          Dale makes a quarter float above his palm.

An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder\r\n          then retracts into the door.\r\n          The loopers watch him in awe.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)

WAITING ROOM\r\n\r\n          Abe leads Joe out, past gat men and Kid Blue, smirking again.\r\n\r\n                         ABE\r\n          Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.\r\n          On the house.\r\n          After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.\r\n\r\n          ABE (CONT'D)\r\n          Call the doc.\r\n\r\n          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE\r\n\r\n          Joe slumps in. Several girls, none of them Suzie.\r\n\r\n                         MADAME\r\n          Suzie's just getting off. Doubt\r\n          she's up for it.\r\n          He pushes through the velvet curtained door.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          22.\r\n\r\n          INT. BLACK HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          A large gat man pushes past Joe.\r\n          At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a\r\n          cigarette. Not sexy, just tired. She sees Joe, and is about\r\n          to say no. But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't.\r\n          Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway.\r\n          Joe follows. Through her smoke.\r\n\r\n          INT. SUZIE'S BEDROOM - LATER\r\n\r\n          Suzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the\r\n          bed, distant.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          I can't remember my mother's face.\r\n          I remember her touching my hair.\r\n          Like this.\r\n          He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles\r\n          briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in\r\n          his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you want to go overseas?\r\n\r\n                         SUZIE\r\n          Do I want to go overseas?

You gotta be careful, it's\r\n          easy to think you know someone once\r\n          you been like this.

JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes\r\n          to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.\r\n          All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,\r\n          knocked out of place.\r\n          He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a\r\n          bright smear of fresh red blood.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a\r\n          train yard.\r\n          It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence\r\n          bordering the train yard.\r\n          Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and\r\n          wraps first his left hand then his right.\r\n          But stops.\r\n          On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly\r\n          carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.\r\n          Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,\r\n          revealing his clean bare forearm.\r\n          Then his face changes.\r\n          Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,\r\n          more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.\r\n          The scars spell out clearly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15\r\n\r\n                         MINUTES\u00c2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up\r\n          and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.\r\n          He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist\r\n          himself over... and stops again.\r\n          His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just\r\n          gone, its stump worn with age.\r\n          Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.\r\n          A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,\r\n          leading out of town. Behind him, the city.\r\n          Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it\r\n          takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing\r\n          has changed to a ragged whistle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          24.\r\n          He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...\r\n          and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY STREETS\r\n\r\n          The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back\r\n          into town.\r\n          He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his\r\n          thumb.\r\n          He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no\r\n          right hand, just a stump.\r\n\r\n                         OLD SETH\r\n          No no no no no!\r\n          A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying\r\n          on the sidewalk.\r\n          He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left\r\n          hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.\r\n          Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the\r\n          street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.\r\n          The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows\r\n          Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.\r\n\r\n          IN THE CAR\r\n          Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the\r\n          DRIVER. Jams on the gas.\r\n          Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.\r\n          His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WIRE STREET\r\n\r\n          The car hits a pole.\r\n          Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing\r\n          a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.\r\n          Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.\r\n          He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.\r\n          Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,\r\n          an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.\r\n          Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one\r\n          arm, slams it.\r\n          Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings\r\n          open.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          25.\r\n          With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and\r\n          Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.\r\n          Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.\r\n          Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical\r\n          frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Joe wakes with a start.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD\r\n\r\n          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his\r\n          stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.\r\n          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling\r\n          before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots\r\n          the man in the chest.\r\n          Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and\r\n          purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.\r\n          Similar.\r\n          He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the\r\n          shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.\r\n          Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.\r\n          Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.\r\n\r\n          INT. PLANT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and\r\n          vanish in a puff of distant fire.\r\n\r\n                         BEGIN MONTAGE:\r\n          1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers\r\n          celebrate.\r\n          2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.\r\n          3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars.\r\n          4. Joe in the field, BANG.\r\n          5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.\r\n          6. Joe in the field, BANG.\r\n          7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire.\r\n          8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more\r\n          determined with each shot.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          26.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.\r\n          Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.\r\n          But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,\r\n          confused.\r\n          2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the\r\n          man is supposed to appear.\r\n          Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.\r\n          2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.\r\n          But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over\r\n          and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.\r\n          Holy shit.\r\n          Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on\r\n          the trigger.\r\n          Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face\r\n          that stares back at Joe is his own.\r\n          57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.\r\n          And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his\r\n          finger eases on the trigger.\r\n          It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body\r\n          into a spin.\r\n          Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.\r\n          The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact\r\n          blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn\r\n          jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They\r\n          caught the blast.\r\n          In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab\r\n          one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt\r\n          and the bar back towards Joe.\r\n          Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes\r\n          focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.\r\n          Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun\r\n          aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's\r\n          head, a fist and then\r\n\r\n          THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER\r\n          Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,\r\n          still squawking French lessons. Sits up.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          27.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Oh god.\r\n          Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no\r\n          truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But\r\n          realizing.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          Late to my own funeral.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from\r\n          his pocket, chucks it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.\r\n          Looks up at his lit window. Debating.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.\r\n          It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n          Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to\r\n          pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars\r\n          missing. But the apartment seems empty.\r\n          Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a\r\n          wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.\r\n          Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --\r\n          footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just\r\n          as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM\r\n\r\n          Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of\r\n          gold bars.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (O.S.)\r\n          That's twenty four there. I'm\r\n          keeping count.\r\n\r\n          TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)\r\n          Uh huh.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (O.S.)\r\n          Two more trips should do it.\r\n          Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          28.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n          The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the\r\n          floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In\r\n          the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.\r\n          CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws\r\n          his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.\r\n          SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his\r\n          momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles\r\n          back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.\r\n          Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and\r\n          SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.\r\n          With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's\r\n          fingers.\r\n          A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door\r\n          clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to\r\n          crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,\r\n          panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts\r\n          clear and earnest:\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell\r\n          Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell\r\n          him keep my bars safe cause I swear\r\n          to god I'm going to fix this, I'm\r\n          going to find my loop and I'm gonna\r\n          kill him. Tell Abe-\r\n          CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door\r\n          splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right\r\n          ear explodes.\r\n          More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls\r\n          back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now\r\n          footsteps running down the hall.\r\n          Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across\r\n          the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,\r\n          shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding\r\n          as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets\r\n          shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe\r\n          barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,\r\n          slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out\r\n          the window and shooting down at him.\r\n          Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -\r\n          three stories at least, falling.\r\n          When he hits the ground the world goes away.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          29.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene.\r\n          Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,\r\n          ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks\r\n          his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.\r\n          This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being\r\n          replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's\r\n          different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.\r\n          And something very different happens:\r\n          Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.\r\n          Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.\r\n          Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He\r\n          pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.\r\n          He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.\r\n          Joe has closed his loop.\r\n\r\n          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The other LOOPERS buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING\r\n\r\n          His belongings in boxes. Joe unloads the GOLD BARS from the\r\n          trap door.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CARGO SHIP DECK - DAY\r\n\r\n          Out at sea.

PARIS BODEGA - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Joe picks up a bottle of beer.\r\n          Several FRENCH GANGSTERS in suits shake down the OWNER of the\r\n          shop for money from the register. One holds a gun in the\r\n          owner's face.\r\n          Joe ignores them, walks out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          30.\r\n\r\n          INT.

PARIS STREETS - DAY\r\n\r\n          Cloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world.\r\n          Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK\r\n          power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown\r\n          drastically low.\r\n          LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARIS BODEGA - DAY\r\n\r\n          A GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several\r\n          years older now, in his mid thirties.\r\n          Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part\r\n          of their gang.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze.\r\n          A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful.\r\n          Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARIS GANG HEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\n          A dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's\r\n          maybe behind a club.\r\n          The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly\r\n          dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment\r\n          to recognize Joe among them.\r\n          In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A\r\n          soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor\r\n          playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          31.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Laughing his ass off.\r\n          A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around.\r\n          Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the\r\n          first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In\r\n          a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit.\r\n\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cSORTIE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on\r\n          her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off.\r\n          Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARIS CAFE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Old Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARIS BEDROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Old Joe in bed with his future Wife.

PARIS APARTMENT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Old Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters\r\n          accusingly. She throws them across the room.\r\n          LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled.\r\n\r\n          INT. CAR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Old Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside\r\n          him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe\r\n          gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun\r\n          out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty,\r\n          then throws the gun into the ocean.\r\n          He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss.\r\n          They fall to the sand, and kiss.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          32.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

His Wife\r\n          tends to him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRENCH COTTAGE - SUNSET - YEARS LATER\r\n\r\n          Old Joe in his mid 50s, his Wife lying on a hammock with him,\r\n          reading. Hands lazily entwined. A good life.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE KITCHEN - MORNING - A WEEK LATER\r\n\r\n          The Wife cuts vegetables. Headlines (in French) scroll\r\n          across a small floating screen, against images of\r\n          destruction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmaker\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          She turns it off.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRENCH BEDROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows.\r\n          Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s.\r\n          His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts\r\n          her hand on his foot. Draws it away, fingers sliding off\r\n          gently. And is gone.\r\n          We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the\r\n          sheets. Running water from the kitchen.\r\n          His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm\r\n          is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.\r\n          A long moment.\r\n          With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front\r\n          door is KICKED OPEN.\r\n          Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab\r\n          him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.\r\n          His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.\r\n\r\n          EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a\r\n          moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about\r\n          happening inside.\r\n          Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing\r\n          thrashing and bleeding from his head.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n\r\n          INT. BASEMENT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog\r\n          tied. Put a sack over his head.\r\n          Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.\r\n          One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a\r\n          large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.\r\n          Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:\r\n          flashes of his WIFE, screaming.\r\n          Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES\r\n          one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry\r\n          and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.\r\n          Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded\r\n          number on his blood-smeared hand.\r\n          A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The\r\n          machine hums angrily. Ready.\r\n\r\n          INT. TIME MACHINE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.\r\n          Closes the hatch behind him.\r\n          Flash and crack and he is sent.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          And appears in front of his younger self.\r\n          The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe\r\n          hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.\r\n          Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his\r\n          younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Old Joe drives the truck into the city.\r\n\r\n          INT. BODEGA - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped\r\n          sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn\r\n          jacket, dumps it.\r\n          At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls\r\n          the blunderbuss on the clerk.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          And your jacket.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          34.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Wearing the clerk's jacket, Old Joe takes four aspirin.\r\n          Holds his head a minute, rocking gently.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,\r\n          watching the window high above. Weighing his options.\r\n          He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.\r\n          Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man\r\n          loading their bars in the back.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Shit.\r\n          Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement\r\n          between parked cars.\r\n          It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the\r\n          apartment building weighing his options.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (SOTTO)\r\n          Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.\r\n          After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the\r\n          building. Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go.\r\n          Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from\r\n          the alleyway, wiping their hands.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Two more trips.\r\n          They enter the building.\r\n          Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the\r\n          sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT\r\n          MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.\r\n\r\n          INT. ARMORED VAN\r\n\r\n          The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.\r\n          Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.\r\n          When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,\r\n          blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat\r\n          Man Driver is torn apart.\r\n          Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the\r\n          bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          35.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n          Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the\r\n          high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's\r\n          right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.\r\n          He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops\r\n          when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.\r\n          Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire\r\n          escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.\r\n          Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots\r\n          upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.\r\n          Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on\r\n          the hood of a parked car.\r\n          Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.\r\n          Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.\r\n          Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat\r\n          out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car\r\n          hood.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Stupid little shit.\r\n          He lifts him in his arms.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

A tight\r\n          bandage on his ear.\r\n          A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link\r\n          fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.\r\n          A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,\r\n          heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.\r\n          Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.\r\n          Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight\r\n          zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards\r\n          the city.\r\n\r\n          INT.

CITY STREETS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing.\r\n          Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights\r\n          themselves.\r\n          Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely\r\n          avoiding the light. He won't last long out here.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Where would I go if I were me.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          37.\r\n          He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the\r\n          other side with flashlights.\r\n          Goes back the way he came, turns a corner.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n          Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE.\r\n          Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window.\r\n          He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate.\r\n\r\n          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.\r\n          A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,\r\n          Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,\r\n          finds what he's looking for at a desk.\r\n          A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.\r\n          Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and\r\n          windows, information flashing, searching.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.\r\n          Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at\r\n          his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An\r\n          idea.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit\r\n          window.\r\n          Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed\r\n          on his boot, enters the building.\r\n\r\n          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look\r\n          like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.\r\n          Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.\r\n          On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to\r\n          his wrist.\r\n          Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,\r\n          revealing \u00e2\u0080\u009cB\u00e2\u0080\u009d then \u00e2\u0080\u009cE\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Then \u00e2\u0080\u009cA then \u00e2\u0080\u009cT\u00e2\u0080\u009d...

SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.\r\n          Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the\r\n          screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.\r\n          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the\r\n          apartment with over-eager purpose.\r\n          Empty. He deflates. Thinks.\r\n          Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.\r\n          A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.\r\n          An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.\r\n          Kid Blue stops scanning, hits \u00e2\u0080\u0098PLAY'. Joe feels around the\r\n          door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.\r\n          Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.\r\n          Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's\r\n          about to step away when his eye catches something.\r\n          He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a\r\n          live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.\r\n          Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.\r\n          On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a\r\n          little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring\r\n          into space.\r\n          Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.\r\n          Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly\r\n          exits.\r\n          Kid Blue stops the screen.\r\n          He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.\r\n          The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOFFEE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.\r\n          It's full of knives.\r\n          Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small\r\n          rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.\r\n          Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces\r\n          together. Lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

BEDROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK\r\n\r\n          The same from the previous flashback.\r\n          Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.\r\n          It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.\r\n          The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his\r\n          foot, moving away.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DINER - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar\r\n          roadside diner. Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four\r\n          aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner\r\n          cautiously.\r\n          Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.\r\n\r\n          INT. DINER\r\n\r\n          Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.\r\n          A moment of silence.\r\n          Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in\r\n          bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe\r\n          pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling\r\n\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cBEATRIX.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          Coffee?\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Please.

Old\r\n          men speaking French sound like\r\n          primeval trees in a strong wind,\r\n          just irrefutable. Wise, strong,\r\n          gentle, all these things in\r\n          harmony, complimentary. At once.\r\n          Old men speaking French. Young men\r\n          speaking French sound, without\r\n          exception, like weenies. Fact.\r\n          You ever hear a Frenchman under 40\r\n          try to sound threatening? It's\r\n          hilarious. English is a tight t-\r\n          shirt, flatters the young. Rat a\r\n          tat tat. French is a double\r\n          breasted suit. Young man can put\r\n          it on, but it always feels like\r\n          he's putting something on.

Nobody knows\r\n          how it works. Time travel was an\r\n          accident, thirty years from now the\r\n          smartest men in the world know\r\n          exactly one thing about it that you\r\n          don't: they know to be scared to\r\n          death of it.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          My memory is cloudy, there's a\r\n          cloud.

Joe passes him two.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          And the salt. No, the pepper. The\r\n          pepper.\r\n          Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and\r\n          pours pepper between them, thus:\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          Ok, the span between the straws is\r\n          a timeline of the next 30 years.\r\n\r\n                         THIS\r\n          (the left straw)\r\n          is the present moment, right now.\r\n\r\n                         AND THIS\r\n          (the right straw)\r\n          is the moment thirty years from now\r\n          when I was sent back.

See\r\n          my memories start clear here,\r\n          (at the right straw)\r\n          but as they go back they get\r\n          cloudier, until they're totally\r\n          obscured. It's like a fog.\r\n          Because my memories aren't really\r\n          memories, they're one possible\r\n          eventuality now, and they grow\r\n          clearer or cloudier as they become\r\n          more or less likely. But then they\r\n          get to the present moment\r\n          (the left straw)\r\n          And they're instantly clear again.\r\n          Like a wall of fog moving forward\r\n          with the present moment. I can\r\n          remember what you do after you do\r\n          it.\r\n          He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it\r\n          pushes the pepper with it.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          So you can\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          And it hurts.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          So when we're apart you can\r\n          remember what I do.

Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest\r\n          sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,\r\n          he breaks off his gaze.\r\n          The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he\r\n          turns it into anger.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          For a long time at the beginning\r\n          she thought we'd have a baby.

Old Joe drags him to the window. They look\r\n          out. Nothing in the parking lot.

Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe\r\n          returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.\r\n          Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.\r\n          Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.\r\n          Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the\r\n          booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have\r\n          their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath\r\n          the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Shit.\r\n          Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind\r\n          Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the\r\n          broken window, jumps...\r\n\r\n          EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING\r\n\r\n          ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRONT OF DINER\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their\r\n          guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,\r\n          followed by Joe.\r\n\r\n          DINER GAT MAN\r\n          The back, he's running!\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Around back!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          50.\r\n          They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the\r\n          corn but not there yet.\r\n          The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after\r\n          him while running but they're too far away (and they're\r\n          running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,\r\n          sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the\r\n          dust.\r\n          When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four\r\n          of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers\r\n          slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.\r\n          It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is\r\n          there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize\r\n          that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards\r\n          the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the\r\n          Gat Men fires.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Alive! No, alive!\r\n          Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.\r\n\r\n          CLICK.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          No fuck no fucking piece of shit\r\n          CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the\r\n          moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike\r\n          the engine turns over with a ROAR.\r\n          The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the\r\n          open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The\r\n          bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.\r\n          Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running\r\n          back to the Gat Men.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          The tracker! Get the tracker!\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD\r\n\r\n          Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He\r\n          BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful\r\n          stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out\r\n          of sight.\r\n          Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn\r\n          paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe\r\n          scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.\r\n          Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and\r\n          scattered farm houses.\r\n          One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          51.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FIELD - DAWN\r\n\r\n          A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts\r\n          the dead stump of an old tree.\r\n          A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the\r\n          trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.\r\n          Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near\r\n          distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.\r\n          Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a\r\n          crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn\r\n          fields, spraying something chemical.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Sara makes coffee.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible\r\n          cigarette.\r\n          Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it\r\n          has been here for awhile.\r\n          The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.\r\n          Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going\r\n          anywhere.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,\r\n          puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          C'mon baby. Time to get up.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER\r\n\r\n          The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The\r\n          latch is broken. She sighs.\r\n          Then freezes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          52.\r\n          Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front\r\n          lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn\r\n          fields. Watching her.\r\n          She watches right back for a long moment.\r\n          Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no\r\n          hesitation at all plows outside.\r\n          The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN\r\n\r\n          Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,\r\n          shotgun extended. Not fucking around.\r\n          Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn\r\n          fields, where she plants herself and shouts:\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Listen up fucker. I have shot and\r\n          buried three vagrants in the past\r\n          year. If you want to know the\r\n          Christ's honest truth I'm starting\r\n          to get a taste for it. So I don't\r\n          care what hobo sob story you've\r\n          got, I get a dozen a week and it\r\n          cuts no cash with me. It's me and\r\n          my husband here, we're broke and\r\n          angry at our lot in this world and\r\n          heavily armed. So take some corn\r\n          and move on, but if you show your\r\n          face again I will cut you the fuck\r\n          in half.\r\n          Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara\r\n          turns, walks briskly back.\r\n          Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He\r\n          takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a\r\n          clear sight line at the house.\r\n          His gun on his knee.\r\n          JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.\r\n          Pinches his eyes. Headache.\r\n          The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          C'mon. C'mere. C'mon.

CITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY\r\n\r\n          Helicopters sweep by.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABE'S OFFICE\r\n\r\n          Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits\r\n          like a kid in detention.\r\n\r\n                         ABE\r\n          Well. You found him. And you\r\n          russeled up a posse and went to git\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u0098em. Like a good little cowboy\r\n          from one of your movie movies.\r\n          Without telling me.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          I can do it again.\r\n\r\n                         ABE\r\n          You can fuck up again? Really.\r\n          You know what happens to me if I\r\n          don't get that old bastard? I got\r\n          too much riding, Kid, I can't\r\n          afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.\r\n          Put your gat on the table.\r\n          Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he\r\n          doesn't take his hand off it.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          I wanted you to say I did good,\r\n          that's all I wanted. This is all I\r\n          have.\r\n          Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the\r\n          trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the\r\n          table.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          Please just give me one more\r\n          chance, I'll bring him here alive\r\n          and hold him and you can put a\r\n          bullet in his brain yourself-\r\n          Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing\r\n          it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.\r\n\r\n          INT. STEEP STAIRS\r\n\r\n          Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of\r\n          backstage, past girls and Loopers and men.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          54.\r\n          The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls\r\n          himself halfway together. Make a show:\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          I'm gonna make this good again. I\r\n          will. I'm gonna be back.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance\r\n          door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards\r\n          the street.\r\n          But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The\r\n          Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Oh no. Oh no no no no\r\n          He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,\r\n          begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.\r\n          The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          No! No! No no no no!\r\n          Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the\r\n          concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without\r\n          ceremony.\r\n          BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES\r\n          into the wall. He drops like a doll.\r\n          Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg\r\n          hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.\r\n          In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps\r\n          stashed. His pinkie on the trigger.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh.\r\n          Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a\r\n          soaked rat.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She\r\n          gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light.\r\n          Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard.\r\n          She turns the porch light back on.\r\n          The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She\r\n          steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          55.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

BARN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted\r\n          floodlight falls off to inky darkness.\r\n          Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps\r\n          off. In its absence the darkness swarms.\r\n          She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.\r\n          Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.\r\n          And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hey. Who's there.\r\n          Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.\r\n          Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a\r\n          shape. A man. coming towards her.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          Stop right there. Stop!\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.\r\n          Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.\r\n          Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.\r\n          In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah\r\n          backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man\r\n          pursues her slowly but steadily.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n\r\n                         SHIT\r\n          His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he\r\n          scrambles in the dirt for it.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The man pauses, but then\r\n          continues towards her.

Joe lingers, then leaves. She\r\n          hacks away.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in\r\n          thought.\r\n          She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally\r\n          with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.\r\n          Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the\r\n          address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.\r\n          Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just\r\n          at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.\r\n          Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.\r\n          The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping\r\n          exhausted, up the stairs.\r\n          And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.\r\n          It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,\r\n          pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.\r\n          He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the\r\n          apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.\r\n          Towards apartment 205.\r\n          Jesus it can't be.\r\n          Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,\r\n          relieved.\r\n          She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely\r\n          indistinct conversation between her and the girl that\r\n          answers.\r\n\r\n                         SUZIE\r\n          Sorry, I know I promised five, you\r\n          know how it gets.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL NEIGHBOR\r\n          Don't worry sugar. She was no\r\n          problem. Gat men searched through\r\n          here, lookin for god knows...\r\n          Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a\r\n          sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the\r\n          neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n          Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to\r\n          be shitting me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.\r\n          Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.\r\n          On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.\r\n          Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long\r\n          red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.\r\n          Old Joe watches them for a long time.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY\r\n\r\n          Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand\r\n          on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer.\r\n          The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Sara empties the dryer.\r\n\r\n          INT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a\r\n          plastic multiplication table.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Where does 56 go?

In the distance, Joe\r\n          paces the yard.\r\n          Relieved, Sara returns to Cid.

She bolts\r\n          out of the room.\r\n\r\n          EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          Sara walks fast down the hall\r\n\r\n          INT.

FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes\r\n          in the kitchen, listening.\r\n\r\n          JESSE (O.S.)\r\n          I'm a deputized police officer,\r\n          we're looking for an escaped\r\n          criminal, just doing a sweep.

Joe can't tell\r\n          if they're coming through the living room or hall. He\r\n          hesitates.\r\n\r\n          JESSE (O.S.)\r\n          This man, here.\r\n\r\n          SARA (O.S.)\r\n          He's young. No.\r\n          Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as\r\n          they enter from the living room.\r\n          Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours\r\n          him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          We're looking for his father too,\r\n          similar look and build but late\r\n          50s. May or may not be travelling\r\n          together.\r\n          This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,\r\n          of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.\r\n          Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with\r\n          Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're\r\n          not sure.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          No.\r\n          She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take\r\n          them.

FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM\r\n\r\n          He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara\r\n          follows him.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          Eight, you said? Boy? And your\r\n          husband. Just gotta, check in.\r\n          With the home office.

No.\r\n          Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My\r\n          boss has half the city's looking\r\n          for him. Half the city and me.\r\n          So. And if you find him, there's a\r\n          helluva price. Think on that if he\r\n          comes by, acting sweet.\r\n          Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees\r\n          Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          87.\r\n          If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.\r\n          Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a\r\n          GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.\r\n          Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently\r\n          creeps down the stairs.\r\n          He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't\r\n          look up from his phone.\r\n          Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE (CONT'D)\r\n          Alright, show me upstairs.\r\n          The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks\r\n          sharply at Sara.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Drafts, in the house.\r\n          Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant\r\n          Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.\r\n          Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.\r\n\r\n          JESSE (O.S.)\r\n          This door doesn't latch?\r\n\r\n          SARA (O.S.)\r\n          It used to, it's busted.\r\n          Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER\r\n\r\n          Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the\r\n          door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into\r\n          the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          Drafty house.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Farm house.\r\n          Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.\r\n          CREAK. He looks at Sara.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          What's down there?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Laundry room.

First, I have a family\r\n          of my own back in the city, and I\r\n          want to see them again. Second if\r\n          anything happens to me, and I don't\r\n          report back to my boss people in\r\n          fifteen minutes, they're gonna know\r\n          I disappeared searching this house,\r\n          and inside of another fifteen\r\n          you'll have an army of more me's\r\n          kicking down your door. Ok?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          It's a laundry room.\r\n          Jesse motions - her first.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM\r\n\r\n          Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The\r\n          only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and\r\n          a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.\r\n          No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the\r\n          hamper.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          You want to call out whoever's\r\n          hiding in that hamper?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          If someone was hiding in the house,\r\n          that's what I'd do. But nobody is\r\n          in the house. Open it up.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          No I think I'm gonna put a shot\r\n          through it just to be safe.\r\n          He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE (CONT'D)\r\n          You wanna call him out?\r\n          Sara stays silent. A long beat.\r\n          Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.\r\n          She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket\r\n          and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's\r\n          empty.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          89.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Now if you promise not to wag your\r\n          gun at my shoe rack I'll show you\r\n          upstairs then show you the fuck\r\n          out.\r\n          She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his\r\n          gun and follows her.\r\n          The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the\r\n          room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.\r\n\r\n          INT.

In the distance, Jesse\r\n          leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking\r\n          back towards the highway.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          My mom gave me up.

Like Seth.\r\n          He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.\r\n          Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.\r\n          Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91.\r\n          Sara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back\r\n          to the corn fields.\r\n\r\n          INT. SECURITY MONITOR ROOM - EVENING\r\n\r\n          A tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his\r\n          hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's\r\n          apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.\r\n          It scans quickly forward.\r\n          The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,\r\n          counting money.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          All working girls, yeah?\r\n\r\n                         SUPER\r\n          Uh huh. This whole block. You\r\n          wanna check those too, I can\r\n          arrange.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          I do.\r\n          On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from\r\n          next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an\r\n          instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the\r\n          playback.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lo Joe.\r\n          Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches\r\n          Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him\r\n          intently.\r\n          Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.\r\n          Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.\r\n\r\n                         SUPER\r\n          I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.\r\n          But you don't see what you wanna\r\n          see, no refunds.\r\n          Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks\r\n          up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few\r\n          drops of rain fall.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)\r\n\r\n          Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on\r\n          the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense\r\n          conversation, her hand on his.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          92.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          But I will.\r\n\r\n          WIFE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          You want to, I know that. But you\r\n          won't.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          I'd do anything for you.\r\n\r\n          WIFE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd\r\n          take life for me. But I don't want\r\n          that. You kill for what you love,\r\n          but someone loves the person you\r\n          kill, and it starts again. I don't\r\n          want that. I can't love a killer.\r\n          What would you give up for me?\r\n          That's yours?\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          Anything.\r\n          She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A\r\n          moment, in thought.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.\r\n          THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun\r\n          breaks the clouds. Rain falls.\r\n          He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds\r\n          her face like the most precious thing in the world.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Anything.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHURCH - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.\r\n          Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the\r\n          side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain\r\n          sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a\r\n          street garbage can.\r\n          He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He\r\n          lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can.\r\n          His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture\r\n          of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from\r\n          his grasp.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n          With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears\r\n          cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct.\r\n          Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the\r\n          photo is nearly gone.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE'S EYES.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\r\n\r\n          Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight.\r\n          We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the\r\n          previous flashback.\r\n          But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG\r\n          grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other\r\n          backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.\r\n          Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less\r\n          likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.\r\n          Erasing it.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE'S EYES.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)\r\n\r\n          Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her\r\n          face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE'S EYES.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK)\r\n\r\n          The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to\r\n          the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory,\r\n          now there is the FOG.\r\n          A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed\r\n          against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of\r\n          nothingness falling towards him.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE'S EYES.\r\n          The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of\r\n          decision.\r\n\r\n          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the\r\n          dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the\r\n          sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.\r\n          A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.\r\n          Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then\r\n          sound: a door opening in the house below.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          94.\r\n          Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door\r\n          flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes\r\n          adjust to the dark.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          What?\r\n          Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head\r\n          doesn't know where to go.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Don't wake Cid.\r\n          She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain\r\n          starts to fall against the windows.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.\r\n          Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She\r\n          sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the\r\n          air, spinning, then drops.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          That's pretty good.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          In the city, young guys would hit\r\n          on me by floating fucking quarters,\r\n          I wouldn't tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em I was TK but\r\n          I'd keep their quarters down. One\r\n          guy busted a blood vessel in his\r\n          eye trying to get it up.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          He's you. Your loop. You lied to\r\n          me.\r\n          She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up.\r\n\r\n          SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          But you protected Cid. And I know\r\n          you're not lying that you're gonna\r\n          kill this guy, your own self.

Cid was sitting on the\r\n          porch, I remember seeing him for\r\n          the first time, in two years.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          95.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          Saw him on the porch. I drove up\r\n          crying and I had been at a party in\r\n          the city when I got the call, I was\r\n          wearing this ridiculous party\r\n          dress. All my ridiculous shit. I\r\n          don't know if he remembered me, but\r\n          he looked at me. I abandoned him.\r\n          I abandoned my baby.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Maybe I can't be a mother to him,\r\n          is that something I can't get back.\r\n          When he looked at me then, on the\r\n          porch, he was mine again, he was my\r\n          son. I seen so many men in the\r\n          city, who I look in their eyes and\r\n          they're lost. Whether he loves me\r\n          back or not I'm gonna love my son I\r\n          said. And he's never gonna get\r\n          lost.\r\n          Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying.\r\n          He touches her hair.\r\n\r\n          INT.

APARTMENT 205\r\n\r\n          Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the\r\n          door at the end with a rainbow on it.

Jesse, purely on\r\n          instinct, spins and draws on Cid.\r\n          Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel\r\n          leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls\r\n          back.\r\n          Everything slows down.\r\n\r\n          INT. APARTMENT 205\r\n\r\n          Old Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM\r\n\r\n          The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud.\r\n          Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid-\r\n          scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles\r\n          down the stairs.\r\n          Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to\r\n          catch Cid. Sara runs behind him.\r\n          The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room\r\n          rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating.\r\n          Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES\r\n          into the air.\r\n\r\n          INT.

FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (OLD JOE'S MEMORIES)\r\n\r\n          Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling,\r\n          nearly at the bottom of the stairs.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (NORMAL)\r\n\r\n          But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind.\r\n          Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her\r\n          face is set.\r\n          Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with\r\n          rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched.\r\n          Screaming.

The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the\r\n          air, terrified.\r\n          Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and\r\n          sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground\r\n          screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the\r\n          threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood.\r\n\r\n          INT.

He looks at\r\n          Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over\r\n          one eye.\r\n          Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but\r\n          in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.\r\n          And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid\r\n          leans against his legs, crying.\r\n          Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and\r\n          embraces him, wiping the blood from his face.

Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway\r\n          while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic\r\n          rifle.\r\n          He blasts like hell into the hallway.

COAT CHECK - LATER\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.\r\n          Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his\r\n          chest is grazed.\r\n          The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABE'S DEN\r\n\r\n          Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue\r\n          stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.\r\n          Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara\r\n          loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Ok baby, we're going.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY\r\n\r\n          Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He\r\n          tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored\r\n          truck.\r\n          Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his\r\n          gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.\r\n          The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He\r\n          throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between\r\n          them.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Bon jour. You take this truck, you\r\n          take your money, and you go live\r\n          your life. No one's coming after\r\n          you. I fixed it.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          And you go kill the boy. That's\r\n          how you fix it.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          That's how. You got your life\r\n          back, you better think right now\r\n          about what that's worth to you.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          My life? Your life.

Too far away, the shot\r\n          scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.\r\n          Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Stupid little shit! You let him\r\n          live, he's gonna take away\r\n          everything that's yours, everything\r\n          that's mine! You seen what the\r\n          boy's gonna become.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          I haven't seen that yet.\r\n          Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's\r\n          chest and knock him back.\r\n          Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has\r\n          until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.\r\n          Kid Blue.\r\n          The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to\r\n          the dusty pavement.\r\n          The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its\r\n          wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a\r\n          stop and spin it around.\r\n          Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.\r\n          Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as\r\n          a rock.\r\n          Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires\r\n          scattershot.\r\n          Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.\r\n          Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round\r\n          after fiery round.\r\n          Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.\r\n          KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud\r\n          of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to\r\n          slow the bike but can't in time.\r\n          In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.\r\n          He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly\r\n          FIRES his buss.\r\n          A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without\r\n          a driver. It skids, crashes.\r\n          When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          107.\r\n          Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.\r\n          Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:\r\n          Old Joe is gone.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN\r\n\r\n          Sara starts the truck up.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Here we go.

DIRT ROAD\r\n\r\n          They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway.\r\n          At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,\r\n          is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand.\r\n          Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n\r\n                         STOP\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Duck down baby\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          Stop please he can shoot us\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Just stay down\r\n          Half the distance closed, but he's still far off.

A fan of crimson blood sprays from\r\n          Cid's head.

FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA\r\n\r\n          Revealing that all we saw was in Joe's head, and we are still\r\n          in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara.\r\n          But this time, just as he's pulling the trigger, a distant\r\n          shot is heard.\r\n          And Old Joe DISAPPEARS.\r\n          Sara stands shell shocked just for a moment. Then she\r\n          doesn't process any of it, she just turns and yells\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n          CID!\r\n\r\n          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID\r\n\r\n          Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field.\r\n          There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is\r\n          gone. The field is empty.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          113.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FIELD - SEEN FROM JOE'S POV\r\n\r\n          We don't see Joe, but far across the field Cid runs to his\r\n          mom, into her arms. Sara lifts him, holds him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FIELD - WITH CID & SARA\r\n\r\n          She carries him. Walking fast back towards a far distant\r\n          figure lying still on the edge of the field. Joe.\r\n          Then a faint buzz. The flasher, in her pocket. She pulls it\r\n          out. Two flashes.\r\n          She slows. Stops. Looking at him, far away. Two flashes.\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          Where's Joe?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          He had to go away, baby.\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          He took the bad man with him?\r\n          She kisses him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FIELD - FROM JOE'S POV\r\n\r\n          In the distance, Sara turns away and carries Cid back towards\r\n          the farmhouse.\r\n\r\n          INT. CID'S BATHROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara bathes Cid, dresses the wound on his jaw.\r\n\r\n          INT. CID'S BEDROOM\r\n\r\n          She tucks Cid in, holds him close. Kisses his forehead.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Sara emerges from the ruined front door, crosses the porch.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN\r\n\r\n          Sara crosses the lawn, and walks across the field.\r\n\r\n          EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS\r\n\r\n          Joe's body. Sara goes to him, slowly. She kneels beside him.\r\n          His pocket watch in the dirt. Open. No photo inside.\r\n          Ticking away. Around and around.\r\n          She closes it.Touches his hair. The wind through the corn.\r\n          After a long while, the sun breaks through the clouds.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nLooper\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Rian Johnson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:30:06.131162"}
