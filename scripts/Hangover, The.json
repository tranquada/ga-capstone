He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.\n          Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school\n          linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two.

Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.\n          The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all\n          over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the\n          couch, onto a pile of newspapers.\n\n                              PILE OF NEWSPAPERS\n                    OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!\n          Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find\n          Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick\n          pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.\n\n                              VICK\n                    Damn, dude, why are you retarded?\n          Both men are ragingly hungover.\n          A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:\n\n                                 VICK (CONT'D)\n                    Um, Stuey?\n\n                                 STU\n                    Yo.\n\n                              VICK\n                    Why do you have a mullet?\n          Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut.

Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:\n\n                              ALAN (O.S.)\n                    Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!\n          There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.\n          Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan\n          stumble out of the bathroom.\n          Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night\n          before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut\n          off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.\n\n                              VICK\n                    Jesus, dude, put away your sack.\n          Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.\n\n          \n\n                                                                    16.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                              STU\n                    Yeah, and it might be time for some\n                    manscaping, bro. Your bush looks\n                    like Yanni.\n          Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.\n\n                              ALAN\n                    What did we do last night?\n\n                                                              CUT TO:\n\n          INT.

I'm sorry to bring\n                    Moshe Mervish into it, but it had\n                    to be said. Now yes, we have 18\n                    hours to find Doug -- which means\n                    we can afford to spend ten minutes\n                    celebrating the special talents of\n                    these gifted young body-artists.

Just then, the door is kicked\n          open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the\n          Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our\n          guys.

They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the\n          end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.\n\n          CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB\n          Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again,\n          leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and,\n          finally, sprinting out the front door!\n\n          \n\n                                                                  53.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of\n          destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through\n          a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however,\n\n          THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS\n          being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble\n          backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS\n          pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground.\n\n                              CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD\n                        (to walkie talkie)\n                    Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder,\n                    we've subdued the targets, over.\n\n          EXT.

Get it out\n                    please.\n          Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He\n          opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a\n          pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks.\n          They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.\n\n                              ALAN\n                    I can't believe this is how we're\n                    going to die...\n          The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away.

You--\n          Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in\n          his massive stomach! And\n\n          NOTHING HAPPENS\n          Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy\n          PISTOL-WHIPS Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls\n          to the ground.\n\n                              VICK\n                    Christ that hurts!\n\n          \n\n                                                                     94.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag.
