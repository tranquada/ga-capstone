Mac glances \n               at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his \n               throat, gets up and leaves the room.\n\n               Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his \n               arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for \n               the first time in months.\n\n<b>               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING\n</b>\n               Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared \n               to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and \n               swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track \n               uniform and spikes.\n\n<b>                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n</b>                         Bleeker decided he didn't want to \n                         see the baby. Neither did I, really. \n                         He didn't feel like ours.\n\n<b>               INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING\n</b>\n               We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her \n               eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.\n\n<b>                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n</b>                         I think he was always hers.\n\n<b>               INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY\n</b>\n               The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate \n               taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the \n               antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.\n\n<b>                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n</b>                         It ended with a chair.\n\n               We pan past the wall Vanessa had said \"needed something.\" \n               There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was \n               handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it \n               says: \"Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno.\"\n\n               We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We \n               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her \n               shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa \n               looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There \n               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed \n               close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the \n               baby for a single moment.\n\n               The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows \n               with an expression of pure bliss.\n\n<b>               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n               It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle \n               out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who \n               is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost \n               as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.\n\n<b>               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY\n</b>\n               Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar \n               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not \n               pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.\n\n<b>                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n</b>                         As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is \n                         totally boss. He is the cheese to my \n                         macaroni. I know people are supposed \n                         to fall in love before they reproduce, \n                         but normalcy's not really our style.\n\n               As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she \n               passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in \n               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.\n\n               Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning \n               his guitar.\n\n<b>               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n               Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles \n               and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and \n               pulls the pick out of the strings.\n\n<b>                                     JUNO\n</b>                         Ready?\n\n               Bleeker nods.\n\n               Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing \"Anyone Else \n               But You,\" by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first \n               their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.\n\n<b>                                     BLEEKER\n</b>                         You're a part time lover and a \n                         fulltime friend. The monkey on your \n                         back is the latest trend. I don't \n                         see what anyone can see, in anyone \n                         else but you.\n\n<b>                                     JUNO\n</b>                         Here is the church and here is the \n                         steeple.

You want more fans, I want \n                         more stage. I don't see what anyone \n                         can see, in anyone else but you.\n\n<b>                                     JUNO\n</b>                         You are always trying to keep it \n                         real.

They smile \n               ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.\n\n               Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with \n               life and summer activity.\n\n<b>                                                              FADE TO BLACK\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Juno.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Juno</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Diablo Cody\" title=\"Scripts by Diablo Cody\">Diablo Cody</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Juno Script.html#comments\" title=\"Juno comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:08:56.125127"}
