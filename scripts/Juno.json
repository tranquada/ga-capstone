Juno is sixteen \n               years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces \n               and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object \n               of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned \n               curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking \n               leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless \n               latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         It started with a chair.\n\n               INT.

She slowly, clumsily lowers \n               herself onto his lap.\n\n               A 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player.\n\n                                     WHISPERED VOICE\n                         Do you know how long I've wanted \n                         this?\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     WHISPERED VOICE\n                         Wizard.\n\n               EXT.

DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the \n               commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily \n               tries to use the pregnancy test.\n\n               We see the test box sitting on the sink. It's a TeenWave \n               Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package \n               photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression. \n               The fine print on the box reads \"From the makers of Sun-Glitz \n               Lightening Hair Spritz!\"\n\n               INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY\n\n               Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the \n               open test box on the front counter.

MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING\n\n               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, \n               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super \n               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to \n               fashion a noose.\n\n               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE.

The girl bites her \n               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.\n\n               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting \n               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. \n               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist \n               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on \n               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their \n               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST\n                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?\n\n               There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.\n\n               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door \n               drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she \n               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.\n\n               EXT. LEAH'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno \n               standing sheepishly on the porch. Leah sighs.\n\n                                     LEAH\n                         What are you doing here, dumbass?

It smelled \n                         like a dentist in there. They had \n                         these really horrible magazines, \n                         with, like, spritz cookie recipes \n                         and bad fiction and water stains, \n                         like someone read them in the tub. \n                         And the receptionist tried to give \n                         me these weird condoms that looked \n                         like grape suckers, and she told me \n                         about her boyfriend's pie balls, and \n                         Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told \n                         me the baby had fingernails. \n                         Fingernails!\n\n                                     LEAH\n                         Oh, gruesome.

Juno discreetly tries to \n               charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her \n               from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely \n               awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.\n\n               Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's \n               bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration \n               hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like \n               something a 5-year old might have.\n\n               INT.

A bunch of us from the team are \n                         going to Benihana, then the prom, \n                         then Vijay's parents' cabin.\n\n               Juno is clearly AFFRONTED.\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                              (meekly)\n                         We're getting a stretch limo.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Your mom must be really glad you're \n                         not taking me.\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         You're mad. Why are you mad?\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great \n                         mood. Despite the fact that I'm \n                         trapped in a fat suit I can't take \n                         off, despite the fact that everyone \n                         is making fun of me behind my back, \n                         despite the fact that your little \n                         girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in \n                         art class yesterday...\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I \n                         doubt she was actually giving you \n                         the stinkeye. She just looks like \n                         that all the time.\n\n               A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look \n               aimed squarely at Juno.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Whatever. Have fun at the prom with \n                         Soupy Sales. I'm sure I can think of \n                         something way more cool to do that \n                         night. Like I could pumice my feet, \n                         or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church, \n                         or get hit by a ten-ton truck full \n                         of hot garbage juice. All those things \n                         would be exponentially cooler than \n                         going to the prom with you.\n\n               She starts to walk away.\n\n               Bleeker takes a deep breath.\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         You're being really immature.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                              (turning around)\n                         What?\n\n               Bleeker BRACES himself and pushes up his lab goggles.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         That's not how our thing works! I \n                         hurl the accusations and you talk me \n                         down, remember?\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         Not this time. You don't have any \n                         reason to be mad at me. You broke my \n                         heart. I should be royally ticked at \n                         you, man. I should be really cheesed \n                         off. I shouldn't want to talk to you \n                         anymore.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Why? Because I got bored and had sex \n                         with you one day, and then I didn't, \n                         like, marry you?\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         Like I'd marry you! You would be the \n                         meanest wife of all time. And anyway, \n                         I know you weren't bored that day \n                         because there was a lot of stuff on \n                         TV. The Blair Witch Project was on \n                         Starz, and you were like, \"Oh, I \n                         want to watch this, but we should \n                         make out instead. La la la.\"\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the \n                         Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure \n                         you guys will have a really bitchin' \n                         time!\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                              (searching for a \n                              comeback)\n                         Yeah, well...

Are you ashamed that we did \n                         it?\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         No...\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Well at least you don't have to walk \n                         around with the evidence under your \n                         sweater. I'm a planet!\n\n               Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her \n               shoulder. She's about to walk away, when...\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         Wait, let me take that.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Huh?\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         You shouldn't be carrying that heavy \n                         bag.

What's another ten \n                         pounds?\n\n               She turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no \n               one sees) and continues down the hallway.\n\n               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - PREVIA - DAY\n\n               Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine, \n               then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She \n               produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview \n               mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some \n               Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.\n\n               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY\n\n               Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie \n               website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive. \n               The doorbell rings.\n\n               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY\n\n               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly \n               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a \n               grin.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                              (furtive)\n                         Is Vanessa here?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Nope. We're safe.\n\n               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Cool.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Come on, I have something for you.\n\n               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.\n\n               INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON\n\n               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and \n               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain \n               to illuminate a bare bulb.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Oh, Mark!

No, I just keep all of my \n                         old comics down here, and I want to \n                         show you one of them.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         You're gonna like this, I promise.\n\n               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.\n\n                                     MARK\n                              (extracting a bagged \n                              COMIC from the box)\n                         Here it is.\n\n               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called \"Most Fruitful Yuki.\" \n               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking \n               names.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         \"Most Fruitful Yuki\"?

I got it when I \n                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds \n                         me of you.\n\n               Juno examines the comic. \"Most Fruitful Yuki\" does resemble \n               her.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a \n                         fat dork now.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. \n                         You should be proud to be the same \n                         condition.\n\n               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!\n\n               Juno is sincerely pleased.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Okay, how about some tunes?\n\n               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner.

She struggles with the keys, \n               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON\n\n               The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the \n               shoulder.\n\n               INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON\n\n               Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for \n               the first time since she became pregnant.\n\n               After a beat, she begins to gather herself.\n\n               INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. \n               He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise.\n\n               EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT\n\n               Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. \n               We push in close... when she gets an idea.\n\n               She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she \n               finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and \n               pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?\n\n               EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting \n               alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of \n               wine.\n\n               INT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events \n               sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join \n               her.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I called Gerta Rauss. She says she \n                         can represent both of us. They call \n                         it \"collaborative divorce.\" It's \n                         apparently all the rage right now. \n                         And it's easy because we don't have \n                         children.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         No, it's fine. Thanks for making the \n                         call, I guess.\n\n               Mark nods and sits down.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         We're actually, finally doing this?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Looks like it, yeah.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         Have you found a place to stay?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Yeah, downtown.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         A hotel?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         It's a loft.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                              (lightly teasing)\n                         Aren't you the cool guy?\n\n               They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         I wanted a baby so bad. So bad.\n\n               She buries her head in her hands.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I know you did.\n\n               There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.\n\n               EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT\n\n               Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting \n               on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the \n               van.\n\n               Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute \n               because of Juno's proficiency in \"teen girl origami.\" He \n               holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.\n\n               Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, \n               examining it.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         It's for me.\n\n               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's \n               been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         I never realize how much I like being \n                         home unless I've been somewhere really \n                         different for a while.\n\n               She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch \n               and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly \n               with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.\n\n               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family \n               finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes.\n\n               Juno enters.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Hi Dad.\n\n                                     MAC\n                         Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. \n                         Where have you been?\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Dealing with stuff way beyond my \n                         maturity level.

Good \n                         mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, \n                         handsome, what have you, the right \n                         person will still think that the sun \n                         shines out your ass.

BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the \n               window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah \n               running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off.\n\n               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING\n\n               Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning \n               run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the \n               stoop: \"BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL.\"\n\n               He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch \n               on the mailbox.\n\n               At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come \n               pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the \n               driveway. Bleeker smiles.\n\n               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING\n\n               Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team, \n               ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. \n               They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching \n               and jogs up to the chainlink fence.\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         Did you put like a hundred things of \n                         Tic Tacs in my mailbox?\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Yeah.

She revs a \n               Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll. \n               Juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked. She pats \n               her lap frantically and jumps off the bed.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Dad!\n\n               INTERCUT WITH:\n\n               INT.

She's being pushed \n               down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair. She bursts into \n               giggles. Pull back to reveal her that Leah is pushing her \n               rather aggressively. Leah jokingly steers the wheelchair \n               into a wall. Juno feigns whiplash.\n\n               Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the \n               wheelchair, exasperated. She pulls off Juno's surgical cap. \n               Leah and Juno snicker.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY\n\n               We see Juno is in a BIRTHING SUITE at the hospital, pacing \n               impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort. She's wearing \n               her Chuck Taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown. \n               Leah and Bren stand nearby.\n\n               Juno doubles over in pain.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                              (panicked)\n                         Ow, ow, fuckity-ow.

Leah \n               holds one of Juno's feet and Bren holds the other.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         The best part was when I peed on \n                         Leah during labor.\n\n               We see Leah holding Juno's FOOT, which is shaking. Leah's \n               shirt is soaked. She rolls her eyes and mouths \"Fuck you\" at \n               Juno. Juno's raised MIDDLE FINGER enters the frame.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         And then, out of nowhere, there it \n                         was...\n\n               The doctor reveals JUNO'S BABY BOY above the sheet.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         There he was.\n\n               Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to \n               flutter... and she passes out.\n\n               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - AFTERNOON\n\n               Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him \n               on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the \n               bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate \n               Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding \n               a video camera.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         I decided to not call Bleeker to \n                         tell him that I was having the baby. \n                         He had a big meet against Manteno \n                         and I didn't want him to get all \n                         worried about me and choke.\n\n               Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race.

She spends a few moments just looking at him.\n\n               She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren \n               leaning against the doorway.\n\n               Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         How do I look?\n\n                                     BREN\n                              (gently)\n                         Like a mom.

The birth \n               is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and \n               accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared \n               out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's \n               not sure what to say.\n\n               He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, \n               but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His \n               expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.\n\n                                     MAC\n                         Someday, you'll be back here, honey. \n                         On your terms.\n\n               Juno nods and swallows.\n\n               Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway. \n               It's Bleeker in his track uniform.\n\n               Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances \n               at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his \n               throat, gets up and leaves the room.\n\n               Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his \n               arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for \n               the first time in months.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING\n\n               Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared \n               to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and \n               swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track \n               uniform and spikes.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         Bleeker decided he didn't want to \n                         see the baby. Neither did I, really. \n                         He didn't feel like ours.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING\n\n               We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her \n               eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         I think he was always hers.\n\n               INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY\n\n               The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate \n               taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the \n               antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         It ended with a chair.\n\n               We pan past the wall Vanessa had said \"needed something.\" \n               There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was \n               handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it \n               says: \"Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno.\"\n\n               We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We \n               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her \n               shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa \n               looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There \n               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed \n               close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the \n               baby for a single moment.\n\n               The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows \n               with an expression of pure bliss.\n\n               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY\n\n               It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle \n               out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who \n               is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost \n               as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.\n\n               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY\n\n               Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar \n               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not \n               pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.\n\n                                     JUNO (V.O.)\n                         As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is \n                         totally boss. He is the cheese to my \n                         macaroni. I know people are supposed \n                         to fall in love before they reproduce, \n                         but normalcy's not really our style.\n\n               As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she \n               passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in \n               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.\n\n               Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning \n               his guitar.\n\n               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles \n               and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and \n               pulls the pick out of the strings.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Ready?\n\n               Bleeker nods.\n\n               Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing \"Anyone Else \n               But You,\" by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first \n               their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         You're a part time lover and a \n                         fulltime friend. The monkey on your \n                         back is the latest trend. I don't \n                         see what anyone can see, in anyone \n                         else but you.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         Here is the church and here is the \n                         steeple. We sure are cute for two \n                         ugly people. I don't see what anyone \n                         can see, in anyone else but you.\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         We both have shiny happy fits of \n                         rage. You want more fans, I want \n                         more stage. I don't see what anyone \n                         can see, in anyone else but you.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         You are always trying to keep it \n                         real. I'm in love with how you feel. \n                         I don't see what anyone can see, in \n                         anyone else but you.\n\n                                     BLEEKER\n                         I kiss you on the brain in the shadow \n                         of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, \n                         my body's swinging from side to side. \n                         I don't see what anyone can see, in \n                         anyone else but you.\n\n                                     JUNO\n                         The pebbles forgive me, the trees \n                         forgive me. So why can't you forgive \n                         me? I don't see what anyone can see, \n                         in anyone else but you.\n\n                                     JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER\n                         Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du \n                         du du dudu. I don't see what anyone \n                         can see, in anyone else but you.\n\n               She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile \n               ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.\n\n               Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with \n               life and summer activity.\n\n                                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nJuno\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Diablo Cody\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:29.574461"}
