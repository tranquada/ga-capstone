BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY\n\n     A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround\n     an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana\n     palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.\n\n     Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the\n     waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of\n     the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.\n\n     For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many\n     VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.\n\n     The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger\n     than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder.\n\n     INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\n     A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.\n     The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a\n     veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to\n     have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight\n     shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...\n\n     SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish,\n     drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids,\n     in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.\n\n     His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon\n     the girls.\n\n     KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.\n\n     NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's\n     walk, then turns to the girl at her side...\n\n     KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.\n\n                                  NICOLE\n                  When we graduate the only thing I'm\n                  going to miss is...\n                         (with a nod to the stage)\n                  Know what I mean?\n\n     Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam.  Nicole has to nudge her.\n\n                                  NICOLE (CONT'D)\n                  Kelly?\n\n                                  KELLY\n                         (still staring)\n                  Oh yeah.\n\n     Sam is at the podium.  He looks out across the audience.  There\n     are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.  Sam smiles,\n     silencing them with a wave of his hand.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  We've come to the halfway point in my\n                  senior seminars...\n\n     Cheers, applause.  Sam waits for the kids to settle.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?\n\n                                  JIMMY (O.S.)\n                  No!\n\n     Boos as we FIND...\n\n     JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique\n     of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue\n     Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...\n\n     SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just\n     enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a\n     loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Thank you, Jimmy.\n\n                                  JIMMY\n                  Hey, man, at least in study hail I could\n                  meditate.\n\n                                  KIRK (O.S.)\n                  He means masturbate...\n\n     This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...\n\n     KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Something Kirk with which I'm sure you\n                  have hands-on experience.\n\n     Loud laughter.  Sam quiets them again, then turns to the\n     blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X.\n     The kids start to cheer.\n\n     Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.\n\n     The cheering fades into silence.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  We've all heard the words, date rape,\n                  sexual harassment.  We've talked about\n                  some of these things in this room.\n                         (beat)\n                  Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay\n                  Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray\n                  Duquette and Gloria Perez.\n                         (beat)\n                  They're here to give you what we hope\n                  will be a fresh perspective on these\n                  subjects, and to answer any questions\n                  you night have.\n\n     Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...\n\n     RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light\n     heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.  He's dressed in a dark\n     suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.\n\n     GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter\n     than Ray, with a sweet face.  Attractive but no stunner.\n\n     About five kids applaud.  Ray takes the podium.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Thank you for having us.  We'll each\n                  talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then\n                  open it up to your questions...\n\n     IN THE AUDIENCE\n\n     Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.  As she passes behind\n     Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  I'm not going to listen to this\n                  jack-off.\n\n     She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..\n\n     Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Let's begin with a question.  What is a\n                  sex crime?\n\n     A moment.\n\n                                  JIMMY\n                  Not getting any.\n\n     This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles\n     from Sam and Gloria.  And none at all from Ray Duquette.\n\n     EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\n     The kids change classes.  Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass.\n     The kids swarm past.  A pair of girls flash by.\n\n                                  CAROLE\n                  Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.\n\n                                  SAM\n\n                  Hey, Carole, you too.  And be good.\n\n                                  CAROLE\n                         (beneath a pouty look)\n                  I hate to be good.\n\n     The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.\n\n     INT. BUILDING - DAY\n\n                                  SAM\n                  This is one of the original buildings.\n                  We have the offices here now.\n\n     The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs.\n     Gloria stops before one of the photos.\n\n     ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH\n\n     An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to\n     another age.\n\n     A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat\n     under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an\n     unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the\n     line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has\n     fixed upon is the future itself.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  Anybody in particular?\n\n     When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.  He\n     stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Sam Lombardo.  The first.

Say hello to Detectives Perez and\n                  Duquette.\n                         (to the cops)\n                  Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.\n\n     Art and the detectives shake hands.\n\n                                  ART\n                  So, did you set 'em all straight on the\n                  ugly facts of life?\n\n                                  SAM\n                  I have the feeling, they got it down\n                  already.  They're a step ahead of us,\n                  Artie.\n\n     Gloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks\n     at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at\n     which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  I've got that two o'clock in town.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                         (nodding)\n                  Back to the land of grownups.\n\n     The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.\n\n                                  SAM\n                         (to Gloria)\n                  If old pictures interest you, come back\n                  some time, there's quite a collection\n                  down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a\n                  proper tour.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                         (smiling)\n                  I'd like that.\n\n     Ray opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it.\n\n     Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway.\n     Sam remains near the doors, watching as...\n\n     ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL\n\n     Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range\n     Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus,\n     which they get into and drive away.\n\n     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER\n\n     Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden\n     pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the\n     bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.\n\n     ANGLE ON DOCKS\n\n     As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one\n     student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets\n     about tying off the boat.\n\n     Sam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.\n\n                                  SAM\n                         (loud enough to be heard\n                          by his class)\n                  Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil\n                  those dock lines and I'll see you all on\n                  Monday.\n\n     He watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon\n     the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in\n     work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.\n\n     EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER\n\n     hosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as...\n     A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake.\n\n                                  JIMMY\n                  All right.  I could party on that.\n\n     Sam just laughs at him.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  That's about all it's good for.\n                         (beat)\n                  That's the one to have.\n\n     He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the\n     bay, under sail.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  The Windward Passage.

No way was\n                  my old man going to spring for the\n                  fees...\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Hey, you're working for it.\n                         (beneath a laugh)\n                  Least you're supposed to be.\n\n     He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but\n     catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.\n\n                                  VOICE (O.S.)\n                  Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys?\n\n     Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the\n     dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse\n     knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at\n     the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam\n     with a coy smile.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  So who's washing your car this weekend,\n                  Mr. Lombardo?\n                         (off Sam's blank look)\n                  The senior car wash, remember?\n                         (beat)\n                  Tamara's making a schedule.  She said\n                  you bought a coupon but you're not on\n                  anybody's list.\n\n     Sam smiles, remembering.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a\n                  Washing ticket, support the effort.\n                  That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste\n                  of time, don't you think?\n\n     Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the\n     dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I\n                  do it?  We're working as a team.\n\n     Sam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out\n                  to the Everglades on Saturday.

My\n                  ride wasn't there.  You suppose you\n                  could give me one?\n\n     Sam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school.\n\n                                  KELLY (CONT'D)\n                  You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?\n                  I mean like, something bad might happen.\n\n     Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who\n     seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?\n\n                                  JIMMY\n                         (still looking at Kelly)\n                  What?\n\n                                  SAM\n                  A ride.  You want one?\n\n                                 JIMMY\n                  Yeah.  But I got my bike.\n\n     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY\n\n     Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning\n     that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which\n     is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His\n     arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy.\n\n     As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit\n     VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.\n\n     A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall\n     black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...\n\n     Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff\n     jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.\n\n     Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  We got room for one more, Suzie.  You\n                  need a ride?\n\n     Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes?\n                  Whores-4-Less?\n\n     Suzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the\n     key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then\n     sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.\n\n                                  KELLY (CONT'D)\n                  That's cute.\n\n     Suzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie,\n     offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.\n\n                                  KELLY (CONT'D)\n                         (to Suzie)\n                  I hope you swallow it.\n\n     Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.\n\n     EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY\n\n     Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid\n     lush, tropical settings.\n\n     Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words \"VAN RYAN\"\n     woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long\n     drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches\n     in a code.  The gates swing open.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  Don't forget the car wash.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  I won't.\n\n     SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42\n     in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When\n     she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.\n\n     Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her\n     mother coming toward her, her face hardens.\n\n                                  SANDRA\n                  Is that Sam Lombardo?\n\n                                  KELLY\n                         (sarcastic)\n                  Hi, Mon.\n\n                                  SANDRA\n                  Sam!

Running over alligators with that\n                  silly swamp jalopy when you could be\n                  sailing a real boat...\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you\n                  a look into the muck we all crawled out\n                  of.  You ought to try it some time.\n\n     Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.\n\n     CLOSE ON KELLY\n\n     still at the door, a cold smile on her face.\n\n                                                 FADE TO:\n\n     EXT.

Pull over.\n\n     Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses.  Sam's muddy\n     Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive.  Behind that is a red\n     Mercedes convertible.\n\n     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME\n\n     Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on\n     the bed.  Barbara is dressed for tennis.  Sam wears a baggy pair\n     of khaki shorts.  Barbara struggles to escape.  Sam grabs a leg,\n     kisses the back of her knee.\n\n     He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her\n     thighs.\n\n                                  BARBARA\n                         (getting just a little\n                          breathless)\n                  Sam, come on...

FRONT DOOR - SAM'S HOUSE - LATER\n\n     Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet\n     T-shirt derby, ring the bell.\n\n     Sam answers.  He looks them over.  A couple of houses down he can\n     see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching\n     the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  So, where you off to now?\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  Aren't  you forgetting something?\n                          (off Sam's look)\n                  Your coupon.

As she hits the street, she begins\n     to run.\n\n     The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer.\n     He watches as the girl runs by.\n\n     The teenagers are still playing hoops.  They stop as Kelly jogs\n     past, sobbing.  They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac\n     and DISAPPEARS around a corner.\n\n     EXT. THE EVERGLADES - DAY\n\n     Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat,\n     rips through the Florida swamp land.\n\n     He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall\n     grass which whips at the hull of his boat.  Bits and pieces of\n     debris fly through the air.  Sam smiles, swinging the boat\n     through a series of wide, sliding turns.\n\n     Suddenly he spots something.  He throttles down gliding into a\n     shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found\n     out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Sly old fucker.  How you got so big,\n                  wasn't it?\n\n     Sam sits for a moment in the silence.

At last he lowers the binoculars,\n     revs up his engine and leaves.\n\n     ANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT\n\n     as it moves away, as SEEN from water level where...\n\n     The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold\n     primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky\n     waters of the swamp.\n\n     EXT.

They\n     kiss.  She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.  His clothes\n     fall away.  Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.

Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big,\n     buffed-out Cuban.  They're making love on the bed.  She throws\n     her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is\n     near, as...\n\n     A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.  They try to ignore\n     it.  No dice.

She moves toward the guest house.  A used-brick cottage\n     tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan\n     tree.

Others of Kelly\n     and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their\n     rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.\n\n     Sandra and Kelly ENTER.

The sobbing has stopped but\n     her shoulders continue to shake.  Sandra sits on the edge of the\n     bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.\n\n                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)\n                  Can I get you anything?\n\n     Kelly shakes her head, no.\n\n     Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss.  At last she stands.\n     She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the\n     words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.\n\n                                  SANDRA\n                  What, honey?  I can't hear you.\n\n     There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself.  She stares at\n     the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she\n     enunciates each word.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  I said.

George reaches out to touch his arm.\n\n                                  GEORGE\n                  Mr. Lombardo.\n\n     Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish\n     bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her\n     father, Tom Baxter.\n\n     Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.\n\n                                  BAXTER\n                  This is not appropriate Lombardo.\n\n     Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.\n\n     Barbara has tears in her eyes.  She looks at Sam, then shakes her\n     head, looking away.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Barbara...\n\n                                  BAZTER\n                  You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo.\n                  You've been scratching at the door long\n                  enough...\n                         (as Sam faces him)\n                  I ever see you around my daughter,\n                  you're going to be finished, period.\n\n     The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed\n     by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way\n     across the room.\n\n     Sam sees them too.  He takes a final look at Barbara.  When she\n     refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd\n     and out of the restaurant.\n\n     EXT. AN EVERGLADES ROADHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room.  A handful of\n     trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.\n\n     INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     The air is thick with smoke.  Locals shoot pool.  The walls are\n     decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.\n\n     An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a\n     pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...\n\n     Sam, alone, awaiting service.\n\n                                  BARMAID\n                  Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a\n                  while.  How's life treatin' you?\n                         (off Sam's look)\n                  That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the\n                  right place.\n\n     EXT. ROADHOUSE - LATER\n\n     Sam walks outside.  He stands in the red glow of neon light,\n     looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...\n\n     ... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco\n     bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.\n\n     Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.\n\n     Sam stares at the motel.  At last he gets in his Jeep.  As he\n     EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.\n\n     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT\n\n     A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp.  Trees bearded\n     with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.\n\n     INT./EXT. SAM'S JEEP - MOVING - SAME\n\n     San drives -- a tired face.  Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.\n\n     Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the\n     headlights.  Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...\n\n     A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.\n\n     Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of\n     something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview\n     mirror, coming fast.  Sam watches as the lights get closer.  He\n     looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...\n\n     Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.  A black Range\n     Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,\n     cutting him off.\n\n     It happens quickly.  Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,\n     but the road affords little margin for error.\n\n     The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a\n     steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM\n     BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.\n\n     Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.  Somewhere over his head\n     he can see headlights shining into the trees.\n\n     He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down\n     the embankment.\n\n     Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.  Someone is\n     approaching, splashing through the muck.  Suddenly a hand reaches\n     through the broken driver's window, helping him.\n\n                                  MAN'S VOICE\n                  Are you all right?\n\n     The hands get him loose.  Sam stumbles from the car.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Yeah, I'm okay.\n\n     He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.\n\n                                  FRANKIE\n                  That's too bad.\n\n     He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.  What we are left with is\n     the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the\n     hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.\n\n     Frankie is breathing hard.  We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the\n     embankment.  We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,\n     leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.\n\n     EXT. THE STRIP MALL - DAY\n\n     Dazzling light.  Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken\n     Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.\n\n     INT. BEEF BOWL - SAME\n\n     Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken\n     with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.\n\n                                  KEN\n                  I figured, you know, it would be darker\n                  in here.\n\n     He moves a hand to his face.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Good thinking.\n\n                                  KEN\n                  You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van\n                  Ryan...\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Forget it.\n\n                                  KEN\n                  Lady has some deep pockets.

I\n                  thought I might be able to save my\n                  fucking house with an equity loan.\n                  Guess who's on the board of directors at\n                  the bank?\n\n     He pauses to look at Ken Bowden.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  Can't you take that stupid thing off?\n\n                                  KEN\n                  Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here\n                  for lunch sometimes.\n\n     San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.\n\n                                  KEN (CONT'D)\n                  You're not in bad shape, really.

He pulls out some papers, tosses\n     them on the table.  Sam picks one up, starts to read.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Nellie Gail Ranch...\n\n                                  KEN\n                  Sound nice?

When Sam speaks again, it is in a\n     calmer voice, calm but tired.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  I had to go look for this coupon.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  The one you bought at school.\n\n                                  SAM\n                         (nodding)\n                  Like I said, I hadn't really expected to\n                  use it.\n                         (beat)\n                  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.

I leave my\n                  room, and there's Kelly.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Yes.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  And she wanted to talk.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Yes.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  But you can't tell us what she wanted to\n                  talk about.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  I could, but it's confidential.  Look,\n                  the point is, we didn't talk.

Ray stares into the dusty light of an\n     approaching sunset.

A sign reads:  \"NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET.\"  The\n     jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.\n\n     As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --\n     along the bank of the canal...\n\n     ANGLE ON BANK\n\n     where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms\n     kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.

This time moving round to the front of\n     the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.\n\n                                  VOICE (0.5.)\n                  He's just showin' off for you now.\n\n     Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up\n     beside her.  The woman is in her sixties.  She's dressed in\n     polyester.  Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to\n     be anything but a dye job.

Gloria walks\n     to his desk.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  You saw the news today?\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  Lombardo's settlement?\n\n     Ray nods.\n\n                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)\n                  Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna\n                  make us look stupid.\n\n     Ray gives her a long look.  Gloria waits a moment, shrugs.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Hey, don't back away from it, you were\n                  right.

Lombardo had an\n                  affair with Sandra, right?\n                         (Gloria nods)\n                  So why not tell us about the affair?  I\n                  mean it could be a hell of a motive for\n                  Kelly to fabricate her charge in the\n                  first place.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the\n                  affair for the trial.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  I thought of that.

The gate closes.\n\n     Ray's pickup drives past.  He drives to a big lot where one of\n     the mansions has been torn down.  He drives up onto the dirt,\n     keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his\n     little skiff out of the back once more.\n\n     He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a\n     Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm\n     waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.\n\n     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on\n     toward the jacuzzi.  The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.\n\n     Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.  Suzie, the contrast --\n     pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.  They\n     argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.\n\n     EXT. THE BAY - SAME\n\n     Ray has arrived near the docks.  He has killed his engine,\n     maneuvering here with a single oar.

He takes a position behind\n     the cabanas, readies his camera.\n\n     EXT.

CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n     Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer.\n\n     Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes.\n\n                                  HUNTER\n                  Oh, Ray... no...\n\n                                  RAY\n                  You think this is just about money,\n                  about us looking foolish?

And those\n                  girls are going to wind up dead...\n\n     Sam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria\n     looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.\n\n                                  HUNTER\n                  Mr. Lombardo, please.

Let\n                  him look into the Kennedy assassination.\n\n     Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they\n     can be separated once again.\n\n                                  SAM (CCNT'D)\n                         (to Hunter)\n                  Next time this guy drags me down here,\n                  I'll sue you.  You're goddamn lucky I\n                  didn't sue you the first time!\n\n     Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.  Ray stares after\n     them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Guess I kind of lost it there.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  You could say that.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Were you ever in a situation where you\n                  could see a thing coming and you didn't\n                  do what you could to stop it?\n\n     Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  We all have...\n\n                                  RAY\n                  I mean something bad, Gloria, something\n                  bad you saw coning, and you didn't do\n                  anything, and then it happened.\n                         (off Gloria's silence)\n                  I did that once.

He looks toward the parking lot where --\n\n     Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet\n     then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A\n     moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  You look pretty.\n\n                                  BARBARA\n                  Thanks.\n\n     Sam smiles.  She points to the stuff beneath his arm.\n\n                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)\n                  Quite a shopping spree...\n\n     She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it.\n\n                                  BARBARA (CONT'D)\n                  I didn't mean...\n\n     Sam laughs it off.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend\n                  it, right?  I've always wanted to live\n                  where I could dive for my dinner.\n\n                                  BARBARA\n                  And where might that be?\n\n                                  SAM\n                  I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.\n\n                                  BARBARA\n                  I love Antigua.\n                         (beat)\n                  Maybe I'll come visit you.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  I'd like that.\n\n     A moment, she touches his face.  Sam raises a hand to cover hers,\n     as...\n\n     ... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above\n     the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.\n\n     INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN\n\n     seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance.\n\n     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV\n\n     Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.  Barbara\n     leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.\n\n     CLOSE ON KELLY\n\n     lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of\n     ENGINE NOISE.  She turns to find...\n\n     Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.\n\n     Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.  She's wearing a\n     black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.  As she settles in\n     the seat, she lets out a long breath.\n\n     Kelly makes a face, fans the air.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  Jesus.  What are you drinking?\n\n     Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag.\n\n                                  KELLY (CONT'D)\n                         (looking at the bottle)\n                  Anybody ever tell you that stuff will\n                  rot your brain?\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  What brain?\n\n     Suzie takes a big drink.  Kelly shakes her head, looks back\n     toward the entrance.\n\n     ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV\n\n     empty.  Sam and Barbara are gone.\n\n     Kelly continues to stare.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  What are you looking at?\n\n                                  KELLY\n                         (starting the car)\n                  Nothing.\n\n     EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT\n\n     The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the\n     last red light drains from the sky.\n\n     The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks.\n\n     INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - SAME\n\n     Kelly turns off the engine.  Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the\n     MD 20/20.  She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  I thought we were goin' to a movie.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  I think we just need to get wasted.\n\n     Suzie shrugs, gets out.  Kelly gets out with her.  Suzie\n     staggers.  Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,\n     begins leading her down the beach.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  I wanna live at the beach someday.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  Shit.\n\n     She stops walking.  Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to\n     look at her.\n\n                                  KELLY (CONT'D)\n                  I left the keys.  I'll get 'em.\n\n     Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.  She\n     watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath\n     her breath, then lies on her back.\n\n     SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY\n\n     The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.  She rolls to one side, looking down\n     the beach\n\n     Murky blackness.\n\n     She tries to focus, sits up.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  Kelly?\n\n     She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.\n\n     A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.\n\n                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)\n                  Kelly?\n\n     The shape gets closer and closer, until...\n\n     Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.\n\n     She takes a step back.\n\n     Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.  He carries something in his\n     other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Suzie, it's okay.  It's me.\n\n     Suzie steadies herself.  A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  I was worried about you, Suzie.  I\n                  decided we should all get together, one\n                  more time, before we split up.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  Are you mad at me?\n\n                                  SAM\n                  No, no.  Look, I probably should have\n                  told you a little more, about the part I\n                  intended to play.\n                         (beat)\n                  We'll go through it all again tonight.\n\n     Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  This is a celebration Suzie, not a\n                  suicide pact.\n\n     He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  We'll chill out first, have a drink,\n                  watch the stars.\n\n     Suzie nods.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the\n                  Jeep.  Could you get it for us?\n\n     Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...\n\n     Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.\n\n                                  SAM (CONT'D)\n                  Let me tell you about this boat I picked\n                  out for us...\n\n     They move OUT OF SIGHT.  Kelly continues to walk, back along the\n     sand toward the cars.\n\n     INSERT - A SCREAM\n\n     A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall\n     silently on dark stone.\n\n     Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,\n     where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the\n     seats.  She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the\n     beach.  As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --\n     it seems like forever\n\n     Sam APP\u00a3ARS before her on the sand.  The champagne bottle swings\n     loosely at the end of one arm.  it looks shiny now, dripping with\n     Suzie's blood.\n\n     Kelly goes to him.  She looks at the bottle, then throws herself\n     against him -- a hard kiss.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to\n                  happen like this.  She was losing it...\n\n                                  KELLY\n                         (breathless)\n                  There was no way.  That cop would've\n                  gotten her to tell him... everything.\n                  She was weak and dumb...\n\n     She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.  Sam takes\n     a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry\n     eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at\n     which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he\n     can into the black waves.\n\n     EXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER\n\n     Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.\n\n     Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to\n     the rear hatch.  As they heft her inside, the light catches --\n\n     SUZIE'S FACE\n\n     A mask of blood.\n\n     Kelly turns away in disgust.  She goes to the passenger side\n     door, gets in.\n\n     Sam gets in behind the wheel.  For a moment the two of them just\n     sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their\n     own BREATHING.  Sam looks at Kelly.\n\n     She is focused on the dark Atlantic.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Are you okay?\n\n     Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                         (a long beat)\n                  My mom would kill me if she knew I took\n                  the Rover.\n\n     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT\n\n     Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.\n\n     SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in\n     waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.\n\n     EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n     Almost empty of cars.  The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW,\n     circles, comes back.  Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets\n     into the VW and backs it out.\n\n     EXT. BUS TERMINAL (MIAMI) - DAY\n\n     Almost dawn.  A long parking lot fronts the terminal.  Suzie's VW\n     arrives, parks, Sam gets out.  He goes to the waiting Range\n     Rover, gets in and drives away.\n\n     EXT. FRONT GATE - VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY\n\n     A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER\n\n     flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street.\n\n     A HAND touches the water.\n\n     PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.\n\n     EXT. VAN RYAN DRIVEWAY - SAME\n\n     Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens,\n     looking toward the house where...\n\n     On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight\n     shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover.  She looks up, sees...\n\n     Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive,\n     arriving at the wrought-iron gates.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Been four-wheelin'?\n\n     Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time.\n\n                                  KELLY\n                  Get off my property.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  I'm not on your property!\n\n     He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and\n     harder.\n\n     Kelly backs away, frightened.\n\n     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY\n\n     Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building,\n     talking to Ruby.

THE BEACH - DAY\n\n     Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the\n     big rocks.  Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.  Ray\n     wears a suit.

Still,\n     the idea generates a laugh.\n\n                                  RAY (CONT'D)\n                  I say something funny?\n\n                                  JIMMY\n                  No.  But I mean... just the idea that\n                  Mr. Lombardo would...\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with\n                  the kids, one of the guys...\n\n                                  JIMMY\n                  Yeah, but...\n\n     He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.  Ray brushes\n     away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking\n     tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets.\n\n     Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees.\n\n     CLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS\n\n     as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone.\n\n     Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand.\n\n     Jimmy stares at the teeth.\n\n     Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.\n                  You can catch a bus up there at the lot,\n                  okay?\n\n     Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.  He starts\n     toward the lot.\n\n     Ray watches for a moment.  Then calls out to him.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  People aren't always what they appear to\n                  be, kid.  Remember it.\n\n     Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying,\n     clearly disturbed by the implications.  But he asks no more\n     questions.  He turns, trudging alone back through the sand.\n\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT.

This thing\n                  worked out just like you said, only\n                  better.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Kelly was supposed to be framed, not\n                  killed.\n                         (beat)\n                  What I'm telling you is, I don't like\n                  surprises.\n\n     Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a\n     bucket of ice.  He opens the bottle, fills two glasses.  He hands\n     one of the glasses to Sam.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Every cloud has a silver lining,\n                  partner.  Here's to no loose ends.\n\n     He raises his glass in a toast.\n\n     Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well.  Ray smiles.  Sam\n     doesn't.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Here's to no more surprises.\n\n     Ray shrugs.  The two men's eyes meet.  They touch glasses and\n     drink.\n\n     EXT. SMALL BOAT HARBOR (ISLAND) - DAY\n\n     Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear,\n     loading supplies.\n\n     The boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky.\n     Palms sway.

She looks\n     toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen.\n\n     Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby.  She's just in\n     time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its\n     front legs, jaws sprung wide.

Used to live\n                  down the road there in a wrecked car.\n                  Him and Suzie were at the Glades that\n                  night.\n                         (beat)\n                  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie\n                  busted and sent her away.

There were going to be roads and\n                  houses.  There was going to be a town.\n                  They were going to call it Salt Creek.\n\n     EXT. OCEAN - DAY\n\n     From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the\n     distance.  The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME.\n\n     On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.  Ray lounges\n     on the deck.  The boat sails easily before the wind.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Ray... you see that winch by your head?\n                  Take a couple of turns on it for me,\n                  she's luffing.\n\n     Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  You mean this thing?\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Yes, we call it a winch.\n                         (pointing at pieces of\n                          the rigging)\n                  And these are shrouds, and these are\n                  stays.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  I thought this was supposed to be a\n                  vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big\n                  power boat?\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of\n                  you yet.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Yeah, or get me drowned.\n\n     Ray kneels.  He begins to tighten the winch.\n\n     Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back\n     to unhook the short line which holds the boom.\n\n     The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc,\n     directly at Ray.\n\n     Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.\n\n     The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines,\n     where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.\n\n     Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the\n     deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.\n\n     The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a\n     small ground swell.\n\n     The two men face each other.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Jesus, man... You okay?\n\n                                  RAY\n                  That how you planned it?  You take cut\n                  Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then\n                  dump me in the ocean...\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Come off it, man... It was an accident.\n\n     Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and\n     starts with it toward Sam.\n\n     Sam looks around.  He jerks open a storage compartment.  A\n     diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over\n     his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,\n     preparing to throw.\n\n     Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.  The boom\n     sweeps the deck.\n\n     Sam throws the belt.\n\n     Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself,\n     a mean grin spreading across his face.\n\n     There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.\n\n     Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,\n     well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.\n\n     Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's\n     as far as he gets.\n\n     WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down,\n     the handle skittering across the deck.\n\n     Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he\n     sees something else.  He draws in his hand as if bitten.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  You... You're...\n\n     He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at\n     his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed.\n     But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.\n\n                                  RAY (CONT'D)\n                  You're dead... for godsake...\n\n     The boat heels over.  The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the\n     edge of the cockpit.  He grimaces in pain as...\n\n     Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.  She's wearing a bikini\n     and showing a nice tan.  She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a\n     fresh spear at the ready.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  Rumors of my demise have been greatly\n                  exaggerated.\n                         (to Sam)\n                  Nice move.  Good thing I was here to\n                  save your incompetent ass.\n\n     Sam secures the boom.  Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with\n     some combination of pain, rage and fear.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  You... I should've killed you myself.\n                  should never have left it up to him...\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  Shoulda, coulda, woulda...\n                         (to Sam)\n                  Get him in the water.\n\n     San starts for Ray.\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Sam, for Christ's sake...\n\n     Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear.  He stops.\n\n     Ray clings to a safety line.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  I can't.\n\n     WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder.  He loses his\n     grip.  The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water.\n\n     Suzie puts down her spear gun.  She goes to a storage locker,\n     takes out a bait bucket.  She steps up on the deck.\n\n     Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around\n     him.  He calls out...\n\n                                  RAY\n                  Sam, for godsake.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  Hey, Ray.

Girl read every book\n                  she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.\n\n     Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a\n     photograph on the bed.  It is one we have seen before.\n\n     ANGLE ON PHOTO\n\n     A stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.  White hair, a\n     white handlebar mustache.  A derby on his knee, a walking stick\n     at his side.  He stares out at the world from a high-backed\n     wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers.\n\n     Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- \"WILLIAM TECUMSEH\n     VAN RYAN.\"  And beside that, in another hand -- \"Dear old Dad.\"\n\n                                  RUBY\n                  Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy\n                  the people who invested here.  He got to\n                  be old, he and his rich cronies would\n                  come down here, hunt and whore, act like\n                  assholes.  One trip he showed up with\n                  this young girl he'd picked up\n                  somewhere, gotten her pregnant then\n                  dumped her in the swamp.\n                         (indicating the photo)\n                  That came with her.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  And the child...\n\n                                  RUBY\n                  She had it, before she drank herself to\n                  death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  Suzie.\n                         (beat)\n                  Then you're not her grandmother...\n\n                                  RUBY\n                  Raised her like she was, but no,\n                  Walter's my only child.\n                         (beat)\n                  He was a good boy, till the army took\n                  him.\n\n     Gloria looks once more at the old photograph.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half-\n                  sisters.\n\n                                  RUBY\n                  And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's\n                  niece.\n\n     Gloria stands, a little weary.  Ruby walks her from the room.\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  Thank you for talking to me, Ruby.  I am\n                  sorry about Suzie, she...\n\n     They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short,\n     noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white\n     TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.\n\n                                  RUBY\n                  You okay?\n\n                                  GLORIA\n                  I'm fine.  Nice TV.\n\n     The old lady nods, walks her outside.\n\n     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY\n\n     The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen.\n\n                                  RUBY\n                  There's an old saying from the\n                  Everglades -- virtue may be missed but\n                  sin can't hide.\n                         (a long beat)\n                  Folks pay in the end.\n\n     Gloria nods.  She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen.\n\n     CLOSE ON PEN\n\n     For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the\n     surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the\n     GATOR'S EYES -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze\n     across the oily waters.\n\n                                                 HARD CUT TO:\n\n     BLACK.

GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes\n     through the French doors.  She can't get it done.  He's there in\n     an instant.\n\n     She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky\n     around his hand and breaks the glass.\n\n     He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the\n     gun at his own shoulder and fires.\n\n     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then\n\n     EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY\n\n     A Jeep and a truck parked in the mud.  Sam and Ray meet under\n     heavy, moss-draped cypress.  Sam hands Ray a plastic bag -- the\n     teeth.\n\n                                  SAM\n                  You know the place I'm talking about --\n                  the big rocks?\n\n     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then\n\n     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT\n\n     SAM & SUZIE\n\n     behind the big rocks.  He's got vise-grip pliers jammed in her\n     mouth.  Suzie moans, for real.  He loosens his grip.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  You've got the pressure too tight.\n                  You'll crush the fucking evidence.\n\n     Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again.  Suzie pops a couple\n     of pills with gulps of wine.  Sam goes to it once more.\n\n     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then\n\n     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Kelly and Sam on the floor, naked.

THE GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n     Suzie's VW is parked across the street, in the shadows of tall\n     trees.  She and Sam sit inside, watching as...\n\n     Ray Duquette EXITS a bungalow, a sport coat over his arm.  He\n     heads for Jim's Recovery Room.  In another moment, a young hooker\n     in a leather miniskirt walks out of the same bungalow.\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  Seems to like some of the same places\n                  you do.

A moment of\n     silence, the twang of a country JUKE BOX -- then...\n\n                                  SAM\n                  Buy you a drink?\n\n     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then\n\n     ZNT.

Pictures slide onto his desk -- Sam and Kelly -- in various\n     poses of coked-out debauchery at the Glades Motel.\n\n                                  SAM\n                         (white-faced)\n                  How...\n\n                                  SUZIE\n                  Walter.
