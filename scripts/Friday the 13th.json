It is a slow tracking shot which gives the\n              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of\n              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged\n              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.\n<b> \n</b>              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.\n<b> \n</b>              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her\n              breast.

The knife falls to\n              the mossy floor of the clearing.\n<b> \n</b>              Two hands go for the free blade.

It moves quickly forward.\n              We can hear the blade strike.\n<b> \n</b>              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.\n<b> \n</b>              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into\n              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.\n<b> \n</b>              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.\n              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her\n              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.

He freezes, then takes a step forward.\n              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the\n              machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto\n              the floor.\n<b> \n</b>              MARCIE and JACK enter.

Then, gradually, we see\n              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's\n              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,\n              anything...\n<b> \n</b>              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough\n              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.\n              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near\n              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach\n              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.\n<b> \n</b>              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and\n              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises\n              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to\n              come through the entrance.\n<b> \n</b>              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the\n              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her\n              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is\n              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with\n              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls\n              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the\n              floor.\n\n              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses\n              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,\n              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.\n<b> \n</b>              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a\n              small puddle of blood under her head.\n<b> \n</b>              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses\n              slowly out of the room.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>       135    EXT.

ALICE pushes a canoe\n              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will\n              permit, out in the lake to safety.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>       136    EXT.

The birds are\n              up, foraging for food.\n<b> \n</b>              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky\n              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe\n              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the\n              surface of the lake.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b><b>       138    EXT.

The\n              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,\n              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.\n<b> \n</b>              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree\n              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.\n\n              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe\n              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the\n              lapping water.\n<b> \n</b>              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,\n              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.\n              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,\n              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!\n<b> \n</b>              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE\n              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES\n              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get\n              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.\n              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle\n              floating near her.\n<b> \n</b>              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the\n              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.\n              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her\n              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.\n<b> \n</b>                                  JASON (Lipsync)\n                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!\n<b> \n</b>              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,\n              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.\n              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has\n              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,\n              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts\n              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for\n              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in\n              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out\n              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the\n              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands\n              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and\n              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.\n<b> \n</b>              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking\n              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.\n<b> \n</b>                                  JASON (Lipsync)\n                            (continuing)\n                      Kill her, mommy!

VOORHEES, whose head flies\n              off into the water.\n<b> \n</b>              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.\n<b> \n</b>              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to\n              shore.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>       139    EXT.
