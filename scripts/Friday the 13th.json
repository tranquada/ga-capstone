CLAUDETTE is 17\n              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with \"Assistant\n              Counsellor\" written on it.

MAIN LODGE - DAY\n \n              Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE\n              passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.\n \n              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms\n              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,\n              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with\n              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out\n              an Everly Brothers hit.\n \n              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not\n              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.\n \n                                  CLAUDETTE\n                      We've got to talk.\n \n              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.

FOREST - DAY\n \n              The TRACK goes SILENT.\n \n              BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless\n              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves\n              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.\n              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.\n \n                                  BARRY\n                      I care very much.\n \n              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.

It is a slow tracking shot which gives the\n              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of\n              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged\n              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.\n \n              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.\n \n              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her\n              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.\n \n                                  BARRY\n                      Claudette...\n\n                                  CLAUDETTE\n                      Somebody'll see.\n \n                                  BARRY\n                      No, they won't...\n \n              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so\n              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips\n              by kissing her.\n \n              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.\n              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear\n              the field of vision.  A branch pops.\n \n                                  CLAUDETTE\n                            (in a thick whisper)\n                      Somebody's there, Barry.\n \n                                  BARRY\n                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of\n                      stone.\n \n                                  CLAUDETTE\n                      Let's go back, Barry...\n \n                                  BARRY\n                      I need you so much, Claudette.\n \n              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,\n              passionately.\n \n              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of\n              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as\n              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.\n \n              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It\n              swells.  Closer.\n \n              QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the\n              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.\n \n              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.\n \n              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the\n              blow.\n \n              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him\n              by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away.\n \n              ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.\n \n              A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.\n\n              BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to\n              the mossy floor of the clearing.\n \n              Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.\n \n              There is a confused jumble of struggle.\n \n              Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.\n \n              REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight.\n \n              The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward.\n              We can hear the blade strike.\n \n              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.\n \n              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into\n              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.\n \n              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.\n              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her\n              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC\n              has stopped abruptly.\n \n              THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.\n \n              It is completely SILENT.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n         8    TITLE SEQUENCE\n \n              The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to\n              ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional\n              rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final\n              position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane\n              of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper\n              left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.\n \n              The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the\n              Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.\n \n              TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.\n \n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n \n \n         9    EXT.

ARCHERY RANGE - DAY\n \n              BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She\n              enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of\n              this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated\n              than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.\n \n              BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter\n              and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are\n              already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.\n              The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.\n \n              The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets\n              closer to setting up the target.\n \n              In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the\n              face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the\n              weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow\n              streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by\n              eighteen inches.\n \n              BRENDA whips around.\n \n              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-\n              to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked\n              simultaneously.

BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY\n \n              The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place\n              alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet\n              tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down\n              and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.\n \n              The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a\n              burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the\n              bag, which has something in it that moves.\n \n              The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below\n              the window.

Who's got the key?\n \n              ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and\n              comes up with a short 2x4.  She crosses to the door and smashes\n              through one of the window panes.  She puts her arm through the\n              broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.  BILL follows.\n \n              The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.\n              They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's\n              desk.  BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch\n              on the desk set several times.\n \n                                  BILL\n                            (continuing)\n                      It's dead.

BILL finds\n              some in the postage drawer.  He then crosses over to a pay\n              phone mounted on the wall.  The CAMERA moves to the cornice of\n              the building where the phone line exits.  It follows the link\n              up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and\n              phone lines come in from the pole.

On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.\n \n              ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles\n              from the wall.\n \n              She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.  She tries another.\n              Empty.\n \n                                  ALICE\n                      Where are the goddamned bullets?\n \n              The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.\n \n              ALICE looks around.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT\n \n              MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT\n \n              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the\n              rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt\n              stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She\n              turns.\n \n              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,\n              blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES\n              steps slowly toward ALICE.\n \n              ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only\n              thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,\n              swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the\n              arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.\n \n              MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and\n              drops to the floor.\n\n              ALICE runs out the door.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT\n \n              ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the\n              front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is\n              no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs\n              into the kitchen.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT\n \n              ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.\n              She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and\n              then hides there, closing the door behind her.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT\n \n              There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.\n              ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type\n              which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.\n \n              ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.\n \n              As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.\n              Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are\n              turned on.\n \n                                  JASON (V.O.)\n                      Please kill her, mommy... Help me,\n                      please.  Kill her, mommy.\n \n              There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the\n              sound of another door being slammed.\n \n              ALICE relaxes again.\n \n              Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door\n              now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the\n              idea.\n \n              She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are\n              the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large\n              skillet, some bags of flour, etc.\n \n              ALICE covers her head with her arms.\n\n              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very\n              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand\n              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is\n              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.\n \n              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.\n \n                                  JASON (O.S.)\n                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...\n \n              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small\n              room.\n \n              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.\n \n                                  ALICE\n                      Please...\n \n              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.\n \n              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.\n \n              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has\n              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the\n              door to the larder.\n \n              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...\n \n              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see\n              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's\n              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,\n              anything...\n \n              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough\n              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.\n              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near\n              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach\n              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.\n \n              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and\n              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises\n              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to\n              come through the entrance.\n \n              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the\n              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her\n              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is\n              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with\n              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls\n              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the\n              floor.\n\n              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses\n              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,\n              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.\n \n              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a\n              small puddle of blood under her head.\n \n              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses\n              slowly out of the room.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       135    EXT. LAKE - NIGHT\n \n              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe\n              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will\n              permit, out in the lake to safety.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       136    EXT. LAKE - NIGHT\n \n              Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls\n              forward, slumped across a thwart.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       137    EXT. CAMP - DAWN\n \n              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the\n              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are\n              up, foraging for food.\n \n              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky\n              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe\n              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the\n              surface of the lake.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN\n \n              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not\n              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The\n              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,\n              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.\n \n              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree\n              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.\n\n              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe\n              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the\n              lapping water.\n \n              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,\n              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.\n              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,\n              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!\n \n              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE\n              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES\n              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get\n              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.\n              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle\n              floating near her.\n \n              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the\n              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.\n              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her\n              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.\n \n                                  JASON (Lipsync)\n                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!\n \n              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,\n              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.\n              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has\n              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,\n              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts\n              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for\n              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in\n              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out\n              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the\n              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands\n              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and\n              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.\n \n              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking\n              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.\n \n                                  JASON (Lipsync)\n                            (continuing)\n                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!\n \n              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in\n              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies\n              off into the water.\n \n              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.\n \n              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to\n              shore.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n       139    EXT. CAMP ROAD/SIGN - MORNING\n \n              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear\n              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is\n              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door\n              that says \"State Department of Health and Safety\".  There are\n              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.\n \n              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.\n \n                                  1st INSPECTOR\n                      Good morning, miss.\n \n                                  2nd INSPECTOR\n                            (Leaning across the front seat)\n                      Are you all right, ma'am?\n \n                                  ALICE\n                      Help me.\n \n              The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle\n              and come around to help ALICE.\n \n                                                       CUT TO:\n \n \n       140    EXT.
