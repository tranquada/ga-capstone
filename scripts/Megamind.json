He looks like he has the worst\r\n      hangover in the world.\r\n      \r\n      Finally, he remembers last night.

It's empty.\r\n      \r\n      As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton\r\n      to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.\r\n      \r\n      He shakes the thought from his mind.\r\n      \r\n      BATHROOM\r\n      \r\n      Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.\r\n                                                              44.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      HAL'S FACE\r\n      \r\n      He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The\r\n      inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content\r\n      look washes over his face.\r\n      \r\n      There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and\r\n      SPLINTERING.\r\n      \r\n      The sound intensifies.

No, it's disrespect for the\r\n                craft.\r\n      \r\n      Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)\r\n                Would Uberman have kept us waiting\r\n                like this?

HAL'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY\r\n      \r\n      Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing\r\n      his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as\r\n      he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.\r\n      \r\n      Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                Oh, for crying out loud.\r\n      \r\n      He gets up and opens the door.

Yeah!\r\n                You're actually the guy I want to\r\n                see!\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                Oh, so NOW you want to get down to\r\n                it. Well, I want to get a few\r\n                things off my chest first.\r\n      \r\n      Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins\r\n      around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal\r\n      fingers.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)\r\n                Of all the inconsiderate - Do you\r\n                have any idea how long we waited\r\n                for you? We're you even planning on\r\n                coming to me and getting revenge?\r\n      \r\n      Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his\r\n      guest.\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                Well, at first I was going to. You\r\n                know, because that's what I figured\r\n                I was supposed to do. But then I\r\n                got to thinking-\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                    (interrupting)\r\n                -You got to thinking? There's\r\n                nothing to think about. I'm the\r\n                villain. I do something bad, you\r\n                come and get me.\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                - I got to thinking...what's the\r\n                point?\r\n      \r\n      Master Mind throws up his hands.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                Maybe you're right. What's the\r\n                point?\r\n      \r\n      He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He\r\n      walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a\r\n      LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER\r\n      VALUABLES.\r\n                                                              76.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)\r\n                What are these?\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                That's what I wanted to talk to you\r\n                about.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                    (baffled)\r\n                Where did you get all this?\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                    (proudly)\r\n                Get this: I stole them.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                From where?\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                From all over. You see, once you\r\n                killed Pat and ruined my other\r\n                apartment building I was pretty\r\n                pissed off, so I figured I'd go,\r\n                find you and kick some ass. Then I\r\n                thought to myself: \"Okay,then\r\n                what?\" I mean, if we were to fight,\r\n                what would I get out of it? Would I\r\n                get my apartment back? Would I be\r\n                able to pay the bills?\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                Well, what about your mentor?\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                Tell you the truth? He was kind of\r\n                a dick. I mean, being a hero is\r\n                dandy and all, but it's volunteer\r\n                work. Now you've always had the\r\n                right take on all this. I mean,\r\n                when you rob a bank or take over\r\n                the diamond exchange you get\r\n                something out of it. I mean, when\r\n                you don't get caught, which, no\r\n                offense, isn't very often. And that\r\n                brings me to what I wanted to\r\n                propose to you: Who could catch you\r\n                if I'm by your side?\r\n      \r\n      Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan\r\n      awe-struck.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                You want to team-up?\r\n                                                                 77.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                You got the brains, I got the\r\n                brawn. We could even call ourselves\r\n                that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at\r\n                this.\r\n      \r\n      Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and\r\n      shows it to Master Mind.\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN (CONT'D)\r\n                I even designed us some new\r\n                costumes.\r\n      \r\n      The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.\r\n      A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of\r\n      grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his\r\n      chest.\r\n      \r\n      Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a\r\n      black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.\r\n      \r\n      Titan proudly points to the two figures.\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN (CONT'D)\r\n                See, you'd be brain, so you got a\r\n                little one on your costume, and\r\n                then I'll have brawn on mine...once\r\n                I figure out the best, you know,\r\n                visual interpretation of it. What\r\n                do you think?\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                What do I think?\r\n      \r\n      Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)\r\n                I think you're probably the biggest\r\n                idiot I've ever met. I mean, I\r\n                can't believe you. All your gifts,\r\n                all your powers, and all you want\r\n                to use them for is your own\r\n                financial fulfillment. You know\r\n                what? Your kind of people make me\r\n                sick.\r\n      \r\n      Titan puts down his drawing.\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                I worked hard on this.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND\r\n                Oh - gee - I am so sorry!\r\n                                                              78.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.\r\n      \r\n                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)\r\n                    (under his breath)\r\n                Of all the people to pick, it had\r\n                to be this loser.\r\n      \r\n      This strikes a cord with Titan.\r\n      \r\n                          TITAN\r\n                Now, hold on.

Figured if they\r\n                could do it, so could you.
