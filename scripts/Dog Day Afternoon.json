Beside the car stands \n               SAL, medium height, also good-looking in an intense boyish \n               way.  His eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever-watchful \n               Sal.\n\n               There is a watchful reserve in Sal that contrasts to Sonny's \n               outgoing bounciness: first impression is Sonny is all bark; \n               Sal is the bite.  Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit \n               style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather.  \n               He even wears a hat.

Jackie is an eighteen \n               year old with bad complexion and in contrast to Sonny and \n               Sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness.  Adidas, T-shirt, \n               bowling jacket, jeans.  He is uncertain: waits for directions \n               from Sonny.  Sonny takes the florist box from him.\n\n               We see a water truck drive down the street, followed by \n               Sonny's car, which drives up near bank.  It stops, Jackie \n               gets out, crosses to bank window, peers through, then\n\n<b>               ANGLE INSIDE CAR\n</b>\n               returns to car.

BANK - DAY\n</b>\n               A slightly seedy little branch bank, old yellow brick, blond \n               varnished wood, a rubber plant, an American flag.  Through \n               the windows we SEE HOWARD, the aged black bank guard, in \n               uniform, taking down the American flag from outside.  Past \n               him comes Sal carrying an attache case.  He passes Howard \n               coming toward us through the door into the bank.

Sal sits down, his back to Mulvaney, facing \n               the front door of the bank.  Mulvaney is on the phone.\n\n<b>               ON DOOR\n</b>\n               as Sonny bustles through in his bouncy dancer's walk.  He \n               carries the large florist box.

To his own amazement, he grins: a hopeful grin that \n               says: \"Like me - don't hurt me.\"  And he's embarrassed by \n               it.

He eases \n               himself out.  Looks at the gun, then at Sonny, then they \n               shove the machine against the door.  Sonny then gives Mulvaney \n               his jacket to put on again.\n\n<b>                                     SONNY\n</b>                         Anyway, I'm not gonna take you.\n                         I'm gonna take one of the girls, a \n                         married one with a couple of kids.  \n                         The cops don't like it in the papers \n                         when they kill a mother, especially \n                         if she's got young kids.\n\n               Finished with the task, Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney, \n               they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group.\n\n<b>                                     SONNY\n</b>                         You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney.\n                         Only don't fuck around with me, you \n                         know what I mean?\n\n<b>                                     MULVANEY\n</b>                         I don't fool around with you.\n\n               Mulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down.

POLICE HELICOPTER (OVER BANK)\n</b>\n               As it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank, and cops \n               around car.  We see a small crowd being held back by a few \n               police still setting up barricades.  It is the first \n               indication of the crowd event it became.  It also sets the \n               geography for us, but very quickly another copter swims into \n               view and the two circle each other.  The other copter -- \n               only feet away -- is a TV news helicopter, with a big camera \n               sticking out the open door on our side.\n\n               It is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank.  A \n               COP in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at \n               the TV Cameraman.\n\n<b>                                     BULLHORN COP\n</b>                         This is a restricted area.  You are \n                         flying in a restricted area...\n\n               The TV Cameraman swivels his camera up to focus on the Cop, \n               and as the lens hits us dead center...\n\n<b>               INT. APARTMENT NEAR BANK\n</b>\n               Though an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond \n               it an angle of street and the bank.  Near the window in a \n               corner is a TV set, and on the TV set we are seeing the shot \n               of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullhorn \n               as seen from the TV copter.  A couple of Elderly Men are \n               sitting watching the TV set, ignoring the bank, which they \n               can see in the flesh, as it were.  Outside we are HEARING \n               the copters, and on the TV set likewise, and the voice of \n               the Announcer.\n\n<b>                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\n</b>                         ...police as yet have made no contact \n                         with the bank robbers who are locked \n                         in the bank...\n\n               There is a HAMMERING at the door, and the men at the TV set \n               barely have time to look around before several burly Cops \n               wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles \n               with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the \n               men.  They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up \n               higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on \n               the front of the bank.  A lot of AD LIB dialogue, but what \n               we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on \n               the TV.\n\n<b>               EXT. BANK - DAY\n</b>\n               The FRAME is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic faces \n               with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age.  They \n               have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing.  They are \n               city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnatory \n               expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature -- \n               the fact is they love their work, which is criminals.  There \n               is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse \n               in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which \n               is the action of repressing their own strongly developed \n               criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, and \n               rigidly controlled men.\n\n               MORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the \n               younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as a \n               group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not \n               deny) the psychic chaos underneath.\n\n               Right now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy \n               helicopter track.\n\n               We feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge, \n               who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, \n               and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties.  In \n               spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart \n               kid who still needs a little help.\n\n               Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit.  \n               Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages.\n\n               The three hang around him.  They approach Moretti who looks \n               at them without moving.\n\n<b>                                     MORETTI\n</b>                              (to no one)\n                         Here comes the FBI.\n                              (to Sheldon)\n                         You men lookin' for protection?

I \n                         thought the sons of bitches would be \n                         overwhelmed with remorse at the sight \n                         of a police officer.  And you know \n                         somethin'?  Nobody has said hostage \n                         yet.  Unnastan?\n\n               They are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a \n               small barbershop across the street from the bank.  We now \n               sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not \n               yet knowing what's going on.\n\n<b>               NEW ANGLE\n</b>\n               From down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits, \n               carrying all kinds of electric junk: The NEW REPORTERS.  \n               They run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke...  \n               they run up to Moretti and Sheldon, who walk along, trying \n               not to catch an eye.\n\n<b>               MOVING SHOT - MORETTI AND SHELDON AMONG NEWSMEN.\n</b>\n<b>                                     VOICES\n</b>                         How many in the bank?\n                         Have they got hostages?

Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal \n               business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on \n               duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery.

Sample dialogue might go: \"Did I hear a shot?\" \n               \"Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, \n               inside.\"  \"Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it \n               was inside the bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\"  \n               \"Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the \n               bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\"  \"Roger, this is \n               the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving \n               toward the rear of the bank.\"  \"Who's that guy walking through \n               the barricade?\"  \"The blue suit?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"Off-duty \n               Inspector come down to see can you use him.\"  Etc.  They \n               really do use the word Perpetrator, Felon, etc.  The Cop \n               handing out radios makes Moretti sign for it -- which Moretti \n               does during the following:\n\n<b>                                     MORETTI\n</b>                         Right -- got ya.
