Right now she \n               is a lump of browning flesh, shining with oil among rows of \n               similar ladies (mostly thinner, but all with a certain \n               unhealthy softness about them) laid out in rows and groups \n               across the sand.

SONNY'S CAR - STREET - DAY\n\n               It is parked in a drab Brooklyn street.  Beside the car stands \n               SAL, medium height, also good-looking in an intense boyish \n               way.  His eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever-watchful \n               Sal.\n\n               There is a watchful reserve in Sal that contrasts to Sonny's \n               outgoing bounciness: first impression is Sonny is all bark; \n               Sal is the bite.  Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit \n               style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather.  \n               He even wears a hat.  Now, matching Sal's preparations inside \n               the car, he checks his tie's alignment, shoots his cuffs and \n               is ready...\n\n               Meanwhile, on their car radio:\n\n                                     ELTON JOHN\n                              (Amoreena)\n                         AND SHE DREAMS OF CRYSTAL STREAMS OF \n                         DAYS GONE BY WHEN WE COULD LEAN \n                         LAUGHING FIT TO BURST UPON EACH \n                         OTHER...\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE BY CAR\n\n               As he turns, from the back of the car, JACKIE appears with a \n               huge florist box, tied with ribbon.  Jackie is an eighteen \n               year old with bad complexion and in contrast to Sonny and \n               Sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness.  Adidas, T-shirt, \n               bowling jacket, jeans.  He is uncertain: waits for directions \n               from Sonny.  Sonny takes the florist box from him.\n\n               We see a water truck drive down the street, followed by \n               Sonny's car, which drives up near bank.  It stops, Jackie \n               gets out, crosses to bank window, peers through, then\n\n               ANGLE INSIDE CAR\n\n               returns to car.  Leans in, has fake conversation with Sonny.\n\n               They are waiting.  Sonny checks his watch, turns to Sal in \n               back seat:\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         30 seconds, Sal...\n\n               They wait.  At appropriate moment, Sal exits car, walks toward \n               bank.  Slowly Sonny gets out.\n\n               INT. BANK - DAY\n\n               A slightly seedy little branch bank, old yellow brick, blond \n               varnished wood, a rubber plant, an American flag.  Through \n               the windows we SEE HOWARD, the aged black bank guard, in \n               uniform, taking down the American flag from outside.  Past \n               him comes Sal carrying an attache case.  He passes Howard \n               coming toward us through the door into the bank.  As he passes \n               CAMERA:\n\n               INSERT: BANK CLOCK\n\n               as it CLICKS from 2:57 to 2:58 PM.\n\n               MOVING SHOT WITH SAL\n\n               as he moves toward the left-hand deposit-slips desks.\n\n               He picks out a car-loan application slip, then walks toward \n               the manager's desk (as the sign on the desk proclaims) of \n               PATRICK MULVANEY.  Sal sits down, his back to Mulvaney, facing \n               the front door of the bank.  Mulvaney is on the phone.\n\n               ON DOOR\n\n               as Sonny bustles through in his bouncy dancer's walk.  He \n               carries the large florist box.  He moves toward the left- \n               hand deposit-slips desks, takes one out and begins to fill \n               one out.\n\n               ON HOWARD\n\n               as he pulls out the keys, attached to the belt of his uniform.  \n               Jackie approaches the door of the bank and stops, neither in \n               nor out, as though he can't make up his mind.  Howard watches \n               him, waiting patiently, keys in hand, folded flag under his \n               arm.\n\n               CLOSE - SAL\n\n               still sitting, back to Mulvaney, watching Jackie's approach \n               and entrance, ready to move on cue.\n\n               ON DOOR\n\n               on Howard as he looks at Jackie, still half in, half out.  \n               Howard speaks to him:\n\n                                     HOWARD\n                         Closing time; you want in or out?\n\n               Jackie steps in and as Howard locks the door to prevent more \n               customers from entering, Jackie walks toward Sonny, filling \n               out a slip at the left-hand area.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Jackie.\n\n               He stops at deposit-slips desk, next to Sonny.\n\n               CLOSE - SAL\n\n               as if by pre-arranged signal, Sal now stands up, moves to \n               the side of Mulvaney's desk.\n\n                                     SAL\n                         You the manager?\n\n               ON MULVANEY\n\n               who is still on the phone.  He gestures at the sign on his \n               desk that says so, and gestures for Sal to sit down.\n\n               ON SAL\n\n               as he sits, producing as he does a machine pistol, which he \n               holds on Mulvaney's chest, out of sight from others in the \n               bank.\n\n               MULVANEY\n\n               His mouth simply stops, and he stares at the gun.  Mulvaney \n               is a comic opera Irishman in his early fifties, florid... \n               cheerful, bushy eyebrows; he acts out everything he says...\n\n                                     SAL\n                         Just go on talking, like nothing was \n                         happening, okay?\n\n                                     MULVANEY\n                              (into phone)\n                         Listen, lemme call you back.\n\n               He hangs up, and looks from the gun up to Sal's blank hard \n               face.  To his own amazement, he grins: a hopeful grin that \n               says: \"Like me - don't hurt me.\"  And he's embarrassed by \n               it.  As we watch, his smile turns sour.\n\n               HIS POV - FLASH\n\n               Sal's absolutely unmoved face.\n\n               TWO SHOT - SONNY AND JACKIE\n\n               Jackie moves over to Sonny.\n\n                                     JACKIE\n                         Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Jackie - what are you talking about?\n\n                                     JACKIE\n                         Maybe we can take something smaller... \n                         like a Spanish grocery.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (indicating what's \n                              happening with Sal \n                              and Mulvaney)\n                         It's too late - just get away from \n                         me - don't talk to me now - go over \n                         to your place...\n\n               Jackie moves to another deposit-slips desk - takes one out \n               and begins to fill it out.\n\n               ON TELLER'S CAGE AREA\n\n               as a LADY with a BABY in a stroller moves away from the Teller \n               and starts to walk toward the front door.  DEBORAH is marking \n               figures on a piece of paper at 1st Teller's cage.\n\n               SYLVIA and MIRIAM stand behind her - their backs to Sonny.\n\n               Howard, who has put the folded flag in a plastic bag in a \n               front desk, follows Lady toward the door.

Sylvia \n               unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash, but \n               Sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead.  He begins to \n               stuff the money into the bag.  Some fives, packaged with \n               rubber bands, in the drawer, he holds up so Sal and all can \n               see them...

In the background, Mulvaney, having finished \n               with the phone conversation, is moving to the rear with the \n               rest of the girls.  Sonny now moves to the 3rd cage's cash \n               drawer... Mulvaney ends phone conversation and Sal moves him \n               over to group at vault.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (mimicking Sylvia)\n                         'This window is shut...'\n\n               Again, the same procedure begins.

Accomplishing this, he \n               starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages \n               as he does so.

He moves toward \n               the group at the vault.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               as Sonny sprints for the door to the Ladies' Room.\n\n               INSIDE LADIES' ROOM\n\n               It is a little lounge; sitting on a couch under the window, \n               making up her face (or painting her toenails) and listening \n               to her tiny transistor radio, oblivious to all that's \n               happened, is MARIA, heavily-painted and voluptuous Latin \n               girl.  Sylvia, following him in, is shocked.  She's forgotten \n               about Maria.  Now she runs over to her, puts her arms around \n               her.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         Oh - Maria!\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Who the hell is that?

At this point, PHONE RINGS AGAIN (#4).  Sonny moves to \n               get the empty wastebasket, shoving it into the vault for the \n               girls to use in case of emergency.  Mulvaney moves to his \n               desk and phone.\n\n               Mulvaney has by this time answered the phone, and is now \n               holding it out to Sonny.  HOLD THE BEAT...\n\n                                     MULVANEY\n                              (to Sonny)\n                         It's for you.\n\n               ON SONNY AND SAL\n\n               They both stare at Mulvaney.  Sonny slowly moves toward \n               Mulvaney.  For the first time since he entered the bank, \n               he's quiet and slow.  He takes the instrument and slowly \n               puts it to his ear.  The group from the vault now slowly \n               starts to move out to listen to the conversation.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (into phone)\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     MORETTI (V.O.)\n                         What are you doin' in there?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Who's this?\n\n                                     MORETTI (V.O.)\n                         This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, \n                         asshole, we got you completely by \n                         the balls.

Sure enough, in \n               the window of the barbershop across the street, the dim figure \n               of a man on a telephone can be SEEN looking out toward us.  \n               He wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped \n               in his mouth.  He is an old-time, hard-nosed, uneducated, \n               street-wise, sarcastic New York cop, outspoken, rude and \n               sentimental.  Right now he's a distant silhouette and a voice \n               on the telephone.\n\n               CLOSE ON SONNY\n\n               holding the phone.  Listening to the voice of his death \n               speaking in New York accents.\n\n                                     MORETTI (V.O.)\n                         Okay?  Let's be reasonable and not \n                         stupid and not get anybody hurt.\n                         You come to the front door with hands \n                         folded on your head, unnastand?  \n                         Nobody's gonna shoot or...\n\n               Sonny slowly, almost sadly, puts the telephone receiver back \n               down, cutting off the little voice at the other end.  He \n               looks up at Mulvaney, then to Sal.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (to Sal)\n                         It's the cops.

He eases \n               himself out.  Looks at the gun, then at Sonny, then they \n               shove the machine against the door.  Sonny then gives Mulvaney \n               his jacket to put on again.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Anyway, I'm not gonna take you.\n                         I'm gonna take one of the girls, a \n                         married one with a couple of kids.  \n                         The cops don't like it in the papers \n                         when they kill a mother, especially \n                         if she's got young kids.\n\n               Finished with the task, Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney, \n               they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney.\n                         Only don't fuck around with me, you \n                         know what I mean?\n\n                                     MULVANEY\n                         I don't fool around with you.\n\n               Mulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down.  At this \n               point, all the phones are off the hooks.\n\n               EXT. (AERIAL) ANGLE FROM INT. POLICE HELICOPTER (OVER BANK)\n\n               As it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank, and cops \n               around car.  We see a small crowd being held back by a few \n               police still setting up barricades.  It is the first \n               indication of the crowd event it became.  It also sets the \n               geography for us, but very quickly another copter swims into \n               view and the two circle each other.  The other copter -- \n               only feet away -- is a TV news helicopter, with a big camera \n               sticking out the open door on our side.\n\n               It is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank.  A \n               COP in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at \n               the TV Cameraman.\n\n                                     BULLHORN COP\n                         This is a restricted area.  You are \n                         flying in a restricted area...\n\n               The TV Cameraman swivels his camera up to focus on the Cop, \n               and as the lens hits us dead center...\n\n               INT. APARTMENT NEAR BANK\n\n               Though an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond \n               it an angle of street and the bank.  Near the window in a \n               corner is a TV set, and on the TV set we are seeing the shot \n               of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullhorn \n               as seen from the TV copter.  A couple of Elderly Men are \n               sitting watching the TV set, ignoring the bank, which they \n               can see in the flesh, as it were.  Outside we are HEARING \n               the copters, and on the TV set likewise, and the voice of \n               the Announcer.\n\n                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\n                         ...police as yet have made no contact \n                         with the bank robbers who are locked \n                         in the bank...\n\n               There is a HAMMERING at the door, and the men at the TV set \n               barely have time to look around before several burly Cops \n               wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles \n               with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the \n               men.  They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up \n               higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on \n               the front of the bank.  A lot of AD LIB dialogue, but what \n               we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on \n               the TV.\n\n               EXT. BANK - DAY\n\n               The FRAME is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic faces \n               with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age.  They \n               have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing.  They are \n               city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnatory \n               expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature -- \n               the fact is they love their work, which is criminals.  There \n               is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse \n               in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which \n               is the action of repressing their own strongly developed \n               criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, and \n               rigidly controlled men.\n\n               MORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the \n               younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as a \n               group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not \n               deny) the psychic chaos underneath.\n\n               Right now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy \n               helicopter track.\n\n               We feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge, \n               who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, \n               and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties.  In \n               spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart \n               kid who still needs a little help.\n\n               Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit.  \n               Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages.\n\n               The three hang around him.  They approach Moretti who looks \n               at them without moving.\n\n                                     MORETTI\n                              (to no one)\n                         Here comes the FBI.\n                              (to Sheldon)\n                         You men lookin' for protection?  We \n                         got all the police right here.\n\n                                     SHELDON\n                         Why didn't you just wait and try to \n                         take 'em out there in the street?\n\n               Moretti looks at him, cheerfully sarcastic.\n\n                                     MORETTI\n                         I made an error in judgment.  I \n                         thought the sons of bitches would be \n                         overwhelmed with remorse at the sight \n                         of a police officer.  And you know \n                         somethin'?  Nobody has said hostage \n                         yet.  Unnastan?\n\n               They are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a \n               small barbershop across the street from the bank.  We now \n               sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not \n               yet knowing what's going on.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               From down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits, \n               carrying all kinds of electric junk: The NEW REPORTERS.  \n               They run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke...  \n               they run up to Moretti and Sheldon, who walk along, trying \n               not to catch an eye.\n\n               MOVING SHOT - MORETTI AND SHELDON AMONG NEWSMEN.\n\n                                     VOICES\n                         How many in the bank?\n                         Have they got hostages?  Any shots \n                         exchanged?\n                              (Etc., AD LIB)\n\n                                     MORETTI\n                         No, we don't know that yet.  This \n                         young fella without the hat is FBI.  \n                         I'm Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti \n                         ... M-O-R-E-double-T-I.  Eugene.

BARBER SHOP - DAY\n\n               A COP is talking on the wall phone as MORETTI, BAKER, etc.  \n               are trying to get inside.\n\n                                     COP\n                         ...no, just get hold of Al, tell him \n                         to get the catering truck over to \n                         26th and Avenue B, there's a bank \n                         robbery in progress and big crowd.  \n                         Big!  Tell him to bring ice cream -- \n                         I got to hang up.\n\n               He hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a POCKET \n               PHONE BOOK.  Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal \n               business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on \n               duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery.  He's \n               trying to get his brother-in-law with the ice cream truck \n               down here, etc.\n\n               Moretti has got the crowd cleared back, so that now we SEE \n               why this has been chosen as a tactical command post.  From \n               here, while talking on the phone, Moretti can see the bank, \n               and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance \n               inside.\n\n               Moretti picks up the phone.\n\n                                     MORETTI\n                              (to phone cop)\n                         You get the phone company?\n\n                                     PHONE COP\n                         It's being set up... this phone'll \n                         be a direct line into the bank.\n\n               Moretti is already dialing.  The phone is answered.\n\n               INT. BANK - DAY\n\n               (Re Moretti's 3rd conversation on phone with Sonny.)\n\n               The group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately \n               twelve minutes since anything last happened.  Sonny is seated \n               at Mulvaney's desk, all the phones off the hooks.\n\n               The rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where \n               Sal is keeping his eye on them.\n\n               Suddenly, Sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on \n               the hooks, crossing back to sit at Mulvaney's desk again.\n\n               PHONE STARTS TO RING and Sonny picks it up.\n\n                                     MORETTI\n                         Okay, you're in there and we're out \n                         here.

What's that for?  Salvatore?\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam \n                         veterans so killing don't mean \n                         anything to us, you understand?\n\n               A cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into \n               Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expected \n               it.  The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other \n               officers.  These sets are tuned in to each other, and \n               throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on \n               these sets.  This is police procedure; the orders are for \n               everyone to talk about everything.  If anyone has a question, \n               has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately \n               responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible \n               surprises.  Sample dialogue might go: \"Did I hear a shot?\" \n               \"Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, \n               inside.\"  \"Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it \n               was inside the bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\"  \n               \"Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the \n               bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\"  \"Roger, this is \n               the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving \n               toward the rear of the bank.\"  \"Who's that guy walking through \n               the barricade?\"  \"The blue suit?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"Off-duty \n               Inspector come down to see can you use him.\"  Etc.

What is being passed on here \n               is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from \n               top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally \n               masculine society: police.  The homosexual content of this \n               should not be lost: it lies in the comfortable fit of their \n               feelings, in the fact, simply, that they love each other, \n               for what they share.\n\n                                     MORETTI\n                         So whatsa deal?\n\n                                     COMMISSIONER\n                         They jet's comin' out.

So I tried \n                         to take my life - I swallowed about \n                         a half pound of pills...  blues, \n                         reds, yellows, downers, uppers, \n                         screamers... you name it.

What the fuck is goin' on?\n\n               There's no answer.  Sonny steps out into the street.  He \n               can't see anything anymore.  The atmosphere is suddenly \n               chillingly dangerous: the crowd SHOTS \"come out of the dark\" \n               and \"we can't see from here\".  The street seems empty except \n               for a few threatening silhouettes of heavily-armed cops.  \n               Sonny responds with bluster.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Get the lights back on!\n\n               He steps out farther into the street.  From behind him, \n               SHELDON, the FBI man, approaches.  He is alone.  Unsmiling.\n\n               Sonny dashes back into the bank.\n\n               INT.

BANK - NIGHT\n\n               Sonny crosses to Sheldon, grins, grabs him and executes a \n               very professional-looking pat-down search.\n\n               He removes Sheldon's .38 from a shoulder holster, producing \n               it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician: some of \n               the old playfulness returns for a moment.  He carefully and \n               with showbiz flourishes searches Sheldon's thighs and groin.  \n               The crowd HOWLS.  Sheldon bears it with stoic calm.\n\n               CLOSE TWO SHOT\n\n               as Sonny stands up from the search and finds Sheldon's eyes \n               locked to his with flat calm.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.\n\n                                     SHELDON\n                         I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I \n                         have to.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that \n                         kills me, I want him to do it because \n                         he hates my guts.  Not because it's \n                         a job.  Okay, let's go... but you \n                         gotta walk in backwards.\n\n               The move toward the door of the bank, where Sonny opens the \n               door, preceding Sheldon, both men entering backwards.\n\n               INT. BANK - NIGHT\n\n               Except for the 4 emergency lights, it is very dark - and \n               very hot as Sonny and Sheldon enter the bank.  Sal now stands \n               behind the desks, covering Sheldon and the group assembled \n               at the vault.  Sheldon takes in every detail as he walks \n               toward the group in the rear, followed closely and covered \n               by Sonny.  As they near the desks, Sonny yells out an order \n               for the group:\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Nobody give their right name...  \n                         it's the FBI!\n\n                                     SHELDON\n                         I just want to see all you young \n                         ladies are all all right in here.\n\n               TWO SHOT - SYLVIA AND SAL\n\n               She's pissed.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         Listen, we asked for the jet hours \n                         ago, what are you doin' out there?\n\n               Sheldon is watching Sal, trying to gauge him.

Sonny covers him every inch of \n               the way.\n\n                                     SHELDON\n                         They're getting what they want.

Sal and Edna alone remain unsmiling.  After a few \n               seconds they force themselves to stop, to behave like they \n               should under the circumstances.

Thighs, the whole bit.\n\n               CLOSE ANGLES AS HE SEARCHES\n\n               It is tense.  The Driver seems uptight.  Sonny finds nothing \n               until he touches a breast pocket.  The Driver is very uptight.  \n               Sonny reaches in, pulls out a -- tiny bottle, with a coke \n               spoon chained to the lid.  Before Sheldon can see it, but \n               the audience has, Sonny shoves it back, grins, slaps the \n               Driver on the buns.  The Driver laughs delightedly.\n\n               He was afraid he'd get busted for the dope: the drive will \n               be a cakewalk.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         You'll be okay.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                              (to FBI)\n                         You men shoot, aim for the white \n                         meat!\n\n               He loves the joke!  They act as though they hadn't heard.\n\n               Sonny slaps him playfully on the arm and smiling turns to \n               Sheldon.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I want him.\n\n               He points at Murphy.  Sheldon stands there speechless.\n\n               Driver stares at Sonny, his smile fading.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (delighted)\n                         What do you think you're dealing \n                         with, an idiot!\n\n               Sheldon nods to Driver and Murphy.  Murphy resumes role as \n               driver of the limo.  Driver gets out.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         So long, copper.\n\n               SONNY AND MURPHY\n\n               as they position the stretchout in front of the bank.  It \n               can be seen from inside.  The FBI men stand well back from \n               it.  Murphy stands by the door.  He also can be seen.\n\n                                     SHELDON\n                         Okay, Sonny?  You follow my car.\n\n               Murphy nods.  Sonny is satisfied and turns to the bank, takes \n               Murphy into vestibule, indicating for him to stay there.  \n               Sonny continues toward group at rear.\n\n               INT.

BANK - NIGHT\n\n               Everyone waits in silence.  The lights.  The limo.  The Driver \n               waiting in the driver's seat.  After a beat the door begins \n               to open.\n\n               VARIOUS ANGLES\n\n               as Cops' guns are brought to bear.  On the apartment fire \n               escape the Old Lady is asleep, her puzzle complete.  The \n               snipers raise their rifles.\n\n               FRONT OF BARBER SHOP - NIGHT\n\n               Sheldon stands there.  The police radio network CRACKLES: \n               \"They're coming out.  Perpetrators and hostages together.  \n               Only authorized personnel may previously authorized, and \n               etc.\"  Sheldon's eyes go to:\n\n               HIS POV - SNIPER\n\n               A middle-aged Man who looks like an overweight accountant, \n               in flak vest and helmet that seems too small, aiming through \n               a telescopic sight at:\n\n               DOOR OF BANK\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (letting Murphy out \n                              first; yells outside)\n                         Get away from the car!\n\n               Something that looks like a multi-legged animal emerges.  It \n               is Sonny and Sal in the center of a tight group of the girls \n               and Mulvaney, so they are completely protected on all sides \n               by hostages.  Over their heads is thrown some drapes from \n               the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear \n               head on Sonny or Sal without hitting a girl.  In fact they \n               can't be seen at all.  This weird apparition appears, \n               hesitates.  The crowd YELLS: \"SHOOT!\"  CHOREOGRAPH THE ACTION \n               so the group hesitates, takes a step forward, then it's clear \n               Sonny can't see well enough to go direct to the car, and the \n               girls are uncertain which direction to go in, not having \n               been briefed.  So they stumble about, make false starts, and \n               finally arrive at the car, where one girl gets into the second \n               row of seats behind the Driver.  Then Sonny slides across \n               next to Driver.\n\n               VARIOUS ANGLES TO COVER\n\n               The police have no chance to shoot.  The group looks like a \n               bewildered centipede finding its way.  Mulvaney detaches \n               himself from the group and slips into the front seat, on \n               Sonny's right.\n\n               ON EDNA\n\n               standing alone, outside filled-up limo.

Sal next to her \n               in the middle and then another girl.  One woman, Edna, a \n               plain middle-aged woman who has not said a word until now is \n               left over.  She stands by the side of the limo as the doors \n               close and this phase of the operation ends, without mishap.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                              (elated)\n                         Fuck!

Silence.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Murphy, can you see what they're \n                         doing?\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         He's still got some arrangements to \n                         make.\n\n               Sheldon is getting out of the car up ahead.  Sonny and Sal \n               and all of them come alert.  As Sheldon and the other FBI \n               men get out of their car, a pair of aircraft landing lights \n               become visible, taxiing towards the limo.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         There it is, Sal.

He stops beside \n               Mulvaney and KNOCKS on the window.  Mulvaney rolls it down.\n\n                                     SHELDON\n                         That's the jet.

Which one goes?\n\n               There is silence inside the limo.  Mulvaney turns to Sylvia.\n\n                                     MULVANEY\n                         Sylvia?\n\n               From a handkerchief, Sylvia draws a slip of paper.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         It's Maria.  Go on, honey.\n\n               They open the door.  They urge her out, and Maria goes with \n               a show of reluctance.\n\n               ON MARIA\n\n               As she stands up outside she is revealed to have a rosary \n               she's counting.  IMPROVISE goodbyes, tearful and fearful all \n               around.  Then:\n\n                                     MARIA\n                         I pray for your safety...\n                              (meaning Sonny and \n                              Sal)\n                         ...Sal?

Now the plane has taxied into position, \n               where it can be seen in floodlights.  It looks big and \n               impressive.  We know the FBI has snipers ringing it.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         I ain't eaten all day.

The \n               rifle stands straight up between his legs.  Sheldon leans \n               down, peering in at him.\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         What do you think, Sal?

He realizes that escape is within their grasp.  The \n               smile transforms him from a formidable Mafia imitation into \n               an utterly sweet and defenseless youth.\n\n                                     SAL\n                              (gun pointing high)\n                         Hey, Sonny - You did it!\n\n               CLOSE - SONNY\n\n                                     SONNY\n                         Let's move it, goddamn it.\n\n                                     SHELDON\n                              (to Driver)\n                         You ready to get out first?\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Yes.\n\n               Driver starts to turn in the driver's seat!\n\n               Sheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window \n               to grab Sonny's rifle barrel, pushes it away, aiming out \n               windshield.\n\n               Mulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck.\n\n               Sal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and \n               is barely beginning to react.\n\n               DRIVER TURNING HAS A GUN OVER THE BACK OF THE SEAT!\n\n               Sonny sees it, and Sheldon's hand grabbing the barrel of his \n               gun at the same moment.\n\n               Sheldon drives hard into the side of the limo, reaching in.\n\n               Mulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the \n               hair down toward the floor.\n\n               Sal, open-mouthed with amazement, is a split-second late \n               bringing his gun up.\n\n               Driver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at Sal \n               between Miriam and Margaret in middle row.\n\n               Sheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard.

The limo -- the people fleeing it.  Agents \n               pull people away from the car.\n\n               Driver and Sheldon and Cops peer into the back.

No one \n               makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move, it was just \n               another job.
