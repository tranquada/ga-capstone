To me, it was about purity, \n               a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily \n               forgotten.

It's a night game. \n                Stands packed.  A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN.  It's the fourth \n               quarter.  Seven seconds left.  Score:  CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST \n               NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27.  A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK \n               gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back \n               to the huddle.  The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG. \n                10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S \n               every word -- \n \n                                     BRANDON\n               Last play.  Slant red, right back on two.  On two, Scottie.  \n               It's a lock.  A guaranteed TD.  I've already seen it.  So relax. \n                There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win \n               and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear \n               any \"Hi moms.\"  Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it \n               and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me.  See \n               you in the end zone.\n \n               The teams breaks, approaches the line.  Loud CROWD roar.\n\n                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER\n               I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football.  Set high school \n               records.  Won state championships.  I wasn't driven by joy, it \n               wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of \n               losing.\n \n                                     TV ANNOUNCERS\n               South West Nevada needs a score.  Seven seconds on the clock. \n                22 yard line.  Win or lose, this has been a spectacular season \n               for Lang.  The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until \n               -- Lang's got the snap--\n \n               BRANDON drops back.  A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey. \n                BRANDON pulls free, runs.  OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON \n               vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES.  BRANDON rolls on his \n               back as an OPPOSING PLAYER hurtles in -- mid-air -- unable to \n               stop as -- 300-plus pounds come crashing onto BRANDON'S leg. \n                Sickening sound.  BRANDON clutches his strangely angled limb.\n \n               \n                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER\n               ... My first thought was I can tape it and play next week.

HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n\n               BRANDON'S in a hospital bed.  Big leg cast.  IV's in each arm. \n               \n \n                                     MAN'S VOICE\n               Brandon...

The NURSE takes his \n               DAD'S arm, leads him out to the hall. \n \n                                     BRANDON'S DAD\n               (pulling away, straightening)\n\n               He didn't recognize me.  Must be all the drugs and all.  Boy's \n               been through a lot.\n \n               (handing the NURSE the flowers) \n\n               If you could put these in some water and leave 'em in his room. \n                Before they die.\n \n               BRANDON'S DAD nods thanks, departs down the corridor and --\n \n               \n\n               EXT. TRACT HOME - DAY\n\n\n               Vegas desert.  It's raining.  A SWNU car pulls up.  The COACH \n               helps BRANDON out, on crutches now.  A middle-aged WOMAN and \n               a TEENAGE BOY stand under a rusty awning, waiting to greet him.\n \n               \n                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER\n               It doesn't rain much in the desert.  Maybe it was that, or maybe \n               the look on my mother's face, or how fast coach left after getting \n               me up the steps, but I swore then and there -- no matter what, \n               I'd get back -- I would play again...\n \n\n               INT. UNLV WEIGHT ROOM - 1997 - DAY\n\n\n               Off-season.  The room's packed.  Loud hip hop plays.  BRANDON \n               limps in on a cane.  Back slaps.  (\"B's back!\" \"The man!\")   \n                \n \n                                     OMIT\n\n               EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY TRACK - DAY \n\n\n               Sprinters dart by.  Here comes BRANDON.  Several months have \n               passed.  Big ass brace on his leg.  A GIRL'S TRACK TEAM bounds \n               past like a herd of gazelles.  BRANDON presses on, possessed.\n \n               \n\n               EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY\n\n\n               The TEAM'S practicing for a new season.  BRANDON'S on the sideline, \n               flanked by the COACH and TEAM DOCTOR.\n \n                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER\n               Doc told me it would take years to heal.  One bad hit and it'd \n               be over.  But the team needed me and I had to play to get drafted. \n                I figured I'd take a chance...\n \n               BRANDON looks at the field, the PLAYERS, the empty stands and-- \n                \n \n\n               EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY STADIUM - 1997 - DAY\n\n\n               CROWDED arena.  Electrifying scene.  BRANDON'S suited on the \n               sidelines.  Kick-off.  A SWNU PLAYER returns the ball.  \n \n                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER\n               Every minute of recovery I'd dreamt about this moment.  There \n               were NFL scouts in the stands.  I knew what happened next.\n \n               \n               BRANDON leads his team onto the field.  Into the huddle --\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               Let's ease back into it with our bread \n\n               and butter -- TD first play.  We're going \n\n               deep.  Split right.  Deep two on three!\n\n               (coming up to the line)\n\n               Red 38!  Red 28!  Set!  Set--\n\n               BRANDON drops back.  Blitz.  Brandon about to throw when one \n               of his own LINEMEN is knocked into him and -- BRANDON'S off balance. \n                Too much pressure on that leg and in one horrible moment... \n               it buckles.  BRANDON falls.  The play whistled dead.  \n \n                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER\n               ...It was over.  I could've gone out with class, a gritty smile \n               and a little wave to the crowd from a stretcher, instead I opted \n               to go psycho on national tv.\n \n               The PLAYER who hit him leans down to help.  BRANDON grabs his \n               face mask, starts punching.  Pure rage.  A REFEREE steps in and \n               BRANDON slugs him, slams his face in the turf.  LINEMEN yank \n               BRANDON off as the bloody REF struggles to get free and --\n \n               \n               TV SCREEN -- jim rome sports show\n\n               A highlight reel plays a tape of the incident -- BRANDON seen \n               struggling with PLAYERS as the roughed-up REF crawls away --\n \n               \n                                     JIM ROME\n               Welcome to the jungle!  Hey clones, do you believe this idiot?! \n                That cannot happen!  This is college football, not the ultimate \n               fighting championship!  What we have here is too much muscle \n               and not  enough brain mass -- this is why we need a life-time \n               ban!  Make an example out of him!

People wrote editorials.  Overnight \n               I became the poster boy for the \"Dark Side of Sports.\" \n \n               The college yanked my scholarship and I was kicked out of school. \n                The ref piled on, pressed charges.

Murmer of voices from each one.  EMPLOYEES \n               seen, all reading phone copy into taping devices.  Sex lines, \n               astrology and get-rich-quick schemes are heard.  \n \n                                     BRANDON VOICEOVER\n               Football wasn't a sport, it was my life.

Ask anyone, \n \n               even that reprobate boss of yours.

This? \n                This is just a job offer.  In your top drawer there's an envelope \n               with your name on it.  \n \n               BRANDON opens the drawer, pulls an envelope and a ticket.\n\n                                     WALTER VO\n               That's travel cash and an airline ticket.  It's not a magic trick, \n               Brandon.  I paid someone to put it there, who incidentally\n \n               \n               said the place reminded him of a Turkish prison.

Well run it by them, you won't \n               know until you try... So, they can stay the night.  I'll put \n               'em up at the Plaza, nice suite, park view... Okay double it... \n               Triple it... Everything's about money.  Look, on Sunday, my daughter, \n               an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again.  She\n \n               \n               loves elephants.  Your circus has 10,\n\n               I only want one, my little girl's happiness is in your hands.\n \n               \n               (beat, icy edge)\n\n               I don't need parenting advice from a guy \n\n               who doubles as a clown.  I want an\n\n               elephant and I'll pay.  What'll it take to grease your wheels \n               and get one this weekend?  Hello?...

Get me on the horn with someone who \n               understands profit!\n \n               WALTER sees BRANDON.  Something new.  Full focus.  He removes \n               the headset.  Dons his glasses.  Circles around.  \n \n                                     WALTER\n               Whoa, look at you.  The Marlboro man.\n\n               (feeling his bicep)\n\n               Jesus you're in great shape.\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               I've been in better.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               (assessing BRANDON as he speaks--)\n\n               Modesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity.  There \n               are rules to\n \n               success, Brandon, and this is rule number one, know what you \n               know and know what you don't know and know I gotta know  everything \n               you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner!  Smile.  C'mon! \n                What the hell is that?  I said smile.  Bigger.  Hungrier.  More \n               teeth.  Ever sell before?  \n \n                                     BRANDON\n               No.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               If you can sell you'll never starve.  Ever speak in public?  \n               Perform?  Anything like that?\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               I played quarterback in college.  Division one. \n\n                                     WALTER\n               I know, I'm talking about not in uniform.\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               I used to sing at church.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               Oh really?  So you're religious?  \n\n                                     BRANDON\n               I don't know.  I guess.  \n\n                                     WALTER\n               Certain things, you either are or you aren't.  Which is it?\n \n               \n                                     BRANDON\n               When I was a kid I thought I wanted to be a pastor... obviously \n               not now.  I mean, yeah, I believe in God.\n \n                                     WALTER\n               Relax.  What do I care?  Besides, it's against the law to hire \n               based on religious orientation.  You're not a republican are \n               you?  Just kidding.\n \n               (silent beat, staring at him)\n\n               You're scaring me son.  What's with the deer-caught-in-headlights \n               vibe?  You were a quarterback for God's sake.  A leader.\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               That was six years ago.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               C'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university. \n                You think I went to college?  I'm autodidactic.  Big word, huh? \n                Know what it means?  Self-taught.  Partially by reading, sure, \n               but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid \n               fucking questions.  I swear to God I'm looking at myself 30 years \n               ago.  A taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance \n               is remarkable.\n \n               WALTER crushes out the cigarette, sprays air freshener.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things.  It's \n               bad for my condition.  So before I die, did you do anything other \n               than the sports phone in Vegas?  \n \n                                     BRANDON\n               Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, I mean we got \n               10 bucks a call.\n \n                                     WALTER\n               Chump change, Brandon.  We're angling for bigger fish here.  \n               You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't \n               tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. \n                These gamblers have needs, Brandon.  Come Monday morning, after \n               a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.   \n \n               WALTER presses a button and the TVS fill with football games. \n               \n \n                                     WALTER\n               That's every pro game played last Sunday.\n\n               Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week? \n                It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb \n               out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday.  Sports \n               betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what \n               we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, \n               only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. \n                We make the big money off our client list.  You see, when a \n               client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they \n               gladly give to keep getting our picks.  When they lose we get \n               zip.  So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend \n               -- is to win.\n \n               WALTER clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs.  \n               Phone numbers and messages (\"FOOTBALL SELECTIONS!\" COLLEGE AND \n               PRO!\"  \"BASKETBALL PICKS!\") flash on the screens.  It's a high-octane \n               infomercial for sports gamblers.\n \n                                     TV WALTER\n               Hello -- this is Walter Abrams and welcome to The Sports Advisors \n               and week three in professional football.  After a nice five day \n               vacation on my yacht I can't be any more ready than I am right \n               now.  Studying the mismatches this weekend I can only conclude \n               they're giving my handicappers a license to steal.  I want you \n               to take out a blank \n \n                                     \n               Tv walter con'd\n\n               check right now -- go on, do it -- and write in as much you want \n               to cash it for on Tuesday, that's how much money we're making \n               for you this weekend.  Year in, year out, no stock matches our \n               return, and for the first time in the history of the company \n               I'm releasing our three-team college and pro parlays absolutely \n               free!  That's right.  This is why in a business with a higher \n               turnover rate than Leona Helmsley's maid staff we're still going \n               strong after 28 years!  I'm giving these picks away.  800-238-6648. \n                1-800-BET-ON-IT.  Absolutely free.

Any more?\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               No, that clears up pretty much everything.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               Great.

I had a check-up yesterday. \n                Afterwards \n \n               he was very concerned.

He reaches to Toni's plate, lifts a dessert pitcher.\n \n               \n                                     WALTER\n               You didn't touch the sauce.\n\n                                     TONI\n               Neither should you, Walter.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               I read chocolate's good for you. \n\n                                     TONI\n               I'm not raising a kid alone.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               Don't get dramatic, Toni.

One week's over, another \n               begins.  The past is merely a prologue.  In this job you have \n               to push the envelope every day.  \n \n               BRANDON glances at a nearby table, catches the eye of a stunning \n               GIRL sandwiched between two middle-aged, overweight MEN.  WALTER \n               catches the eye contact before she looks away.  The GIRL seems \n               bored as the two big men heartily chow down.\n \n                                     WALTER\n               Look at that.  Beauty and the beasts.

The girl's gorgeous.  And bored \n               out of her mind.  Waiting for some young buck to save her from \n               those two gorillas.  Check it out.  She's eyeing you again, Brandon.\n \n               \n                                     BRANDON\n               So are the two guys she's with.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if \n               you leave with her.\n \n               Toni\n\n               C'mon Walter.

It's a challenge.  If Brandon leaves with her \n               I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he \n               made last year.  If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give \n               to you. \n \n                                     BRANDON\n               I don't bet, Walter.\n\n               (glancing over, look from the GIRL)\n\n               ...

Before you bust a move, just one thing...\n\n               (talks across the table, addressing the MODEL and the two MEN)\n \n               \n               Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt but \n\n                                     \n               Walter con'd\n\n               I have to know what's going on here.\n\n               You're drop dead gorgeous and your dates\n\n               look like they haven't missed a meal\n\n               since Christ died.

She's right.  I owe 'em a meal.  Hey -- \n               here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom. \n                \n \n               The GIRL glides by their table.

He walks through the restaurant, up the stairs \n               as the WOMEN'S ROOM door opens and the GIRL emerges before him. \n                She regards BRANDON.

Not a cent.\n \n               (murmurs of approval)\n\n               I've listened to thousands of sob stories by people like Leon \n               here, and I gotta say, Leon -- if I learned one thing it's that \n               gambling is not your problem. \n \n                                     LEON\n               It's not?\n\n                                     WALTER\n               Not even close.  You're a lemon.  Like a bad car, there's something \n               inherently defective in you.  And you.  And me!  All of us here \n               -- we're lemons!  Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! \n                We look like everyone else but we're defective because when \n               most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate \n               gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. \n                All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes \n               us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into \n               the void!  And we like doing it so much we do it time after time \n               after time!  Me?  I always felt most alive when they were raking \n               away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. \n                People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time \n               before we give it all back.  But when we lose, and I mean the \n               kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a \n               decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and \n               you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side \n               of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly \n               realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still \n               alive!  In order to really live you have to be aware of your \n               own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of \n               the best ways \n \n                                     \n                                     WALTER CON'D\n               I know of getting that feeling.  When you win, you defy death, \n               but when you lose, \n \n               you survive it, and that's remarkable! \n\n               Us lemons, we fuck shit up on purpose!

Where \n               did you get it?\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               I made it.  Earned it.  Every fucking cent.

Bastard \n               treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor.  Never once returned \n               a call.  I've been trying to bag this guy for years.

WALTER looks wide-eyed up at BRANDON, mouths \n               \"Big one.\"  BRANDON frantically loosens WALTER'S shirt.  A crowd \n               gathers.  A BUSINESSMAN pulls a cell phone, dials 911.    \n \n               \n                                     BRANDON\n               Hold on, Walter we're getting help!  Oh my God.

You have a beautiful \n               home.  Let's start with how much you bet.\n \n                                     NOVIAN\n               A million a game, across the board.\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               Nice round number, is that our ceiling here?  Is that the most \n               we're working with?\n \n                                     NOVIAN\n               \"We're\" not doing anything until I hear how you feel about this \n               weekend.\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               Do you rent that yacht out there?\n\n                                     NOVIAN\n               I own it.\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend.  That may sound \n               cocky, I don't care.  I didn't come down here to lie. \n \n                                     NOVIAN\n               Do you have inside information?\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               If I did I wouldn't share that with you.  My record speaks for \n               itself.  The truth is I know these teams better than they know \n               themselves.  I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes \n               the Monday Night parlay.   \n \n                                     NOVIAN\n               Why should I believe you?\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to.\n\n                                     NOVIAN\n               I can afford to do any damn thing I please.\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               Can you?  What I'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter \n               -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to \n               bet to feel a win?  Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's \n               one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy.  Or was, \n               until you called me.\n \n               Charged beat.  A tight grin's glued to WALTER'S face.\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian -- up-front -- in \n               addition to a percentage of every game you win.\n \n                                     NOVIAN\n               Fuck you.

But with what you're betting, \n               250 up front's a bargain.  You want this weekend's winners, that's \n               my offer.  Take it or leave it.\n \n                                     NOVIAN\n               (standing)\n\n               ...

Too bad.  Woulda been fun.  Grown \n               men crying on the phone.

BRANDON riding \n               his bike, pedaling fast when a MAN suddenly steps out, flash \n               of something in his hand, jamming it in the spokes and --BRANDON \n               wipes out, over the handlebars -- hard to the ground --\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               Son of a bitch...

And I \n               can't get my money back.  It's gone.  No, I came for an apology.\n \n               \n               The BODYGUARD holds him tight.  Light fading.  No one around.\n \n               \n                                     NOVIAN\n               Look me in the eye and say you're sorry. Say it so as to make \n               me believe you mean it.\n \n               Cold gust.

Try again.\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               I don't know what you want me to say.  I'm sorry.  I am.

Unbuttons his coat.  Sound of a \n               zipper.  BRANDON glances down, sees Novian reach into his fly. \n                BRANDON jumps.  The BODYGUARD holds him.  NOVIAN comes close. \n                BRANDON struggles, very unsure where this might be going and--\n \n               \n               He squirms -- enduring something -- trickling water heard -- \n               NOVIAN staring right at BRANDON -- finishes pissing on BRANDON'S \n               leg.  NOVIAN motions his BODYGUARD to let go and the men walk \n               off.  BRANDON stands there.  Alone in the gloom and --\n \n\n               INT.

Oh wait, I take that back -- you meant \n               5000 bucks.  Your friend set it up.\n \n               (already heading back inside)\n\n               Don't fucking bother me again.\n\n\n               EXT.

BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAWN\n\n\n               BRANDON sits at his desk.  Staring out at the city.  His phone \n               rings.  Again.  Again.  Finally pressing speaker phone -- \n \n               \n                                     BRANDON\n               Hello.\n\n               Intercut - amir in payphone beside N.J.

Who the fuck are you, like this is \n               some kind of game.  I was betting a few thousand a Sunday when \n               I called you.  You pushed me.  Every call.  All the time with \n               your talk... I lost $380,000 this weekend... I was going to get \n               married... I had a life... \n \n               BRANDON staring at the phone, barely holding it together, sees \n               TAMMY standing there -- holding the day's newspapers, hearing \n               the conversation on speaker.\n \n                                     AMIR\n               No words now, huh?

BRANDON \n               glances down, something catches his eye.  BRANDON pulls a newspaper \n               from the pile -- finds himself staring at a full-page ad for \n               JOHN ANTHONY.  Big smile.  Copy advertising \"The Million Dollar \n               Man!\" and -- \n \n\n               INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\n\n\n               BRANDON paces the dim space.  Sits on the bench press.  Leans \n               back on the board.  He stares up at the weights.  Moves the weight \n               pin to 250... and slowly starts to lift.  One rep.  Two.  Three. \n                Four.  A bad of sweat forms.  BRANDON throws off the jacket. \n                Pulls off the tie.  Removes his shirt and shoes.  He resumes \n               lifting, grim determination -- the weights rising over and over \n               and over -- faster and faster and --\n \n\n               INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING\n\n\n               BRANDON, t-shirt and sweats, approaches WALTER'S office, bursts \n               through the door --\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               I know what the problem is!\n\n               BRANDON freezes.  WALTER watches two MEN unload stacks of money \n               from a briefcase, pile them on his desk. \n \n                                     BRANDON\n               I'll come back later.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               No!  C'mon in.  We're done here.  Right fellas?  All through? \n                You want a bite before you go?  Something to drink? \n \n               The two MEN leave.

From now on we take your picks and reverse everything! \n                Like a Twilight Zone episode where everything's the opposite! \n                You say black we go white!  A is B!

The \n               last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off.  He'll come around. \n                Climb out on his own.  Now I figure fuck it!  Time to turn on \n               the lights!  Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! \n                Maybe that'll shake him up!  So what do you want to know?  I \n               got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to \n               cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of \n               a bar on a 106th and Broadway!  All this -- everything you see \n               around you -- \n \n               is smoke and mirrors!  I shoulda been a magician!\n\n                                     \n                                     WALTER CON'D\n               ... What'd you say when you came in?  You    were in a good mood \n               when you walked through the door and you said something.\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               You're betting my picks?\n\n                                     WALTER\n               You went 82 and 11!  You were picking 80 percent -- how could \n               I fucking not!?  Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred \n               percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet!  One decent \n               weekend and I would have been set for life!  One decent weekend! \n                \n \n               BRANDON stares at him, stunned.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               \"I know what the problem is!\"  That's it!  You came in with a \n               big smile and said, \"I know what the problem is!\"\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               ... I'm Brandon Lang, Walter.  Brandon's the one who played sports. \n                Brandon's the one who can pick games.  I lost touch with him \n               -- myself.  It wasn't an act, man.  I became John Anthony.  But \n               he's not me.  If I go back to being Brandon--\n \n                                     WALTER\n               --You can pick again!  Of course!\n\n               All you gotta do is go back to being Brandon!  Talk like Brandon! \n                Eat like Brandon!  Forget John Anthony!  Burn the suits!  It's \n               all my fault.  I see that now.  I pushed you into something you \n               weren't.  I took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a \n               duck.  We're winding down the season.  There's only two games \n               this weekend.  Two winners and two over/unders.  That's all we \n               need.  You crunch the numbers, sprinkle in a little Brandon magic, \n               we get the sales people burning up the phones and come Monday \n               we go four for four going into the big game!  Right?  Huh?  Let's \n               get\n \n               something to eat!  Go to Smith and Wo's!\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               No thanks.  I'll stay here.

What am I thinking trying to get you to go \n               out?  What would Brandon eat for lunch?  Peanut butter and jelly? \n                Ramen noodles?  What?\n \n                                     BRANDON\n               (on the floor, helping him)\n\n               I'll get something.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               You want anything shipped from home?

I fucked with that.  Two little \n               winners and a couple of over/unders.  That's all we need.  You \n               could phone it in.  Two's nothing.  Not for you.  Not for Brandon. \n                Right, Brandon?  Isn't that right?\n \n               BRANDON stands.  Looks down at WALTER, unable to hide the desperation \n               behind his frozen smile and --\n \n               MONTAGE OF BRANDON WORKING THROUGH THE WEEk\n\n               --BRANDON closes the blinds in his office, blocks the view --BRANDON \n               works out, watching ESPN -- the SALES STAFF sit idle at their \n               desks, playing cards -- a pick sheet fills FRAME,  shows New \n               York versus Atlanta, Tenessee versus Kansas City and an over/under \n               beneath each game -- WALTER waits in the SALES ROOM, edgy, pacing \n               when BRANDON emerges holding the sheet -- all eyes on him -- \n               WALTER approaches --\n \n                                     WALTER\n               These are the winners?\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               That's who I like.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               Brandon made these picks?\n\n                                     BRANDON\n               You're looking at him.\n\n                                     WALTER\n               (regarding the picks, to the room)\n\n               New York and the under, Tenessee and the under!  Sell 'em hard!\n \n               \n\n               INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n\n               SALES STAFF crowd into the room.  WALTER and BRANDON sit side-by-side. \n                Seconds before kickoff of the New York/Atlanta game.  JULIA \n               climbs into WALTER'S lap, holding her puppy.\n \n               Julia\n\n               Can I watch, daddy?\n\n                                     WALTER\n               Sure, Angel.  I need you to root for me.\n\n               (pointing at ATLANTA)\n\n               They're the bad guys.  Atlanta.  We want the blue team.  New \n               York.  They have to win by more than five points.  And root for \n               a low score.  Both teams have to make less than 42 points total. \n                New York and under 42 points.\n \n                                     JULIA\n               Why do we like the blue team?\n\n                                     WALTER\n               Because Brandon likes them.\n\n               JULIA looks at BRANDON, smiles.  BRANDON'S barely holding up \n               here, forces himself to find a smile in return.\n \n               THE TV FILLS FRAME.  New York kicks off.  An Atlanta RECEIVER \n               takes it back for a 60 yard return.  We start cutting from the \n               game to BRANDON, to WALTER, the SALESPEOPLE, JULIA, all reacting \n               as the betting Gods raise hopes one play, dash them the next. \n                Play after play.  Tide going for New York one minute, Atlanta \n               the next.  Tension in the room building. Everyone crowds the \n               TVs as New York defends a 10 point lead with a minute left.  \n               37 points on the board.  Only an Atlanta TD can lose the two \n               bets and they're 80 yards from scoring.  A few high fives as \n               Atlanta fumbles on a run, recover the ball for a five yard loss. \n                Backed up to their own end zone.  Two plays left.
