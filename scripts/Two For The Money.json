Sports \n               betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what \n               we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, \n               only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. \n                We make the big money off our client list.  You see, when a \n               client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they \n               gladly give to keep getting our picks.  When they lose we get \n               zip.

Once \n               a week, every Friday night, for 18 years.  This, my friends, \n               is my 936th consecutive meeting.\n<b> \n</b>               (enthusiastic applause)\n\n               Thank you.  Thanks.

Not a cent.\n<b> \n</b>               (murmurs of approval)\n\n               I've listened to thousands of sob stories by people like Leon \n               here, and I gotta say, Leon -- if I learned one thing it's that \n               gambling is not your problem. \n<b> \n</b><b>                                     LEON\n</b>               It's not?\n\n<b>                                     WALTER\n</b>               Not even close.  You're a lemon.  Like a bad car, there's something \n               inherently defective in you.  And you.  And me!  All of us here \n               -- we're lemons!  Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! \n                We look like everyone else but we're defective because when \n               most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate \n               gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. \n                All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes \n               us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into \n               the void!  And we like doing it so much we do it time after time \n               after time!  Me?  I always felt most alive when they were raking \n               away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. \n                People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time \n               before we give it all back.  But when we lose, and I mean the \n               kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a \n               decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and \n               you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side \n               of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly \n               realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still \n               alive!  In order to really live you have to be aware of your \n               own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of \n               the best ways \n<b> \n</b><b>                                     \n</b><b>                                     WALTER CON'D\n</b>               I know of getting that feeling.  When you win, you defy death, \n               but when you lose, \n<b> \n</b>               you survive it, and that's remarkable! \n\n               Us lemons, we fuck shit up on purpose!  We need to constantly \n               remind ourselves\n<b> \n</b>               that we're alive!  Gambling's not the problem, Leon, your fucked \n               up need to feel something, to convince yourself you exist, to \n               test what's really real, that's the problem!\n<b> \n</b><b>                                     BICYCLE MESSENGER\n</b>               Hey!

Only an Atlanta TD can lose the two \n               bets and they're 80 yards from scoring.  A few high fives as \n               Atlanta fumbles on a run, recover the ball for a five yard loss. \n                Backed up to their own end zone.  Two plays left.
