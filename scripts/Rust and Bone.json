THE CHILD\r\n</b>          Gradually more and more visible in the darkness, the face\r\n          of a child, Sam. He is 6 years old, blond, pale and\r\n          miserably thin. As we move in on his eyes, we see his lids\r\n          quickly contracting.\r\n          Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and\r\n          shadows, of the day's noise.\r\n\r\n<b>          2.

He\r\n          follows the lines to plot out their trip. He arrives where\r\n          France ends, at the Mediterranean.

He searches through the garbage under\r\n          other empty seats.\r\n          Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish\r\n          off abandoned bottles of water.\r\n\r\n<b>          5.

Sam watches the\r\n          landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat.

It's\r\n          hot and beautiful. They walk by tanned people in shorts,\r\n          short skirts, sandals...\r\n          In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes.\r\n          Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the\r\n          other.\r\n          Ali is on the phone:\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALI\r\n</b>          I don't know.

A refrigerated truck, blinking to get\r\n          to the side of the road.

In pool number\r\n          3, a five-ton black shadow bides its time: it is Niska.\r\n          Behind the grate in pool number 3, Niska watches her mates\r\n          diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles.\r\n          A mechanical creak, then the grate slowly begins to lift.\r\n          It's about to be her turn.\r\n\r\n<b>                         25\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Niska swims into the big pool, slowly at first, but then\r\n          picks up speed. She surfaces, disappears for a long beat,\r\n          then again reappears, churning up a whirlpool of bubbles.\r\n          On the other side of the mirror, the music blares and the\r\n          crowd cheers.\r\n          What looks like a small black and white arrow dives into\r\n          the pool. We recognize Stephanie. She caresses Niska's\r\n          rostrum, then kisses it, hanging onto her fins, waltzing\r\n          with her up to the surface. Her hands look ridiculously\r\n          tiny on the huge black fins. We see her face mirrored in\r\n          one of the orca's huge black, gentle eyes. A liquid world\r\n          of greens and blues whirls around them.\r\n          Now, with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum,\r\n          Stephanie has Niska swim around the pool, accelerating the\r\n          water pressure and speed. The plastic wall rushes by, a\r\n          rush of adrenaline\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 clouds of sediment are lifted as if by\r\n          a gust of wind.\r\n          A young male, Tom, joins Niska in pool number 1. Niska\r\n          immediately rushes him, as if riled by the intrusion, and\r\n          flattens him against the plastic wall.\r\n          In the shifting reflections at the water's surface, we can\r\n          make out Stephanie and two other trainers' faces on the\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u0098beach'. Their palms beat on the water, summoning the orcas\r\n          for their next number.\r\n          Tom gathers some momentum, then shoots around Niska to jump\r\n          into first place. He disappears a moment, then is back into\r\n          the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning.\r\n          Niska then gets into place and takes a running start, but\r\n          just as she is about to shoot out of the water, Tom appears\r\n          out of nowhere and forces the huge female to leap over him.\r\n          We sense chaos up above. Then we see Niska crash back into\r\n          the water, with, one after the other, a piece of the huge\r\n          video screen that towered over the stage, bits of scenery,\r\n          and all kinds of random objects, as if Niska had carried\r\n          away half the platform in her wake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It all seems to fall\r\n          in slow motion, like flecks of snow in a snow globe.\r\n          Something sinks toward us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 a body, floating weightless and\r\n          disjointed in a cloud of red.\r\n\r\n<b>                         26\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          30.

He slips, gets back up and runs\r\n          again... he again breathes into Sam's mouth... while still\r\n          running...\r\n\r\n<b>          142. INT. STRASBOURG - HOSPITAL - ICU. DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Leaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali\r\n          sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors...\r\n          his skin is blue from the cold... there is a tube in his\r\n          mouth... his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a\r\n          respirator... his mouth spits out brackish water\r\n          brutally...\r\n          A door opens and a nurse appears. Ali straightens up.\r\n\r\n<b>                         NURSE\r\n</b>          We'll take care of you. Come with me.\r\n          He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his\r\n          hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred\r\n          fingers, his broken, bloodied hands.\r\n\r\n<b>                         118\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          143. INT. SAM'S HOSPITAL ROOM. EVENING\r\n</b>\r\n          Sam is lying in a hospital bed. His eyes are closed and\r\n          coils of tubes attach him to control apparatus.\r\n          Ali is at his side. His hands are now wrapped in thick\r\n          bandages. The disinfectant makes him look like he is\r\n          wearing yellow gloves halfway up his arms.\r\n          Richard is standing behind him, near the window.\r\n          Ali takes Sam's fingers, places them in the palm of his\r\n          bandaged hand and looks at them.\r\n          Sam's eyes begin to dart wildly under his eyelids... his\r\n          fingers quiver... his eyes open.\r\n\r\n<b>          144. INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR. NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          There are not many people in the corridor at this late\r\n          hour. Richard is bent over a coffee machine. A cup slowly\r\n          fills up. Farther off, Ali is KO, leaning against a wall.\r\n          Richard brings him a coffee. Ali takes it clumsily into his\r\n          damaged hands.\r\n          Richard's cell phone rings. He moves away to answer and\r\n          speaks into it softly. A few moments later, he returns to\r\n          Ali and hands him the phone.\r\n\r\n<b>                         RICHARD\r\n</b>          Here.

INT. POLAND. HOTEL ROOM. DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          A child sleeps.\r\n          His eyes are darting under his eyelids: vestiges of light\r\n          and shadow, of noise.\r\n          Sam opens his eyes: he is in a hotel room. At the foot of\r\n          the bed, a TV with the sound turned down low is\r\n          broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in Polish.\r\n          Stephanie comes and goes, picking up things littering the\r\n          floor and packing their bags.\r\n          Over these images, we hear Ali's voice:\r\n          The human hand contains 27 bones. Some\r\n          monkeys have more: gorillas have 32, five in\r\n\r\n<b>                         121\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          each thumb. For humans, it's 27.\r\n          If you break an arm or a leg, after a while\r\n          calcium gathers around the bone and joins it\r\n          together. In the end, it's stronger than\r\n          before. But if you break a bone in your\r\n          hand, you know it'll never fully heal.\r\n          You'll think about it before every fight.\r\n          You'll pay attention... And even if you pay\r\n          attention, the pain will come back... like\r\n          needles, like broken glass...\r\n          Ali is wearing a T-shirt. He still bears the marks of\r\n          yesterday's fight. His eyebrows and hands are bandaged.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALI\r\n</b>          Wake up, kiddo. It's over.

DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          The lobby of a Holiday Inn, the day after an Ultimate\r\n          tournament... (much the same ambience as in Turin) The\r\n          fighters, winners and losers, are about to leave. They\r\n          greet each other, pose for photographers, answer\r\n          interviewers, sign autographs... Ali's hands are still\r\n          bandaged. He is being interviewed along with a kind of\r\n          Viking with a closed eye and broken arm.\r\n          Ali goes to join Stephanie and Sam outside the hotel, where\r\n          a taxi driver is loading their luggage. A young Polish fan\r\n          calls out: \"Ali! Ali!\" He wants a photo.\r\n          Ali lifts Sam into his arms and pulls Stephanie closer.\r\n          They pose.\r\n\r\n<b>                         THE END\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Rust-and-Bone.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Rust and Bone</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Jacques Audiard\" title=\"Scripts by Jacques Audiard\">Jacques Audiard</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Thomas Bidegain\" title=\"Scripts by Thomas Bidegain\">Thomas Bidegain</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Rust and Bone Script.html#comments\" title=\"Rust and Bone comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:15:12.210273"}
