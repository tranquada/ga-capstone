MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE IN GRAINY BLACK\n</b><b>AND WHITE)\n</b>\nFade out music.\n\nSilence.\n\nA well-dressed black BOY and his MOTHER walk through several\ngalleries.\n\nThey stand before Picasso's \"Guernica,\" holding hands.\n\nThe mother is disturbed. Crying.\n\nThe boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see his\nmother crying in public. She looks at him tenderly.\n\nHer brow furrows. She stops crying. She stares just above his\neyes.\n\nSomething's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of his\nhead... his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown!\n\nHe raises his hands. He touches it.\n\nA beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on his\nmother's face.\n\nThe beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black.\n\n\n<b>INT. CARDBOARD BOX\n</b>\nSilence. In darkness, we hear a VOICE - imbued with a sense of\nits own history:\n\n<b>                      VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>           Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh\n           boat. There's no trip so horrible that\n           someone won't take it. The idea of the\n           unrecognized genius slaving away in a\n           garret is a deliciously foolish one. We\n           must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh\n           for really sending this myth into orbit.\n           How many pictures did he sell? One? He\n           couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed\n           of his life that the rest of art history\n           will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect.\n           No one wants to be part of a generation\n           that ignores another Van Gogh.\n\nThe beam of light shines through a small hole. It falls upon a\nsleeping, dreaming, delighted face. It belongs to JEAN MICHEL\n<b>BASQUIAT.\n</b>\nOUTDOOR, DAYTIME SOUNDS filter in.\n<b>\n</b>Hearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up.\n\n\n<b>EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY\n</b>\nA long, rectangular cardboard box.\n\n<b>SUPER: \"NEW YORK CITY\"\n</b>\n\n<b>ANGLE ON:\n</b>\nRENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a\nnotebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt and\nwhite hightops.\n\nAs he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity.\n\n<b>                        RENE (CONT'D)\n</b>                   (sighing theatrically)\n            In this town one is at the mercy of the\n            recognition factor.

I am a witness.\n\nA HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's.\n\nJean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban\npark around him is alive with a typically full range of the good\nand bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in\nwhich he has spent the night. There's something about the way\nthat he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost\nsurprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a\nsubtle hint of him coming out of a dream.\n\nHe squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face.\nHis hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue\njeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered\nWesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of an\novercoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He's\nstylish.\n\nHe shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a\nsmall book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and\na cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking\ntape.\n\nJean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the\nsky:\n\n\n<b>SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFER\n</b>\nJean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering\n<b>\n</b>sunlight.\n\n<b>                                                  DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.

She continues to work.\n\nStill staring at her, he sits down at a table. He pours maple\nsyrup onto the table. He draws in the syrup with his fingers.\n\n\n<b>CLOSE ON SYRUP ON TABLE\n</b>\nANOTHER WAITRESS arrives at his table.

He doesn't like what he sees.\n\nJean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself. He\ndraws a picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware,\nrendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines.\n\nA GAUNT YOUNG MAN saunters up to Jean's table. He's sort of a\ntall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes. He is BENNY.\n\n<b>                      BENNY\n</b>           Hey - Willie Mays.\n\n<b>                      BASQUIAT\n</b>           Willie Mays.\n<b>\n</b>Suddenly, Rene Ricard enters - a one-man parade.

She said she wanted to be by\n           my side and have inter-racial babies with\n           me.\n\nBenny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his\n<b>\n</b>index finger.\n\n<b>                      BENNY\n</b>           G'night... See you in court tomorrow.\n\nJean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paper\nBenny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on\nfire.\n\nHe lights the roach with it.\n\nHe looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jean\nturns up the volume.\n\nThe bum's on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocket\nrecorder and turns it on:\n\n<b>                      BUM\n</b>           The guy just hit me and I was on the\n           ground!!!!

He turns on the speakerphone.\n\nJean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the\nphone.

With cardboard in one hand and\nbugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach.\n\nHe's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can.\n\nSomeone POUNDS furiously at the door.\n\nIgnoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the\npiece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a\nsymbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.\n\n<b>                      LANDLADY\n</b>           Miss Cardinale...

Jean steadies the ladder.

Milo, (also about\n30), wears    casual clothes splattered with paint. Mary Boone is\nengaged in    conversation with Milo. Rene chatters away.\n\nGreg climbs back up the ladder. He holds a piece of wire down to\nJean. Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible.\n\n<b>                         RENE\n</b>              I need to make a call, Mary.

BOONE GALLERY - ALBERT MILO OPENING - DUSK\n</b>\nThe ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across the\nstreet, watching through the window.\n\nCabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks the\nstreet.\n\nJean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged -     he feels\nentitled to all this.\n\nHe crosses the street to get a closer look.\n\n\n<b>THROUGH THE WINDOW\n</b>\nHe sees Albert Milo    talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO\nBISCHOFBERGER. Andy,    of course, is thin, silver-haired, and\nnearly albino. Bruno    is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's. He exudes\nmoney - a pillar of    security.\n\nOn the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a\ncoterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks\ndrunk, enjoying the moment, holding court.\n\nRene crosses to Albert and Andy.\n\nPeople pass by.\n\nJean starts to walk.\n\nAbout half a block away, he sprays on a wall:\n\n<b>\"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALL\n</b><b>CRUSHED INTO THESE FEET\"\n</b>\nHe looks pleased.

The crumbs fall onto the paintings.\nHe walks on them.\n\nEvery so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings.

The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and\nwalking over the paintings, wagging his tail.\n\nHe stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music.\n\nJean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line of\ncoke on a foil plate.\n\nRene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written:\n\n<b>                      RENE\n</b>           3rd night I called    him 'boy'\n           He sed \"don't call    me 'boy'\" \"Well\n           Then don't call me    'Boss'\" That\n           Was the end for us    and I've\n           Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years.\n           In kangaroo court I    want to be\n<b>\n</b>           Able to say I never kept a\n           Slave.

He lights and hands Rene the\njoint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back.\n\nJean starts to work again.\n\nThe PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way,\nrunning across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag.

A thick\nwooden plank suspended by chains for a bench. A candle on the\nwall.\n\nA small, crowned prince (the boy seen in the dream in intro.)\nlooks longingly out the window at rolling green hills.

An evil warlock kidnapped him,\n           locked him in a cell in a huge tower and\n           took away his voice. There was a window\n           made of bars. The prince would smash his\n           head against the bars hoping that someone\n           would hear the sound and find him. The\n           crown made the most beautiful sound that\n           anyone ever heard. You could hear the\n           ringing for miles. It was so beautiful,\n           that people wanted to grab the air. They\n           never found the prince. He never got out of\n           the room. But the sound he made filled\n           everything up with beauty.\n\n<b>                      BASQUIAT (O.S)\n</b>           It's definitely time to get out of here.\n\n\n<b>EXT.
