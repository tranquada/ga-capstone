MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE IN GRAINY BLACK\nAND WHITE)\n\nFade out music.\n\nSilence.\n\nA well-dressed black BOY and his MOTHER walk through several\ngalleries.\n\nThey stand before Picasso's \"Guernica,\" holding hands.\n\nThe mother is disturbed. Crying.\n\nThe boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see his\nmother crying in public. She looks at him tenderly.\n\nHer brow furrows. She stops crying. She stares just above his\neyes.\n\nSomething's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of his\nhead... his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown!\n\nHe raises his hands. He touches it.\n\nA beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on his\nmother's face.\n\nThe beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black.\n\n\nINT. CARDBOARD BOX\n\nSilence. In darkness, we hear a VOICE - imbued with a sense of\nits own history:\n\n                      VOICE (O.S.)\n           Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh\n           boat. There's no trip so horrible that\n           someone won't take it. The idea of the\n           unrecognized genius slaving away in a\n           garret is a deliciously foolish one. We\n           must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh\n           for really sending this myth into orbit.\n           How many pictures did he sell? One? He\n           couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed\n           of his life that the rest of art history\n           will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect.\n           No one wants to be part of a generation\n           that ignores another Van Gogh.\n\nThe beam of light shines through a small hole. It falls upon a\nsleeping, dreaming, delighted face. It belongs to JEAN MICHEL\nBASQUIAT.\n\nOUTDOOR, DAYTIME SOUNDS filter in.\n\nHearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up.\n\n\nEXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY\n\nA long, rectangular cardboard box.\n\nSUPER: \"NEW YORK CITY\"\n\n\nANGLE ON:\n\nRENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a\nnotebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt and\nwhite hightops.\n\nAs he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity.\n\n                        RENE (CONT'D)\n                   (sighing theatrically)\n            In this town one is at the mercy of the\n            recognition factor. One's public\n            appearance is absolute.\n\nBeyond him, a HAND gropes its way out of the box. It tosses a can\nof YOOHOO chocolate drink.\n\n                       RENE (CONT'D)\n            I consider myself a metaphor of the public.\n            I am a public eye. I am a witness.\n\nA HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's.\n\nJean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban\npark around him is alive with a typically full range of the good\nand bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in\nwhich he has spent the night. There's something about the way\nthat he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost\nsurprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a\nsubtle hint of him coming out of a dream.\n\nHe squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face.\nHis hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue\njeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered\nWesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of an\novercoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He's\nstylish.\n\nHe shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a\nsmall book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and\na cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking\ntape.\n\nJean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the\nsky:\n\n\nSUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFER\n\nJean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering\n\nsunlight.\n\n                                                  DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY\n\nRene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out\nloud as he writes.\n\n                       RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)\n            Part of the artist's job is to get the work\n            where I will see it.\n\n\nEXT. LOWER EAST SIDE ST. - DAY\n\nAs he speaks, we see Jean pass the wall of a funeral parlor. He\nspraypaints: \"SAMO AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD\"\n\n                        RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)\n            When you first see a new picture, you don't\n            want to miss the boat. You have to be very\n            careful because you may be staring at Van\n            Gogh's ear.\n\nJean signs his words with his 'logo', a triple pointed crown.\n\nAs he presses the spray can, we HEAR the roar of a breaker.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n\nINSERT: CLOSEUP OF SIDEWALK\n\nPressed into the concrete is a pair of EYEGLASSES.

LESHKO'S RESTAURANT - DAY\n\nBending over a countertop, we see GINA CARDINALE, 22. He fixates\non her.\n\nShe looks up and notices his stare. She continues to work.\n\nStill staring at her, he sits down at a table. He pours maple\nsyrup onto the table. He draws in the syrup with his fingers.\n\n\nCLOSE ON SYRUP ON TABLE\n\nANOTHER WAITRESS arrives at his table. She's put off by the\nsyrup.\n\n                      WAITRESS\n           What'll it be?\n\nJean thinks about it, eyes still following Gina.\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n           Ummm. It'll be great. We'll live together\n           in peace. What's her name?\n                  (indicates Gina)\n\nHe looks up at the waitress.\n\n                      WAITRESS\n           Gina. What'll it be?\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n           Pancakes.\n\nShe leaves and whispers something to Gina. Gina turns and glances\nover at Jean.\n\nJean pours more syrup and starts writing his name.\n\nAt the grill, LESHKO, the burly Owner/Cook, has his watchful eye\non Jean. He doesn't like what he sees.\n\nJean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself. He\ndraws a picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware,\nrendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines.\n\nA GAUNT YOUNG MAN saunters up to Jean's table. He's sort of a\ntall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes. He is BENNY.\n\n                      BENNY\n           Hey - Willie Mays.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Willie Mays.\n\nSuddenly, Rene Ricard enters - a one-man parade. He beckons to\nGina, snapping his fingers.\n\n                      RENE\n           Nurse!!! Oh!!! Nurse!!! Carrot juice. Tofu\n           burger.

She can't resist\nsmiling.\n\n                      GINA\n           It's me. I've never been done in maple\n           syrup. Here's a rag.\n\nGina smiles. She offers him one. As she holds it out, their eyes\nlock. She tries to resist his smile.\n\n                        BASQUIAT\n                   (gently)\n           Gina?\n\nShe puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off.\n\nBenny takes it all in.\n\nLeshko is upon them.\n\n                      LESHKO\n           Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl,\n           making a mess.\n\nHe waves Jean toward the door.\n\nJean takes Gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seemingly\ncompliant.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           How about those pancakes?\n\nHe brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open.\nDimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts. The\nmanager explodes.\n\n                      LESHKO\n           OK! Goodbye!\n\n                      GINA\n           Pipe down, Lech.

AVE. A - DAY\n\nThey stand outside, not knowing quite what comes next.\n\nJean gives Benny a look (i.e. 'scram').\n\n                      BENNY\n           Catch you later.\n\nBenny leaves.\n\nA CHILLY WIND picks up.\n\nJean's mood is suddenly downcast.\n\nThey button up their overcoats, about to leave.\n\n                       GINA\n           What's a job, anyway?\n                  (pause)\n           What's wrong with you?\n\nThe truth is, he feels awful for causing Gina's trouble, but\nshows it by moping like a child.\n\n                      GINA (CONT'D)\n           No, don't tell me - you just got fired by\n           your crazy boss.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           I guess you did.\n\n                      GINA\n           Guess I just got sick of him.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Can I walk you home?\n\n                      GINA\n           I think I could do that alone.\n\nGina walks away.\n\nHe runs after her.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Wait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd\n           Club on Halloween.

You could use a\n           scrub.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good.

MENTAL HOSPITAL (OUTSIDE THE CITY)\n\nWe see Jean crossing a lawn outside a mental hospital.\n\n\nINT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - RECREATION / VISITING ROOM - DAY\n\nPSYCH. PATIENTS fill a cavernous day-room engaged in arts and\n\ncrafts. Some of the sadder patients stare off into space as Jean\ncrosses the room. He carries a plate of cookies and a full glass\nof milk.\n\nHe approaches a sad, nice-looking, middle-aged black woman - the\nsame one from the dream, earlier. She sits alone fondling a\npillow in her lap. It's his mother, MATILDE. She doesn't see him\ncoming.\n\nAs he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him. She\nrecognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation. He\nkisses her on the cheek.\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n           Hey, mom.\n\nShe smiles slightly.\n\nJean takes a cookie. She does likewise.\n\nThey eat in silence, looking at each other, communicating what\nthey can.\n\nTime passes. In between cookies her fingers find and break the\nstems of the pillow feathers.\n\n                      BASQUIAT (CONT'D)\n           I met the girl I'm gonna marry.\n\nHis mother brightens. She drinks the milk. They finish the\ncookies.\n\n                      MATILDE\n           Do you like it here?\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           I'd like it better in Hawaii.\n\n\nINT. CARDBOARD BOX - NIGHT\n\nJean tries to sleep in the box. RAIN falls heavily onto it.\n\nDrops of water hit his face.\n\nHe wills it to stop. It doesn't.\n\nFinally, he can't stand it. Rain forces his blinking eyes open.\n\n\nINT. BENNY'S APARTMENT -     NIGHT\n\nA door opens to reveal Jean's wet face.\n\nBenny lets him in.\n\nJean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical\ninstruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There's a couch with a\nsheet over it.\n\nJunk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings.\n\nBenny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently\nplaying. He sings along, softly, working out the words,\nconcentrating, absorbed.\n\nJean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and\nstarts making up his own words.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           \"She loves me.\n           Oh yeah she loves me!\n           She loooooooves me,\n           Oh yeah she loves me!\"\n           Bring me some chicken, baby!\n\n                      BENNY\n           Would you shut the fuck up?

You're always great,\n           Benny.\n                  (goes back into 'act')\n           \"Her name is G-I-N-A Gina\n           And she lo-oooves me.\"\n           I did say chicken!\n\nBenny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean's\nself-centeredness.\n\nJean digs through a pile of garbage. Finally, he finds what he's\nlooking for - a pile of \"SAMO baseball cards\" - color Xeroxes of\nhis favorite images and words. He pockets them.\n\n                       BASQUIAT (CONT'D)\n           I knew I left these somewhere. One of\n           these'll send your kids to college someday.\n                  (hands it to Benny solemnly)\n           Here - I made this for you.\n\n                       BENNY\n           Thanks.\n                  (beat)\n           Your dad called again - something about a\n           job.\n\nHe hands Jean a slip of paper. He notices the number on Jean's\npants.\n\n                      BENNY (CONT'D)\n           You got a date already?\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n                  (exhaling)\n           We're getting married. She said she could\n           tell I was a great artist - she could see\n           it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by\n           my side and have inter-racial babies with\n           me.\n\nBenny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his\n\nindex finger.\n\n                      BENNY\n           G'night... See you in court tomorrow.\n\nJean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paper\nBenny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on\nfire.\n\nHe lights the roach with it.\n\nHe looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jean\nturns up the volume.\n\nThe bum's on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocket\nrecorder and turns it on:\n\n                      BUM\n           The guy just hit me and I was on the\n           ground!!!! Boom, for real.\n\nJean mutes the sound on the TV. He rewinds and proudly plays back\nthe words \"Boom, for real.\"\n\nHe picks up the phone and dials. He turns on the speakerphone.\n\nJean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the\nphone. (Jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following.)\n\n                      VOICE\n           Hello?\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n                  (deadpan)\n           I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?\n\n                      VOICE\n           Yes. My name is Chris. What's yours?\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Jean Michel.\n\n                      CHRIS\n           That's a beautiful name. French?\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm\n           taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.\n\nJean opens his notepad and looks down a long list of seemingly\nrandom words. He comes to the words (in order) \"liquid, hijack,\"\nand \"Marlboros.\"\n\n                      CHRIS\n           What? Wait a minute... talk to me.\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n                  (about to sob)\n           Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's\n           k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack\n           Marlboros!\n\n                       CHRIS\n           What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't\n           permanent. Don't you believe that?\n                  (pause)\n           What is it - did your girlfriend leave you?\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.\n\nJean spies an electric pencil sharpener and plugs it in.\n\n                      CHRIS\n           You see? You have someone to live for.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are.\n           Especially here. The world's unjust. The\n           respect fools get. The disrespect I get.\n\n                      CHRIS\n           What is it you want?    Respect? I have\n           respect for you, just    for making this call.\n           One philosopher said    \"Sadness is a sin\n           against the richness    of the world.\" Think\n           about it. Feel it.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           You don't even know me. I want real\n           respect.\n\nHe jams a pencil into the electric sharpener and holds the\nreceiver right next to it, giving the guy an earful:\nRRRRKKKKKKK!!!\n\n\nANGLE ON\n\nCLOSE UP - A speaker. It fills the screen.\n\nWe continue to hear:\n\n                       CHRIS (O.S.)\n                  (beat)\n           What?

My liquid hijack Marlboros and the\n           moon and the cow that jumped over it.\n\nCAMERA PULLS BACK FROM SPEAKER TO REVEAL:\n\n\nINT. MUDD CLUB - HALLOWEEN NIGHT\n\nJean and Benny are on stage with two other GUYS, members of the\nband Gray. Everyone but Jean is dressed in some sort of Halloween\ncostume.\n\nWe HEAR the words \"Boom, for real\" blasting from the P.A. system.\n\nWhat follows is a continuation, a collage of words from Jean's\n\"suicide hotline\" call -\n\n                      P.A.\n           One philosopher said \"Give me my liquid\n           hijack Marlboros. Life's beautiful. You\n           have someone to live for. What do you want?\n           RKKKK! That's a beautiful name... French?\n\nJean sits in a chair onstage with his band members. Benny plays\nthe organ. The other band members play percussion and guitar.\n\nIt works. The crowd loves it.\n\nThe song ends abruptly.\n\nWe begin to hear James Brown's \"Sex Machine.\"\n\nJean looks out into the crowd and notices Gina. She's looking\nright back at him from the bar. Pleased to see her face, he says\nto himself -\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Boom, for real.\n\nWe see him walk offstage into the crowd. They meet.\n\n                      BASQUIAT (CONT'D)\n           I thought you hated this place?\n\n                         GINA\n           I do.\n                  (beat)\n           I just said that. I was never here before.\n           I actually like it.\n\nMUSIC segues into PIL's \"Public Image\".\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Let's get out of here.\n\nHe leads her towards the exit. They step out of the club.\n\n\nEXT. MUDD CLUB - NIGHT\n\nHIGH, WIDE ANGLE\n\nIt's raining heavily. Jean motions for Gina to wait under the\nentrance. He tries to hail a cab... And another. And another.\n\nA parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a\nglimpse of Jean and drive off.\n\nFinally, Gina steps out of the entrance. She raises her hand, and\na car pulls over instantly.\n\n\nINT. CAB - NIGHT\n\nThey scurry into the backseat.\n\nThe cab pulls off.\n\n\nEXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\nThrough a steamy, rain-wet window, we see Jean and Gina seated at\na table, dining.\n\nThey seem to be having a nice time.\n\n\nINT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING\n\nGina lays in bed. Daylight streams into the apartment.\nJackhammers RATTLE outside. (Music: REGGAE SONG - Errol\nScorcher's \"Cockroach in de Corner.\")\n\n\nEXTREME CLOSEUP\n\nA cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into\nthe kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a\ndrawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box.\n\nJean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean\ntears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and\nbugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach.\n\nHe's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can.\n\nSomeone POUNDS furiously at the door.\n\nIgnoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the\npiece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a\nsymbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.\n\n                      LANDLADY\n           Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!\n\nHe gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle-\naged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it.\n\n                      LANDLADY (CONT'D)\n           Ohhh, Dios mio!\n\nShe stares at him levelly.\n\n                      LANDLADY (CONT'D)\n           I just want the rent.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep!\n\nJean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. He\nhands it to the landlady. It's a a little shack with a big head\nnext to it that says \"'Here' For Rent.\"\n\nThe landlady looks at him like he's crazy. She balls up the\ndrawing and puts it in her pocket.\n\nGina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady's\ntrapped between them.\n\n                       GINA\n                  (to Jean)\n           What're you doing?\n\nThe landlady wags her finger at Gina.\n\n                      LANDLADY\n           Next Monday.\n\nGina and Jean look amused as they watch her leave.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Wanna go get some breakfast?\n\n                      GINA\n           A friend of mine offered me a job doing a\n           little work installing a show in a gallery.\n           He's an electrician. I was supposed to be\n           there an hour ago.\n\nShe looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor.\n\n                      GINA (CONT'D)\n           Ohh, that's nice.\n\nJean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing.\n\nWe HOLD on the drawing.\n\n\nINT. MARY BOONE GALLERY - DAY\n\nWhite dust sprinkles down onto Jean's face from the ceiling.\nUnable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of his\neyes...\n\nHis boss, GREG, a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works above\nhim on the ladder. Jean steadies the ladder. Greg's head is out\nof frame.\n\nThe gallery is an impressive space under preparations for an\nopening.\n\n                      GREG\n           Jean, could you get me a Phillips\n           screwdriver?\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           A what?\n\n                      GREG\n           A Phillips head. From the toolbox.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Yeah.\n\nJean searches through the toolbox. He picks up a screwdriver and\nreads the handle: \"CRAFTSMAN\"\n\n                         BASQUIAT (CONT'D)\n              'Phillips head,' right?\n\n                         GREG\n              Yeah.\n\nJean shakes his head and puts it back. He tries a couple more -\nthey each say \"CRAFTSMAN.\" He puts them back.\n\nFinally, he finds one with a different handle. It says \"G.S.C.\n2000.\"\n\n                         BASQUIAT\n              You don't have any!!!\n\n                         GREG\n              That's impossible. I've got, like, five of\n              'em!\n\nHe comes down off the ladder.\n\n                          GREG (CONT'D)\n              You're holding one in your hand!!!\n                     (beat)\n              You've never done this kind of work before,\n              have you?\n                     (demonstrating)\n              See, this is a regular screwdriver, and\n              this is a Phillips head. The cross thing...\n              I'll tell you later what all the tools are\n              so you'll know.\n\nA GROUP of people arrives.\n\nAlbert Milo    comes into view, tailed closely by Rene Ricard and\nMARY BOONE    - well dressed, petite, intense, 30. Milo, (also about\n30), wears    casual clothes splattered with paint. Mary Boone is\nengaged in    conversation with Milo. Rene chatters away.\n\nGreg climbs back up the ladder. He holds a piece of wire down to\nJean. Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible.\n\n                         RENE\n              I need to make a call, Mary. You don't\n              mind, do you?\n\n                         MARY BOONE\n              Certainly not. You can use my line.\n\nRene picks up the phone.\n\n                          RENE\n              To Paris. Bernard Picasso -\n                     (to Mary)\n              You know Bernard -\n\n                          MARY BOONE\n                     (wincing)\n              Be my guest.\n\nJean watches the group talking.\n\n                       GREG\n           Jean? Hold this, please.\n                  (beat - he sees why Jean's so\n                  distracted)\n           You'll get there. But it's good to have\n           something to fall back on. That's why I\n           became an electrician. It pays the rent.\n           Y'know, I'm an artist, too.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           I didn't know.\n\n                      GREG\n           I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find\n           myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're\n           just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And\n           I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition.\n           It gave me time to develop.\n\nJean watches Mary and Milo talking.\n\n                       MARY BOONE\n                  (to Milo)\n           I can't tell you how happy I am with this\n           show.\n\nMary yells across the room to Jean.\n\n                       MARY BOONE (CONT'D)\n                  (her tone impersonal)\n           Excuse me - you - what's your name? Would\n           you move those tools there and put them\n           somewhere else?\n\nHe looks at her.\n\nMilo watches to see what he's going to do.\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n                  (to Milo)\n           My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you\n           heard of me?\n\n                       ALBERT MILO\n                  (amused)\n           No. Should I have?\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           I'm a painter, too.\n\n                      ALBERT MILO\n           Really. Huh. Too bad.\n\n                      MARY BOONE\n           Excuse me, would you please move those\n           tools?\n\nJean looks at Milo. Milo looks back at him.\n\nJean walks past the tools and continues toward the door. He walks\nout without turning around.\n\nMilo smiles to himself.\n\n\nEXT. BOONE GALLERY - ALBERT MILO OPENING - DUSK\n\nThe ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across the\nstreet, watching through the window.\n\nCabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks the\nstreet.\n\nJean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged -     he feels\nentitled to all this.\n\nHe crosses the street to get a closer look.\n\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW\n\nHe sees Albert Milo    talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO\nBISCHOFBERGER. Andy,    of course, is thin, silver-haired, and\nnearly albino. Bruno    is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's. He exudes\nmoney - a pillar of    security.\n\nOn the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a\ncoterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks\ndrunk, enjoying the moment, holding court.\n\nRene crosses to Albert and Andy.\n\nPeople pass by.\n\nJean starts to walk.\n\nAbout half a block away, he sprays on a wall:\n\n\"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALL\nCRUSHED INTO THESE FEET\"\n\nHe looks pleased. He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the\nbuildings at the sky:\n\n\nSUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY\n\nWe see a surfer emerging from a HUGE WAVE. He looks powerful and\nexalted.\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY\n\nANGLE ON: A wall. We see the following graffity:\n\n\"JIMMY BEST ON HIS BACK TO THE SUCKERPUNCH OF HIS CHILDHOOD\nYEARS\"\n\nA basketball bounces against a wall.\n\nJean and Benny amble onto a basketball court. Jean's changed his\nhairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head.\n\nBenny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a\ncigarette. He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy.\n\nBenny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and\nsplashes Jean.\n\n                      BENNY\n           Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette.\n           Concentrate.\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n           I am... On Gina.\n                  (beat)\n           Fuck - I didn't think we were actually\n           gonna do this.\n\n                      BENNY\n           Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.\n\nJean shoots. It flies up, up, up -     and over the backboard.\n\nHe runs after the ball, gets it, and dribbles clumsily.\n\n                      BENNY\n           You're shattering all my myths.\n\n                         BASQUIAT\n           About what?\n\n                      BENNY\n           Your people.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Oh - you mean black people!\n\nHe shoots and misses again. He throws it to Benny, who does a\npicture-perfect lay-up.\n\n                       BASQUIAT (CONT'D)\n                  (changing the subject)\n           How long do you think it takes to get\n           really famous?\n\nDuring the following, Benny performs a series of amazing shots\nwhile Jean looks on admiringly.\n\n                      BENNY\n           For a musician or a painter?\n\nJean shrugs.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your\n           stuff all day without thinking about\n           anything else.\n\n                      BENNY\n           Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.\n\nHe shoots. Swish.\n\n                      BENNY (CONT'D)\n           First, you have to dress right.\n\nHe shoots again. Swish.\n\n                      BENNY (CONT'D)\n           Then, you have to hang out all the time -\n           with famous people - the right people, the\n           right chicks, the right parties.\n\nHe shoots again. Swish.\n\n                      BENNY (CONT'D)\n           And you gotta do your work all the time\n           when you're not doing that. The same kinda\n           work, the same style - over and over\n           again, so people recognize it and don't get\n           confused. Then, once you're famous, you\n           have to keep doing it the same way, even\n           after it's boring - unless you want people\n           to really get mad at you - which they will\n           anyway.\n\nBenny tosses Jean the ball. Jean walks off the court.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Come on. I hate this. I'm no good at it.\n\nJean shoots the ball and keeps walking. The ball goes in. He\ndoesn't notice. Benny runs after it.\n\n\nEXT. HOUSTON ST. - DUSK\n\nBenny and Jean walk along. Benny dribbles.\n\n                      BENNY\n           Famous people are usually pretty stupid.\n           You're too smart.

Y'know, pounding in spikes and\n           laying down track. Then one day they\n           invented a machine to do it. And he says\n           \"Fuck that, I'm a MAN\" and he challenges\n           the machine to a race to lay down a mile of\n           track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the\n           whole time.

He copies\nthe technical blueprints from the manual.    He reads the Bible,\nfollowing the text with a dirty finger. It    seems that he watches\nTV, draws, listens to the music and reads    at the same time.\n\nHe mixes Liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings. He\ndraws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor. Up the\nwall. Through the fridge. Across the window.\n\nHe takes off his paint-covered clothes and changes into Gina's\nblack slip. He rummages around the room, gathering pieces of his\nand Gina's clothes.\n\nHe spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brushes\nwith long bristles, picks up the cans of Liquitex paint.\n\nWhen paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes.\n\nGina wakes up.

Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties\nthe dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. He hands\nthe rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line.\n\nBenny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as\nthough the dope burned a hole in his sinus.\n\n                        BENNY\n             We got beat.\n\n                         BASQUIAT\n             For real?\n\nJean takes a taste with his finger...

They greet each other as friends.\n\nRockets leads Jean aside. They stand near a wall where a painting\nhangs (\"Flats Fixed\"). It bears Jean's three-point crown.\n\n                        ROCKETS\n             You did that, didn't you?\n\nJean shrugs.\n\n                         BASQUIAT\n             I gave it to Maripol.

How's that?\n\nJean re-pockets his money. He gestures to Rockets as if to say\n\"fine - it's a deal.\"\n\nHe and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the\nwindow, as before. This time, it's good. They lean back into it,\nslumping down into the couch.\n\nNearby, Rene sits on a couch with THREE STREET KIDS - artists\n(who we've seen at Milo's opening). They sit on their knees\nlooking out a window passing binoculars back and forth.\n\nARTIST #1 looks through the window with a pair of BINOCULARS.

The crumbs fall onto the paintings.\nHe walks on them.\n\nEvery so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings. Torn\npages litter the floor beneath the book.\n\nWe hear someone THUMPING down the stairs.\n\nIt's Rene. A PUPPY follows him.\n\nHe dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout\nribs. The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and\nwalking over the paintings, wagging his tail.\n\nHe stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music.\n\nJean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line of\ncoke on a foil plate.\n\nRene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written:\n\n                      RENE\n           3rd night I called    him 'boy'\n           He sed \"don't call    me 'boy'\" \"Well\n           Then don't call me    'Boss'\" That\n           Was the end for us    and I've\n           Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years.\n           In kangaroo court I    want to be\n\n           Able to say I never kept a\n           Slave.

He'll jump up at my Trial\n           Yelling 'He wupped me gud.'\n\nJean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then \"chases the\ndragon,\" sucking the smoke through a straw.\n\nHe offers it to Rene, who refuses. He lights and hands Rene the\njoint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back.\n\nJean starts to work again.\n\nThe PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way,\nrunning across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag. The puppy\ngets a hold of Jean's sleeve. It unravels about ten feet.\n\nWhile Jean's playing, Rene spots a painting with the words\n\"Famous Negro Athletes.\"\n\n                      RENE\n           Oh man! That's one looks famous already.\n\nWithout hearing him, Jean walks towards the painting and with a\nswipe, paints out what Rene is pointing to.\n\n                       RENE (CONT'D)\n           You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to\n           write about you if you keep changing\n           everything?\n\nThe phone RINGS... Jean ignores it.

He writes \"5:11\" on it. He\ncrosses it out and re-writes it, \"Rene 5:11.\" Rene looks pleased.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           That one's for you.\n\n                      RENE\n           Thanks...

He sees her. His\npath is blocked.\n\nHe presses forward, looking for Gina, getting caught in the\ncrowd.\n\nJean strains to keep an eye on Gina and Big Pink..\n\nBenny arrives at Jean's side holding a bottle of Jack Daniels and\na shot glass.\n\n                      BENNY\n           Willie Mays. A Toast.\n\nJean brushes past him.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Not now, ok?\n\nBenny is left standing next to Andy holding the bottle.\n\nJean manages to advance a few more feet through the crowd, then\nruns smack into Rockets, his drug dealer.\n\n                      ROCKETS\n           Jean Michel, my man. Nice party. Should we\n           step into my office?\n\nNearby, Benny sees this meeting and walks off, disgusted,\nthinking this is why Jean gave him the brush off.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           That's alright. I'm cool now.\n\nJean looks off and sees Big Pink fingering the scarf, saying\nsomething to Gina.\n\nGina slaps her in the face.\n\nJean tries to get around the dealer.\n\nGina turns to leave. She catches Jean's eye.\n\nShe walks out.\n\n                      ROCKETS\n           A gift! I was just trying to give you a\n           gift!\n\nThe dealer palms something to Jean.\n\n                         BASQUIAT\n           I gotta go.\n\nJean steps away from Rockets, but is trapped in the crowd.\nRockets looks after him with disappointment.\n\nRene arrives with, Andy, Bruno, and a PHOTOGRAPHER.\n\n                         RENE\n\n                  (edging his way in)\n           This guy wants a picture.\n\nThey shrug and crowd in - Jean, Andy, and Rene. The photographer\ngets them to squeeze closer and closer.\n\n                      PHOTOGRAPHER\n           Of the painters, please.\n\nThere's not enough room. Rene accidentally gets pushed out of\nframe.\n\nRene fumes. Albert Milo arrives with his parents (JACK AND ESTHER\nMILO). They are a nice Jewish couple in their 70's.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           He said 'of the painters!' Hey - Albert!\n           Get in the picture!\n\nAlbert crowds in. The photographer SNAPS a picture and the FLASH\nblinds everyone momentarily.\n\n                      ALBERT MILO\n           Hey, Jean, I'd like you to meet my\n           wife....and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is\n           Jean Michel Basquiat.\n\nJean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette.\nHe offers it to Albert, who takes a hit.\n\n                       ESTHER MILO\n                  (frowning at her son)\n           Don't do that.\n                  (beat)\n           Hello, Jean.\n\n                      JACK MILO\n           Hi, John...

I'd\n           like to buy it for myself.\n\nJean spots the very word on the painting (\"Rene 5:11\") and\nfreezes for a second.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           I wasn't gonna sell this one.\n\nHe looks around the room for Rene, but doesn't see him. Bruno\nremains smiling, waiting for an answer.\n\n                      BRUNO\n           You shouldn't have put it in the show. This\n           is the one I absolutely have to have.

He feels compromised.\n\n                      BASQUIAT (CONT'D)\n           Do you think I could borrow your limousine?\n           I'll get it back to you in an hour.\n\n                      BRUNO\n           It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner\n           at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.\n\n                        ANDY WARHOL\n           Bye, Jean.\n\nJean makes his way through the crowd, as we see images of the\ncrowd and fragments of paintings. As he nears the door, he feels\nhis arm pulled.\n\n                       RENE\n                  (hissing)\n           You fucking little whore! You sold my\n           painting!

The money earned is proof pure and\n           simple of the value of that individual...\n           The Artist.\n\n\nINT. / EXT.

And\n           this is a much different idea than the\n           fancier notion that art is a scam and a\n           rip-off. But you could never explain to\n           someone who uses God's gift to enslave that\n           you have used God's gift to be free.\"\n\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nJean enters a waiting limo. It pulls away from the curb.\n\nRene finishes as the limo threads its way through the night-lit,\ntwinkling city.\n\n\nINT. LIMO - NIGHT\n\nThe DRIVER is the young Rasta we saw earlier outside Ballato's\ndriving Bruno and Andy.\n\nJean slumps in the back seat.\n\nThe driver can't help staring in the rearview mirror.\n\n                      DRIVER\n           I really... admire you.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Me?

He leaves the door open.\n\nThe DRIVER watches as Jean talks to two DRUG DEALERS.\n\nJean jumps back into the limo.\n\nThe driver pulls away. In the rearview mirror, he sees Jean\nseparate a bag from a bundle of ten. He rips it open and snorts\ndirectly from it.\n\nHe lays his head back and takes a deep breath.\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n                  (calm, relieved)\n           What's your name, man?\n\n                      DRIVER\n           They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Nice to meet you, Shenge.

Dinner's already\nserved.\n\nAt the large table, everyone watches as Milo makes a portrait of\nFrancesco in a beautiful leatherbound book.

Mr. Chow watches his book change hands.\n\nJean takes a bowl of moo-shoo pork in front of him and dumps it\nonto the book. Then he uses a piece of pork to draw a head.\n\nSuddenly, there's a shrill, familiar voice.\n\n                       RENE\n           I'd like a glass of your best champagne,\n           please?\n                  (reading)\n           This is an enormously important season in\n           New York, and to make a false step could\n           have severe repercussions for years.

On the opposite wall in back of the bar hangs\nanother huge painting with a lot of heads, mostly black.\n\nLots of PEOPLE mill about a huge room.\n\nA GIRL - another Gina look-alike walks through the crowd. Jean's\neyes follow her momentarily..\n\n                       BASQUIAT\n                  (re: the paintings)\n           What do you think?\n\n                       ALBERT MILO\n\n           I like the one with the dragon's heads a\n           lot. But the black one's filled up with too\n           many heads...\n                  (beat)\n           I'd take some of them out.\n                  (beat)\n           I think you're painting too fast. I\n           wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it\n           breathe a bit.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           It's always how you would do it. This is my\n           version.\n\n                      ALBERT MILO\n           You're right. It's your version. You should\n           come over to the studio sometime.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Why, so you could humiliate me?\n\n                      ALBERT MILO\n           No, I wanted to make a painting of you.\n\n\nEXT. UNION SQUARE PARK - DAY\n\nJean rides his bicycle through the park. He's looking up at the\nbirds flying in the trees.\n\n\nANGLE ON\n\nThe birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we\nhave no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign.\nThe birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees.\n\n\nEXT. THE FACTORY (ENTRANCE) - DAY\n\nJean presses a buzzer. He's admitted. He carries his bike on his\nshoulder.\n\n\nINT. THE FACTORY - DAY\n\nJean enters a broad, high-ceilinged studio. It's neat. Paintings\nlie on the floor.\n\nAndy's back is turned to him. As Jean gets closer, he sees that\nAndy's assistant FRANK is peeing on canvas covered with copper\npigment. We hear the SOUND of the piss.\n\nFrank holds a bottle of beer in his hand.\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           A little more to the right, Frank. OK...\n           Good. Now up... You got a little more?\n\nJean notices a bunch of Andy's wigs on a desk.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           What's with the wigs?\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           I'm going to send them to my friends for\n           Christmas presents.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           You think those are good presents? Who\n           wants an old wig?\n\nJean makes a grimace. He walks up to the painting Frank's peeing\non.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Piss painting?\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           I wanted to make a few more of these.\n           Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It\n           makes a good green.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           How come you're not peeing on them\n           yourself?\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           I don't like beer.\n\nLooking down at the painting -\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just\n           ask. You could finger paint.\n\n\nINT. THE FACTORY - LATER\n\nJean and Andy collaborate on a large canvas. Andy outlines a\nMobil Oil winged horse.\n\nJean paints it out. To the side he paints a penguin with a hat.\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           That was my favorite part!\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           We can do better. It needed more white.\n\nAndy watches as Jean lights a joint and continues working on his\npenguin.\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           Jean, you make me feel worthless. You're so\n           famous.\n\nAndy paints an Amoco logo next to the penguin.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           I don't even have any friends anymore\n           besides you. And everyone says \"Warhol?\n\n           That death-warmed over person on drugs?\n           He's just using you.\"\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously,\n           Jean. That's why you can't stop taking\n           drugs. You always think people don't like\n           you. Everyone likes you.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           People are only interested in you because\n           you're famous, not because they know a\n           fuckin' thing about your work.\n\nJean paints out part of Andy's logo.\n\n                      ANDY    WARHOL\n           Bruno called. In    Europe, people are saying\n           you're gonna die    from drugs. They think\n           they can cash in    on your death.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           When I was poor, everybody doubted I could\n           make it. When I got rich, everyone said,\n           `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now\n           everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I\n           clean up, and then they say `Look. His\n           art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway.\n           I'm healthy now.\n\nJean obliterates Andy's logo.\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m.\n           You call at four in the morning. You never\n           show up anywhere on time - if you show up.\n           You're painting out everything I do!\n\nAndy paints back in part of the horse.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           That's better.\n\nJean adds some letters on top of Andy's logo.\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           I can't even see what's good anymore.\n\nJean Michel obliterates the rest of the logo with some white.\n\nAndy steps back and squints as he examines Jean's work.\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL (CONT'D)\n           Yeah, I see what you mean about the white.\n           It's better.\n\nJean quits painting.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           After the show we should take a nice long\n           vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what\n\n           I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting\n           and start playing music again. I wanna\n           sing.\n\n                      ANDY WARHOL\n           That would be a pity because you're a real\n           painter.\n\nFrank arrives.\n\n                      FRANK\n           Here's the poster for the show.\n\nHe presents them with a yellow poster of Jean and Andy facing\neach other with boxing gloves.\n\n\nINT. FACTORY - NEXT DAY\n\nShenge hands Andy a box.\n\nAndy opens the box.

Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks.\n\n\nINT. GREAT JONES ST. LOFT - NIGHT\n\nAs Shenge opens the door, a CROWD of people spill out. They pour\ninto the loft. The studio is crowded with PEOPLE. (Many of them\nwe recognize from earlier scenes in Mudd Club, Jean's opening,\netc). On the wall there is a portrait of Jean by Andy. The\nbackground is a piss painting.\n\nInside, Jean kneels on the floor in the corner of the loft with a\nbunch of people around him - girls, mostly. Twenty-five copies of\nthe Times Magazine lay stacked on the floor.\n\nCrouching on one knee, Jean signs a copy for a BRUNETTE.\n\nLooking up -\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Name?\n\n                      BRUNETTE\n           Elke.\n\n                      BASQUIAT\n           Number?\n\n                      BRUNETTE\n\n           505-0236.\n\nA BRUNETTE walks up -\n\n                        BASQUIAT\n           Name?\n\n                        BLONDE\n           Monica.\n\n                        BASQUIAT\n           Number?\n\n                        BLONDE\n           477-0258.\n\nAndy's assistant, Frank, arrives with CHRISTINE, 25, a model.\n\n                        BASQUIAT\n           Yo, Frank.\n\n                      FRANK\n           This is really great.

I painted it after\n           Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting.

I read that. The person\n           that wrote that has the compassion of a\n           housefly. That's your enemy, not your\n           audience. Your audience hasn't even been\n           born yet. It's a lie that art is popular.\n           The only thing popular about it is that\n           it's written about in newspapers. I'm\n           surprised when anybody comes to my\n           openings.

You're\n           the only person he cares about. He's your\n           friend. Fuck that article.

An evil warlock kidnapped him,\n           locked him in a cell in a huge tower and\n           took away his voice. There was a window\n           made of bars. The prince would smash his\n           head against the bars hoping that someone\n           would hear the sound and find him. The\n           crown made the most beautiful sound that\n           anyone ever heard. You could hear the\n           ringing for miles. It was so beautiful,\n           that people wanted to grab the air. They\n           never found the prince. He never got out of\n           the room.
