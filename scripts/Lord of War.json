A perfect 39mm.\n\n     - The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of\n     identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's monochrome.\n\n     - The BULLET, picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER, is\n     tossed into a crate.\n\n     - The BULLET, lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where it's\n     inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest.  He\n     seems to stare directly at our BULLET.\n\n<b>                             UKRAINIAN OFFICER\n</b>                      (to his SUBORDINATE carrying a\n                       manifest, in Ukrainian)\n                 Call it \"agricultural machinery\".\n\n     - The BULLET's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an\n     industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of LENIN.\n\n     - The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in\n     the cold grey Odessa harbor.  A container door closes, plunging the\n     bullet into darkness.\n\n     - The door re-opens.  The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks in\n     bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea.\n\n     - The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a\n     glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory\n     Coast.  The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship.\n\n     - BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through a\n     mud-clogged road in lush rainforest.\n\n     - The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone -\n     immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier.\n\n     - The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted\n     into an AK-47 machine gun.\n\n     - The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber.  Suddenly, from outside,\n     the sound of raised voices and gunfire.\n\n     - The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine\n     towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired.\n\n     - Our hero BULLET is next.  Will it see action?\n\n     - Smack.  The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder\n     ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel.\n\n     - Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into\n     bright sunshine.  It is flying down the main street in Freetown.\n\n     - The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of\n     it.  They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild-\n     eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47\n     almost as tall as he is.\n\n     - The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear,\n     striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a\n     building riddled with pock-marks.\n\n     - Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into\n     the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly\n     relieved.\n\n     - The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain\n     where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into\n     darkness - the bullet's final resting place.\n\n<b>     CUT TO BLACK\n</b>\n<b>     EXT.

His THIRD WIFE stands next to him, wiping the\n     sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper.\n\n<b>                             YURI (V.O.)\n</b>                 It was my first meeting with the American-\n                 educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste.

Even though\n                 we'd met before, I was in no hurry to meet\n                 him again.  He'd gotten a reputation for\n                 routinely hacking off the limbs of those who\n                 opposed him.  His seven-year civil war has\n                 been described as \"a relentless campaign of\n                 sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to\n                 those unfamiliar with the details of man's\n                 capacity to visit the abyss.\"  That kind of\n                 sums up Andy for me.\n\n     As the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln\n     Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo\n     blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock.\n\n     The car slides to a stop beside Yuri.  It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE\n     JNR., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an\n     earring and a facial tattoo.  Also in the car, two BODYGUARDS and\n     a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy\n     cheerleader uniforms.\n\n<b>                             ANDRE JNR.\n</b>                 Mr. Yuri, I am Andre Baptiste Junior.

My schedule just freed up.\n\n     A bodyguard takes Yuri's suitcase.  Yuri is barely in the car before\n     it screeches away.\n\n     As the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we hear\n     Yuri's thoughts.\n\n<b>                             YURI (V.O.)\n</b>                 But if I thought I was scared of Andre\n                 Senior, I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.\n                 Like father, like son.  The guava doesn't\n                 fall too far from the tree.  He was a heavy-\n                 drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for\n                 cheerleaders and a lover of fast American\n                 automobiles which he drove recklessly and\n                 with total impunity around the streets of\n                 the capital.  Oh yes, he was also a\n                 cannibal.  They say Andre would eat a\n                 victim's heart while it was still beating to\n                 give him superhuman strength.  I could've\n                 told him he'd get the same effect from a\n                 pastrami sandwich at Carnegie's Deli.\n\n     Andre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a\n     burst of gunfire.  The city, a violent clash of cultures.  Goats and\n     Gucci.\n\n<b>                             YURI (V.O.)\n</b>                 Monrovia itself was like being on another\n                 planet.  Planet Monrovia.  From the\n                 temperature it was obviously a planet close\n                 to the sun.  I rarely saw another white man\n                 even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the\n                 \"Little Kremlin\".  And I never left town\n                 alone.  Outside town, was the edge of hell.\n                 I didn't want to even gaze into it.\n\n     The car pulls up to Monrovia's premier hotel.

ANDRE JNR. watches\n     over his shoulder.\n\n     Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically.\n\n     In front of him, a pensive YURI, taking in his surroundings.  Half a\n     dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch.  Several HOSTESSES tend\n     to a refreshments table.

YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window.\n\n     Curious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side\n     of the road.\n\n<b>                             YURI\n</b>                      (to the pilots, sizing up the\n                       locals)\n                 We're going to be okay.\n\n     The PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing\n     supplies as they go.\n\n                             YURI (cont'd)\n                      (calling out from the window)\n                 Where are you going?\n\n<b>                             PILOT\n</b>                 As far from the evidence as I can.\n\n     The pilots start running down the highway.\n\n<b>                             YURI\n</b>                 Wait, you idiots!  There's not going to be\n                 any evidence!  Stay with the plane!\n\n     The pilots ignore him - run for their lives.\n\n     YURI is left alone.  He turns a lever marked, \"CARGO BAY\".\n\n<b>     EXT.  CARGO BAY.  DAY.\n</b>\n     The rear cargo bay opens.  YURI stands beside his incriminating\n     merchandise.\n\n<b>                             YURI\n</b>                      (to the gathering locals)\n                 Help yourselves.  Be my guest.  No charge.\n\n     One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay.  Yuri hands him\n     an AK-47 and a box of shells.\n\n     More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road,\n     seemingly out of thin air.\n\n     Yuri hands out more guns.\n\n                             YURI (cont'd)\n                      (to other locals)\n                 Take the whole crate.\n\n     Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away.\n\n     The other locals become bolder, then brazen.\n\n     Soon it's a free-far-all.  Men, women and children swarm all over\n     the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted\n     down - also a lot that is.\n\n     Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush.\n\n<b>     EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY.\n</b>\n     YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of\n     grenades.\n\n     He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos.\n\n     Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses.\n\n<b>                             YURI\n</b>                      (muttering under his breath,\n                       shutting off the calculator in\n                       disgust)\n                 What a fucking disaster.\n\n     Yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen.\n\n<b>                             YURI\n</b>                 Hey, not those!

The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away\n     on the back of a thin cow.\n\n     Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane.\n\n     Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay -\n     empty.\n\n     Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals.\n\n     Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush.\n\n     Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a\n     lifevest.\n\n<b>                             VALENTINE\n</b>                 Hey, you!\n\n     The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver.\n\n                             VALENTINE (cont'd)\n                      (exasperated)\n                 Forget it.\n\n     The entire cargo has gone.  An errant bullet falls off a shelf in\n     the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up.\n\n     YURI sits innocently on his soda crate.\n\n     A frustrated African Interpol Agent, MBIZI, wound-up by the chase,\n     rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground.\n\n<b>                             MBIZI\n</b>                 You run from us.\n                      (flashing a machete in Yuri's\n                       face)\n                 Can you run with no legs?\n\n     Valentine rushes over, pulls Mbizi off Yuri.\n\n<b>                             VALENTINE\n</b>                 No, Mbizi.  No, no, no.\n\n     Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot.  Mbizi still wants a\n     piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner.\n\n<b>                             MBIZI\n</b>                 Let me disappear him, Mr.  Valentine.

Valentine\n     handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri back\n     on it.\n\n                             VALENTINE (cont'd)\n                 I've spent my whole career on the right side\n                 of the line.

Keeping track of the nuclear\n                 arsenals.  You would think it more critical\n                 to world security.  It's not.  Nine out of\n                 ten war victims today are killed by assault\n                 rifles and other small arms - like yours.\n                 Those missiles just sit in their silos.\n                 Your AK-47 - it's the real weapon of mass\n                 destruction.\n\n     Yuri regards his interrogator curiously.

I\n                 can assure you, it is not because I enjoy your\n                 company.  And you may be surprised to learn\n                 that it is not for any vindictive motive.  No.\n                 The reason I delay you for every second of the\n                 permissible twenty-four hours, is that I am\n                 delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of\n                 your victims.  I don't think of it as taking a\n                 day from you but giving a day to them.  Some\n                 innocent man, woman or child somewhere has one\n                 more day on this earth because you are not\n                 free.\n\n     Valentine looks to his watch.\n\n                             VALENTINE (cont'd)\n                 See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five\n                 minutes.\n\n     Valentine walks away.  Yuri is left to ponder the notion.\n\n     We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four\n     hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs,\n     eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun\n     arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being\n     cannibalized by the locals.  Finally the time lapse slows back into\n     real time.\n\n     Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents.\n\n<b>                             VALENTINE\n</b>                 You'll be pleased to know your colleagues\n                 were no more co-operative than you.\n\n     Valentine opens the back of the Jeep.  Lying in the back, the bodies\n     of the two PILOTS shot and stripped.\n\n                             VALENTINE (cont'd)\n                 The locals got to them before we could.\n\n     Yuri turns away from the sight.  His handcuffs are removed.\n\n     Returning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of AVA and\n     NICKI in the wallet.\n\n                             VALENTINE (cont'd)\n                 Handsome family.\n\n     Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away.\n\n<b>     EXT.

Not that, Yuri.\n\n     Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the exhibition\n     of her paintings inside the locker.  Shaking the image from her\n     head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents.\n\n     She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos of\n     Yuri, different names: \"George Eagleman\", \"Georges D'Aigle\", etc.  Who\n     is her husband?

A Jeep packed with young, machete-wielding FREEDOM\n     FIGHTERS circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the\n     inhabitants.\n\n     The mostly WOMEN and CHILDREN are trapped by the circling Jeep.\n     Whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by the\n     increasingly manic, shrieking rebels.\n\n     Yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest\n     of the REBELS are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized sneakers,\n     carrying machetes and the occasional AK-47.\n\n     At a small folding table a REBEL LEADER negotiates with YURI and\n     ANDRE JNR.  The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table.\n\n     VITALY is more interested in the camp - observing the circling Jeep\n     full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway.\n\n     From a distance, he spies a WOMAN and YOUNG SON make a desperate bid\n     for escape from the camp.  Two REBELS, on foot, give chase.  The\n     woman appears to be pregnant.\n\n     Vitaly watches in horror.  The Woman is quickly overtaken and hacked\n     to death.  Then the Boy.

Vitaly's legs betray\n     him.  He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust.\n\n     We focus on Vitaly's still FACE - he has taken enough bullets to\n     kill him three times over.  But he is not quite dead.\n\n     Agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls\n     the pin with his teeth.\n\n     CLOSE on Vitaly's HAND, trying to summon the strength to throw the\n     grenade.\n\n     A hand appears, grasps Vitaly's hand - gently but firmly removing\n     the grenade.\n\n<b>     YURI.\n</b>\n     The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri, unsure where his\n     loyalties lie.
