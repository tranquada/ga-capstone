ADELE'S STUDIO - 2006 - DAY21\n\n          The studio is a mess, the floor covered with paint. Adele,\n          in her paint-spattered clothing, works on a tiny canvas, an\n          inch square. She paints with a single-hair brush while\n          looking through a magnifying glass.

His\n          urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder,\n          through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an\n          amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in\n          a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while\n          standing in a field of flames.\n\n          CADEN\n          It's gorgeous, Ad.\n\n          ADELE\n          Thanks.

Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with\n          strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a\n          naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild-\n          eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As\n          he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden\n          sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's\n          show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like\n          the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t-\n          shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The\n          flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them.\n\n          176 EXT.

Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The\n          scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth\n          aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking\n          coughs.

He gets out and follows them, spots a\n          woman ahead walking with a suitcase. He hurries as much as\n          he can with his limp, his weakness, his ancient body, to\n          catch up with her.\n\n          CADEN\n          Hello.\n          The woman turns. She's middle-aged, face radiating kindness.\n\n          CADEN (CONT'D)\n          Where is everybody?\n\n          WOMAN\n          Mostly dead. Some have left.\n\n          CADEN\n          Would you sit with me for a moment?\n          I'm very tired. And lonely.\n          The woman smiles at Caden. They sit on a log.\n\n          CADEN (CONT'D)\n          I feel like I know you.\n\n          WOMAN\n          I was the mother in Ellen's dream.\n          Perhaps from there.\n\n          CADEN\n          Yes! That's it. Yes. You seem a\n          bit older than I remember.\n\n          WOMAN\n\n          (CHUCKLING)\n          That dream was quite a while ago.\n          He's silent. The woman touches his hand.\n\n          CADEN\n          I didn't mean to say you look old.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           SYN, NY - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - JULY 30, 2007 127.\n\n          202CONTINUED:202\n\n           WOMAN\n           I know.\n\n           CADEN\n          Everyone's dreams in all those\n          apartments. All those secrets\n          we'll never know. That's the truth\n          of it -- all the thoughts nobody\n          will ever know.\n\n          WOMAN\n          It's true.\n\n          CADEN\n          I'm sorry the experiment didn't\n          work. I wanted it to with all my\n          heart. I wanted to do that picnic\n          with my daughter. I feel I've\n          disappointed you terribly.\n\n          WOMAN\n          No. No. I am so proud of you.\n          Caden starts to tear up.\n\n          CADEN\n          All I want is someone to see me,\n          someone to look at me with\n          kindness. For me to be the most\n          special person in the world to just\n          one person.\n\n          WOMAN\n          I know, baby. I know.\n          He looks at her tentatively. She's looking into his eyes\n          directly, clearly, kindly. She smiles.\n\n          WOMAN (CONT'D)\n          You're going to be fine.\n          Caden starts to weep so hard he chokes. Strings of snot pour\n          from his nose. The woman holds him, gently takes off his\n          wig, and strokes his sparse hair. He looks out over her\n          shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the\n          warehouse. His rheumy eyes light up.\n\n          CADEN\n          I know what to do with this play\n          now. I have an idea. I think --\n          The screen goes black fast.\n\n\n\n          THE END\n\n\n\n\nSynecdoche, New York\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Charlie Kaufman\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:51.160157"}
