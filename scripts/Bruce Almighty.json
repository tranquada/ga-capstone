Today, in honor of\n          their 30 year anniversary, Momma\n          Kowolski and her sons Gustov and\n          Vol, decided to do something, a\n          little bit different. Tell me\n          guys, how did this idea come about?\n\n                       GUSTOV\n          Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why\n          don't    we make the biggest chocolate\n          chip    cookie in Buffalo?'

It is serious.\n           There's an anchor job open. This\n           is important. This is our future!\nBruce points to the TV as he says \"future,\" not realizing\nhe's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the\nhair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.\n                        GRACE\n           I'm sorry.\nBruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child.

Bruce swerves to avoid the\nman and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited\nItalian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the\nprofessional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG\nTIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the\ndriver's window.\n                    PAUL NEWMAN\n          Hey Mario, did you get that box of\n          dressing I sent you?\nBruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --\n                    BRUCE\n              (in perfect Italian)\n          Si, dovete venire sopra per il\n          pranzo un certo tempo.\n              (SUBTITLES: Yes, you must\n               come over for dinner some\n               time.)\nBruce reacts shocked.

DEBBIE HOUSE - NIGHT\nBruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another\nspecial creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets\nthem down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.\nBetter.\nHe heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He\nlooks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.\nHe climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.\nGRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her\ncry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.\n                    GRACE\n          Please God. Please...\n\n                                                          11 6.\n\n\n\nThrough her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with\ntotal love.\n                       GRACE\n             Please God. I still love him...\nBruce smiles, thankful.\n                       GRACE\n             ...but I don't want to love him\n             anymore. Please God. Help me to\n             forget.\n                  (cries)\n             I don't want to hurt anymore. I\n             want to forget.\nBruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a\nhand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly\nselfless act. He lets Grace go.\nON GRACE\nHer face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.\nAnd it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.\nA sad smile.\nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT\n\nRain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at\nGod. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up\nheavenward, weakly. Humble.\n                       BRUCE\n             You win. I' m done. Please. I\n             don't want to do this anymore.

The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.\nBruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when\nhe turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as\nthough sitting in the most royal throne.\n                     BRUCE\n          Am I...?\n                     GOD\n          You can't expect to kneel down in\n          the middle of a highway and live to\n          talk about it.\n                    BRUCE\n          But why?

If this is\n          what you want. Okay, okay...\nGod holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce.
