Remember, the life you save\n          may be mine, so hurry down. I had\n          a close call and, well, can you\n          imagine what life would have been\n          like without me?\nLaughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.\nBruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         121.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                    BRUCE\n</b>          In honor of this event, the\n          Kowolski brothers have baked a one-\n          of-a-kind, creation.\nThe brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see\nthat it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.\n<b>                    BRUCE\n</b>          Sure, a little creepy and a\n          shameless plug, but we love 'em.\n              (Bruce breaks off a little\n               piece, takes a bite)\n          Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's\n          Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that\n          gets more air time than a high\n          speed chase.\nEveryone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.\nBruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,\nrevealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties\noff his arm, starts to probe for a vein.\n<b>                       \u00b7\n</b><b>                    BRUCE\n</b>          To be honest, I've never been a big\n          fan of shots. . .\nThe volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is\nstarting to sweat.\n<b>                    BRUCE\n</b>              (nervous)\n          Okay, we're good to go...They just\n          stick it into my arm. Breaking\n          through the skin, of course...\nThe volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.\nGasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:\n<b>                      BRUCE\n</b><b>          BLLLAAAA!\n</b>\nBruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.\nThey all laugh.\n\n<b>                    BRUCE\n</b>          Had you going, didn't IIIIII1\n\nHe reacts to the nurse POKING the needle in. Everyone laughs\nmore.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                          122.\n</b>\n\n<b>                      BRUCE\n</b>           No, this is nothing. In fact, this\n           is the second time I've given blood\n           this week.

Bodies clear frame and we see the\nHOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads:\n<b>THEE END\n</b>The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and\nin a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly\ntransforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and\nw. . .\ne\n<b>                                          CUT TO BLACK:\n</b><b>ROLL CREDITS\n</b><b>BRUCE ASKS GOD 20 QUESTIONS\n</b><b>\n</b></ae></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Bruce Almighty</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Steve Koren\" title=\"Scripts by Steve Koren\">Steve Koren</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Mark O'Keefe\" title=\"Scripts by Mark O'Keefe\">Mark O'Keefe</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Steve Oedekerk\" title=\"Scripts by Steve Oedekerk\">Steve Oedekerk</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Bruce Almighty Script.html#comments\" title=\"Bruce Almighty comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:01:29.209160"}
