Whatever it is, it is clearly getting to\n     him. He shakes his head; it's not right. It's just not good\n     enough. Rusty glances at the digital thermometer attached to\n     the cask of molten metal.

I paid for pure. And\n               if my workshop were on top of Mount\n               Everest it would be pure. But I'm\n               at sea level, Felix, and at sea\n               level it should liquefy at 736.95.\n               If it's pure, that is. Which this\n               isn't.\n\n     Rusty makes another turn.

He gets out of his car and slams the door shut.\n     He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window. It\n     rolls down electronically to reveal Benedict.\n\n                         RUSTY (contd)\n               How long you gonna give us?\n\n\n18   INT.

Pulls the face plate off,\n     examines the inside.\n\n                         ISABEL (cont'd)\n               And damaged the circuits.\n\n                         PAM\n               Well, then I don't know how they\n               got in.\n\n                         ISABEL\n               They had to have known the code.\n\n     She moves on to look in the mark's BEDROOM.\n\n                         PAUL\n                   (calls to her)\n               We considered that, but the mark\n               swears that nobody in the world\n               knew the code except him. He\n               programmed the last seven steps of\n               the system himself. He set it and\n               never left the house again. When he\n               dies, we'll probably have to\n               physically cut all the power lines\n               to the house to get it off line.\n\n     Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which\n     was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedroom\n     closet. She answers the detective almost as an afterthought.\n\n                         ISABEL\n               There are other ways to get the\n               code.\n                   (to herself)\n               Closed loop.

He stands\n     at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code.

It's an obviously unnatural position. Then\n     he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one\n     normally would.\n\n                         PAUL (cont'd)\n               --then his body would block the\n               view from across the canal.\n\n                         ISABEL\n               That's why they probably set up\n               over there--\n\n     She points out an adjacent window on another wall.\n\n                         ISABEL (cont'd)\n               --And used the mirror.\n\n     She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall.

Something has caught her\n     attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that\n     is shinier than the paint that surrounds it.\n\n\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                47.\n69   CONTINUED: (3)                                              69\n\n\n     Isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches\n     the shiny area. When she pulls her finger away there is\n     paint on it.\n\n     Isabel cocks her head.\n\n\n70   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    70\n\n     A black-clad thief (LINUS) uses a paint brush to touch up the\n     wall above the alarm keypad.\n\n\n71   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           71\n\n     The lead detective watches Isabel intently.\n\n                          PAUL\n                What is it?\n\n     Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from\n     Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the\n     paint. The plaster there is soft and wet. In fact it isn't\n     plaster at all. It's spackle.\n\n                          PAUL (cont'd)\n                What is that?\n\n     Isabel cooks her head again.\n\n\n72   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    72\n\n     THUNK!

Two thin wires are attached to a\n     tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt.

Livingston then types a six-\n     digit code into a remote keypad. His keypunches are mimicked\n     by the remote device.

Later I asked him\n                about it. He said if I really\n                wanted to say I was the best\n                thief...I'd have to prove I was\n                better than the eleven of you.\n                    (beat)\n                           (MORE)\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               76.\n118   CONTINUED:                                               118\n                           TOULOUR (cont'd)\n                 You know, the Benedict job made\n                 waves, even all the way over here.\n                 16.3 million dollars.

So, in a\n                way, you brought this problem with\n                me on yourselves.

And I'm not going to\n                embarrass myself or this\n                institution by telling her she\n                can't.\n\n                          ISABEL\n                She's an actress, Giovanni, not the\n                Pope.\n\n                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR\n                Do you realize how much free\n                publicity we'll get for this\n                museum, just because she because\n                she decided to come by and look at\n                the egg?

GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY          187\n\n      Yen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker.\n\n      He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn.\n\n      Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and\n      Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up\n      the camera, lights, and flags.\n\n      Each \"crew member\" carries an odd-looking oversized \"light\n      meter\". Upon closer examination we can see that each device\n      has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the\n      museum's closed circuit system. The guys are carefully\n      placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the\n      egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the\n      gallery.\n\n      \"Studio Execs,\" Reuben and Linus go to \"Julia.\"\n\n\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 115.\n187   CONTINUED:                                                  187\n\n\n                          REUBEN\n                I was thinking maybe we could get\n                you and Topher into some \"You\n                Always You Never\" hats and t-shirts\n                for the shoot--\n\n                          TESS\n                That's stupid.\n\n                           REUBEN\n                    (instant reversal)\n                So stupid!\n                    (turns to Linus as if it's\n                     his idea)\n                Idiot.\n                    (gingerly)\n                Maybe we could put some posters in\n                the background--\n\n                          TESS\n                I don't think we want to be so\n                obvious--\n\n                          REUBEN\n                I completely agree!\n                    (to Linus)\n                Stop trying to turn this into some\n                sort of stunt.\n\n\n188   INT.

Danny and Tess just look at him. Something\n      about their demeanor is troubling. Namely, that they look\n      completely untroubled.\n\n                          TOULOUR\n                Oh, no. You stole it on the way to\n                Rome didn't you? I stole a replica.\n\n\n203   EXT.

This time the shot continues over to a door on the\n      side of the building. A YOUNG KID emerges with a backpack\n      over his shoulder.\n\n\n204   EXT.

The\n      other Normal-Looking Guy is a row away, facing him.\n\n      Linus looks at the door of the car.\n\n      SAUL\n\n      Is making his way through the door.

It's\n      gone into a tunnel. We hear Saul's voice CRY OUT.\n\n      In a few seconds, the train exits the tunnel and the lights\n      come back on.\n\n      SAUL\n\n      Has fallen into the lap of the BackPack kid. Linus and the\n      Normal-Looking Guy try to help him up.\n\n      He stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat.\n\n                          LINUS\n                    (in French)\n                He's completely drunk.\n      The BackPack Kid nods his head. Linus goes back to his book.\n      We drop down to see HIS BACKPACK also beneath his feet.\n\n\n207   INT.
