Cut off by a flight steward who passes \n     by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction. \n     Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling.

He checks the \n     countdown time on his watch again.  Nekhorvich looks around him.  \n     The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the \n     passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out.\n\n<b>     INT - COCKPIT\n</b>\n     The flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks.\n\n<b>                                CAPTAIN\n</b>                        (into radio)\n                Pan, pan, pan, Denver Center.

Pull up, pull up.\n\n     The co-pilot stirs.  He blearily rouses himself just in time to \n     see:\n\n     A mountain rushing toward him.  As mountain meets airplane, the \n     frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the \n     fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame, \n     which ignited, lights a fuse..\n\n     The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to:\n\n<b>     EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)\n</b>\n     For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the \n     plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle \n     widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from \n     than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the \n     midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at \n     least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of \n     a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan \n     climbs out of shot.\n\n<b>     WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)\n</b>\n     revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and \n     whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, \n     fluffy clouds overhead.\n\n     Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds \n     he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears \n     relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's \n     holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost \n     expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on \n     the soundtrack.\n\n     Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six \n     inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by \n     five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem \n     terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter.\n\n     It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close \n     just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan.  \n     Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, \n     as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when \n     its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his \n     climb.\n\n<b>     A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY)\n</b>\n     near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now \n     traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet \n     exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain \n     almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a \n     handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a \n     lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of \n     feet to oblivion.\n<b>                                \n</b><b>                                ETHAN\n</b>                Whoaa..\n\n     He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.\n\n<b>     REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT\n</b>\n     with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the \n     summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who \n     favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To \n     lizard:\n\n<b>                                ETHAN\n</b>                You're welcome.\n\n     The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back \n     attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the \n     beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo \n     streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now \n     ominously circling back.\n\n     Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of \n     the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.\n\n     The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.

Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries \n     of flamenco dancers.\n\n<b>                                                        DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)\n</b>\n     Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving \n     guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, \n     exits her car and enters the villa.\n\n<b>     A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT.

Nyah \n     offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to \n     the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one \n     another.

Once upstairs, a security \n     guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her\n     down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to \n     Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the \n     windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.  \n     In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard \n     can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the \n     hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out \n     of shot.\n\n<b>     INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)\n</b>\n     Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.\n\n<b>     INT - BATH (EVE)\n</b>\n     A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored \n     walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler         \n     chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of \n     ice.  Nyah can't resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and \n     downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to \n     its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, \n     revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds \n     it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from \n     green thru yellow and into red.\n\n<b>                                NYAH\n</b>                        (her fondest hopes confirmed)\n                Mmmm.\n\n     She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the \n     tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any \n     cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she \n     pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing \n     something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.  \n     She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.\n\n     There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble \n     casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of \n     relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself \n     looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked \n     compartments.  As she studies them:\n\n<b>                                ETHAN\n</b>                Decisions, decisions.\n\n     Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom \n     mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.\n\n<b>                                NYAH\n</b>                What are you doing here?\n\n<b>                                ETHAN\n</b>                Think you're the only one who can pick a \n                lock?\n\n<b>                                NYAH\n</b>                        (not altogether pleased)\n                I see.

A bloody baritone.\n\n     Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror.  \n     She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the \n     tub, pulling him down on top of her.

In it is the reflection of SENOR \n     AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's \n     changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.  He \n     breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and \n     disappears from the dressing room mirror.\n\n<b>                                NYAH\n</b>                Would you mind if I'm on top?\n\n<b>                                ETHAN\n</b>                Oh, either way works for me.\n\n     With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins \n     working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque \n     wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara \n     brush.

A lot better than the way that\n                bitch is going to die.\n\n     Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of\n     kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing.  Ethan steps\n     back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping\n     kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his\n     hand.\n\n<b>     EXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER - CLIFFTOP\n</b>\n     As they approach in the distance, Billy, Luther and Nyah finally\n     gain sight of Ethan in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n<b>     EXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT\n</b>\n     Ethan turns and walks away from Ambrose toward the cliff edge.\n     The copter lands and Luther runs toward Ethan but pulls up,\n     looking over Ethan's shoulder.  Ambrose has a gun aimed at        \n     Ethan's back.\n\n<b>                                AMBROSE\n</b>                Hunt.  You should have killed me.\n\n     Near Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by\n     dust from the copter.  Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and\n     then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air.  He\n     catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.\n\n<b>     EXT/ INT - HELICOPTER ON CLIFFTOP\n</b>\n     Ethan reaches Nyah at the copter.  Inches apart, they can only\n     stare silently at one another.\n\n<b>     INT - CULTURAL MUSEUM\n</b>\n     Didgeridoo music.  A child admires a painting.  Swanbeck and Ethan\n     face one another.  A long, long pause.  For a moment it appears as\n     if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethan's presence.\n\n<b>                                SWANBECK\n</b>                Sorry, Ethan.

At any rate, it's been\n                most instructive -- what they'll swallow,\n                or what they'll broadcast with a straight\n                face.\n                        (picking up a file)\n                Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has\n                absolutely no elements of the Chimera\n                virus.
