They are moving in and around an odd\n     freeform sculpture.\n\n     POV - SCULPTURE AND CHILDREN\n\n     a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children, \n     almost like mirrors in a fun house.\n\n     NEKHORVICH \n\n     wipes his eyes, a horn honks.

On the other side a guard \n     opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal \n     items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small \n     plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, \n     hi-tech and at odds with the other items.

CABIN - DAY)\n\n     seems intent on the map, its changing times and distance.  He  \n     checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours \n     and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending \n     seconds whipping by.\n\n     ETHAN HUNT sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat \n     beside Nekhorvich.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                You keep staring at that watch as if your\n                life depended on it, Doctor..\n\n                                NEKHORVICH \n                Well, yes.

'You're sorry and I'm\n                sorry..'\n                        (bemused laughter, then looks at Ethan)\n                - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.\n\n     Nekhorvich is overcome.  Ethan puts a comforting hand on his  \n     shoulder:\n\n                                ETHAN\n                He was quite a man.  Did he know before \n                the end you two had succeeded?\n\n                                NEKHORVICH \n                Yes, he knew.  Just..\n\n                                ETHAN\n                ..not in time to save him.\n\n                                NEKHORVICH \n                No.  After you've lived with Chimera for \n                twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not \n                even...Bellerophon.\n\n     Nekhorvich pats the satchel.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                You carry them together?  Safely?\n\n     With an almost impish grin and a wink:\n\n                                NEKHORVICH \n                Yes, and you'll get us to a safe place \n                with them, thank god!..left to my own \n                devices, I'm an old fart too inept to read \n                a railroad timetable!..\n\n     Good-natured laughter.  Cut off by a flight steward who passes \n     by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction. \n     Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling.  Passengers are \n     puzzled and alarmed.\n\n                                CAPTAIN'S VOICE\n                You Captain again.  We've experienced a \n                slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..\n                \n     A passenger struggling with his mask.  As Nekhorvich fumbles with \n     the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows \n     their altitude is below 30,000 feet and dropping.  He checks the \n     countdown time on his watch again.  Nekhorvich looks around him.  \n     The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the \n     passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out.\n\n     INT - COCKPIT\n\n     The flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks.\n\n                                CAPTAIN\n                        (into radio)\n                Pan, pan, pan, Denver Center.

His eyes flutter, then:\n\n                                CO-PILOT\n                Captain, I don't..can't..\n\n     He passes out.  The Captain, HUGH STAMP, turns to verify that the\n     relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls.\n\n     He then removes his oxygen mask, sets the auto pilot, inputting \n     numbers to slow the plane and descend.  As the craft titles \n     downward...\n\n     INT - GALLERY\n\n     The flight attendants are pulling on jump suits.  Stamp emerges\n     from the cockpit.\n\n     INT - CABIN\n\n     Ethan returns.  Nekhorvich beckons to him.  Ethan sits.  Grinning \n     around, Nekhorvich conspiratorially:\n\n                                NEKHORVICH\n                ..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                        (in the same tone)\n                You keep calling me Dmitri.

Stamp pulls \n     back the panel, hops into the compartment below which is four \n     walls of electronic equipment.  Stamp kneels and slides back the \n     floor hatch.  The wind howls, puffs of cloud zip by beneath them.  \n     As they descend into the belly:\n\n                                WALLIS\n                Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus \n                two-zero-thousand.

Pull up, pull up.\n\n     The co-pilot stirs.  He blearily rouses himself just in time to \n     see:\n\n     A mountain rushing toward him.  As mountain meets airplane, the \n     frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the \n     fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame, \n     which ignited, lights a fuse..\n\n     The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to:\n\n     EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)\n\n     For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the \n     plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle \n     widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from \n     than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the \n     midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at \n     least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of \n     a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan \n     climbs out of shot.\n\n     WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)\n\n     revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and \n     whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, \n     fluffy clouds overhead.\n\n     Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds \n     he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears \n     relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's \n     holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost \n     expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on \n     the soundtrack.\n\n     Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six \n     inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by \n     five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem \n     terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter.\n\n     It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close \n     just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan.  \n     Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, \n     as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when \n     its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his \n     climb.\n\n     A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY)\n\n     near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now \n     traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet \n     exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain \n     almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a \n     handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a \n     lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of \n     feet to oblivion.\n                                \n                                ETHAN\n                Whoaa..\n\n     He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.\n\n     REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT\n\n     with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the \n     summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who \n     favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To \n     lizard:\n\n                                ETHAN\n                You're welcome.\n\n     The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back \n     attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the \n     beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo \n     streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now \n     ominously circling back.\n\n     Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of \n     the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.\n\n     The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.  Ethan has \n     opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses.\n\n     ETHAN'S POV SUNGLASSES\n\n     First, a retinal scan.\n\n                                ELECTRONIC VOICE\n                Identity confirmed.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Good morning, Mr. Hunt.\n\n     Swanbeck's face flashes onscreen.

Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a \n     little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his \n     back-pack.  Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries \n     of flamenco dancers.\n\n                                                        DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)\n\n     Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving \n     guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, \n     exits her car and enters the villa.\n\n     A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT.

The dancers perform on a raised platform \n     and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling \n     skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them.\n\n     REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN\n\n     looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the \n     relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the \n     crowed party.  Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder \n     over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah \n     offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to \n     the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one \n     another.  Ethan approaches her.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Do you know me?\n\n                                NYAH\n                No.  Should I?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                No.  You just looked as if you did.\n\n                                NYAH\n                No.  Just as if I'd like to.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -\n\n                                ETHAN\n                There's not enough time in the world for \n                any of it to be bad.\n\n     This stops her.  Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose \n     to nose.  Whispered but breezy:\n\n                                NYAH\n                Look, it's either you or the rent and I \n                don't mind telling you it's not an easy \n                choice.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                What if I pay the rent?\n\n                                NYAH\n                Uh-huh.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Uh-huh?\n\n     Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink \n     then:\n\n                                NYAH\n                Go find the wealthy lady you came with and \n                next time we meet - I'll pay your rent. \n                        (kissing him, sweetly)\n                Now bugger off.\n\n     And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated \n     desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of \n     the dancer's steps to cover her own.  Once upstairs, a security \n     guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her\n     down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to \n     Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the \n     windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.  \n     In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard \n     can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the \n     hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out \n     of shot.\n\n     INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)\n\n     Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.\n\n     INT - BATH (EVE)\n\n     A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored \n     walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler         \n     chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of \n     ice.  Nyah can't resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and \n     downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to \n     its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, \n     revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds \n     it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from \n     green thru yellow and into red.\n\n                                NYAH\n                        (her fondest hopes confirmed)\n                Mmmm.\n\n     She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the \n     tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any \n     cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she \n     pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing \n     something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.  \n     She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.\n\n     There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble \n     casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of \n     relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself \n     looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked \n     compartments.  As she studies them:\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Decisions, decisions.\n\n     Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom \n     mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.\n\n                                NYAH\n                What are you doing here?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Think you're the only one who can pick a \n                lock?\n\n                                NYAH\n                        (not altogether pleased)\n                I see.  You're not just another pretty face..\n\n     Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the \n     bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto.\n\n                                NYAH (cont'd)\n                Oh god.  A bloody baritone.\n\n     Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror.  \n     She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the \n     tub, pulling him down on top of her.  Once again they're nose to \n     nose.\n                                \n                                ETHAN\n                I take it you prefer tenors.\n\n     She glances up at the mirror.  In it is the reflection of SENOR \n     AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's \n     changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.  He \n     breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and \n     disappears from the dressing room mirror.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Would you mind if I'm on top?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Oh, either way works for me.\n\n     With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins \n     working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque \n     wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara \n     brush.  She glances down and is rather disconcerted.  Continues \n     working with the pick and wrench.\n\n                                ETHAN'S VOICE\n                You're never gonna find it there.\n\n                                NYAH\n                        (she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)\n                Damn it!  Find what?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes \n                up for auction Tuesday.\n\n     Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation:\n\n     LOOKING UP\n\n     more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against \n     the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's \n     lower pelvic region as she straddles him.  Not exactly in the mood \n     to move:\n\n     She stiffens - he knows too damn much.\n\n                                NYAH\n                - right..where is it?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Far right. \n\n     She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the\n     bottom right compartment.  She's utterly nonplussed:\n\n                                NYAH\n                Where's the bloody -\n\n                                ETHAN\n                        (plucking it off his chest,\n                        offering it up like a mechanic\n                        under the chassis)\n                - torque wrench.\n\n                                NYAH\n                - this is very disconerting..\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Hey, you put me here.

She withdraws a velvet\n     pouch and opens the pouch.  Out spills the spectacular necklace.\n\n                                NYAH (cont'd)\n                Lovely.\n                        (starting to close the safe)\n                Who are you and what's it going to cost me?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                        (having sat up)\n                I wouldn't do that.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Do what?\n\n     The alarm goes off.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                That.\n\n     The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn\n     Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in.\n\n                                SENOR DE L'ARENA\n                Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you!\n                        (in Spanish to security guards,\n                        annoyed)\n                It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is\n                that the heat sensors were activated.

Absolutely.  Much too long I\n                should yes.\n\n     Nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary,\n     intensified curiosity - about Ethan.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Under the circumstances I think we would\n                recommend re-setting the senors to\n                respond to a lighter load.  How do you\n                feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?\n\n                                NYAH\n                Indeed.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason \n                to disrupt your party any longer.  we have\n                some further concerns about the disposition\n                of your security guards, which you'll\n                receive in our written report by fax in the\n                morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?\n\n     He offers Nyah his arm.  They start out.  Ethan immediately stops.\n\n                                ETHAN (cont'd)\n                Miss Hall. Haven't you forgotten\n                something?\n\n     Nyah looking genuinely puzzled.\n\n                                NYAH\n                The necklace?\n\n     Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering\n     string of diamonds and rubies from her bust.\n\n                                SENOR DE L'ARENA\n                        (a great kidder)\n                What are you trying to do, senorita?  Rob\n                me.\n\n     They all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door.\n\n     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN)\n\n     The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.  Ethan and Nyah\n     emerge from the villa, walking slowly.  Nyah's clearly\n     preoccupied.\n\n                                NYAH\n                I'm missing something here, aside from a\n                500,000 pound necklace.

Ringing her number again:\n\n                                ETHAN\n                        (half to himself)\n                Slow down, slow down.\n\n     She turns up a mound and loses control.  She spins out and heads\n     toward the edge of the cliff.\n\n                                NYAH\n                        (realizing she's in trouble)\n                Uh-oh.\n\n     Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin.\n     Her car stops just at the cliff's edge.\n\n     Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                No!\n\n     Suddenly there's no Nyah.  Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and\n     sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet\n     below, holding the door handle.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Oh..oh..\n\n     Taking a firm grip on her wrist.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Don't look down.  Just..look at me.\n                That's it..that's it..\n\n     He pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into\n     his arms.  For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.  Then:\n        \n                                NYAH\n                What's you name?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Ethan Hunt.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to\n                talk to me about?\n\n     Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.  Her dark eyes\n     suggest wit, and willingness, and longing.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                ...more than I thought..\n                \n     They scarcely to move to bring their lips together:\n\n                                NYAH\n                Awfully short notice..\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Care to wait a decent interval?\n\n                                NYAH\n                Who wants to be decent?..\n\n     DISSOLVE:\n\n     CLOSE - ETHAN (INT-EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE)\n\n     sleeping.  His eyes open slowly.  He comes to full consciousness,\n     his head still on the pillow.  Something approaching serious\n     anxiety informs his features.  He lifts his head and looks at his\n     left, angle widening.  Nyah lies on her side facing him,        \n     sleeping serenely.  Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't-\n     approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed.  He lets his head flop\n     back on the pillow.  Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to-\n     profile.  As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced\n     by curiosity and even wonder.  He lifts his hand and just\n     brushes her cheek.  Her eyes open.  She knows where she is.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                So what've you got against spooks?\n\n     Nyah smiles.\n\n                                NYAH\n                When they've got your recruiting\n                technique?  Not a thing.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.\n\n                                NYAH\n                They've got a book for this?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                They've got a book for everything.\n\n                                NYAH\n                The only other spook I knew was a liar.\n                Charming but absolutely incapable of\n                telling the truth.  He'd lie about his\n                favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an\n                occupational hazard.  All spies really do\n                is conceal the truth and tell lies.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Not revealing information doesn't\n                necessarily make someone a liar.\n\n                                NYAH\n                That's not the point.  In the end what\n                spies rely on is the one thing they think\n                they know that you don't.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Which is?\n\n                                NYAH\n                That they're lying.\n\n     Ethan laughs.\n\n                                NYAH (cont'd)\n                ..once they know that they can\n                get very very..crosee..\n\n     Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                So where did I got right?\n\n                                NYAH\n                You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully\n                good one..\n                        (then)\n                ..this thing these blokes pinched..\n\n                                ETHAN\n                I don't know that they 'pinched' it.\n                Don't even know that they're blokes.\n\n     Nyah stops to think about this.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume\n                I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to\n                catch-a-thief..\n\n                                ETHAN\n                So do I.  Sort of.\n\n     Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Of what?\n\n     Nyah laughs.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Ask a question, you get an answer!..\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Damn, you're beautiful.\n\n                                NYAH\n                That's because I'm on my back.\n\n     Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so she's looking down\n     at him.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                I don't think so.\n\n     She sinks into his arms.\n\n     EXT-INT - STREET - SEVILLE (VALENCIA FESTIVAL) (EVE)\n\n     Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his\n     way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the Crema\n     portion of the Fallas de Valencia.  On this night great papier\n     mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the\n     city and torched in great bonfires.  Outside the bar Ethan's\n     looking for there's a street vendor, hawking Fallas mementos and\n     flowers.  He starts past the vendor, and it hits him - he's going \n     to buy some flowers.\n\n     He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be\n     seen on the petals.  Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar,\n     and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet.\n     Turns back to the vendor.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Are you gonna be here a while?\n\n                                VENDOR\n                Si, senor.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                I'll pick'em up on my way out, okay?\n\n     Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where\n     he passes security at a pair of double doors.\n\n     INT - IMF BRIEFING ROOM\n\n     Swanbeck stands looking out the window.  Noisy crowds from the\n     festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the\n     first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid\n     background thru briefing room's window.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Fetival's a pain in the ass.  Honoring\n                saint by setting'em on fire.\n                        (turning to Ethan)\n                Sit down, sit down.\n\n     Ethan sits.\n\n                                SWANBECK (cont'd)\n                Let's you know what they think of saints,\n                doesn't it?  Damn near set me on fire on\n                my way over here.  As if I haven't been\n                burned enough today.\n\n     A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is\n     going to blow between these two.  Then civilly:\n\n                                SWANBECK (cont'd)\n                Sorry I barged in on your vacation.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Why did you phrase it like that?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Like what?\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'\n\n                                ETHAN\n                You gotta be kidding.\n\n     Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a DVD, and\n     projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is:\n\n     VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH\n\n                                NEKHORVICH\n                        (with exaggerate brio)\n                Well, Dmitri!  How are you?..\n\n     Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply.  Ethan smiles.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                ..I'm fine..and you?\n\n                                NEKHORVICH\n                I'm fine..\n\n     Ethan laughs.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                I'm fine and you're fine..\n\n     With Ethan simultaneously whispering:\n\n                                NEKHORVICH\n                I'm fine too.. I'm fine and you're fine - do\n                you remember, dear fried, how you got\n                Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr.\n                Strangelove and we gave you the name of that \n                silly Soviet Premier because we didn't know\n                your name?..In those days, you not only\n                saved our lives, you saved our sanity.  'Now,\n                then Dmitri - we have this little problem':\n                Every search for a hero must begin with\n                something that every hero requires; a \n                villain.  Therefore, in a search for our\n                hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster\n                Chimera.  I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney\n                and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.\n                However we travel, I must arrive at me\n                destination, within 20 hours of departure.\n                Forgive this fanciful explanation, but for\n                now prudence dictates that I communicate\n                nothing but the gravest urgency.\n                I fear I can entrust this to no one but\n                you, Dmitri.  as we say, 'I'm sorry and\n                you're sorry'..\n\n     Swanbeck stops the DVD.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Let me ask you something.  You have any\n                idea what the hell he's talking about?\n\n     Ethan smiles.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                An idea, yeah.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Like?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a\n                hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a\n                commercial carrier.  So let's get on with\n                it.  He's still in Sydney?\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his\n                colleague, Gradski, but that happened\n                earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight\n                from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..\n\n     Ethan sits back, heavily.\n\n                                SWANBECK (cont'd)\n                - Hunt, are you listening?..\n\n     Slowly looking up:\n\n                                ETHAN\n                If he didn't want to go anywhere without\n                me, how did you get him on the flight?\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                You were there.\n\n     Swanbeck clears his throat.  He turns back to the computer and \n     punches in: MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE.  File open to computer scans\n     of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and\n     comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat,\n     as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy\n     scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image.\n\n     ETHAN\n\n     slowly looks up at Swanbeck.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                When I couldn't find you, I had to replace\n                you.

Isn't it a little late in the day\n                to be asking me that?\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Not necessarily.\n\n     Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Airline record list Captain Harold\n                Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207.  as\n                far as the media and all governmental\n                agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh\n                died on the flight, but in fact he missed\n                it.  He did, however make the next flight -\n                in cargo, stuffed into a rather small \n                suitcase considering his size.\n\n     Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially\n     obscured by a ring of police and customs officers.\n\n                                SWANBECK (cont'd)\n                Someone on that flight planned an\n                operation designed to down the plane and\n                make it look like an accident.  Someone\n                skillful enough to bring the whole thing\n                off without a hitch but - they don't\n                always get your luggage on the plane, even\n                when you fly first class.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                So there's one thing we know Ambrose\n                doesn't.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Then you do think it was Ambrose.\n\n     Ethan barely nods.\n\n                                SWANBECK (cont'd)\n                And you're not surprised.\n\n     Ethan gives Swanbeck a look.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean\n                wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact\n                that he took it.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred\n                innocent passengers?\n\n     Ethan smiles.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless\n                he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                The question is why?  What was this\n                Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?\n\n     Ethan rises and moves to the window.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Right now only Ambrose knows that.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                In any case, you've got to recover Chimera\n                and bring it to us.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                In order to do that, I've got to figure\n                out how he plans to make money with it.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                - right.  In fact since the plane went\n                down our banking sources have confirmed a\n                marked increase in the stock pilling of\n                cash in terrorists accounts.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                'Terrorists?'\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Well you know Nekhorvich's history.\n                You're the one who got him out of the\n                Soviet Union was it still in bio-\n                weapon business.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                If that's what you're thinking Ambrose\n                would have set up a bidding situation with\n                any number of buyers before he got on the\n                plane.  Locating him in time to stop\n                something like that - \n\n                                SWANBECK\n                - is where Miss Hall comes in.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                        (blindsided)\n                Excuse me?\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship\n                which he took very seriously.  She walked\n                away and he's wanting her back ever\n                since.  We believe she's our surest and \n                quickest way of location him.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                        (acidly)\n                And then what?\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Then makes sure she continues to see him.\n                Gets him confide in her and report to\n                you.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                You made it sound as if I was recruiting\n                her for her skills as a thief.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the \n                wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking\n                her to resume a prior relationship, not do \n                anything she hasn't already done.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                She's got no training for this kind of\n                thing.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Go to bed with a man and lie to him?\n                She's a woman.  She's got all the training\n                she needs.\n\n     Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                I don't think I can get her to do it.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                You mean it'll be difficult.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Very.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Well it's not mission difficult, Hunt.\n                It's mission impossible.  Difficult should\n                be a walk in the park for you.  If you can\n                think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose,\n                you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you\n                might want to take a look at these..if you\n                have any further qualms about getting her\n                to do the job.\n\n     He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the\n     one in Nekhorvich's bag at airport security).  Swanbeck sets it on\n     the table.  Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.\n\n     EXT - BAR (NIGHT)\n\n     A grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever\n     more lively crowd.  as he does:\n\n                                STREET VENDOR\n                Senor, senor!

She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the\n     lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto\n     the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of\n     champagne chilling.

Ambrose grabs\n     Ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing Stamp, eyes\n     wide open and thoroughly lifeless.

Luther fires his grenade launcher.  It\n     hits the Falcon's trunk, lifting its back wheel off the ground,\n     but the Falcon keeps coming, its trunk ablaze.  Luther reloads as\n     a gunman leans out the window, firing up at Ethan on the hill.\n\n     BEAR ISLAND HILL - ETHAN\n\n     lays on the cycle's throttle, accelerates down the hill and\n     propels the bike into the air and off the island, just as\n        \n     EXT - IMF HELICOPTER - LUTHER\n\n     again fires his grenade launcher, this time at the front of the\n        \n     BEAR ISLAND BRIDGE - GOLD FALCON\n\n     on the bridge.

At any rate, it's been\n                most instructive -- what they'll swallow,\n                or what they'll broadcast with a straight\n                face.\n                        (picking up a file)\n                Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has\n                absolutely no elements of the Chimera\n                virus.  Not even antibodies.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Yes, I gathered as much.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                And the only other remaining sample was in\n                the canister you recover from Ambrose.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Yes.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                And that appears to have been destroyed.\n                It also contained the anti-virus,\n                Bellerophon.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only\n                really effective against Chimera.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                But you were under specific instructions\n                to bring back a living sample of the\n                Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to\n                know how, after you'd managed its recovery\n                intact, it subsequently got destroyed.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                By fire.  That's the best way, really.\n\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                So you didn't fail mission, you simply\n                changed it.\n\n     Ethan doesn't respond.\n\n                                SWANBECK (cont'd)\n                It's no longer enough for you to execute\n                and implement IMF policy, you now wish to\n                go in the business of creating it?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                No, I don't.  But in this case -\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In\n                face, it was a pretty damn good idea.\n                Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for\n                Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her\n                criminal records will certainly be\n                expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                I do.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Where is she now, by the way?  Do you\n                know?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                I don't.  No exactly.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Well, Hunt, what are your plans?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll\n                let you know where I'm going.\n\n                                SWANBECK\n                Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't \n                be a vacation if you did.\n\n     Ethan and Swanbeck exchange one final, knowing glance.\n\n                                SKY NEWSCASTER\n                This incident in the wake of rumors\n                suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and \n                Biocyte's financial difficulties --\n                including criminal allegations of insider \n                trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to\n                commit fraud, and stock parking -- have,\n                understandably, sent stock prices of the\n                pharmaceutical company plummeting.\n\n     EXT - SYDNEY (DAY)\n\n     Ethan emerges to a very crowded street.  Billy and Luther are\n     waiting.  Both look to Ethan.\n\n                                LUTHER\n                        (worried)\n                So what did he say?\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Good job.  And thanks.\n\n                                BILLY\n                        (incredulous)\n                That's it?  That's it? That's it?\n\n                                LUTHER\n                        (dryly, looking at Billy)\n                And the check's in the mall.\n\n                                BILLY\n                Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy\n                Baird's the name.  Anything you need to\n                get, move or watch, I'm your man.\n\n     And Billy's gone.  Ethan and Luther remain alone, both reluctant\n     to say anything, both reluctant to leave.\n\n     One quick bear hug, then:\n\n                                LUTHER\n                Always nice hearing from you man.  Stay in \n                touch..\n\n     And Luther's off.  Ethan looks after him, a bit wistfully.  Then,\n     curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd.  After a half-\n     dozen steps, something catches his eyes.  He stops.\n\n     One quick bear hug, then:\n\n                                NYAH\n                        (a tad wary)\n                Do you know me?\n\n     NYAH\n\n     is inches from him.  Without batting an eye.\n\n\n                                ETHAN\n                No.  Should I?\n\n                                NYAH\n                No.  You just looked as if you did.\n\n                                ETHAN\n                No...\n\n     She wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable\n     conviction.\n\n                                ETHAN (cont'd)\n                ...just as if I'd like to.\n\n                                NYAH\n                Oh.  Well..\n\n     He kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for\n     hers.\n\n                                NYAH (cont'd)\n                ..I think that can be arranged.\n\n     Looks around at the swirling crowd:\n\n                                ETHAN\n                Let's get lost.\n\n     And in a moment they've vanished from the frame and into the\n     crowd.  Camera begins to pull back, the bustling crowd ever\n     filling the frame - and in the distance, perhaps, just a splash\n     of a bouquet of flowers can be seen, appearing to bounce along on\n     its own, the rising beat of the MI theme:\n\n     BEGIN CREDITS:  IMF II - CHIMERA\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission Impossible II\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Robert Towne\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:31:28.578545"}
