Where's\n               the office?\n\n          Jill points -- Vanity hurries away  --\n\n                            JILL\n               (triumphantly)\n               No one's in!\n\n          Vanity stops dead in her tracks, does a\n          slow burn.  She walks back to Jill--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Okay, so you got  me back,\n               fine. Listen, I'm from out of\n               town. I have to see the\n               manager, it's important.  I'm\n               a real good singer and dancer.\n               I know he could use me.\n\n                            JILL\n               Do you have any experience?\n\n          Vanity simmers, enunciates every word--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Yeah...definitely.\n\n                            JILL\n               Follow me.\n\n          And she turns on her heels, makes her\n          way through the club, moving into the\n          vicinity of the stage.  Vanity follows\n          her reluctantly, casts a look to the\n          band.   She spots Prince for the first\n          time -- stops instantly...\n\n          His effect on her is instantaneous.\n          Passion surges through her like a tidal\n          wave.  His hair, face, eyes -- it all\n          conspires to make her weak.  It's like\n          meeting someone for the first time, but\n          seeing so much of yourself in them, that\n          their lips, eyes, mouth -- you're\n          certain you have touched, and the desire\n          to be with them becomes so strong that\n          the very act of touching will release\n          you in a way you never thought\n          possible...\n\n          Prince brines \"Let's Get Crazy\" to a\n          rousing, blistering end.  Suddenly the\n          stage is plunged into darkness. The\n          CROWD goes WILD!\n\n          ...Vanity snaps out of it.  Jill is\n          tugging at her arm, a puzzled look on\n          her face--\n\n                            JILL\n               Here, fill this out -- I'll\n               have him call you.\n\n                           VANITY\n               I don't have a phone.

Vanity and\n          Jill turn directly into the path of\n          Prince, descending the Steps of the\n          stage.  Vanity gasps, LOCKS eyes with\n          him.  Jill seems to jump out of her skin\n          -- it's obvious she has a crush on him\n          something  awful--\n\n                            JILL\n               Hi ya,  Prince -- God I liked\n               that song, it's real fun.\n\n          She fidgets uncontrollably, Vanity's\n          card buring a hole into her hand.\n          Prince glances at the card, then stares\n          at Vanity,  the ripeness of her look\n          paralyzing.   He tears his eyes away,\n          puts on his sunglesses, looks toward the\n          stage.\n\n           (18A) INT.  CLUB -- NEAR STAGE -- NIGHT\n\n          MORRIS and The Time rip into a funk tune\n          called \"Jungle Love.\" Their stranglehold\n          on the audience is instantaneous.\n          Morris struts across the stage like a\n          panther, playing to the audience with a\n          relish.  His eyes fastened on Prince --\n          his pride umistakable.\n\n          PRINCE watches Morris a moment, then\n          eyes Vanity again.  The heat between\n          them is apparent.  Vanity's heart is\n          pounding, she's not sure what to do.\n          She keeps her eyes on Morris, hoping\n          that a Solution will present itself.\n\n          PRINCE watches as Jill tacks the card to\n          a board behind the bar.  Sizing up the\n          situation quickly, he again glances at\n          Vanity -- but her eyes are fastened on\n          Morris.  Feeling terribly shy and\n          thinking there's nothing he can do to\n          divert her attention away from him, he\n          reluctantly heads for the front door.\n          Vanity finally hits upon something to\n          say, turns--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I really liked your song\n               too...\n\n          But he's gone.  Her eyes scan the room\n          frantically -- catches a glimpse of him\n          leaving.  She takes a sudden step, then\n          stops, paralyzed with indecision.  Jill\n          regards ger coldly.\n\n          MORRIS meanwhile is beside himself.\n          Some gorgeous, dark-haired babe, eyes\n          wide as saucers was starlng at him from\n          the bar.  Prince has left, and this girl\n          is his.  He motions to Jerome,  and they\n          direct their act in her direction.\n\n          JILL gazes at Vanity, fidgets intensely,\n          suspicious and resentful of her.   She\n          glances up and notices Morris, look.\n          She seizes upon an idea,  forces a\n          friendly smile, taps Vanity on the\n          shoulder--\n\n                            JILL\n               Hey ...\n\n          She points to the stage.  Vanity looks\n          at Morris, and he goes crazy,\n          entertaining her with his own special\n          blend of showmanship.  The CROWD loves\n          it!  Vanity is held a moment, but her\n          thouchts are elsewhere. She finally\n          comes to a decision, pulls away, cuts\n          through the club.\n\n           (18B) INT.  FOYER AND STAIRWAY -- NIGHT\n\n          as she runs down the stairs, cuts behind\n          Chick, BURSTS out the door.\n\n                  (19) EXT.  CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          FRANTIC!  The STREETS are thick with\n          TRAFFIC.  She scans them wildly --\n          nothing.  Suddenly Prince, astride his\n          motorcycle, BLAZES past her from the\n          opposite direction.  She starts running,\n          shouts--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Hey  wait!\n\n          But Prince is too far away, the traffic\n          too coneested for him to hear.  He whips\n          down the street, disappears around the\n          corner.\n\n          Vanity continues running, then slows,\n          dejection overcoming her in waves.  She\n          looks around -- KIDS are staring at her,\n          passing  jokes.  Embarrassed, She moves\n          to the front door but Chick is there,\n          his eyes upon her cold, impassionate.\n\n          Exhausted and slighlty tearlul, she cuts\n          across the street, heads back to her\n          apartment.\n\n              (20) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince WHIPS down the street, cuts his\n          motor, coasts up the drive. He comes to\n          a stop against a wooden gate.  His house\n          is a nondescript, one-family structure\n          with a wide front porch.  He lives in a\n          neat and tidy, homogeneous, lower middle-\n          class neighborhood whose occupants are\n          hard-working type fiercely protective of\n          their privacy.\n\n          He climbs the steps to the porch, opens\n          the front door...\n\n          ...his mothers SCREAM is like ice in his\n          veins.  Fear trickles into the hollows\n          of his body like cold water,  His pain\n          commands him to move, but the impulse\n          short circuits somewhere at the waist,\n          leaving his legs twitching\n          uncontrollably.  Then another SCREAM\n          from his mother, and his father's voice\n          now, LOUD and FURIOUS--\n\n                        FATHER (O.S.)\n               Listen to me!

His mother SCREAMS -- Prince\n          BURSTS into the room.\n\n          (21) INT. Prince's LIVING ROOM --  NIGHT\n\n          Prince's MOTHER is at the far side of\n          the living room CRYING uncontrollable.\n          She's in her early 40's, a dark-haired,\n          faded beauty, with large, wild, anxious\n          eyes.  There's a detectable scent of\n          liquor in the air, and her slurred\n          speech pins her as the source.\n\n          His FATHER is in his late 40's, a squat,\n          but solidly built black man, with a\n          cherubic face, and graceful expressive\n          hands.\n\n          He's upon her now, WHACKING! at her\n          horribly, trying to get to her face--\n\n                           FATHER\n               You do what I say, do you hear\n               me?!

She topples to the floor, a\n          lamp CRASHES to the ground.  Prince cuts\n          through the room, lunges desperately in\n          front of him--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               (pleading)\n               Please, Dad...she's heard you.\n               She's had enough!\n\n          His Mother drags herself up along the\n          wall--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               (hysterical)\n               He's  trying to kill me!

Prince's head snaps back, his\n          feet lift from the floor, his body\n          CRASHES in a heap by the door...\n\n          Stunned SILENCE.  Prince, flat on his\n          back, fights vertigo with everything\n          he's got.  His Mother lets out a YELP,\n          rushes into the bedroom, SLAMS the door.\n          His Father stands motionless, sullen--\n\n                           FATHER\n               Get up...you ain't hurt.\n\n          Prince opens his Mouth, BLOOD gushes\n          from a gash in his tongue.  He hoists\n          himself up slowly, using the wall for\n          support.  He moves into the kitchen,\n          disappears down the basement steps.\n\n       (22) BASEMENT -- HALLWAYS AND BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          A naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  It dangles\n          like a pendulum, casting strange\n          shadows.  The basement is partitioned\n          off into a series of rooms,\n          interconnected by a labyrinthine\n          coimbination of passages.  An old washer\n          and dryer stand in the corner.\n\n          Prince descends the steps slowly.  He\n          comes through a door, closes it behind\n          him.  He moves down a narrow passageway,\n          enters a small cramped BEDROOM.\n\n          He closes the door and locks it behind\n          him.  MOONLIGHT filters in throuch the\n          cacement windows.  The total effect is\n          like entering a womb, a deep dark\n          chamber of security and safety.\n\n          Lying heavily onto his bed, he sighs\n          long and deep, his eyes piercing the\n          darkness...\n\n          FADE OUT:\n\n          FADE IN:\n\n               (23) INT.

A cigarette dangles\n          from her lip, a police cap is perched\n          jauntily on her head.  It's a simple bar\n          tune, delivered slightly off-key, but\n          with an openness that is endearing.\n          Chick is working in the corner,\n          chuckling to himself, stacking chairs,\n          sweeping up.\n\n          Suddenly she stops -- listens intently.\n          She jumps up, deliberately spills her\n          orange juice on the piano.

Her hold on\n          him is unmistakable.  She pulls off her\n          blouse in one fluid motion, tugs off her\n          boots, drops her pants to the ground.\n          She's exquisite, takes a step toward\n          him.  Passion rings in his veins ...\n\n          Suddenly she turns on her   heels, moves\n          purposefully toward the water.

She breaks the surface\n          coughing and sputtering, hops and jumps\n          to the shore--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Hold it.\n\n                           VANITY\n               What?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               That ain't Lake Minnetonka.\n\n          He tries to keep a straight face, jumps\n          on his motorcvcle, STARTS it up.

He fishtails to a slick stop.\n          Vanity is by the lake, flailing about,\n          throwing things, trying to get into her\n          boots--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Bastard!\n\n          He laughs heartily, wants to kid her,\n          rides down the road as if he's leaving.\n          Having his fun, he slows, turns to go\n          back ...\n\n          ...his smile dissolves instantly.\n          Vanity is in the middleof the road,\n          flagging down a small PICKUP TRUCK.  She\n          hops in, slams the door.  The truck\n          peels out, bears down upon him.   He\n          gesticulates his arms wildly --  wants\n          to explain--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Hey ...\n\n          But the truck streaks past -- Vanity's\n          look is cold, triumphant.\n\n        (30) INT.

DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince and his band (Mark, Bobby, Matt,\n          Lisa) sit backstage, waiting to go on.\n          An air of tension permeates the room.\n          Lisa sits in the corner and fidgets,\n          casts sidelong looks to Prince.  He sits\n          apart from the group, deathly silent,\n          locked in thouqht.\n\n          Wendy walks in and shares a look with\n          Lisa.  She goes up to Prince, her voice\n          filled with nervousness--\n\n                            WENDY\n               Hi  ya, Prince.  I heard\n               through the grapevine you had\n               a new tune written by two\n               great girls.  By chance did\n               you hear it?\n\n          He stares at her -- if looks could kill\n          Wendy would be dead--\n\n                            LISA\n               I knew it -- he didn't listen\n               to it.  He probably dropped it\n               under his bike and rolled over\n               it.\n\n          Prince grunts, turns away -- Wendy is\n          amazed--\n\n                            WENDY\n               Wow! Okay...you think about\n               this.  I'm going to be real\n               honest with you.  You're\n               really being full of shit.\n\n                            LISA\n               Forget about it, Wendy.  Let's\n               get out of here--\n\n          But Wendy, agitated, silences her with a\n          fierce gesture--\n\n                            WENDY\n               (to Prince)\n               Every time we give you a song,\n               you say you're going to use\n               it, but you never do.  You\n               always think that we're doing\n               something behind your back.\n               You're just being paranoid as\n               usual.\n\n                            LISA\n               Wendy...\n\n                            WENDY\n               (upset)\n               Shut up, Lisa, please!\n               (to Prince)\n               You should know by now that we\n               wouldn't hurt vou.

Prince casts a look to\n          Bobby, Mark, Matt--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               You tired, too?\n\n                            MATT\n               God got Wendy's periods\n               reversed.

Bobby gets up, the\n          others follow him to the door--\n\n                            BOBBY\n               What difference does it make,\n               Prince.

One of them,\n          wearing a tight, red dress, looks\n          especially enticing.  Morris leans in\n          closer -- her tasty breasts strain\n          against the spandex material--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Honey -- don't you ever try\n               and breastfeed no baby now.\n\n                            GIRL\n               Why not?\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Never mind ...\n\n          Jerome appears--\n\n                           JEROME\n               What.\n\n                           MORRIS\n               What?\n\n                           JEROME\n               Right.

DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          as Prince sits by himself in front of\n          the mirror, staring at a cassette on the\n          counter.  We recognize it immediately as\n          the tape Jill gave him earlier,\n          containing Lisa's and Wendy's music.  He\n          picks it up, snaps it into a ghetto\n          blaster.  MUSIC, without lyrics, fills\n          the room.  He adjusts the dials, sits\n          back and listens a moment.  Suddenly the\n          door opens--\n\n                          STAGEHAND\n               Prince, five minutes.\n\n          Be snaps off the music, drops the\n          cassette into his pocket, cuts out the\n          room.\n\n                (37) INT.  BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT\n\n          He comes to the stage-area.  His\n          Band.Members are standing about\n          anxiously, watching the final moments of\n          The Modern Aires' performance.  He cuts\n          behind the curtain, peers at the\n          crowd...\n\n          ...his eyes fall on Vanity -- his face\n          brightens instantly.  Just then Jerome\n          and Morris approach her.  Prince shakes\n          his head knowingly, offers a wry smile,\n          then joins his band.\n\n         (38) INT.  VAN1TY'S TABLE AND CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          She sits demurely.  Morris' eyes are\n          wide and shining -- her beauty up close\n          astonishes him--\n\n                           JEROME\n               Vanity, I'd like you to meet\n               Morris E.

(O.S.)\n               Ladies and Gentlemen -- please\n               welcome Prince!\n\n          The CLUB erupts in CRIES!  Prince hits\n          the stage, launches into \"G-spot,\" a\n          fast, high-spirited funk tune that gets\n          the crowd hopping.  Vanity watches as\n          Prince whips the crowd into a frenzy.\n          Morris listens with a complacent grin on\n          his face, his eyes searching out various\n          members of The Time who are scattered\n          through-out the club.  When he connects\n          with one of them he makes a series of\n          absurd faces which sends them into\n          hysterics.  For Prince is playing music\n          that The Time is noted for, and, as far\n          as Morris is concerned, performs better.\n          Not everyone in the club is dancing, or\n          paying attention, and this does not\n          escape his notice.\n\n          Suddenly \"G-Spot\" comes to a rousing\n          end.  The CROWD cheers wildly.  Prince\n          moves quickly to the piano and launches\n          into \"Electric Intercourse,\" a love\n          ballad which, as it progresses, becomes\n          a personal statement for Vanity and\n          Prince himself.\n\n          She listens intently, her eyes fastened\n          on him.  The words have a profound\n          effect on her -- and the audience.\n          Without being consciously aware of it,\n          they're moving closer to the stage,\n          searching for their personal fix. Prince\n          surrenders himself to the music totally,\n          releasing from himself all that is\n          hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and\n          truthfulness that escapes him in his\n          daily life.  We are entering  realm\n          where life and music are inextricably\n          bound, and the impact on the performer\n          and listener is profound.\n\n          He's directing his music toward her, and\n          she receives it gratefully, almost\n          anxiously.  It fills a void in her, hewn\n          by a life of meaningless promises.  He\n          searches her face with his magnificent\n          eyes, and ends the song with a\n          heartrending cry which connects with the\n          souls of all present.  Everyone is\n          paying attention now.\n\n          The stage is plunged into darkness.  The\n          CROWD goes CRAZY!  Vanity applauds\n          vigorously, wipes the tears from her\n          eyes.  Morris, who was more affected by\n          the performance than he'd care to admit,\n          doesn't like what he sees and searches\n          for a winning line--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               He doesn't like girls.\n\n          She's equal to the challenge--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I know -- he likes women.\n\n          But Morris can barely suppress a smile,\n          and settles himself comfortably into his\n          chair -- for he knows what Vanity has\n          lost...at least this round--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Well ... he don't do too good\n               with them either.\n\n          She flashes him a quizzical look -- he\n          simply smiles.\n\n           (39) INT.  BACKSTAGE HALLIIAY -- NIGHT\n\n          Jubilation time!  Prince and his Band\n          move through the hallway briskly, past\n          the outstretched arms of admiring fans.\n          There's a lot of back-slapping going on\n          as the Musicians bask in the glow of\n          well-wishers.  Prince moves past Billy\n          Sparks, who has an angry look on his\n          face--\n\n                            BILLY\n               What's this intercourse, shit?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Hey; man -- don't worry about\n               it.\n\n                            BILLY\n               I'm warning you...\n\n          But Prince ignores him, cuts into the\n          dressing room--\n\n              (40) INT.  DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          --then stops suddenly, surprised.  He's\n          muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly DOG, held\n          up lovingly by Jill--\n\n                            JILL\n               Surprise!\n\n          OOHS! and AAHS!  by  the entire group.\n          Jill hesitates, then kisses Prince's\n          cheek compulsively.  He's surprised,\n          touched--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Hey -- wait till we're\n               married, now.\n\n          She fidgets, her face blushes red.\n          Wendy is studying the dog--\n\n                             WENDY\n               Oh, my God -- look at this!\n\n          Everyone looks -- Jill grins like the\n          Cheshire Cat--\n\n                            JILL\n               Notice anything?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               What?\n\n                            WENDY\n               It looks like you!\n\n          She thrusts the dog into his arms -- the\n          Band laughs uproariously.  Jill is\n          beaming--\n\n                            JILL\n               His hair ...\n\n          Prince gazes into the mirror -- and sure\n          enough the dog's hair has been groomed\n          to match his.  He can't help smiling--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Shit ...\n\n                            JILL\n               (softly)\n               I wanted to cheer you up.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Thanks.\n\n                            MATT\n               I'm hungry -- where's the\n               food?!\n\n          He grabs the dog, 'a la The Werewolf,\n          starts chomping on it's neck.  The Group\n          busts up, starts fooling around.\n\n          Prince glances into the mirror -- Vanity\n          is there.  He whirls around to the door\n          -- nothing.  A huge smile sweeps his\n          face instead.  The Band continues\n          fooling around, and Prince joins in with\n          a relish.\n\n         (41) EXT.  ALLEYWAY #2, REAR CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          Vanity leans against a brick wall,\n          hiding in the shadows.  Suddenly\n          FOOTSTEPS approach.  Prince appears,\n          gets on his Motorcycle--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Hey...\n\n          He doesn't look up--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               We have to go to your place.\n\n                           VANITY\n               What for?\n\n                            PRINCE\n               I want to show you something.\n\n          She's embarrassed by her apartment--\n\n                           VANITY\n               No...no, we can't.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Why -- is there someone there?\n\n                           VANITY\n               Why do you always think\n               there's somebody else?\n\n          He averts his eyes -- kick STARTS his\n          bike--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Let's go.\n\n                           VANITY\n               (Getting on)\n               Yeah -- but we're not going to\n               my place.\n\n          He remains silent, snaps the bike into\n          gear, blasts down the ally into the\n          street.\n\n           (42) PRINCE'S HOUSE AND STREET -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince and Vanity whip down a\n          residential street.  As he approaches\n          his house he slows, moves past it\n          quietly.\n\n          He makes a deft U-turn, crosses his\n          house again -- seems to be listening\n          intently...\n\n          After a moment, he cuts down a narrow\n          path, turns up a back alley.  He rides\n          to a wooden gate, detaches a hidden\n          lever.  The wood slats rotate like a\n          garage door -- Prince coaxes his bike\n          through.\n\n          BACKYARD\n\n          Vanity's mesmerized.  They ride down a\n          narrow sidewalk, cut through a garden,\n          and emerge from the back of a garage.\n          He leans his bike against it--\n\n                           VANITY\n               That was a grand entrance.\n               Where am I?\n\n          He silences her with a look, moves\n          quickly across the grass, comes to a\n          window.  He stands on a pipe, looks in--\n\n       (43) PRINCE'S POV -- INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          His Mother and Father in the living\n          room.  His Mother is sprawled out on the\n          sofa, obviously drunk, her dress hiked\n          along her thighs.  Her head rests in his\n          Father's lap.\n\n                (44) EXT.  BACKYARD -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince hops from the pipe, leans coolly\n          against the house. Intrigued. Vanity\n          looks in--\n\n       (45) VANITY'S POV -- INT.  LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          The mother and father kissing\n          tentatively, then violently, finally\n          pulling away.  The Mother seems to be\n          taunting the Father, coaxing him into a\n          trap.  He kisses her mouth lustily --\n          she pulls back snarling--.\n\n                (46) EXT.  BACKYARD -- NIGHT\n\n          Vanity's scared -- tries to be cool--\n\n                           VANITY\n               So -- friends of yours?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Yeah -- the freak show.\n\n          He walks off.  She jumps off the pipe,\n          follows.\n\n          SIDE OF HOUSE\n\n          as they emerge around the corner.\n          Prince squats by a basement window,\n          adjusts an old coal chute, then slides\n          down it--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Hey...\n\n                        PRINCE (O.S.)\n               C'mon.\n\n          She hesitates a moment, then slides down\n          too.\n\n         (47) INT.  BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT\n\n          He turns on a LIGHT, disappears into an\n          ADJOINING ROOM.  Vanity looks around\n          amazed.  She stands in a small ANTE-\n          CHAMBER whose walls are covered with\n          thicks pads and foam.\n\n          Colorful MOBILES hang suspended from the\n          ceilings -- various INSTRUMENTS lie\n          about: a drumset, an electric guitar,\n          and a small upright piano.  A stereo and\n          cassette player. are perched on a shelf,\n          and  two speakers are recessed into the\n          walls.  The entire room looks hand-\n          built, the wood carefully painted, or\n          stained.\n\n          She peers through the doorway into the\n          adjoining room.  BLUE MOONLIGHT filters\n          in through the casement windows.\n          Various MURALS are painted on the walls,\n          MOBILES are suspended from the ceiling.\n          A bed sits in the middle of the floor, a\n          vanity table and mirror nearby.\n\n          She stands idly a mement, then moves\n          around the antechamber.  Various\n          KNICKNACKS catch her attention. Small\n          wind-up TOYS lie about:  a soldier, a\n          bear banging on a drum, a tractor and\n          car.  A small MUSIC BOX sits on a shelf.\n          She turns the handle, a little TUNE\n          fills the room...\n\n          A cassette sits in the player.  She\n          snaps it shut, hits the play button.  A\n          DRUM BEAT fills the room, followed by a\n          WOMAN'S VOICE, seemingly speaking in a\n          foreign tongue.  The combination is\n          hypnotic and sensual -- she finds\n          herself drawn in ...\n\n          Suddenly Prince grabs her by the waist,\n          lets out a SHRIEK.  She draws a out\n          breath, jumps--\n\n                           VANITY\n               If you think you scared me,\n               you didn't.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Oh, yeah ...\n\n          He puts his index finger directly in\n          front of her nose, moves it back and\n          forth hypnotically.  She follows it\n          earnestly with her eyes.  Suddenly, he\n          pulls his hand away, stretches it to the\n          ceiling like an escaping bird.  They\n          both smile, lock eyes.  Passion rings in\n          their veins...\n\n          The Woman's VOICE begins to moan deeply,\n          pleasurably--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Who's the lucky girl?  Sounds\n               like she was having a good\n               time.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               She's crying -- it's\n               backwards.  It makes me sad\n               when I hear it.  It sorta\n               sounds like she's laughing,\n               doesn't it?\n\n                           VANITY\n               So what did you do to her? Do\n               you always treat your women\n               like that?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I don't have anybody right\n               now.\n\n          Heat floods into her womb like soft fire-\n          -\n\n                           VANITY\n               You look pretty...\n\n          She touches his chest delicately, fluffs\n          up his hair--\n\n                           VANITY\n               King Kong?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Stop.\n\n          She hesitates -- but he reaches out\n          tentatively, touches her breast--\n\n                           VANITY\n               No.\n\n          But their mutual desire is too strong.\n          Their lips seek one another out timidly,\n          almost deferentially...then fervently.\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n            (48) INT.  BEDROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT\n\n          Vanity sits at the foot of the bed,\n          Prince stands before her.  Her dress is\n          hiked along her thighs, her stockings\n          attached to garters.  Their hands search\n          delicately across the contours of their\n          bodies, drawing quick breaths from their\n          lips.  They kiss one another ardently,\n          then quickly, like sparrows pecking\n          seed.  She goes to remove her dress, but\n          Prince stays her with a gesture, moving\n          his hands along her thighs, touching\n          delicately that spot between her legs.\n          A low, whispery moan escapes from her\n          lips.\n\n          Vanity lies back, drawing Prince toward\n          her.  His lips move across her mouth,\n          her neck, her breasts.  She moans\n          softly, pulls her dress above her\n          thighs, goes to remove it.  Once again\n          he stops her, slowly turns her onto her\n          stomach.\n\n          She stands.on her knees, her head\n          resting on a pillow.  His hands move up\n          along the back of her thighs, past the\n          garters to her panties.  He tugs at them\n          gently, then rubs his hand firmly\n          between her legs.  She moans suddenly,\n          the shudder moving through her like a\n          whirlwind ...\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n            (49) INT.  BEDROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT\n\n          MOONLIGHT glows throuch the casement\n          windows.  MOBILES stir gently in the\n          night breeze.\n\n          Prince and Vanity are asleep.  He rests\n          on his side, his hands gently surporting\n          his face.  She lies behind him, one leg\n          dangling off the bed, one shoe discarded\n          on the floor\n\n          Suddenly a distant MOAN...QUICK\n          FOOTSTEPS -- A DOOR SLAMS.  Vanity SNAPS\n          awake! Fear sweeps her like a shadow\n          from a passing cloud.  She listens\n          intently, then--\n\n          -- Another DOOR SLAM, QUICK FOOTSTEPS,\n          and Prince's Mother\n           CRYING in the dark--\n\n                           MOTHER\n                           (o.s.)\n               (upstairs)\n               Please!\n\n          A bottle CRASHES to the floor.  Then\n          silence...\n\n          ...deep silence like snow in the room...\n\n          Vanity's racked with fear.  She sits up\n          slowly, her eyes searching out Prince --\n          he's sleeping...\n\n           Suddenly more FOOTSTEPS, a DOOR SLAMS and the\nFather's CRY--\n\n                           FATHER\n                           (o.s.)\n               No!!\n\n          WHACK!  Something heavy CRASHES to the\n          floor...\n\n          Vanity rises from the bed in a panic!\n          She smoothes down her dress, searches\n          for her other shoe.  She shoots another\n          look to Prince, but he sleeps\n          peacefully.  Casting a glance upstairs,\n          she climbs throuch the casement window,\n          disappears into the night.\n\n          PRINCE is resting on his side, his eyes\n          opened.\n\n        (50)  EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE AND STREET -- NIGHT\n\n          Vanity moves quickly along the side of\n          the house, trying desperately to find\n          her wav.  Suddenly a HAND reaches out of\n          the darkness, GRABS her by the throat.\n          She SCREAMS, swings her bag desperately\n          -- something CRASHES, into the bushes--\n\n                            VOICE\n               Damn, baby, hold it!

The landscape becomes lush,\n          the trees a riot of autumn splendor.\n\n               (58) EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAWN\n\n          ANOTHER ANGLE\n          as Prince and Vanity whip up to the top\n          of a small hill, skid to a stop.  He\n          scans the area quickly, gets his\n          bearings.  He pops the clutch, skids off\n          to the valley below.\n\n             (59) EXT. WOODS AND STREAM -- DAWN\n\n          PRINCE AND VANITY ride cautiously\n          through a series of hiking paths, then\n          twist down a small embankment.  A STREAM\n          flows before them.  They climb off the\n          bike, look around quietly--\n\n                           VANITY\n               God, this is beautiful.  It\n               reminds me of where I grew up.\n               My father used to ...\n\n          He waits for an answer, it's not\n          forthcoming--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Your father used to what...?\n\n                           VANITY\n               Nothing...it's just...\n               (changes subject)\n               You must like places like\n               this.\n\n          He goes to the stream, balances on\n          several rocks, moves to the other side.\n          The stream flows between them--\n\n                           VANITY\n               So, have you reconsidered my\n               proposal?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               What...?\n\n                           VANITY\n               What we talked about last\n               time.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               You can't be serious.\n\n          She starts a little dance step, climaxes\n          it with spins and twirls--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Oh, come on -- you know you\n               really want to.

You don't want to\n               help me, not that you have to.\n               You don't want to sleep with\n               me, not that you have to do\n               that either.  So why am I\n               here?\n\n          He smiles, walks off--\n\n                           VANITY\n               There's a lot of things you\n               don't know about me.  You'd be\n               surprised how many things I\n               could do.\n\n          He disappears around some trees--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Take me home immediately!  I\n               want to go home.  I can't\n               stand this!  I can't take this\n               anymore!

I never\n               wanted to make it with you\n               anyway.\n\n          The Hikers pass him startled--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Good morning.\n\n                           VANITY\n               PRINCE, I HATE YOU!\n\n                           HIKERS\n               Good morning, sir.\n\nAnd they walk down the path, disappear around the bend.\nJust then--\n\n          VANITY is standing by his side, a\n          wildflower in her hands--\n\n                           VANITY\n               (softly)\n               I'm sorry.

GLADE AND BARN -- DAWN\n\n          as they ride down a leaf-strewn path and\n          pull to a stop near an old, weathered,\n          dilapidated BARN.  It stands laarge and\n          silent like a painting.  A low THUNDER\n          rolls across the land...\n\n                   (61) INT. BARN -- DAWN\n\n          DAWN LIGHT burns through the wooden\n          slats.. STEAM rises from the wet hay\n          scattered throughout.  The air is thick\n          and damp.  It begins to RAIN.\n\n          Vanity stands in the middle of the barn,\n          gazing at the storm.  Beads of\n          perspiration glisten on her forehead.\n          She turns slowly, watches as Prince\n          retrieves old blankets from a nearby\n          stall.  Their eyes search one another\n          out, their breathing becomes short,\n          expectant.  She hesitates a moment, then\n          pulls off her blouse, discards it to the\n          moist, dusty floor.\n\n                   (62)  INT. BARN -- DAY\n\n          ANOTHER ANGLE\n          RAIN patters srtongly against the barn.\n          A deep THUNDER rolls.  She's on top of\n          him, moving deliciously, her body\n          glowing in the purple, dawn light.\n          Moist, purple water shadows streak and\n          course her skin as she moves slowly,\n          then deliberately against him.  He\n          watches her avidly,  his hands firmly on\n          her thighs, and thrusts into her again\n          and again...and again.\n\n                   (62A)  EXT.

She hugs him fiercely, steps\n          off the bike, her face alive and fresh\n          as a flower.

She watches him a\n          moment, her eyes glowing.  She heads to\n          her motel, then stops short -- a single\n          CARNATION lies oon the sidewalk.  She\n          looks around quickly, almost expecting\n          someone to claim it.  But no one's\n          around, so she picks it up, goes inside.\n\n       (64) INT. STAIRWELL, VANITY'S MOTEL -- MORNING\n\n          She enters the LOBBY, closes the door\n          behind her.  She turns -- another\n          CARNATION is on the stairwell.  She's\n          intrigued, glances up the stairs --\n          there's another one, and yet another\n          further up.  She's confused, but grabs\n          them, disappears up the stairs.\n\n          HALLWAY\n          as she comes to a halt outside her room,\n          picking up carnations along the way.\n          She opens her door, cuts inside.\n\n             (65) INT. VANIITY'S ROOM -- MORNING\n\n          She goes into the bathroom, fills the\n          sink with water, arranges the flowers\n          within.  She smiles radiantly -- they\n          look beautiful.  Suddenly something\n          seizes her thoughts.  She opens her\n          bureau drawer quickly, pulls out the\n          yellow pages, leafs through it\n          hurriedly, We READ: Parking, Passport,\n          Paving...then Pawnbrokers.  She stops,\n          runs her finger down the page, then\n          hunts quickly through her drawer.  Her\n          eyes dance mischievously when she pulls\n          out her gold chain.  She places it on\n          her bureau, hurries to her clothes rack.\n          Suddenly, a quick KNOCK at the door--\n\n                          MAN(O.S.)\n               Miss V.?\n\n          She looks around the corner -- a flower\n          delivery MAN stands in the hallway,\n          holding a bouquet of roses--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Yes...?\n\n                             MAN\n               Delivery.\n\n                           VANITY\n               (surprised)\n               Come in ...\n\n          He cuts inside, and is followed by\n          another MAN, holding a bouquet of\n          daisies--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Hey -- wait a minute.

You're really crazy.\n\n          She disappears from the window.  They\n          stand expectantly a long time.  Finally\n          Jerome looks at Morris--\n\n                           JEROME\n               Well...what do you think?\n\n          Morris is staring intently at the window\n          -- he purses his lips sensualy--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Chili sauce.\n\n          Just then Vanity steps outside, looks\n          stunning in her tight, black pants and\n          boots.

The DRUM\n          RIFF is provided by the Linn Machine (a\n          synthesized drum unit).  Wendy plays\n          guitar, her back to Prince.

PRINCE'S ANTECHAMBER AND BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          CU--Clock.  We See: 8:15.\n\n          Prince sits, on his bed, staring at the\n          clock, seemingly lost in thoucht.  He\n          gets up, rummages through his coat\n          pockets, pulls out Lisa's and Wendy's\n          tape.  He snaps it into the player,\n          settles back.\n\n          MUSIC fills the room.  He listens\n          intently a moment, his face placid.  He\n          closes his eyes, tries to relax ...\n\n          Suddenly a DOOR SLAMS in the far reaches\n          of the house.  Harsh FOOTSTEPS echo\n          through the upstairs hallway.  Prince\n          remains still, his eyes closed...\n\n          Then another deathly DOOR SLAM!  GLASS\n          dissolves in its frame and trickles to\n          the floor like icicles.  Resentment\n          surges in him like a tornado.  He rises\n          purposefully, turns the MUSIC up...\n\n          ...And then his door SMASHES open and\n          his Mother LUNGES into the room in a\n          PANIC.  She flings herself onto his bed\n          as his Father streaks in and WHACKS!\n          WHACKS!  WHACKS!  at her with a strap,\n          SCREAMING at her with an ominous growl\n          of rage--\n\n                           FATHER\n               You ain't got no business\n               leaving here!

She topples in a heap to the bed.\n          He's over her now, breathing fire,\n          flailing about savagely--\n\n                           FATHER\n               Shut up! Shut up!

His Father SMASHES\n          backwards against the wall, slides to\n          his buttocks on the floor.  He sits\n          there dully, exhausted...spent.\n\n          Prince crawls up along the side of the\n          bed.  His Mother buries her head in the\n          pillow, choking back sobs--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               I'm just trapped here...\n\n          His Father's eyes well with tears.  He\n          leans close to her, speaks softly--\n\n                           FATHER\n               You always got a roof\n               overhead...\n\n                           MOTHER\n               You don't let me have any\n               fun...\n\n          His Father sighs wearily, pulls himself\n          to his feet.  He moves to the door--\n\n                           FATHER\n               I could make you happy.  Just\n               believe in me...\n\n                           MOTHER\n               You never...\n\n                           FATHER\n               I would die for you.\n\n          He leaves the room, closes the door\n          behind him.\n\n          PRINCE stares at  the door a moment,\n          tears welling in his eyes.  His Mother\n          is motionless, whimpering softly.  A\n          scent of liquor permeates the air.\n\n          He moves toward her, reaches out\n          tentatively...\n\n          Suddenly she jumps up, starts pacing\n          franticaily--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               It's nice here.

Don't you think I\n               have a good figure?  Your\n               Father did.\n\n          She sits in front of the mirror, studies\n          her face, her eyes...her breasts--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               I was beautiful when your Dad\n               met me.

The minute he saw me\n               singing, I knew just what he\n               wanted.\n\n          She fixes him with a conspiratorial\n          look, whispers--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               He wanted to get into my\n               panties.\n\n          She makes funny, \"jazzy\" eyes at him,\n          then stops suddenly, staring.  His face,\n          mouth, eyes...a sudden stirring in her\n          loins.  Her lips part, she moistens them\n          unconsciously...\n\n          She turns from the mirror and stares at\n          him -- his look connects with her groin.\n          She rises suddenly, walks slowly toward\n          the bed, sits facing him--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               You look so pretty.  Just like\n               me, honey.  You coulda been a\n               girl.\n\n          She outlines the mole on his cheek with\n          a makeup pencil, then draws one on\n          herself.  She takes her earring off, and\n          puts it on his ear.  They are face to\n          face -- identical--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               So pretty...\n\n          She looks at him drunkenly.  He tries to\n          hold it in, but can't.  A tear, hot and\n          hard as a bullet flows down his cheek.\n          She puts her index finger in front of\n          his face, moves it back and forth\n          hypnotically.   Suddenly she pulls her\n          hand away, stretches it to the ceiling\n          like an escaping bird.  He swallows,\n          tries to smile -- she leans close --\n\n                           MOTHER\n               (secretly)\n               I have to go now, see some\n               friends.  Don't tell your\n               father, okay?\n\n          She gets up, leaves the room--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               Bye, skipper...bye.\n\n          (71) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT (LATER)\n\n          Vanity climbs over a fence, moves\n          through some bushes, emerges along side\n          Prince's house.  She has an excited,\n          ravenous look on her face.  She hurries\n          to the casement window, climbs into the\n          basement.\n\n            (72) INT. PRINCE'S BEDROObt -- NIGHT\n\n          She drops down into the basement, turns\n          excitedly, leaps into Prince's arms--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I missed you!  Missed you!\n               Missed you!\n\n          She hugs him tight, showers him with\n          kisses, topples them both to the bed.\n          Laughing, hugging, kissing -- fast and\n          furious.  Suddenly she jumps up like a\n          panther, fluffs her hair wildly in the\n          mirror, fixes him with a wanton look.\n          His eyes devour her--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Come here.  Where were you?\n\n          She moistens her lips, walks\n          lasciviously toward the bed, sits facing\n          him.  She laughs suddenly, pushes him\n          back...and they're at each other again -\n          - faces two inches apart;  touching,\n          whispering, kissing, hands searching --\n          shutting out the rocm, shutting out the\n          world...\n\n          She jumps up suddenly.  She can't be\n          contained!  She practically levitates--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I have a big surprise for you.\n\n          She rushes to the coal chute, climbs\n          halfway through.  Prince, puzzled,\n          cracks up watching her ass and legs\n          dangling.  She drops back into the room,\n          holding a large PACKAGE.  His eyes\n          widen.  She struts to the bed, lays it\n          down majestically before him--\n\n                           VANITY\n               (sings)\n               Da...da..!\n\n                            PRINCE\n               What is it?\n\n                           VANITY\n               Open it.\n\n          He starts peeling the tape off, careful\n          not to rip the paper.  Vanity's bursting\n          with excitement though, and demolishes\n          it in a flash!  He laughs, opens the lid\n          -- stares in shock--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Oh, no...\n               (happy)\n               Oh, no!\n\n           He pulls out a gleaming new GUITAR, and\n          we immediately recognize it as the one\n          they saw in the window. He's deliriously\n          happy, and speechless--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               How'd you do it?\n\n          She shouts with delight, attacks him\n          again, pushing the guitar aside.  Fast,\n          furious kisses and he responds in kind.\n          They're twisted in a heap on the bed.\n          After a moment they come up for air,\n          stare at each other playfully. Something\n          flashes across his mind--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Here...\n\n          Her eyes widen.  He takes off his\n          Mother's earring, fastens it to her ear.\n          Eyes dancing, she jumps up, studies it\n          closely, in the mirror--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I love it!\n\n          She twists around, kneels beside him,\n          showers him with bites and kisses.\n          Suddenly she stops--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I'm going to join Morris'\n               group.\n\n          His face  drops, shocked--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               What?\n\n          She backs away from  him, stands,\n          strikes a defensive stance--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I'm going to join Morris'\n               group.\n\n          He LUNGES savagely before he knows it!\n          His hand lashes out, SMASHES her in the\n          face.  She falls back, CRASHES into the\n          mirror.  She slips dully to the floor,\n          tries desperately to brace herself on a\n          chair--\n\n          He's horrified--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I'm sorry!

CLUB -- MORNING\n\n          Matt, Bobby and Mark are JAMMING\n          onstage.  Prince emerges from behind the\n          curtains.  He looks drawn.and haggard,\n          his face unshaven.  The Guys spot him,\n          and the MUSIC trickles to a stop.\n          Tension fills the room in an instant.\n          Mark glances at his watch, fixes Prince\n          with a disgusted look.\n\n          Prince climbs the steps to the stage,\n          cuts across it--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Where's Lisa and Wendy?\n\n                            BOBBY\n               They haven't shown up yet.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               They call?\n\n          The Guys shrug, look away.  Prince\n          simmers a moment, straps on his guitar -\n          - immediately gets ear-splitting\n          FEEDBACK.  He stomps on the floor pedals\n          angrily.  Just then Chick comes up to\n          the stage--\n\n                            CHICK\n               Prince.

REHEARSAL HALL -- DAY\n\n          The PLACE is JUMPING!  Once again The\n          Time is deep in the guts of \"Sex\n          Shooter,\" but now there's a difference.\n          The MUSIC is fiercer and crisper -- the\n          BEAT tailored, more defined.\n\n          Morris and Jerome stand off to the side\n          sporting huge grins.  They're avidly\n          watching...\n\n          ...Vanity, Susan, and Brenda dancing up\n          a fierce storm.  Vanity fronts the two\n          Girls and moves panther-like in front of\n          the mirrors...\n\n          She's a dynamo, her face drawn tightly,\n          her movements crisp and precise.  She\n          urges the Girls on, suggests and\n          cajoles, strengthening their resolve.\n          Sweat lathers their bodies and forms\n          rings on their Danskins.  The act is\n          still very rough, but the potential for\n          success can be felt.\n\n          PRINCE suddenly enters the hall.  Morris\n          spots him immediately and halts the\n          MUSIC.  The Girls dance on a moment,\n          then stop perplexed.  Vanity catches\n          Prince's look, shakes her head in\n          disbelief--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I want to talk to you.\n\n          She's out of breath, waves him off--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Not now,  I'm busy.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Now.\n\n          A TITTER goes through the Band Members -\n          - Vanity wipes her face, fixes him with\n          a glare--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I said I'm busy -- we'll talk\n               later.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Uh, uh...\n\n          He grabs her suddenly, pulls her to the\n          door--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Leave me alone!

Everybody is\nfrozen now -- scared.  The Girls are crying, the incedent\nhas already gone too far...\n\n          Jellybean settles his weight on Prince,\n          twists his head down painfully, trying\n          to break the resistance he alone can\n          feel.  Prince remains silent, the anger\n          coursing through his body in tremors--\n\n          The Guys surround them, grabbing\n          Prince's arms, legs, and feet.  He's\n          like a trapped animal now--\n\n                          JELLYBEAN\n               Lift him.\n\n                           VANITY\n               (crying)\n               Don't hurt him ...\n\n          They pick him up, move him toward the\n          door.  He resists them slightly, his\n          body lurching in fit and starts.\n          Suddenly he breaks free, faces them with\n          his back to he door.  But the Band\n          Members surround him, their wills\n          united, the obviousness of the situation\n          apparent to all.\n\n          He searches for Vanity's eyes, but she\n          can't face him and walks away.  Anger\n          again surges in his veins.  He cuts out\n          the door, SLAMS it behind him.\n\n         (77) EXT. ACCESS ROAD, TRAIN TRACKS -- DUSK\n\n          Prince WHIPS down a dirt access road\n          locked in thought, the pain and anger in\n          his eyes apparent.  Suddenly a TRAIN\n          WHISTLE BLASTS just behind him, sending\n          a shot of fear through his guts.\n\n          He twists backwards in amazement.  A\n          FREIGHT TRAIN ROARS around the bend\n          BLASTING its HORN violently.  Prince\n          shudders with fright, loses control of\n          his cycle for an instant.  He hits a\n          series of ruts that almost topple him to\n          the ground.\n\n          He looks back at the train confused,\n          when another BLAST seems to SOCK him in\n          the teeth.  He twists wildly to the side\n          of the road, kicking up dirt and debris,\n          lurching him into the handlebars\n          violently.\n\n          The TRAIN ROARS abreast of him!  Prince\n          snaps an angry look at the engineer.\n          The Guy coolly gives him the finger and\n          BLASTS the HORN violently.\n\n          Prince becomes enraged!  He snaps a look\n          to the speedometer: 65 mph.  He snaps a\n          look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends\n          him another obscene gesture and BLASTS\n          his HORN.\n\n          Prince grits his teeth, twists the\n          throttle full.  He lurches forward in an\n          instant, blazing in front of the train,\n          The Engineer BLASTS the HORN\n          mercilessly, and throws on the coals.\n          They blast down the stretch neck to\n          neck, twist round a wide bend.\n\n          Prince edges in front!  The Engineer\n          BLASTS the HORN and moves up.  Prince\n          snaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths\n          the words:  Fuck You!\n\n          Prince wants to scream!  He twists the\n          throttle, snaps a look to the\n          speedometer:  75 mph.  He RIPS past ruts\n          and gullies like a madman.  The TRAIN\n          moves up.  They blast around another\n          bend neck to neck\n\n          Suddenly Prince's eyes widen with\n          horror.  A CAR is parked across the\n          access road, waiting to cross the track.\n          He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the\n          Guy is laughing hysterically now,\n          BLASTING his HORN wildly, mouthing the\n          words:  Bye Bye!\n\n          Prince screams like  a MADMAN!  He\n          twists his  throttle FULL!  He blazes\n          ahead of the train, BLASTS! up the\n          embankment, SAILS through the air...\n\n          ...a BRICK WALL cuts the access road in\n          two!\n\n          He SCREAMS in bloody terror!  He hits\n          the road and fishtails wildly, locking\n          his brakes.  The WALL comes at him like\n          a locomotive.  He's going to hit it,\n          knows it and...\n\n          He twists his throttle violently BLASTS!\n          directly into the path of the train!\n\n          The Engineer looks on in horror!  Prince\n          throws his weight forward and...\n\n          ...the train ROARS past him as he\n          fishtails wildly to a stop.\n\n          The Engineer sails off into the dusk,\n          his mouth agape.  Prince sits there\n          breathing fiercely, the adrenaline\n          shrieking though his veins, watching\n          the train disappear into the distance.\n\n     (78) EXT. STREETS AND ALLEY -- DOWNTOWN -- TWILIGHT\n\nSHOPPERS flood the sidewalks, rushing for the buses that\ntake them home.  TRAFFIC clogs  at the 77 intersections\nwhile PEDESTRIANS walk against the lights.  Prince rides\ndown the streets, hugging the right shoulder, impatient with\nthe delays.  He blasts down a side street, sees FLASHING\nLIGHTS up ahead.  GAWKERS are already crowding around.\n\n          He moves through the TRAFFIC slowly,\n          glides past a POLICE CAR, and a small\n          CROWD.  A CAR has run onto the sidewalk,\n          knocking down the marquee to a rundown,\n          neighborhood bar.\n\n          Something catches his eye -- he stops\n          suddenly.  His Mother stands against the\n          wall, idly watching the goings on.  He\n          jumps off his bike hurriedly, walks up\n          behind her, taps her on the shoulder--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Ma...?\n\n          She turns, he gasps out loud.  Her left\n          eye is swollen shut--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               (drunkenly)\n               Hi, ya, baby...\n\n          Her drunken breath washes over him --\n          his head spins--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Ma...what happened?\n\n          She rubs up against him--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               Can you give me some money?\n               C'mon, just some money...\n\n          She gropes for him drunkenly -- he\n          suddenly realizes she doesn't know who\n          he is--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               Here...here...\n\n          She tugs at her wedding ring--\n\n                           MOTHER\n               Give me something for\n               this...just a little.

Three WOMEN stagger over, one\n          of them grabbing his Mother--\n\n                            WOMAN\n               C'mon, honey -- we're goin'\n               in...\n\n          She fixes Prince with a glare--\n\n                            WOMAN\n               You're a little young aren't\n               you?  Get out of here.  Leave\n               her alone.\n\n               (79) EXT. PRINCES HOME -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince BLASTS down the STREET, sweeps\n          into his drive, and jumps off his bike,\n          practically smashing it into the gate.\n          His eyes are burning with anger.  He\n          flies up the steps three at a time, cuts\n          across the porch, bursts throuch the\n          front door and--\n\n              (80) INT. PRINCE'S POME -- NIGHT\n\n          -- stalks through the living room, eyes\n          blazing--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Where the fuck are you?\n\n          He spins like a top, streaks down the\n          hallway, throws open several doors\n          violently--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Where are you?\n\n          He cuts into the kitchen raging--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Answer me you fucker!!\n\n          He twists around frustrated; exhaustion,\n          anger, and pain competing for the same\n          space.  Suddenly he stops, listens\n          intently a moment.  We HEAR it now -- a\n          PIANO.  Someone's PLAYING A PIANO.\n          Prince throws a look at the basement\n          door -- it's ajar.\n\n         (81) INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n          A naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  Prince\n          hesitates a moment, descends the steps,\n          pauses at the door.  The MUSIC wafts\n          delicately in the night breeze.  He\n          moves down the halllway uncertainly, but\n          steadily, the MUSIC growing, drawing him\n          in.\n\n          He stops, peers into the antechamber.\n          His Father is at the piano, his back to\n          him.  He's perched on the broken stool,\n          playing with all he's got.\n\n          Prince moves slowly into the room, his\n          knees weakening, his anger flowing from\n          him with every step he takes.  Seeing\n          his Father this way, he doesn't know if\n          he should laugh or cry.  He sits down\n          silently behind him, listens as his\n          Father plays.\n\n          The SONG ends.  His Father sits a\n          moment, stretching his hands idly along\n          the keys.  Feeling a presence in the\n          room, he spins around and jumps slightly\n          at seeing his son.  He fixes him with a\n          threatening look, then shrugs, hunches\n          over the keys--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Is that yours?\n\n                           FATHER\n               'Course it's mine.  Who else's\n               is it goin' to be?  Got all\n               kinds of them.  They're\n               different too.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I'd like to see them.  You got\n               them written down somewhere?\n\n                           FATHER\n               No, man -- I don't write them\n               down -- don't need to.  That's\n               the big difference between you\n               and me.\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Thought you weren't going to\n               play no more.\n\n          His Father looks at him sullenly, then\n          looks down, stares at the keys.\n          Prince's eyes well with tears--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I saw Mom up the street.  She\n               looked pretty bad.  Any idea\n               how she got that way?\n\n          His Father bites his his lip, rubs a\n          hand over his face, stares at the keys.\n          His voice comes with difficulty--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Yeah...\n               (a beat)\n               I got a girlfriend.\n\n                            FATHER\n               You gonna get married?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               (long pause)\n               I don't know.\n\n          His Father shares a hurtful look with\n          him, then stares darkly at the floor\n          below--\n\n                           FATHER\n               Never get married.\n\n                   (82) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          The CLUB is THROBBING.  Prince is\n          onstage, stripped to the waist, SWEAT\n          seeping from his pores in torrents.\n          He's deep into the pit of \"Computer\n          Blue, \" locked into a provocative,\n          obscene graphic with Wendy. She's on her\n          knees in front of him, his crotch moving\n          directly in front of her lips.  She's\n          made up fiercely, looks like Prince\n          himself.  The total effect is unnerving\n          -- Prince is going down on himself.\n\n          Billy Sparks stands by the bar pretty\n          upset.  Jill stands slack-jawed.  The\n          KIDS have stopped dancing, drinking --\n          they staring at the display,.shaking\n          their heads confused...\n\n          The BEAT is SAVAGE.  Prince is in his\n          own world, living his own private hell.\n          Suddenly the MUSIC crescendos, then\n          winds down like a roller coaster\n          sweeping everyone along.  The BEAT\n          changes radically.  He turns his back to\n          the audience and plays ...\n\n          ...and we suddenly recognize the MUSIC\n          as his Father's -- the song he played on\n          the piano the night before. But it's\n          Prince's now, stamped with his own\n          signature.  He's bent at the waist, his\n          back to the audience, alone with his\n          father's, and his, pain.\n\n          The CROWD fidgets...Billy Sparks fastens\n          his eyes on Prince angrily.\n\n (83) EXT. CLUB/INT. MORRIS' CAR (1ST AVE. ST. BAR) -- NIGHT\n\n          KIDS are hanging out in front of the\n          club.  The usual queue, however, is\n          noticeably absent.\n\n          The yellow Caddy sweeps up.  Jerome is\n          at the wheel, Morris and Vanity sit in\n          the back.  Morris is dressed elegantly,\n          resplendent in a 5O's-style suit.  She's\n          beautiful in a sleek black dress, with\n          long black gloves, and heels--\n\n                           VANITY\n               What are we doing here,\n               Morris?\n\n                           MORRIS\n               What do you mean?\n\n                           VANITY\n               I don't want to be here.  I\n               don't want to hurt anybody.\n\n                           MORRIS\n               It's not about hurting\n               anybody.  This is business.\n               We can use the exposure.\n\n          Just then Brenda and Susan come up to\n          the car excitedly.  Brenda is dressed in\n          a 40's-style dress, Susan wears a form-\n          fitting leopard one.  They both look\n          gorgeous--\n\n                           BRENDA\n               Hi -- you coming in?\n\n          Their excitement and nervousness is\n          endearing.  Vanity's heart goes out to\n          them.  She forces a smile, climbs out\n          unaided--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Your horns are showing,\n               Morris.\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Yeah...but they're holding up\n               my halo.\n\n                   (84) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince is on-stage, deep into the\n          closing moments of \"Computer Blue.\"  He\n          paces back and forth frantically, still\n          locked in his own private hell.  The\n          Crowd's attention has wandered, however,\n          and very few remain on the dance floor,\n          finding it too much trouble to keep up\n          with the changing shifts in the music.\n          Even his band members are edgy, casting\n          quick looks to each other, wishing to\n          get on with more compelling audience-\n          pleasing sounds.\n\n          BAR AREA\n          as Billy Sparks shakes hands with Morris\n          and Jerome and is introduced to Vanity\n          Six for the first time.  We can tell by\n          his reaction that he likes what he sees.\n          He kisses Brenda and Susan, saves a\n          special squeeze for Vanity herself.  He\n          escorts the whole group to a table\n          across the floor.  Vanity brings up the\n          rear, casts a quick look to Prince\n          onstage.\n\n          PRINCE\n          fastens on her and brings \"Computer\n          Blue\" to a rousing end.  The Crowd\n          applauds, but it's more out of respect\n          than eagerness.  He doesn't seem to\n          notice though, or care.  He confers\n          quickly with his group., then moves\n          center-stage.  The Band Members trade\n          frustrated looks with each other -- it's\n          obvious that they have some trouble with\n          the next song...\n\n          Prince presses his lips to the mike, and\n          the MUSIC starts.  He begins SINGING\n          \"Darling Nicky\"--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I knew a girl named Nicky,\n               I guess you can say she was a\n               sex fiend.\n               I met her in a hotel lobby\n               masturbating in magazines.\n               She said, How'd you like to\n               waste some time,\n               And I could not resist\n               When I saw little Nicky grind.\n\n          BILLY SPARKS\n          shoots a fierce look to Prince, helps\n          Morris, Jerome and the Girls to their\n          table.  Vanity is watching Prince, a\n          puzzled look on her face--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Hee, hee...little empty\n               tonight, huh, Billy.  But I\n               guess money isn't everything.\n\n          Jerome busts up--\n\n                           JEROME\n               Oh no... that's cold...\n\n          But Billy agrees--\n\n                            BILLY\n               The Duke of Dick is in rare\n               form tonight.\n\n          They all look toward the stage--\n\n          PRINCE\n          is fastened on Vanity and it's apparent\n          to all.  He launches into the next verse-\n          -\n\n                           PRINCE\n               She took me to her castle\n               And I could not believe my\n               eyes.\n               She had so many devices\n               Everything that money could\n               buy.\n               She said,\n               Sign your name on the dotted\n               line,\n               The lights went out,\n               And Nicky started to grind.\n\n          VANITY\n          flushes with embarrassment.  Billy and\n          Morris notice this and glare at Prince.\n\n          PRINCE\n          looks dead-center at them, and then to\n          Vanily--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I woke up the next morning.\n               Nicky wasn't there.\n               I looked all ov'r all I found\n               Was a phone number on the\n               stairs.\n               It said thank you for a funky\n               time,\n               Call me up when ev'r you want\n               to grind.\n\n          VANITY\n          stands suddenly, fighting back tears.\n          She backs from the table quickly, knocks\n          the chair over.  Morris tries to help\n          her, but she sweeps past him, hurrying\n          for the exit.\n\n           (85) INT. STAIRWAY/EXT. STREET -- NIGHT\n\n          as she comes down the stairs stumbling\n          slightly, tears streaming down her face.\n          Chick sees her, reached out to help--\n\n                            CHICK\n               Hey ...\n\n          But she pulls away, runs out the door,\n          cuts across the street.\n\n                   (86) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          PRINCE\n          brings the SONG to a blistering end.\n          The stage is plunged into darkness.  He\n          strips off his guitar, cuts from the\n          stage, ignoring the grave looks from his\n          Band Members.\n\n                 (87) INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\n          as Prince twists aggressively past a\n          handful of FANS, rudely disregarding\n          their attention.  He Cuts into the\n          dressing room.\n\n              (88) INT. DRESSING ROON -- NIGHT\n\n          He's agitated, paces back and forth in a\n          frenzy.  Suddenly the DOOR flies open.\n          Billy Sparks enters angrily--\n\n                            BILLY\n               What the fuck's wrong with\n               you, Prince?!\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I don't have time for your\n               bullshit, Billy.

Your music doesn't\n               make sense to anyone but\n               yourself.\n\n          He closes the door behind him.  Prince\n          stands dully a moment, then sits heavily\n          in a chair.  Exhaustion suddenly\n          overwhelms him.  He rests his head in\n          his hands, moments tick by...\n\n          He shakes himself awake -- Morris and\n          Jerome stand by the door--\n\n                           JEROME\n               That was fucked up what you\n               did man.

CARS are THICK in front of\n          THE TASTE, a small NIGHTCLUB located in\n          the poorer part of the city.  Because of\n          its location, The Taste books different\n          dance bands four nights a week and then\n          hosts a Variety Night the remaining two.\n          Aspiring comedians, dancers and jugglers\n          flock to Variety Night, desirous of\n          trying their material in front of a live\n          audience -- and hoping to catch the\n          discering eye of a talent scout on the\n          prowl.\n\n          Billy Sparks pulls up to the curb, gets\n          out with a beautiful WOMAN and cuts\n          inside.\n\n           (90) INT. BACKSTAGE, THE TASTE -- NIGHT\n          Jerome stands BACKSTAGE fidgeting\n          nervously, staring appreciatively at the\n          closed dressing room door.  Various\n          PEOPLE in COSTUMES pass by sporadically.\n          Suddenly a burst of APPLAUSE and\n          LAUGHTER wafts into the hallway.  Jerome\n          walks to the curtain and peers out--\n\n                (91) INT. THE TASTE -- NIGHT\n\n          JEROME'S POV--\n          Billy Sparks and his Girlfriend being\n          seated at a front table.

BACKSTAGE -- THE TASTE -- NIGHT\n\n          Just then a CLOWN passes Jerome, stops,\n          and hands him a flower.  Jerome tries to\n          smile, but his nervousness is simply too\n          strong.  The Clown hands him another\n          flower, trying to elicit a favorable\n          response.  Jerome is patient, but\n          attempts to ignore the Clown in a polite\n          way, indicating he'd rather be alone.\n          The Clown persists, however, going\n          through a little routine, handing him\n          flower after flower...\n\n          Suddenly Jerome throws them into the\n          air, grabs the Clown by the throat and\n          flings him headlong down the hallway.\n          The Clown gives Jerome the finger and\n          walks off in a huff.\n\n          MORRIS\n          cuts from the dressing room, closes the\n          door behind him.  He joins Jerome at the\n          curtain, and they move down the back\n          stairway to the CLUB--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               (nervously)\n               I guess this is it.\n\n                           JEROME\n               I guess so, M.D.\n\n                           MORRIS\n               I think I'm going to be sick.\n               Why does this have to be\n               happening to me?

THE TASTE -- NIGHT\n\nas Billy Sparks spots Morris, waves.  Morris manages a weak\nsmile, offers a half-hearted wave back.  Just then we HEAR a\nfirce DRUM BEAT, and--\n\n                         TASTE M.C.\n               Ladies and Gentlemen, please\n               welcome Vanity Six.\n\n          Respectful APPLAUSE--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Oh, God--\n\n          He sits quickly, followed by Jerome --\n          they both put on sunglasses.\n\n          A HUSH descends over the CROWD.  The\n          CURTAIN rises slowly...and Brenda, Susan\n          and Vanity are frozen in a provocative,\n          vampy stance.  Their effect on the\n          audience is galvanizing --   the Crowd\n          bursts into APPLAUSE and WHISTLES--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               (surprised)\n               What??\n\n          Wearing sexy lingerie and moving\n          seductively to the beat, the Girls\n          launch into \"Sex Shooter\" with complete\n          abandon.  The MUSIC is slick and fierce,\n          the Girls sexy and sure.  Wearing black\n          bikini panties, black tails and boots,\n          Vanity dances center-stage and begins\n          SINGING.  She's mesmerizing, her look so\n          alluring, so profound that the audience\n          sits slack-jawed in amazement.  The\n          SPOTLIGHT is hers and she soaks it in,\n          radiating a sexiness that has the\n          audience at her feet.  The entire\n          concept -- dress, dance, music and\n          staging -- is overwhelming, with just\n          the right degree of playfulness to allow\n          the Crowd easy passage into the fantasy\n          world the Girls create.  Brenda and\n          Susan play off her wonderfully, sharing\n          secret looks with the Crowd, balancing\n          the wickedness of the act with an\n          innocence that is enticing.  They're\n          working strongly as a unit now, the\n          AUDIENCE roaring their approval...\n\n          MORRIS\n          and Jerome are beside themselves with\n          happiness.  The pull off their shades\n          immediately, sit back and glow in the\n          audience's response.\n\n          PRINCE\n          stands in the back, his eyes glued to\n          Vanity.  Her strength and sureness in\n          front of the Crowd is breathtaking.  The\n          audience loves her and he suddenly feels\n          very alone -- as if another wall has\n          gone up between them.  He looks away a\n          moment and spots...\n\n          ...Morris looking at him with a self-\n          satisfied, triumphant grin on his face.\n          Prince looks away, moves out of his\n          eyesight.\n\n          \"Sex Shooter\" comes to an end.  The\n          stage is plunged into darkness.  The\n          CROWD goes WILD, leaps to their feet,\n          begging for more.  The Girls, slighly\n          over-whelmed by the response and\n          flushing deep red, hold one\n          another.tightly and take repeated bows.\n\n          PRINCE\n          watches the Girls bowing to thunderous\n          APPLAUSE.  Suddenly Vanity looks at him\n          and touches the earring she's wearing --\n          it's his Mother's.  His knees weaken\n          instantly, and he locks eyes with her.\n          The heat between them is unmistakable.\n          She smiles vividly, gives him an\n          endearing wave and steps back as the\n          curtain closes.\n\n          He's MOVING through the Crowd before he\n          knows it, trying to get to the backstage\n          door.  The Crowd is thick, his path\n          momentarily blocked.  He spots Billy\n          Sparks cutting across the floor and\n          congratulating Morris and Jerome.\n          Prince turns from them, tries once again\n          to make his way through the Crowd.\n\n (94) INT. DRESSING ROOM, AND HALLWAY -- THE TASTE -- NIGHT\n\n          VANITY\n          and the Girls rush into the dressing\n          room and jump up and down with\n          excitement.  They are beside themselves\n          with happiness, kissing and hugging one\n          another avidly.  Suddenly Vanity pulls\n          away, indicates she will be back and\n          cuts out the room.\n\n          HALLWAY\n          as she runs down the hallway to the\n          backstage area, peers from behind the\n          curtain, scanning the club earnestly.\n\n      (95) IN'T. -- THE TASTE -- NEAR CURTAIN -- NIGHT\n\n          as Prince waits impatiently in the long\n          line.  Billy Sparks comes by, spots him\n          and stops--\n\n                            BILLY\n               Morris is squeezing you,\n               kiddo.  You better kick ass\n               tomorrow night or else.\n\n          He cuts outside, disappears into the\n          Crowd.  Prince stands there steaming,\n          the wind knocked out of him, his joy a\n          memory.  He turns back to the line, but\n          it has grown, the Crowd now jammed up\n          against the door.  Frustrated, he cuts\n          outside.\n\n          BACKSTAGE\n          as Vanity watches Prince leave.  A\n          profound sadness sweeps her face.\n          Suddenly Susan is by her Side, hugging\n          and kissing her happily.  Brenda runs\n          up, pouring champagne.  Morris, Jerome\n          and The Time are at the end of the\n          hallway and beckon her excitedly into\n          the room.  Vanity forces a smile, goes\n          down the hallway, casting another look\n          at the exit door.\n\n          (96) EXT. BACK ALLEY, THE TASTE -- NIGHT\n\n          Morris and Vanity stagger down the ALLEY\n          obviously very drunk.  Morris pulls from\n          a FLASK.  Vanity is still in her\n          lingerie, wears an open coat over it.\n          Her speech is slurred--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Did you hear these people\n               applauding?  They loved us --\n               they wanted to rip us apart,\n               and this is just our first\n               night.  I can see it now,\n               we're all going to be big\n               stars.  I can feel it.\n\n                           MORRIS\n               (singing)\n               Ain't nobody bad like me.\n\n          She kisses him spontaneously on the\n          cheek--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Morris, you're a genius.\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Ye-es...\n\n          He fixes her with a sexy look, takes a\n          healthy look from his flask, then gives\n          it too her.  Vanity throws her head\n          back, drinks fully, the liquor coursing\n          over her cheeks.  He devours her with\n          his eyes, opens the door to the Caddy--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Let's go, Bebe.\n\n          She stops as if remembering something--\n\n                           VANITY\n               Huh, where's Jerome?\n\n                           MORRIS\n               In his skin...hee, hee...\n\n          He's trying to nudge her into the Caddy-\n          -\n\n                           VANITY\n               Is he coming?\n\n                           MORRIS\n               I gave him the night off.\n\n                           VANITY\n               Why?\n\n          He staggers back from the car, undulates\n          his hips wantonly--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Whawhak!\n\n          She busts up.  Just then a MOTORCYCLE\n          can be heard off screen.  They look\n          around drunkenly, trying to discern its\n          direction.  Suddenly Prince BLASTS\n          around the corner FULL OUT!  He streaks\n          by Morris and KICKS him flat on his ass\n          into the garbage--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               (wails)\n               Oh, no -- Oh, God...No!\n\n          Prince skids to a slick stop.  Vanity is\n          transfixed.  The entire episode  took\n          less than five seconds.  He twists the\n          throttle, BLASTS down upon her...\n\n          She breaks in a panic!  She runs\n          clumsily down another alley, her coat\n          flying.  He WHIPS after her like a\n          madman.  She flies around the corner --\n          a dead end!  He fishtails to a slick\n          stop--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Get on!\n\n          There's no way out!  Suddenly she lets\n          out an excited YELP, jumps on.  He guns\n          the bike, BURSTS up the alley.  Morris\n          jumps into his path drunkenly, his arms\n          extended--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Stop! Stop!\n\n          But Prince BLAZES down upon him, sending\n          him slipping and sliding to safety.  He\n          BLASTS around the bend--\n\n                           MORRIS\n               Motherfucker!  You long-haired\n               faggot!\n\n          (97) EXT.

EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT\n\n          They streak down the road, slow, then\n          move down a small embankment.  He stops\n          the bike and gets off.  She's in a foul\n          mood, staggers around dully, her head\n          pounding, her speech slurred--\n\n                           VANITY\n               So here we are again.  So this\n               is it, huh?  What do you want\n               this time?\n\n          He looks at her painfully, upset about\n          her drunken state--\n\n                           VANITY\n               What's your problem now?\n               What's your main problem?\n\n                           PRINCE\n               No problem.  I just wanted to\n               talk, alright? I just want us\n               to be okay, to really get\n               along.  No big deal.\n\n          She cackles, falls flat on her ass,\n          hoists herself up--\n\n                           VANITY\n               No big deal, huh...\n\n          She pulls Morris' FLASK from her jacket\n          -- his eyes blacken--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Give me that.\n\n                           VANITY\n               No, definitely not.  Who are\n               you?  You can't tell me what\n               to do.\n\n          She puts it to her lips--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Please don't drink that.  Give\n               it to me.\n\n          She holds the flask to her lips\n          defiantly, then goes to drink.\n\n          He lashes out suddenly, SMASHES it from\n          her grip.  She SCREAMS wildly, SLAPS him\n          hard across the face.  He stands shocked\n          a moment, his rage surging within him,\n          smashing through every safety valve he's\n          acquired in his life.  He BACKHANDS her\n          savagely across the jaw.\n\n          She hits the ground like a rag doll.  He\n          looks at her curiously, bends over her -\n          - she sucker-punches him with everything\n          she's got!  He SCREAMS in rage and grabs\n          her hands as they flail about his face.\n          He squeezes her fingers back while the\n          tears stream down her cheeks and her\n          mouth forms a silent \"ow\"!  She bares\n          her teeth angrily and he sucks at her\n          mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever\n          pitch.\n\n          She kicks at him violently, hot tears\n          streaming down her cheeks.  He jams his\n          leg between hers, rubs it firmly against\n          her bottom.  She struggles helplessly\n          against him as he covers her breasts,\n          her stomach, her thighs with his lips.\n          Quick breaths escape from her -- her\n          breathing begins to race...\n\n          He snaps her panties in two, pulls them\n          from between her legs.  She spreads\n          herself as he releases his pants.  She\n          squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward\n          her -- but Prince resists her coldly,\n          regards her with contempt.  Suddenly he\n          flips her onto her stomach, forces her\n          to stand painfully on her knees.  He\n          rubs his hand between her buttocks, then\n          thrusts into her painfully, driving\n          himself to the very depths of her...\n\n          ...but she stifles a cry, arches her\n          back, and meets his thrusts fiercely,\n          moving quicker and quicker, banging her\n          buttocks against his thighs again and\n          again.  She's drawing from him now,\n          turning the humiliation around,\n          obtaining all that she needs and\n          desires.  He's powerless -- her thrusts\n          set the pace.  She rises, Prince still\n          inside her and tugs on him rapidly,\n          causing him to ejaculate suddenly,\n          drawing from him a sharp and sudden\n          cry...\n\n          She moves away, draws her coat tightly\n          about her, fixes him with a contemptuous\n          look--\n\n                           VANITY\n\n               You're nothing, Prince,\n               absolutely nothing.

She bites her lip sadly,\n          then snaps a hot look at the Driver--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I  need a  ride.\n\n          She cuts around the car, hops in.

He walk wearily\n          across the porch, moves to the front\n          door -- it's wide open.

A lamp, a porcelain\n          dish, some knickknacks on the mantle --\n          all smashed.

He flings his stick at the\n          wall, unends shelves and bureaus,\n          trampling old memories that have lain\n          dormant for years.\n\n          Drawer after drawer is flung against the\n          wall, their contents smashing and\n          scattering about.  He opens a large,\n          oaken chest and flips over.  Thick three\n          inch piles of yellowed paper fall out.\n          He snaps through the rubber bands\n          holding them together and flings the\n          paper at the wall again and again...\n\n          ...he stops suddenly, shocked.  He SEES\n          musical notes written down on the paper.\n          his heart pounding in his chest, he\n          searches frantically through the rubble\n          scattered about him.  More and more\n          musical notes, sketched ideas, simple\n          melodies, entire songs and scores -- all\n          meticulously recorded on lined yellowed\n          paper, dated for the last 20 years, and\n          signed...by his Father.  He's shocked to\n          a standstill.  Then the full\n          significance of what's before him hits\n          him like a sledgehammer.  He collapses\n          in agony against the chest, tears\n          flowing down his cheeks.\n\n  (105) INT.

A nervous\n          TWITTER ripples though the crowd.  Those\n          who know about the tragedy feel a\n          profound embarrassment for him -- but no\n          one turns away.  Then his voice comes\n          clear and mellifluous--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               I would like to do a song that\n               two of my friends wrote.\n\n          A MURMUR, cuts through the Crowd like a\n          riptide.  Prince snaps a look to Lisa\n          and Wendy and confirms that it is indeed\n          their song.  They can't believe it!\n          Tears spring to Wendy's eyes before she\n          knows it ...\n\n          Prince smiles at her, then gazes at his\n          entire Band.  Their eyes fasten on him\n          in an instant.  He counts softly and...\n\n          MUSIC.  The opening bars of \"Purple\n          Rain.\"  He turns to to the audience and\n          SINGS....\n\n          It's a ballad, a poem really, a plea for\n          understanding, love, and survival.  It's\n          a testament, a pact if you will, between\n          himself and others...\n\n          The AUDIENCE is mesmerized, all EYES are\n          upon him -- but Prince doesn't notice.\n          Lips pressed against the mike, dark eyes\n          streaming, he's lost to himself now,\n          loosening all that's within him,\n          cleansing himself of his rage, hatred\n          and pain...\n\n          VANITY\n          is crying.  Every moment she has shared\n          with him is expressed in this song, and\n          the effect on her is unnerving.  Her\n          heart leaps to him in a way she never\n          thought possible.  But she lets it go\n          willingly, as the words draw her in,\n          seducing her somehow, making her\n          free...as if the music, his words, all\n          that he has experienced and  understood,\n          is purging what is confused and ugly\n          within herself, leaving her with an\n          understanding and joy that burns in her\n          womb like soft fire.  A smile springs to\n          her lips as tears continue to flow, and\n          she finds herself moving closer...\n\n          ...as the Audience moves closer, drawn\n          somehow to the stage, to the person who\n          SINGS so truly, to the person who gives\n          of himself unselfishly to all that he\n          feels...\n\n          Prince begins a long sustained CRY that\n          cuts though the hearts of all present.\n          The MUSIC builds awsomely, and he\n          continues to sing out, emptying himself\n          of all the remaining pain lying within.\n          The MUSIC crescendos and comes to a\n          quiet end...\n\n          Stunned SILENCE.  A silence so profound\n          you could hear a pin drop.  Prince\n          sighs, assumes the worse, then cuts\n          across the stage purposefully.  Now some\n          CLAPPING.  And a WHISTLE from the back\n          and the SHOUTING.  And more WHISTLES and\n          some even SCREAMING.  And the WHISTLES\n          and the SHOUTS and the CLAPPING growing\n          and growing as....\n\n                (112)  INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince cuts from the stage in a frenzy,\n          rushes toward the rear exit.  The\n          APPLAUSE is building and building until\n          it's a THUNDER, an onrushing ROAR, an\n          avalanche of HYSTERIA that rocks the\n          club mightily...\n\n          PRINCE\n          is still running though, his face\n          streaming with tears, past the surprised\n          look of Jill, past the FANS, past\n          everyone -- stripping of his clothes\n          fiercely, flinging off his jacket, his\n          shirt, his scarf--\n\n   (113) EXT. BACK ENTRANCE, INT. HALLWAY -- CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          He SMASHES open the door, BURSTS\n          outside.  He sucks in the night air as\n          if he was drowning.  He wipes away his\n          tears, rushes to his bike, starts to\n          undo the chain...\n\n          ...they're SHOUTING his NAME...\n\n          Not randomly, not haphazardly, but...in\n          unison.  And relentless, very demanding,\n          downright urgent, and...it's beautiful.\n\n          A wry smile crosses his lips.  He heads\n          back to the door.  Jill is there,\n          scared, her face a map of tears.  He\n          flashes her a smile--\n\n                           PRINCE\n               Hi.\n\n          She's thunderstruck, can barely squeak\n          it out--\n\n                            JILL\n               Hi.\n\n          And he whips into the hallway.  Her face\n          dissolves into a smile of pure joy.\n\n                  (114) INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          MOVING now, FAST and FURIOUS.  The\n          HALLWAY is LINED with PEOPLE.  They\n          reach for him as he passes, touching\n          him, showering him with their love.\n          Someone hands him his shirt, another his\n          scarf -- it's so intense!\n\n          He's moving quickly now, his jacket up\n          ahead, closer...he stops suddenly,\n          stunned...\n\n          ...Vanity is holding his jacket.  He's\n          struck speechless -- she hands it to him\n          smiling, tears streaming down her face--\n\n                           VANITY\n               I love you.\n\n          His knees go weak, she kisses him\n          spontaneously, pushes him lovingly to\n          the stage.\n\n          THE CROWD IS ROARING!\n\n         (115)  INT. HALLWAY AND STAGE REAR -- NIGHT\n\n          He's half-running now like crazy -- his\n          Band is on-stage, peering anxiously into\n          the hallway.  They spot him and relief\n          sweeps their faces like a tidal wave.\n          He whips his jacket on, rushes up the\n          stairs...\n\n                  (116)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          STAGE\n          THUNDER!  Prince walks center-\n          stage...and bows.  The AUDIENCE goes\n          BERSERK!  He acknowledges Wendy and\n          Lisa, and then the entire Band.  The\n          CROWD is jumping out of their skin!  He\n          straps on his guitar, gives a deft\n          signal and--\n\n          MUSIC.  The Band launches into \"I Would\n          Die For You.\"  Vanity squeezes her way\n          through the crowd and stands watching\n          Prince from the wings.  He presses his\n          lips to the mike and SINGS.\n\n          The MUSIC continues as we...\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n       (117)  INT. LIVING ROOM, PRINCE'S HOME -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince walks through the LIVING ROOM\n          slowly, gazes at the smashed table, the\n          broken lamp and dishes. Every item in\n          the room suddenly takes on a profound\n          significance.  His father's slippers\n          under the sofa, his mother's knickknacks\n          on the table, her pen and ink drawings\n          on the wall.  After a moment, he picks\n          up his father's slippers, studies them a\n          long time.\n\n                (118)  INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          The DOOR opens -- a LIGHT snaps ON.  He\n          walks into the room, places his father's\n          slippers in the CLOSET.  His Mother's\n          dress is lying in a heap on the floor.\n          He picks it up, and puts it away.\n\n                (119) INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT\n\n          as he descends the steps hesitantly.\n          The FLOOR is covered with rubble.  He\n          sits on the steps, stares at his\n          father's MUSIC on the floor.\n\n          \"I Would Die For You\" continues as we...\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n                  (120)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince on-stage SINGING \"I Would Die For\n          You.\"  The AUDIENCE is captivated,\n          locked into his grip again.  His eyes\n          seem to be focused on something far\n          away.  He closes them tightly, presses\n          his lips against the mike.\n\n          The MUSIC continues as we...\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n       (121)  INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- TWILIGHT\n\n          He's in the final stages of cleaning the\n          basement floor.  The debris has been\n          swept up, shelves righted, smashed items\n          thrown away...\n\n          He stacks his Father's music neatly,\n          tears welling in his eyes.  He places it\n          in new boxes, stands wearily, a\n          fulfilled look on his face.  Suddenly he\n          stops -- stares at the awful chalk marks\n          on the floor:  his Father lying down,\n          the gun gripped in his hand...\n\n          \"I Would Die For You\" continues as we...\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n                  (122)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          Prince on-stage SINGING  \"I Would Die\n          For You.\"  He's lost to himself now,\n          locked into a personal horror he alone\n          can see.  The CROWD is pressed against\n          the stage, mesmerized by his\n          performance.  Billy Sparks is also drawn\n          in, amazed at the power being generated\n          from the stage.  Prince sweeps the\n          audience with his eyes, then fastens on\n          Vanity earnestly, SINGS directly to her.\n\n          The MUSIC continues as we...\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n         (123)  INT. BASEMENT, PRINCE'S HOME -- DAWN\n\n          He pulls a HOSE from behind the washer,\n          draws it on to the floor.  He hesitates\n          a moment, gazes one last time at his\n          Father's outline, tears welling in his\n          eyes.  He turns the water on, watches as\n          the dusty yellow chalk gives way\n          reluctantly, mixing with the water,\n          swirling down the drain.  Calmness\n          sweeps his face like a passing cloud.\n\n          Just then SUNLIGHT blazes in through the\n          casement windows.  Water droplets\n          glisten brilliantly in the morning\n          light.  He turns the water off, goes to\n          put the hose back -- stops suddenly,\n          surprised...\n\n          ...his Mother's earring lies on the\n          floor.\n\n          He's entranced, picks it up, stares at\n          it a moment.  Everything he's been\n          through comes rushing at him like a loco\n          motive.  The confusion, the shouting and\n          violence, the darkness that eclipsed his\n          parents' life -- it's all there, lying\n          just below the surface, settled into his\n          heart.  But now there's a difference --\n          he knows it's there and has discovered\n          what could happen when it takes control\n          of your life.\n\n          So as he stands in the basement, on the\n          clean cellar floor, he realizes\n          that...he'll just take one thing at a\n          time, and do it right.  Better than\n          anybody else.  He smiles, realizes that\n          in the last few weeks, he's never felt\n          better than he feels right now.  He\n          turns quickly, flips the earring to the\n          stairwell...\n\n          ...Vanity plucks it from the air.  Their\n          eyes lock and they share smiles of pure\n          joy.  He picks up his father's music,\n          and they both head up the stairs.\n\n          \"I Would Die For You\" continues as we--\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n                  (124)  INT. CLUB -- NIGHT\n\n          CELEBRATION!  Everyone is JUMPING up and\n          down.  Prince is radiant, strutting\n          across the stage, his hands upraised.\n          The CROWD goes WILD!  He flashes a wide\n          grin to Vanity, then twists, eyeballs\n          the CROWD wickedly, wonderfully.  It's\n          too much!\n\n          Everyone is joining in now.  Even Morris\n          and Jerome, standing in the wings, start\n          DANCING like crazy.  Then suddenly they\n          catch themselves, stop, act dignified.\n          But Vanity sees them and busts up.  They\n          catch her look, laugh heartily and join\n          in again.\n\n          The MUSIC segues into a fierce BEAT.\n          The CROWD lets out a ROAR!  Prince\n          strips off his guitar, streaks center-\n          stage.  The Band launches into \"Baby,\n          I'm A Star.\"\n\n          ...And the CROWD laughing, dancing,\n          shouting and loving.
