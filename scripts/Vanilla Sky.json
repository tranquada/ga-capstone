DAVID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n          DAVID AAMES, JR., 32, swings out of bed and sits on the\n          corner of his mattress. it's a chilly New York City\n          morning. Early sunlight glows around the corner's of his\n          curtains.\n\n          A WOMAN'S VOICE\n          open your eyes...\n          He reaches behind him to shut off a slim voice-activated\n          clock-radio. He rises, a comforter draped around his\n          shoulders, and heads to the bathroom.\n\n          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - MORNING\n\n          David regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully-tiled\n          and well-appointed bathroom. in his thirties now, his\n          looks have only deepened and improved. He brushes his\n          teeth. He spots a gray hair, and holding tweezers, seizes\n          and plucks it.\n\n          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n          David puts on a shirt. Checks his wallet for money. His\n          bedroom is elegant and spare.\n\n          INT. DAVID'S NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT - MORNING\n\n          He slips down the stairs into the expansive living area of\n          this deeply-textured apartment. A stunning, inherited book\n          collection lines the walls.\n\n          INT./EXT. NEW YORK CITY GARAGE BELOW APARTMENT/STREETS -\n\n\n          MORNING\n          David starts up his dark green sports car, and roars onto\n          the New York City streets.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2\n          EXT. NEW YORK SIDE STREETS u- MORNING\n          David travels the side-streets to work. He senses a\n          growing weirdness. The streets are empty. He looks at. his\n          watch. It's        8:12.  He continues anxiously. Runs a red\n          light. Music rises.\n\n          EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- MORNING\n\n          The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is\n          silent. It is as if the world's biggest parade has just\n          left, taking everybody with it. David pulls over\n          haphazardly. He exits the car, leaving it in the middle of\n          the street. He begins to walk, faster now, as music rises.\n          All the electricity is on. There is absolutely nobody in\n          sight. David begins to run, searching for humanity. The\n          billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions\n          to his loneliness. He pulls up short., stopping and crying\n          out in anguish. There is no one left in the world.\n\n          A WOMAN'S VOICE\n          Open your eyes... open your eyes,\n          David...\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n          INT.

He makes a relieved agonized sound into the\n          pillow. Gets up, sees a pizza box... a container of\n          soup... a remote control on the floor. We hear an incisive\n          voice with a comforting lilt - a man we'll meet later.\n\n          A MAN'S VOICE\n          Well, I suppose the empty street\n          meant loneliness.\n\n          DAVID'S VOICE\n          You're a shrink. You've got to do\n          better than that.\n\n          A MAN'S VOICE\n          I'm a doctor. Let's not\n          stereotype each other. Not all\n          rich kids are soul-less, and not\n          all psychologists care about\n          dreams. The question is how you\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3\n          got here, and why you've been\n          charged.\n\n          DAVID'S VOICE\n          What do you want to know? I was\n          about to turn 33. I ran three\n          magazines, and a world-wide\n          publishing house. On most days I\n          actually fooled myself into\n          believing it would last forever.\n\n          INT. BATHROOM - MORNING\n\n          David checks himself in the mirror. Seizes and plucks that\n          same gray hair.\n\n          DAVID'S VOICE\n          Isn't that what being young is\n          about? Believing secretly that\n          you would be the one person, in\n          the history of man, who would live\n          forever?\n\n          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n          David enters, reaching for his wallet, repeating the\n          morning ritual. A figure stirs in the bed behind him. She\n          leans upward, wearing David's college basketball tank for a\n          pajama-top. She's warm and wicked, a mildly reformed party\n          girl, the kind of girl first-novels are written about. She\n          is JULIANNA GIANNI,25.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Where you going so early?\n\n          DAVID\n          (slightly self-conscious)\n          Hey, don't record any more\n          messages on my alarm--clock, okay?\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Why not?\n\n          DAVID\n          I'll think we're married or\n          something.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Don't you ever say that word. Or\n          I'll never come over here and\n          bring you chicken soup and fuck\n          your brains out again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4\n\n          DAVID  (O.S.)\n          (exiting, from other\n          room)\n          How's your cold?\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Still there. How's yours?\n\n          DAVID  (U.S..)\n          I guess you took my mind off it.\n          She pulls a pink pill-box purse from the nightstand,\n          withdraws a multi-colored phone.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Reyna, it's Julianna. I missed my\n          audition.\n          (dramatic, like Bette Davis)\n          I lost my head. Listen, I have to\n          go.\n          (whispers)\n          I'm with David.\n\n          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n          David in his steel-and-linoleum bachelor kitchen. Julie\n          swings into view. Her blouse is unbuttoned two buttons\n          too many, down to mid-chest. She gives him a kiss on the\n          cheek and lingers. David grabs a racquetball bag, talks to\n          the next. room.\n\n          DAVID\n          Help yourself to whatever you\n          want. Set the alarm, Maria will\n          clean up. Lock up when you go.\n          And... you are the greatest.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Bye \"honey!\"\n\n          DAVID\n          Bye \"honey!\" I'll call you later.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          When? When?\n\n          DAVID\n          Soon!\n          They have a comfortable, healthy, mutually satisfying,\n          gloriously superficial relationship.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5\n\n          INT./EXT. NEW YORK CITY GARAGE/STREETS - DAY\n\n          David is about to enter the green sports car, then thinks\n          better of it. He fires up a knock-around beater car from\n          his collection. He drives into the street which is,\n          comfortingly, now full of people. We hear R.E.M.'s \"All\n          The Right Friends.\"\n\n          EXT. NEW YORK SIDE-STREETS - DAY\n\n          David drives the crowded streets.        It all seems more\n          poignant today. Life is good again.\n\n          EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n          David pulls up to a lower-end apartment, checks his watch.\n          Enter the hung-over BRIAN SHELBY,        30ish. In a world of\n          acquaintances, Brian is a true friend.   He has all the\n          qualities of Abe Lincoln and, much to his chagrin, the\n          looks too. He hops in the car with racquetball bag.\n\n          DAVID\n          Did you reserve the court?\n\n          BRIAN\n          Easy. I can't handle heavy\n          conversation at this ungodly hour.\n\n          DAVID\n          I'm sorry to do this early. I\n          gotta be done by 10.\n          Car phone rings.

Look out!\n          David turns and sees he's hurtling into the back of a car\n          stopped just in front of him. Clenching he hits the\n          brakes, narrowly avoiding a high-speech collision. And\n          then... to his right... another car comes hurtling toward\n          him... and stops within an inch of deadly impact.           There\n          is an awful moment, as the second car blares on the horn.\n          Traffic continues, but the lingering feeling of dread and\n          confusion is still in the air.\n\n          BRIAN\n          Fuck!\n\n          DAVID\n          (annoyed)\n          We almost died.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          8\n\n          BRIAN\n          I know.

Goodnight.\n          He enters and shuts the door. Frustrated, she stands for    a\n          moment, listening to the music streaming from the\n          downstairs apartment.

In the\n          distance, rain.\n\n          DAVID\n          A lot of people are scared of\n          heights.

APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl\n          apartment. A life is lived here, a bed on the back-room\n          floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew. She\n          makes no attempt to clean it up. He soaks in the details,\n          including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and\n          shelves.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Hey Paulo!\n          A large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds\n          to slather David with love too.\n\n          DAVID\n          I'm glad he protects you. This is\n          a lethal canine.\n\n          SOFIA\n          (from other room)\n          I love living here.

He grabs a look at her in the other room. A bit of\n          leg between boot and skirt.  As he admires the dolls:\n\n          DAVID\n          So you're really a dancer, huh?\n\n          SOFIA\n          For     14     years.

A note reads: Call Dad!\n          An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          30\n          that represent a hard-working, hard-earned, committed and\n          passionate life.\n          Shot moves across the photos. A young girl living a young\n          girl's hard-working and happy life. Group photos of co-\n          workers. A few from a vacation. A whole new cast of\n          characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to\n          him.

Marry me!\n\n          DAVID\n          I do not want to know the story\n          behind this photo. Who's Sergio?\n\n          SOFIA\n          It's a nickname.\n\n          DAVID\n          Your nickname is Sergio?\n\n          SOFIA\n          It's a long story, and we don't\n          know each other.\n\n          DAVID\n          So many secrets.\n\n          SOFIA\n          That's because I'm really an arms\n          dealer.\n\n          DAVID\n          I've never known an arms dealer.\n\n          SOFIA\n          You do now. What about you?\n          What's your nickname?\n          David freezes.

It must be hard\n          controlling all those people's\n          lives. Everyone at that party is\n          connected to you for survival in\n          some way, it seems.\n          David looks at her, mentally assessing her level of guile.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Ever been married?\n\n          DAVID\n          No. Ever accept any of your\n          12,000 proposals?\n\n          SOFIA\n          (playful, self-\n          deprecating)\n          12,008.No.\n\n          DAVID\n          And you moved to New York.

Flashes of the photos on her\n          refrigerator.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Everyone said \"don't go to New\n          York.\" But I just think good\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          32\n          things will happen if you're a\n          good person with a good attitude.\n          Doncha think?\n          He regards her.  He's a little restless, and a lot\n          enchanted. Is she for real?\n\n          SOFIA\n          You think I'm naive.\n          He decides she's for real.

Again, strangely, it is \"To Kill A Mockingbird\"\n          that he's watching. We hear audio from the movie through\n          the glass.\n\n          INT.

Hang on. Okay - done.\n          Sofia offers her drawing. It's a caricature of a good-\n          looking guy surrounded by money, cars and very thin girls.\n          He snatches it, studies it, and what he sees hurts him in\n          surprising ways.\n\n          DAVID\n          (embarrassed laugh)\n          Jesus. That's how you see me?\n\n          SOFIA\n          Maybe I didn't add enough money --\n\n          DAVID\n          No. It's wonderful. It's\n          something you'd see on the wall of\n          a steak-house in hell, but it's\n          wonderful. Sign it.\n          Sofia's face falls a bit. She sees she's hurt him. She\n          takes the drawing and signs it, a little guilty.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Let's see yours.\n\n          DAVID\n          No.\n          She grabs it.

I feel bad.\n          (regarding it carefully)\n          You said to draw a caricature.\n\n          DAVID\n          I know. I couldn't.

How much for?\n\n          DAVID\n          One kiss.\n          She smiles. Something is developing between them.\n\n          DAVID\n          That smile is gonna be the end of\n          me.\n\n          SOFIA\n          (serious)\n          And what happens when your friend\n          calls you tomorrow?\n\n          DAVID\n          He only met you a few hours before\n          me. He would do the same.\n\n          SOFIA\n          I see that friendship is important\n          to you.\n\n          DAVID\n          It is. But as his best friend, I\n          also know that he's trying to\n          finish a novel about inadequacy\n          and rejection. So the longer I\n          stay, the better it is for his\n          career.\n          Sofia smiles, shakes her head. And yawns.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Your career is one I'd worry\n          about.\n          David looks down. She's hit a nerve.\n\n          SOFIA\n          I'm sorry -\n\n          DAVID\n          No, no. You're more right then\n          you even know.

Her words strike right to\n          the heart of him.\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n          INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER\n\n          Sofia is asleep on the sofa. Clothes still on.               David\n          gently strokes her hair.    Television in b.g. It's one of\n          those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously\n          compelling. The perfect thing to bond over on a great,\n          lingering date.\n\n          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.\n          And to those who think that you're\n          a charlatan?\n\n          OLDER MAN ON T.V.\n          I understand. The perception of a\n          head frozen somewhere waiting for\n          reanimation - it sounds like\n          science fiction.\n\n          SOFIA\n          What are you watching?\n\n          DAVID\n          It's the greatest show... it's\n          called \"Sofia.\"\n          Sofia looks at him and smiles. They look back to the\n          television.\n\n          ON TV INFOMERCIAL\n          A charming looking older-man discusses eternal life with a\n          television interviewer.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          37\n\n          SOFIA\n          (off t.v.)\n          I've seen this thirty times.\n\n          DAVID\n          We did a story on this guy. He\n          owns half of Arizona.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Is he a fraud?\n\n          DAVID\n          How would you ever know?\n\n          SOFIA\n          Good point.\n\n          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.\n          Can you unfreeze a human life?\n\n          OLDER MAN ON T.V.\n          Take the case of Benny the dog.\n          Benny is a dog who was frozen for\n          three months, and thawed out to\n          live a normal life.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Oh, well that's comforting. It's\n          safe for Benny. I'm in!\n          David moves closer to her.\n\n          SOFIA\n          We better watch out.\n          They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa.\n          It's true. The promise is too great to not savor it, and\n          walk away for now. Thrill remains in the air.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Where are you going?\n\n          DAVID\n          I left my number on your fridge.\n          He makes a courtly bow and turns. She feels the loss of\n          his company.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Come here, I want to tell you a\n          secret.\n          He pauses a moment, and turns. In this instant, a fleeting\n          instant, it's the oddest thing. He can see their entire\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          38\n          life together. He returns to her. Tentatively, she grabs\n          a quick sweet kiss on his mouth. He stays for an extra\n          moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to\n          the potential of their future. And then... very close she\n          says:\n\n          SOFIA\n          I meant that to be your forehead.\n          David stands. He looks around the small apartment.\n\n          DAVID\n          Thank you for the inspiration. I\n          will now attempt to run my\n          company, showing compassion for\n          the seething throng of my partners\n          who root quietly for me to fail.\n          She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business\n          crossroads. Silently, she roots for him like crazy.\n\n          DAVID\n          For things you don't even know -\n          thank you. I'm going to go to\n          work. I have a company to run.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Pleasure delayer.\n          He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl.\n          He actually wants to run his company.\n\n          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n          David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the\n          alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...\n          because David is a man with a brand new buzz.                The city is\n          his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.\n          Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with\n          its lights still on starts and advances alongside.           Behind\n          the wheel is Julianna Gianni.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          David Aames.\n          David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.\n\n          DAVID\n          Julie Gianni.     You're following\n          me.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          only a little.    I wanted to\n          finish what we were talking about.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          39\n\n          DAVID\n          And _-\n\n          JUL IANNA\n          How'd it work out with our Moth\n          Girl? Did she turn into a\n          butterfly for you?\n\n          DAVID\n          Yes she did.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          But I can see from your walk that\n          you didn't sleep with her.\n          David turns.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Let me see if I can guess. You\n          haven't slept with her because...\n          it's more fun when you can draw it\n          out. Sex just isn't as good if\n          the woman hasn't told all her\n          friends she'd never sleep with\n          you.\n\n          DAVID\n          You're right on the money, Julie.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          She must be exhausted from trying\n          to be witty for you all night\n          long.\n\n          DAVID\n          Hey, Julie.\n\n          JUL IANNA\n          Sorry. You're just never there\n          for your friends until they've\n          already given up on you.\n\n          DAVID\n          I'm not blowing you off! I just\n          want to be alone for a little bit.\n          Trust me - I have a lot of things\n          I gotta take care of. If we're\n          friends, which we are, you'll\n          understand.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          (simple, honest)\n          I'm sorry I got weird. I missed\n          an audition and I just felt bad\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          40\n          you didn't invite me to your\n          party.\n          It zings him.

DANCE STUDIO - DAY\n\n          Sofia dances at the end of a long day. A few others leave\n          for the day, trying not to stare at David. Sofia is there\n          alone. For a moment, we share her solitude. She practices\n          ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking\n          just past camera. She freezes. She catches sight of\n          David, undisguised. And she begins dancing again. Harder.\n          Does she even recognize him? He moves closer, attempting\n          an easy-going persona. We hear nothing but the sound of\n          his heart pounding, in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing.\n          Finally she stops.\n\n          DAVID\n          You won't believe this... but this\n          is me smiling.\n          She laughs a little at his strange new humor, keeps a brave\n          front.\n\n          SOFIA\n          It's been a long time.

BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n          David's mirror is restored. He studies himself. Raises\n          his arm higher than he has been able to. In the next room\n          we hear Conan O'Brien welcoming:\n\n          CONAN (O.S.)\n          . please welcome, Benny the Dog.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          David watches Conan. The Owner of Benny sits with Benny\n          himself. He wears a t-shirt reading: L.E. Benny is not\n          the most excitable dog in town. In fact, he seems rather\n          spacey.\n\n          CONAN (O.S.)\n          I have so many questions. To\n          start off, tell us all just what\n          has happened to Benny. What's\n          Benny been through?\n\n          OLDER MAN/OWNER\n          Benny fell into the water near our\n          home, and was frozen in the\n          Skykomish River.

Riding the buzz of what he's\n          watching, David dials.\n\n          DAVID\n          Hey listen, it's David. I'm back\n          in your life. I saw you earlier\n          tonight. I was just watching our\n          old friend Benny the Dog on... on\n          Conan... and I thought of you.\n          (laughs)\n          Whatever. I loved seeing you\n          today. So I'll see you soon.\n          You're a great dancer!\n          He hangs up and feels instantly mortified. He looks at the\n          phone in his hand.\n\n          TO BLACK\n\n          INT. CLUB - NIGHT\n\n          David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood\n          dance club. He wears a facial prosthetic. In the\n          darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much. He spots Sofia\n          and Brian, chatting, waiting for him. The sight of the two\n          together recalls happier times. Sofia is dressed down.\n          Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better. His\n          clothes are nicer. He wears them with confidence. David\n          has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together.\n          He will be trying too hard, all night long.\n          They regard him in the mask.\n\n          SOFIA\n          (a little too big)\n          Hi!\n\n          BRIAN\n          (equally big)\n          Hey.\n\n          DAVID\n          What are you drinking?\n\n          SOFIA\n          Nothing.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          55\n\n          BRIAN\n          I am in the mood for cheap sugary\n          overpriced rum-and-cokes. You\n          want one?\n\n          DAVID\n          (spreads arms)\n          Is there any other kind?\n\n          BRIAN\n          I'll go get us some         -\n\n          SOFIA\n          Where's the bathroom?\n\n          BRIAN\n          Behind... over by the place next\n          to the door by the chick... I\n          mean, girl who looks like Bjork.\n          She leaves. David turns to Brian immediately.\n\n          DAVID\n          You look good, man. How's your\n          book?\n\n          BRIAN\n          Take it off.\n\n          DAVID\n          I can't. It's a facial shield.\n          It's an antiseptic prosthesis to\n          stop infections. These fucking\n          doctors.\n\n          BRIAN\n          (with all love)\n          Take off the mask! It's freaking\n          me out.\n\n          DAVID\n          I can't. It's my face. This is\n          my face.\n\n          BRIAN\n          Oh no. Trust me. It's a little\n          different.\n\n          DAVID\n          Hey, if you're embarrassed, just\n          go. Nobody asked you to chaperone\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          56\n\n          BRIAN\n          Sofia asked me.\n\n          DAVID\n          She didn't want to be alone with\n          me?\n          (Brian regrets his words)\n          That's bullshit. Because I think\n          I'm being pretty fucking cool\n          about the whole thing.\n\n          BRIAN\n          Talk to a shrink!        Or you can\n          call me sometime, instead of\n          hiding in your apartment. Don't\n          take it out on a girl you only met\n          once.\n\n          DAVID\n          (stung)\n          Did she say that? I met her\n          \"once?\" Did she say I met her\n          \"once?\"\n          Brian looks away. He's said too much.\n\n          BRIAN\n          Cut it out. I miss the old you.\n          We all miss the old you. Because\n          the new guy is shit.\n          David turns away. The perfectly wrong thing to say.\n\n          BRIAN\n          Oh. Man. Wait. That came out\n          wrong. I love you - period.\n          How's your arm, man?\n          David shakes his head, moves toward the bar.\n\n          DAVID\n          Fuck you, Brian. How about no\n          more sympathy? How about if\n          that's the deal we make with each\n          other? Okay?\n          David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his\n          mask. His head thuds from a migraine.\n\n          DAVID\n          Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of\n          tequila.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          57\n\n          BARMAN\n          (avoiding eye contact)\n          What kind of tequila?\n\n          DAVID\n          What did you say to me?\n\n          BARMAN\n          (leans closer, still\n          looking down)\n          I said - What. Kind. Of.\n          Tequila.\n\n          DAVID\n          Why don't you ask me to my face,\n          bitch?\n          The barman looks up, expressionless.\n\n          DAVID\n          Patron. If you have it.\n\n          ON DAVID - LATER\n          watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as\n          friends.\n\n          DAVID\n          Another shot, another Bud.\n          He throws bills on the bar.\n\n          BARMAN\n          No. This is on the house.\n\n          DAVID\n          Why -\n\n          BARMAN\n          (odd compassion)\n          It just is. Bitch.\n          David looks across the club to see Sofia. A Clubgoer Guy\n          whispers something in her ear. She shakes it off. He\n          pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the\n          Barman.\n\n          DAVID\n          Patron!\n          David regards a video monitor behind the bar. Someone's\n          camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another\n          good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good-\n          looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          58\n          over lo those many nights ago at her apartment. He pounds\n          back another drink.\n\n          INT. CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Weaving at the urinal, David pees. Squeezes his temples to\n          ward off a headache.\n\n          CLUBGOER # 1\n          Dude, fix your face!!\n          The Clubgoers laugh. David laughs too. Suddenly, he feels\n          better.\n\n          INT. CLUB         - NIGHT\n\n          David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of\n          belonging. The music swirls, and takes him along with it.\n          He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is\n          anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes\n          the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In\n          profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David\n          sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the\n          club. He approaches her.\n\n          DAVID\n          Hello again.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Hello again.\n\n          DAVID\n          Idea.

Unless\n          I'm horning in here -\n          (beat, does her)\n          You are. But the food is good.\n          He continues, taking a step.\n\n          DAVID\n          See, I've got a little problem.\n          I've got a stalker.\n          (does her)\n          It doesn't sound life-threatening.\n          (does himself, self-\n          deprecating)\n          I need a cover.

She is overwhelmed, holding\n          it in. David continues.\n\n          DAVID\n          I think she' s the saddest girl to\n          ever hold a martini.\n\n          SOFIA\n          (about to burst)\n          David --\n\n          DAVID\n          Are you okay?\n\n          SOFIA\n          No.\n\n          DAVID\n          What's wrong?

Hurry.\n          Let's move through this.\n\n          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DUSK\n\n          There is tension in the air. David's face is covered in\n          high-tech facial plates. He sits at a table near the\n          window. Sofia stands.\n\n          SOFIA\n          You've got to take the plates off,\n          David.\n\n          DAVID\n          I don't want to know what's under\n          here.\n\n          SOFIA\n          It's going to be fine, you'll see.\n\n          DAVID\n          I already called Pomeranz and\n          switched it to Wednesday.\n\n          SOFIA\n          I hope that shrew at the front\n          desk gave you shit about it.\n\n          DAVID\n          I'll go in the morning. The\n          car'll be fixed.\n          She advances, takes his face in her hands. She tugs at the\n          corner of one of the plates.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          71\n\n          SOFIA\n          Good, because I know that the\n          problem wouldn't be you delaying\n          something you were dreading.\n\n          DAVID\n          Couldn't be that.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Nooooo, it couldn't be that.\n          She pulls off one of the plates.\n\n          SOFIA\n          I mean, I agree, it's very\n          important to have...\n          She pulls off another one of the plates. She grows a bit\n          emotional.\n\n          SOFIA\n          . the right car...\n          She pulls off another one of the plates. Tearing slightly.\n\n          SOFIA\n          . to take you where you want to\n          go...  24   hours a day...\n          Quadrant by quadrant, his face is restored to a pale-\n          skinned and tender... perfection.\n\n          DAVID\n          How bad is it?\n\n          SOFIA\n          Well, your ears are in the right\n          place. And the rest of it is...\n          not too bad at all.\n          Tenderly she kisses, and hugs him.\n\n          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- DUSK\n\n          Sofia and David make love, looking into each other's eyes.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Do you love me? I mean, really\n          love me... because if you don't,\n          I'll just... have to kill you.\n\n          DAVID\n          In my next life I want to come\n          back as this mole -\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          72\n          (points out mole between\n          her breasts)\n          - seriously, this mole. I mean,\n          you'll have to wear bikini tops to\n          work, or loose-fitting shirts so I\n          can breathe, but -\n\n          SOFIA\n          I love you. I love you. I love\n          you.\n\n          DAVID\n          - I could live right there.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Is this a dream?\n\n          DAVID\n          Oh absolutely.\n          She grabs his face, kisses him... a powerful moment, like\n          few others in this life.\n\n          EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY\n\n          Portrait of the couple together, moving down the middle of\n          the street on fresh snow.\n\n          DAVID  (V.0.)\n          We talked about the big things,\n          the little things, and the big\n          things. But in truth, with Sofia,\n          it was the in-between times.\n\n          INT. FLORENTINE'S BAR AND GRILL - DAY\n\n          Sofia laughs. A perfect laugh. David admires her, sits\n          next to her, holding her hand. Theirs is the unmistakable\n          closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual\n          relationship. They share a giddy open secret. Across the\n          table, we reveal Brian. He's got a tiny high-tech camera.\n          Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish.\n          David replies knowingly - \"si\"           - every few words. It's a\n          deep communication. She exits.\n\n          BRIAN\n          What, did she say?\n\n          DAVID\n          (in love)\n          I have no idea.\n          Brian shakes his head.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          73\n\n          DAVID\n          How's things, Brian?\n\n          BRIAN\n          Fine.\n          David's face is huge in the Brian's viewfinder.\n\n          DAVID\n          How's things, Brian?\n\n          BRIAN\n          Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.\n          Besides - Sofia is great, but by\n          no means one-of--a-kind. She was a\n          proximity infatuation.\n          Brian, naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous,             spots  a\n          writer at a nearby table making notes.\n\n          BRIAN\n          (to writer)\n          And don't use that, it's mine.\n          The writer looks busted.\n\n          DAVID\n          Where'd you get the camera?\n\n          BRIAN\n          I'm into things... you have no\n          idea.\n\n          DAVID\n          Well, as long as you're okay.\n\n          BRIAN\n          And anyway, we're friends, aren't\n          we?\n\n          DAVID\n          Always.\n          David offers his hand. They shake.\n\n          DAVID'S POV\n          David's gaze moves to a 40 year-old man staring at him with\n          a bemused smile. A plate of food sits in front of him.\n          His eyes suggest a piercing intellect, he looks at David\n          with deep familiarity. David can't quite place the face.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          74\n\n          BRIAN\n          Hey what's up with your face?\n          Fuck, there's a seam opening or\n          something!\n\n          DAVID\n          (mounting horror)\n          What - what are you talking about?\n          Brian laughs. The spell is broken. Friends again.\n\n          DAVID\n          You asshole!\n\n          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n          David sleeps next to Sofia. He sits up, takes a glass of\n          water from the night-stand, admires his girlfriend and\n          moves to the bathroom.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n          He turns on the light, fills the glass with water. Looks\n          up into the restored mirror. His face is disfigured. He\n          recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking\n          to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the\n          lower cabinet.\n          Sofia bolts upright. She sees him on the floor across the\n          room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her\n          arm, screaming.\n\n          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          He awakens suddenly. Sofia is next to him, smiling.\n\n          SOFIA\n          Was I snoring?\n\n          DAVID\n          (still breathing heavily)\n          No, I think it was me. Thirsty,\n          that's all.\n          She kisses his hand reassuringly.\n\n          SOFIA\n          I'm dreaming about you. Mmmmmmm.\n          He gets up and goes to the bathroom.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          75\n\n          INT. BATHROOM\n\n          Tentatively, he flips the light on. A very relieved David\n          regards his restored face. He shuts off the light quickly,\n          and fills the glass of water. Splashes some water on his\n          face.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM\n\n          David climbs back into bed.\n\n          SOFIA\n\n          DAVID\n          (small laugh)\n          I could listen to you say \"mmmmm\"\n          for the rest of my life.\n\n          SOFIA\n          They kiss. The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of\n          her neck. He caresses her body. She kisses his\n          fingertips. Her back to him. Tangled in sheets, they ease\n          into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant\n          for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.\n          His hand stops.   It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns\n          her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of\n          the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling\n          to the floor, the sheet tangled around him. He turns on\n          the light.\n          Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night\n          animal caught in the intrusive glare of day.\n          When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          (scared, uncomprehending)\n          Baby, what's wrong?\n          He gasps for breath, backing away. Totally terrified.\n          Paralyzed. In a low voice:\n\n          DAVID\n          Where. Is. She.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Who?\n          His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he\n          pounces on her with a manic will to survive.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          76\n          Julie Gianni looks a little loopy, almost stoned.\n          Taunting.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          (taunting, sweet)\n          I'm Sofia.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT - MINUTES LATER\n\n          David dismantles the phone, takes the cord. He ties her\n          willing hands to the posts of the bed. She protests oddly,\n          like an actress playing a part.\n\n          DAVID\n          Now I'm going to make sure that I\n          tie this four times. Do you know\n          why, Julie? Because four times\n          really means something.\n          David pulls his pants on, frantically opens the wardrobe\n          closet. No Sofia. Goes to the kitchen. No Sofia. Julie\n          sobs quietly, sweetly, tied to the bed. She behaves and\n          acts like Sofia.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          David, don't hurt me.\n          David returns and sits across from her on the bed,\n          terrified and barely hanging on.\n\n          DAVID\n          Okay, I'm freaked out. It worked.\n          So just tell me right now - where\n          is Sofia?\n\n          JULIANNA\n          I am Sofia.\n\n          DAVID\n          In one minute I'm going to call\n          the police --\n\n          JULIANNA\n          (heart breaking)\n          Don't do it, honey.\n\n          DAVID\n          I knew you'd survived the\n          accident.\n          She looks at him with tearful eyes.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          What. accident?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          77\n\n          DAVID\n          Whose body was it? Who's the one\n          who hired you? The Seven Dwarves?\n\n          JULIANNA\n          I haven't had any accident!\n\n          DAVID\n          No, of course not. It wasn't an\n          accident at all. It was attempted\n          murder!\n\n          JULIANNA\n          Honey, please.\n          He picks up the phone. Dials 911.\n\n          DAVID\n          Police Department? I've captured\n          an intruder who's entered my home.\n          He turns to her. Her eyes are yearning.\n\n          INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          The flash of mug shots. We see David sitting, sweating,\n          agitated waiting in a Police station holding room.\n          Suddenly, the door opens and Thomas Tipp enters, flanked by\n          other Detectives.\n\n          TIPP\n          Guys, can you give us a minute\n          here? Detective Larson...\n          Detective Andrews... thank you.\n          The room empties, and Tipp approaches David.\n\n          DAVID\n          They think that I had something to\n          so with this.\n\n          TIPP\n          I'm going to handle this exactly\n          the way your father would have\n          handled this. I've got it solved.\n\n          DAVID\n          You've got it solved? Where is\n          she?\n\n          TIPP\n          She's going to be fine.\n          David hugs Tipp.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          78\n\n          DAVID\n          Thank God you're here, man. I\n          love her.\n\n          TIPP\n          Yeah... Now, I want you to look\n          at these photos and then I'm going\n          to destroy them. Sofia's\n          testimony is also in here. It\n          won't exist. She's not going to\n          press charges.\n\n          DAVID\n          Press charges against. me?\n\n          TIPP\n          David, wake up. As your friend, I\n          think you should see what you did\n          to Sofia. The press won't get\n          hold of this if you get. away\n          quickly.\n          David leans back in his seat. It's all of them - everybody\n          - against him. Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two\n          computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,\n          moving it into the light so he sees it clearly.              Julie\n          Gianni, battered.\n\n          DAVID\n          This is Julie Gianni. That's not\n          Sofia. This is Julie Gianni. I\n          didn't do that do that to her.\n          (beginning to shut down)\n          Tommy, someone's setting me up.\n\n          TIPP\n          David, the Board and I have taken\n          care of everything. They've been\n          really great, actually. All of\n          this is going to disappear. We're\n          all behind you... even the Board.\n          David looks at Tipp. It's very clear now. He's one of\n          them. David attempts calm.\n\n          TIPP\n          (quiet, helpful)\n          Get out of here.\n          A migraine is thundering in David's head. His world is\n          spinning backwards.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          79\n\n          INT. POLICE STATION -\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 NIGHT\n\n          David strides down the hallway. A Man in a crystal blue\n          sport coat stands, waiting. As David passes, the Man\n          confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable\n          secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child\n          saying: \"Mommy, mommy.\"\n\n          MAN IN BLUE COAT\n          This is a revolution of the mind.\n\n          INT./EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT\n\n          Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian.\n\n          BRIAN\n          You're in fucking sad shape, man.\n          Don't fucking ever hit a girl,\n          man. Hit me, but don't fucking\n          EVER hit a girl.\n          David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on\n          them - pulls Brian out of the station.\n\n          DAVID\n          It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.\n\n          BRIAN\n          Oh... it was Julie Gianni. So,\n          Sofia was abducted by Julie, and\n          now Julie is posing as Sofia.\n\n          DAVID\n          Yes.\n\n          BRIAN\n          You're in O.J. land, man. Julie\n          Gianni is fucking dead!\n\n          DAVID\n          I don't know what the cops have\n          told you, but let me assure you -\n          Julie Gianni is alive alive ALIVE.\n\n          BRIAN\n          I didn't talk to the cops. I\n          talked to Sofia!\n\n          DAVID\n          Where is she?\n\n          BRIAN\n          I just dropped Sofia off. And I\n          saw everything you did to her.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          80\n\n          DAVID\n          Let me tell you something - I did\n          not do that to her. Look me in\n          the eye and tell me that it was\n          the same girl you brought to the\n          party. Tell me it was your dream\n          girl, your \"proximity\n          infatuation.\"\n\n          BRIAN\n          (raw, finally)\n          Yes! And you stole her from me!\n          David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his\n          heart.\n\n          BRIAN\n          The one girl I really wanted, and\n          you took her from me. You're\n          insane. You're losing it, man.\n          David nods powerfully. He now understands. Brian is one\n          of them too.\n\n          DAVID\n          You have revealed yourself.\n\n          BRIAN\n          Oh yeah, I'm with them.\n\n          DAVID\n          Where'd you get the coat, Brian?\n          Where'd you get the camera?

I\n          was your only friend.\n\n          DAVID\n          You have revealed yourself to me.\n\n          INT. FLORENTINE'S - NIGHT\n\n          David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily. He's been\n          crying. His head aches with this thought - maybe I am\n          insane. A man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting\n          himself to sit at the table. His bedside manner is\n          impeccable. His smile offers infinite compassion. He was\n          the man staring at. him in this same restaurant.

SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK\n\n          The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear\n          the front door kicked in. David enters, slamming the door\n          behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such\n          happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now\n          horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the\n          refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact\n          expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier\n          visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.\n          He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the\n          drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He\n          rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment\n          until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...\n          Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends\n          down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her\n          hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.\n          Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around\n          sweetness of Sofia.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          I thought you were a vandal.\n\n          DAVID\n          (with difficulty)\n          Who... are... you?\n\n          JULIANNA\n          I'm Sofia.\n\n          DAVID\n          You are not Sofia... you're not\n          Sofia...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          85\n\n          JULIANNA\n          I'm Sofia.\n\n          DAVID\n          Whatever.\n          Julie starts to cry. Battling tears, she offers her heart\n          and soul.\n\n          JULIANNA\n          David, honey. This will all be\n          over soon. We'll be together\n          again. You'll forget Julianna and\n          I won't be afraid of you. Let me\n          get you a cold towel.\n          She exits. He struggles to rise. His head is a swirling\n          mess. And then:\n\n          ON KITCHEN DOORWAY\n          Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.\n          David advances, and faints into her arms.\n\n          DAVID\n          Sofia?\n\n          SOFIA\n          (whispers)\n          Yes, David, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia.\n          He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her.\n          They kiss, gently, then more powerfully.\n\n          INT. SOFIA'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n          They make love, emotionally and deeply. Two bodies\n          yearning to possess the other. Camera moves across their\n          bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move\n          continues onto her back.\n\n          DAVID\n          Where were you...\n          Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment.\n\n          DAVID\n          I don't want to know.\n          (thrusting)\n          Just tell me you love me.\n          David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'. He doesn't\n          want to look. The passion gives way to a mounting dread,\n          as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          86\n\n          JULIANNA (O.S.)\n          I love you. I'm afraid of how\n          powerful this is.\n          He continues moving passionately, harder now. Julie\n          responds to the overwhelming surge within David. She gives\n          over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a\n          rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and\n          pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his\n          own.\n          Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.\n          This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking\n          it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.\n\n          DAVID\n          What the fuck is happening?\n          Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an\n          advanced lovemaking session.\n\n          DAVID\n          I want to see your face!\n          She grabs at the pillow.\n\n          DAVID\n          I want to see your face!\n          David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.\n          Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He\n          loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent\n          attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut\n          it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her\n          hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.\n          She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a\n          whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's\n          confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want\n          to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.\n          He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With\n          true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand\n          will reveal who he's just killed.\n\n          ON HER TORSO\n          as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-\n          inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top\n          of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,\n          and then... there it is. The mole between her breasts.\n\n          INT. HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY\n\n          David exits hurriedly, past some tenants, down the stairs.\n          He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          87\n          He looks horribly disfigured.

Your feeling\n          of responsibility or guilt over\n          Julie might have easily turned\n          Sofia into Julie.\n          (pause)\n          Do you know what derangement is?\n\n          DAVID\n          I need your help.\n\n          MCCABE\n          All I know is, you killed your\n          girlfriend and I don't know what's\n          in your mind.\n\n          DAVID\n          I need your help.\n\n          MCCABE\n          I'd work on this case forever if I\n          could, but we've run out of time.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          88\n\n          DAVID\n          What will you plead?\n\n          MCCABE\n          Temporary derangement.

You've become like family to\n          me. I don't want to give up on\n          you.\n          David looks at, him oddly. Suddenly, the archetype seems\n          very familiar. McCabe continues with the noble concern of\n          a towering father figure.\n\n          MCCABE\n          (continued)\n          But I needed more. I needed an\n          answer. I...

Slowly, always looking at\n          David, he settles into the truth of his very being.

He arrives at the edge,\n          looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping\n          himself at the precipice.\n          He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out\n          into the celestial future. For a fraction of a moment, he\n          is suspended in mid-air.
