It is as if the world's biggest parade has just\n          left, taking everybody with it. David pulls over\n          haphazardly. He exits the car, leaving it in the middle of\n          the street. He begins to walk, faster now, as music rises.\n          All the electricity is on. There is absolutely nobody in\n          sight. David begins to run, searching for humanity. The\n          billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions\n          to his loneliness.

He makes a relieved agonized sound into the\n          pillow. Gets up, sees a pizza box... a container of\n          soup... a remote control on the floor. We hear an incisive\n          voice with a comforting lilt - a man we'll meet later.\n\n<b>          A MAN'S VOICE\n</b>          Well, I suppose the empty street\n          meant loneliness.\n\n<b>          DAVID'S VOICE\n</b>          You're a shrink.

He fires up a knock-around beater car from\n          his collection. He drives into the street which is,\n          comfortingly, now full of people.

He grabs a look at her in the other room. A bit of\n          leg between boot and skirt.  As he admires the dolls:\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          So you're really a dancer, huh?\n\n<b>          SOFIA\n</b>          For     14     years.

He\n          recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking\n          to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the\n          lower cabinet.\n          Sofia bolts upright. She sees him on the floor across the\n          room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her\n          arm, screaming.\n\n<b>          INT.

The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of\n          her neck. He caresses her body. She kisses his\n          fingertips. Her back to him. Tangled in sheets, they ease\n          into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant\n          for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.\n          His hand stops.   It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns\n          her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of\n          the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling\n          to the floor, the sheet tangled around him. He turns on\n          the light.\n          Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night\n          animal caught in the intrusive glare of day.\n          When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent.\n\n<b>          JULIANNA\n</b>          (scared, uncomprehending)\n          Baby, what's wrong?\n          He gasps for breath, backing away.

Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two\n          computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,\n          moving it into the light so he sees it clearly.              Julie\n          Gianni, battered.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          This is Julie Gianni. That's not\n          Sofia. This is Julie Gianni.

As David passes, the Man\n          confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable\n          secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child\n          saying: \"Mommy, mommy.\"\n\n<b>          MAN IN BLUE COAT\n</b>          This is a revolution of the mind.\n\n<b>          INT./EXT.

David enters, slamming the door\n          behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such\n          happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now\n          horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the\n          refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact\n          expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier\n          visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.\n          He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the\n          drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He\n          rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment\n          until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...\n          Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends\n          down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her\n          hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.\n          Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around\n          sweetness of Sofia.\n\n<b>          JULIANNA\n</b>          I thought you were a vandal.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          (with difficulty)\n          Who... are... you?\n\n<b>          JULIANNA\n</b>          I'm Sofia.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          You are not Sofia... you're not\n          Sofia...\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          85\n</b>\n<b>          JULIANNA\n</b>          I'm Sofia.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          Whatever.\n          Julie starts to cry.

And then:\n\n<b>          ON KITCHEN DOORWAY\n</b>          Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.\n          David advances, and faints into her arms.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          Sofia?\n\n<b>          SOFIA\n</b>          (whispers)\n          Yes, David, I'm Sofia.

She gives\n          over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a\n          rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and\n          pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his\n          own.\n          Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.\n          This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking\n          it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          What the fuck is happening?\n          Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an\n          advanced lovemaking session.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          I want to see your face!\n          She grabs at the pillow.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          I want to see your face!\n          David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.\n          Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He\n          loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent\n          attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut\n          it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her\n          hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.\n          She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a\n          whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's\n          confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want\n          to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.\n          He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With\n          true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand\n          will reveal who he's just killed.\n\n<b>          ON HER TORSO\n</b>          as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-\n          inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top\n          of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,\n          and then... there it is.

He moves to her.\n          She touches his cheek. His face is restored. They\n          embrace.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          Look at us. I'm frozen, and\n          you're dead. And I love you.\n\n<b>          SOFIA\n</b>          It's a problem.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          I lost you when I got in that car.\n          I'm sorry.\n          She looks at him, beguiling and understanding.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          But remember what you told me\n          once? Every passing minute is\n          another chance to turn it all\n          around.\n          She kisses him.\n\n<b>          SOFIA\n</b>          I'll find you again.\n          She regards her lost love, taking him in.

He arrives at the edge,\n          looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping\n          himself at the precipice.\n          He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out\n          into the celestial future. For a fraction of a moment, he\n          is suspended in mid-air. And he hurtles to the ground.\n          And the ground hurtles to meet him.\n\n<b>          SERIES OF IMAGES\n</b>          It is the little things, the random poetic instances of\n          David Aames' life that come back to him. Music rises as he\n          realizes, finally, his own true poetry and humanity. The\n          images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his\n          heartbeat. Father. Mother. A casual glance of a\n          stranger. All combine to give his life meaning. And then,\n          finally, we see the face of the one person who gave him\n          purpose in this life... and the next. Sofia.\n\n<b>          TO WHITE:\n</b>          The sound of a breath.
