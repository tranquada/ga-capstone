Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie \n               grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed \n               crowd.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIE\n</b>                         They tried to ruin me. But they are \n                         ruined. They tried to ruin me because \n                         they did not like what I have done. \n                         Do you like what I have done?\n\n               Loud applause, and cries of \"yes.\"\n\n<b>                                     WILLIE\n</b>                         Remember, it's not I who have won, \n                         but you. Your will is my strength, \n                         and your need is my justice, and I \n                         shall live in your right and your \n                         will. And if any man tries to stop \n                         me from fulfilling that right and \n                         that will, I'll break him. I'll break \n                         him with my bare hands. For I have \n                         the strength of many.\n\n               Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack \n               and comes down the steps to greet him.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIE\n</b>                         Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're \n                         here. I knew you'd come back.\n\n               He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. \n               They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees \n               someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIE\n</b>                         Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see \n                         you.\n\n               Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before \n               Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. \n               Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol \n               and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, \n               shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and \n               point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, \n               forcing them back.\n\n<b>                                     COP\n</b>                         Stand back, everybody. Stand back.\n\n               Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie.

She looks at Adam for a moment, then \n               turns away.\n\n<b>                                     JACK\n</b>                         Anne, Anne...
