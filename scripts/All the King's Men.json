He grew \n                         up on the dirt roads and gully washes \n                         of a farm.

He figured if he was going to \n                         get anything done, he had to do it \n                         himself. So he sat up nights and \n                         studied books. He studied law because \n                         he thought he might be able to change \n                         things some... for himself, and for \n                         folks like him.\n\n               Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's \n               speech.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         No, I'm not going to lie to you. He \n                         didn't start off thinking about the \n                         hicks and all the wonderful things \n                         he was going to do for them. No. No, \n                         he started off thinking of number \n                         one. But something came to him on \n                         the way. How he could do nothing for \n                         himself without the help of the \n                         people. That's what came to him.

You do too. It's a matter \n                         of method. Many times out of evil \n                         comes good.

The first thing \n                         he did was to take over the newspapers \n                         and the radio stations. Why be so \n                         afraid of criticism? If Stark is \n                         interested in doing good, he should \n                         also be interested in the truth. I \n                         don't see how you can separate the \n                         two.

From a large platform, loaded with people, \n               comes the chant \"We want Willie, we want Willie.\" Jack pushes \n               his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing \n               guard on the Capitol steps.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Where do you think you're going?\n                              (recognizes Jack)\n                         Oh, I'm sorry.

A voice from a public \n               address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd.\n\n                                     LOUDSPEAKER\n                         All right now.

Even that crowd outside, \n                         yelling on cue, is part of that \n                         pressure.\n\n                                     CROWD NOISE\n                         We want Willie.

The crowd suddenly \n               goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the \n               growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises \n               his hands to wave to the crowd.\n\n               We see various shots of people straining to get a little \n               closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then \n               turns and goes back into the room.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               Exterior: State Capitol, Day\n\n               The crowd again, still waiting. The camera pans upward to a \n               loudspeaker.\n\n                                     ANNOUNCER\n                         Attention, please.

If you want Willie Stark to \n                         win, stay where you are.\n\n               They cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's \n               reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol \n               Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE -- \n               GOVERNOR STARK.\n\n                                     ANNOUNCER\n                         Do you hear me... stay where you \n                         are.

The crowd, every \n               bit as large, is quiet but expectant. Everyone holds still \n               as the announcer's voice is heard again.\n\n                                     ANNOUNCER\n                         Attention, please.

This is the result: \n                         Willie Stark has won.\n\n               The crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers. \n               Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera \n               picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through.\n\n               Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all. \n               Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by \n               Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie \n               grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed \n               crowd.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         They tried to ruin me. But they are \n                         ruined. They tried to ruin me because \n                         they did not like what I have done. \n                         Do you like what I have done?\n\n               Loud applause, and cries of \"yes.\"\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Remember, it's not I who have won, \n                         but you. Your will is my strength, \n                         and your need is my justice, and I \n                         shall live in your right and your \n                         will. And if any man tries to stop \n                         me from fulfilling that right and \n                         that will, I'll break him. I'll break \n                         him with my bare hands. For I have \n                         the strength of many.\n\n               Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack \n               and comes down the steps to greet him.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're \n                         here. I knew you'd come back.\n\n               He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. \n               They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees \n               someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see \n                         you.\n\n               Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before \n               Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. \n               Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol \n               and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, \n               shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and \n               point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, \n               forcing them back.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Stand back, everybody. Stand back.\n\n               Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar, \n               looking down on him.\n\n                                     SUGAR BOY\n                              (nearly crying)\n                         D-does it hurt m-much, boss?

She looks at Adam for a moment, then \n               turns away.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Anne, Anne...
