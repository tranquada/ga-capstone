TRAIN CAR - DAY                                          1\n</b>\n    A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The\n    boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard\n    tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This\n    is Claude.\n\n    We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle,\n    balances it in one hand as he opens the door.\n\n    The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.\n\n    He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits\n    while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above\n    the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration\n    alternating between the food and the path.\n\n    He sits next to a brunette woman.   He hands her a hot dog.\n\n<b>                           CLAUDE\n</b>              Here.\n\n    He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black\n    circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly\n    blushes and mumbles:\n\n<b>                           CLAUDE\n</b>              Sorry.\n\n    He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next\n    to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder\n    length hair. Her name is Margot.\n\n<b>                        MARGOT\n</b>              That was quick.\n\n<b>                        CLAUDE\n</b>              I sat next to the wrong person.\n\n<b>                         MARGOT\n</b>              Really?

Claude\n    listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up,\n    and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes\n    between cars.\n\n    The train roars and screeches. Claude screams.   He stops,\n    looks around. He screams again.\n\n<b>3   CUT TO:                                                       3\n</b>\n    Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a\n    river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.\n\n    Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant.\n    Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger\n    against the glass and traces the wires.\n\n<b>                        CLAUDE\n</b>              Will the wedding be crowded?\n\n<b>                        MARGOT\n</b>              I don't know.

FERRY DOCK - DAY                                           4\n</b>\n    A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs,\n    clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun\n    hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his\n    shoulder.\n\n<b>5   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                5\n</b>\n    The rumbling and sputtering of the boat.    People get out of\n    their cars and stretch their legs.\n\n    Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his\n    face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She\n    stuffs the phone in her pocket.\n\n<b>                        MARGOT\n</b>              Why aren't you wearing your new\n              shades?\n\n<b>                        CLAUDE\n</b>              I don't think I need them right\n              now.\n\n<b>                        MARGOT\n</b>              You begged for those glasses.\n\n<b>                        CLAUDE\n</b>              I know, but...I will wear them, I\n              just feel like people might think\n              it's weird that a kid is wearing\n              dark shades.\n<b>                        MARGOT\n</b>              That's ridiculous.\n    Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk\n    sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self-\n    consciously.\n<b>                        MARGOT\n</b>              You look very cool.\n    He takes them off.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                             4.\n</b>\n\n<b>                        CLAUDE\n</b>              I don't need them right now.\n\n<b>6   CUT TO:                                                       6\n</b>\n    Margot and Claude wait.   The ferry has emptied out.\n\n<b>                        CLAUDE\n</b>              Do they know we're here?\n\n    A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops\n    across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the\n    backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down\n    the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and\n    sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.\n\n<b>                        MALCOLM\n</b>              Are you...?\n\n<b>7   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                              7\n</b>\n    Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is\n    in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl,\n    Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind.\n    Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a\n    panda on it.\n\n<b>                        MALCOLM\n</b>              Paul apologizes for not coming,\n              she's still getting the house\n              ready.\n\n<b>                        MARGOT\n</b>              I'm sorry it was such short notice.\n\n<b>                        MALCOLM\n</b>              I don't care.

The Volvo is parked in a driveway\n    alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water.\n    They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them.\n\n    Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her\n    sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot\n    smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips\n    down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.\n\n<b>                        PAULINE\n</b>              You're so handsome.\n\n    Now she hugs Margot.    They both tear up.

A\n    large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped\n    into their yard. There's whispering and movement through\n    brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with\n    concern.\n<b>                        PAULINE\n</b>              You're arriving in the midst of a\n              drama.

A door\n    opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto\n    another bedroom.\n\n    Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a\n    realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.\n<b>                        INGRID\n</b>              This is my room.\n<b>                         CLAUDE\n</b>              Okay.\n<b>                        INGRID\n</b>              Do you like showers or baths?\n\n<b>                         CLAUDE\n</b>              Showers.
