TRAIN CAR - DAY                                          1\n\n    A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The\n    boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard\n    tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This\n    is Claude.\n\n    We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle,\n    balances it in one hand as he opens the door.\n\n    The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.\n\n    He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits\n    while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above\n    the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration\n    alternating between the food and the path.\n\n    He sits next to a brunette woman.   He hands her a hot dog.\n\n                           CLAUDE\n              Here.\n\n    He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black\n    circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly\n    blushes and mumbles:\n\n                           CLAUDE\n              Sorry.\n\n    He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next\n    to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder\n    length hair. Her name is Margot.\n\n                        MARGOT\n              That was quick.\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              I sat next to the wrong person.\n\n                         MARGOT\n              Really?   Where?\n    She stretches up and peers over the seats.   He grabs her\n    shirt.\n                        CLAUDE\n              Please don't look.    She'll see you.\n                        MARGOT\n              Careful with my blouse.\n\n                                                             2.\n\n\n2   CUT TO:                                                       2\n\n    Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude\n    listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up,\n    and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes\n    between cars.\n\n    The train roars and screeches. Claude screams.   He stops,\n    looks around. He screams again.\n\n3   CUT TO:                                                       3\n\n    Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a\n    river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.\n\n    Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant.\n    Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger\n    against the glass and traces the wires.\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              Will the wedding be crowded?\n\n                        MARGOT\n              I don't know. I think she doesn't\n              know anyone anymore.\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              How long has she known Malcolm?\n\n                        MARGOT\n              Only a year.\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              Is that short?\n\n                        MARGOT\n                  (pointedly)\n              Would you marry someone you'd only\n              known a year?\n                        CLAUDE\n              I'm not going to ever get married.\n                        MARGOT\n              I can't say I have a lot of hope\n              for the whole thing.\n                        CLAUDE\n              Why are we going then?\n\n                        MARGOT\n              We're supporting her.\n\n                                                               3.\n\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              I thought she wasn't speaking to\n              you.\n\n                        MARGOT\n              No...no...I wasn't speaking to her,\n              but I'm over it.\n\n4   EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY                                           4\n\n    A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs,\n    clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun\n    hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his\n    shoulder.\n\n5   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                5\n\n    The rumbling and sputtering of the boat.    People get out of\n    their cars and stretch their legs.\n\n    Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his\n    face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She\n    stuffs the phone in her pocket.\n\n                        MARGOT\n              Why aren't you wearing your new\n              shades?\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              I don't think I need them right\n              now.\n\n                        MARGOT\n              You begged for those glasses.\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              I know, but...I will wear them, I\n              just feel like people might think\n              it's weird that a kid is wearing\n              dark shades.\n                        MARGOT\n              That's ridiculous.\n    Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk\n    sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self-\n    consciously.\n                        MARGOT\n              You look very cool.\n    He takes them off.\n\n                                                             4.\n\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              I don't need them right now.\n\n6   CUT TO:                                                       6\n\n    Margot and Claude wait.   The ferry has emptied out.\n\n                        CLAUDE\n              Do they know we're here?\n\n    A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops\n    across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the\n    backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down\n    the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and\n    sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.\n\n                        MALCOLM\n              Are you...?\n\n7   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                              7\n\n    Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is\n    in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl,\n    Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind.\n    Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a\n    panda on it.\n\n                        MALCOLM\n              Paul apologizes for not coming,\n              she's still getting the house\n              ready.\n\n                        MARGOT\n              I'm sorry it was such short notice.\n\n                        MALCOLM\n              I don't care. Paul's frantic, but\n              I don't give a shit. Oh, and\n              Ingrid wants me to tell you that\n              she made us all bracelets.\n                        INGRID\n                  (embarrassed)\n              No, I wanted...I wanted to wait...\n                        MALCOLM\n              Oh, I thought you asked me to tell\n              them. Anyway...\n\n    Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange\n    bracelet.\n\n                                                           5.\n\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I got Knicks colors.\n\n                    INGRID\n          They're not Knicks colors!\n\n                    MARGOT\n          It's beautiful, Ingrid.\n\n                    INGRID\n              (to Claude)\n          I made this one for myself.\n\nShe shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.\n\n                    INGRID\n          Yours is yellow. Is that okay?\n\n                          CLAUDE\n          I guess.\n\n                    INGRID\n          Where's your dad and Josh?\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          They might come later.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Josh's spring break is next week.\n          Jim teaches through Friday and then\n          they open the house in Vermont on\n          the weekend.\n\n                    MALCOLM\n              (bluntly)\n          It means a lot to Pauline that\n          you're here.\n\nMargot nods awkwardly -- she blushes.\n                          MARGOT\n          Oh.     Good.\nA car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near\ntheir car. Malcolm swerves anyway.\n                    MALCOLM\n          Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!\nIngrid giggles.    Margot clutches the handle above the door.\n\n                                                                 6.\n\n\n                        MALCOLM\n              If you're wondering about the\n              moustache --\n\n                        MARGOT\n              No, I wasn't.\n\n                        MALCOLM\n              I had a full beard   for a while and\n              then when I shaved   it I left this\n              part for last, you   know to see how\n              it looked, and...    It's meant to be\n              funny.\n\n    Margot nods politely.   The sound of tires on gravel:\n\n8   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  8\n\n    The trunk slams shut. The Volvo is parked in a driveway\n    alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water.\n    They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them.\n\n    Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her\n    sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot\n    smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips\n    down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.\n\n                        PAULINE\n              You're so handsome.\n\n    Now she hugs Margot.    They both tear up.   Claude beams.\n\n                        PAULINE\n              I never thought I'd get you here.\n\n    A loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A\n    large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped\n    into their yard. There's whispering and movement through\n    brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with\n    concern.\n                        PAULINE\n              You're arriving in the midst of a\n              drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is\n              inside.\n    Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans.\n                        INGRID\n              It's the Voglers.\n\n                                                                7.\n\n\n                        PAULINE\n              The neighbors want us to cut down\n              our tree.\n\n    She indicates a large oak that extends up and into the\n    adjoining property.\n\n                        MARGOT\n              No, that's our tree!\n\n                        INGRID\n              They think it's sick and rotting\n              their property.\n\n                        PAULINE\n              We're having the ceremony under it.\n\n                        MARGOT\n              You took the swing down.\n\n                        MALCOLM\n              Pauline thinks this is their way of\n              trying to be friends. I think they\n              resent us because we're...\n\n    He searches for the word, but can't come up with anything.\n    He says wearily:\n\n                        MALCOLM\n              I don't know what we are.\n\n9   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM/INGRID'S ROOM - DAY                     9\n\n    Claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his\n    wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door\n    opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto\n    another bedroom.\n\n    Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a\n    realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.\n                        INGRID\n              This is my room.\n                         CLAUDE\n              Okay.\n                        INGRID\n              Do you like showers or baths?\n\n                         CLAUDE\n              Showers.   What about you?\n\n                                                                8.\n\n\n     Ingrid shrugs.   She says, already bored with the topic:\n\n                         INGRID\n               I don't care.\n\n10   INT. STAIRWELL/MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    10\n\n     Pauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now\n     wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one\n     another.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Is Malcolm what you thought he'd\n               be?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Well, I didn't know what to --\n\n                         PAULINE\n               The moustache is temporary. He\n               left it for last when he was\n               shaving. It's meant to be funny.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               He told me.\n\n                          PAULINE\n               Yeah...\n\n     They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the\n     curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               I'm sorry -- with so little time to\n               prepare, we had to put you in\n               Malcolm's storage room --\n\n                         MARGOT\n               This was Becky's room.   Poor Becky.\n                         PAULINE\n               Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a\n               storage room. I've just started to\n               feel like it's our house not my\n               parents. You know?\n                         MARGOT\n               Our parents.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Of course. It might still smell\n               like paint, but...\n\n                                                           9.\n\n\n                     MARGOT\n           I thought he was a musician.\n\nPauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to\nunpack and hang up clothes in the closet.\n\n                     PAULINE\n           Well, music's officially a hobby...\n           He's painting now. And writing\n           letters to newspapers and\n           magazines. He's very meticulous,\n           he'll spend up to a week writing a\n           response to a music review. He's\n           incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.\n           I don't know. We're doing very\n           well.\n\n                       MARGOT\n           Good.

She\n     whispers:\n                         MARGOT\n               Are you asleep?\n\n                            CLAUDE\n                      (softly)\n               Yes.\n\n                                                       18.\n\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Will you remember this?\n\n                       CLAUDE\n          Yes.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          I just talked to your dad...\n\nClaude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          I'm only going to tell you if you\n          won't remember.\n\n                       CLAUDE\n          Okay.\n\nMargot hesitates.    She changes her mind and says\nthoughtfully:\n\n                     MARGOT\n          Everyone finds you so funny and\n          charming. I always get compliments\n          about you.\n\nMargot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and\nsmears some eye make-up off of her face.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Are you having fun?    Is it nice to\n          see Pauline?\n\n                    CLAUDE\n              (opens his eyes)\n          Yeah, I really like her.\n\n                       MARGOT\n          Yeah.     She is crazy though.\n                    CLAUDE\n          In what way?\n                    MARGOT\n          She's really berserk. Maybe it's\n          hormones. You don't notice\n          anything different about Pauline?\n                       CLAUDE\n          No.\n\n                                                             19.\n\n\n                         MARGOT\n               She's pregnant -- she told me. But\n               she's keeping it a secret -- I mean\n               from Malcolm and even Ingrid.\n               Which I think is unforgiveable.\n               Now she'll have to marry him.\n               What's she planning -- to get\n               married and not drink champagne?\n               Then she'll just be lying. I guess\n               she's afraid she'll miscarry. She\n               probably will. I think on some\n               level she's ambivalent about the\n               marriage and that's why she's not\n               telling him.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Are you stoned, Mom?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Maybe a little.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               I don't like it.\n\n16   INT. MALCOLM AND PAULINE'S ROOM - NIGHT                     16\n\n     Water runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of\n     whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.\n\n                         MALCOLM\n                   (shakes his head)\n               My scrotum is longer than my penis.\n\n     He turns around and looks at his ass.

Do people\n          have to be all one thing?\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I guess not.\n\n                     PAULINE\n          Well, okay...\n              (back into it)\n          It is nice she came for the\n          wedding. She's so pretty, don't\n          you think?\n\n                    MALCOLM\n              (warily)\n          She's attractive.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          A little thin maybe...

MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - SAME                                17\n\n     Margot lies on her front, her hand underneath her. She tries\n     to masturbate. The bed creaks. Finally, she flips over and\n     gives up. She wears a rubber night-guard in her mouth.\n\n18   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                               18\n\n     A croquet game in progress. Pauline and Malcolm play Margot\n     and Claude. Ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself.\n     The dog next to her. Malcolm concentrates -- he carefully\n     lines up his shot. Finally, he swings --\n\n     The ball misses the wicket.    He shakes with frustration.\n\n                          MALCOLM\n               Fuck it!\n\n     Claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the\n     neighbor's yard: A naked man, 40's, crouches. Arms extend\n     from below and pull him downward. His ass pokes up over the\n     weeds.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Honey, you're up.\n\n     Claude shakes out of his reverie. He walks briskly up to his\n     ball and smacks it. It bullets forward and lands just short\n     of Pauline's ball.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Claude, don't just whack it.    Think\n               about it before you hit.\n\n                          CLAUDE\n               Sorry.\n\n     Pauline knocks her ball into Claude's. She holds her ball\n     down with her foot and prepares to swing.\n                         MALCOLM\n               Paul, what are you doing?\n                         PAULINE\n               I'm sending Claude's ball into the\n               bushes.\n                         MALCOLM\n               Take the extra hit.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               I don't want to do that.\n\n                                                         22.\n\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          It's the smarter play.\n\nShe whacks -- Claude's ball travels about two feet.\n\n                       PAULINE\n          Shit.\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          Pauline! See, I knew you\n          couldn't... Your feet are too\n          small!\n\nMargot steps up to take her turn.   She regards the house.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          You took the awnings down.\n\nClaude looks back into the adjacent yard: Flashes of skin. A\nbreast. Pubic hair. Claude crouches to see more clearly --\nthe bodies disappear from sight.\n\nMalcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes.\nHe swings -- his ball rockets past Margot's, rolls up over a\nridge and onto the cement drive. It quickly sails down into\nthe road and bounces into a ditch.\n\nMalcolm shakes furiously. He lifts his mallet, turns toward\nthe house, rethinks momentarily, and hurls it up over the\nincline and down to the water. Pauline puts her hands on her\nhips.\n\n                       PAULINE\n          Well done.\n\n                       MALCOLM\n          Fuck you.\n\nMalcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach.\nClaude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Honey, you're up.\nHe approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double\nwickets.\n                    MARGOT\n          You're going the wrong way.\n                       CLAUDE\n          Oh.\n\n                                                                23.\n\n\n     He blushes and laughs.    Pauline laughs.   Margot shakes her\n     head.\n\n                            MARGOT\n               So stupid.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.\n\n     Margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               We're in the middle of it.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               This is why I hate games.    I hate\n               what it does to me.\n\n     Pauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at\n     her. Malcolm calls from the stairs:\n\n                         MALCOLM (O.S.)\n               Wait, we're not finished!\n\n19   EXT.

It's not necessarily bad,\n               Paul. It's just something you do.\n\n     Pauline looks mildly horrified.   She suddenly turns to\n     Claude.\n                         PAULINE\n               Claude have you ever seen your\n               mother climb a tree?\n\n                            CLAUDE\n               No.\n\n                                                                24.\n\n\n                          MARGOT\n               We don't have much opportunity in\n               Manhattan.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               As kids Margot climbed everything.\n               She could even climb that tree.\n\n     She points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into\n     the neighbor's property.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Can you do it, mom?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Maybe later.\n\n                          CLAUDE\n               No, now.\n\n                         INGRID\n               Do it now, Margot!\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Show him, Margot.\n\n20   CUT TO:                                                       20\n\n     Margot strides toward the tree.   The group follows behind.\n\n     She grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself.\n\n     Claude grins, impressed.\n\n     With brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree.\n\n     Claude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from\n     below.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               I told you.\n     Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the\n     gang. They wave. She waves back.\n     The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep\n     breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The\n     neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance,\n     toxic white smoke comes out into the sky.\n\n     An earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for\n     a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more\n     rapid.\n\n                                                                25.\n\n\n     A bug buzzes around her head.

The\n     buzzing continues.\n\n     Close on Margot's ear. A small black gnat lands on the lip\n     of the lobe. It hesitates and darts inside the hole.\n\n     Margot gasps.   She jams her pinky in her ear.\n\n     Pauline comes back out with an ice tea.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               What's she doing now?\n\n                         PAULINE\n                   (dryly)\n               She's stuck.\n\n21   CUT TO:                                                      21\n\n     A young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of\n     the tree and toward Margot.

He stumbles,\n     recovers and flings the animal at the front door.   He races\n     back toward his property.\n27   EXT.

Claude, you\n               say Go.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Okay.\n\n     Margot knocks on the side of her head with her hand.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Go!\n\n     Pauline flings herself in and is off. Margot hesitates then\n     follows. Maisy and Dick watch from the chairs. Ingrid\n     floats on a raft and cheers. Claude runs along the pool-\n     side.\n\n                         DICK\n               How's your dad?\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Good.\n                         DICK\n               He and I shared a thesis advisor at\n               Stanford. Did you know that?\n                         CLAUDE\n               No.\n     Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around.\n     Margot stops short and follows her sister. They're neck and\n     neck. Their arms cut in and out of the water.\n\n                                                               36.\n\n\n                     DICK\n           I was dating your mom back then,\n           did you know that?\n\n                      CLAUDE\n           No.\n\nPauline lands -- touches the wall first.    Margot a close\nsecond.\n\n                     CLAUDE\n           Pauline wins!\n\nPauline beams. Margot immediately drifts to the ladder.\nShe's panting heavily.\n\n                     CLAUDE\n           Mom cheated. You didn't touch the\n           wall!\n\n                     MARGOT\n           I did so. It doesn't matter.     I\n           lost anyway.\n\n                     PAULINE\n           It was close.\n\nPauline floats on her back, exhausted.\n\nIngrid swims beneath Claude -- long strands of hair stream up\nfrom beneath the surface.\n\nMargot gets out of the water and Dick wraps her in a towel.\nFor a moment it's an embrace. Margot looks quickly over at\nClaude --\n\nHis foot slips.\n\nHe topples in.\nWater roars around him.\n\nHe opens his mouth.   Bubbles spurt out.\nHe drifts down.\nLying next to the drain is a field mouse.       Its eyes are\nwhite.\n\nSplash.   Hands wrap around him.\nHe goes up.\n\n                                                                37.\n\n\n     The sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer.\n\n     Pauline brings Claude to the surface and pushes him to the\n     ladder. She helps him climb out. Ingrid and Maisy are\n     grinning. Their expressions slowly shift as they see\n     Claude's face.\n\n     Claude is sobbing.\n\n                            PAULINE\n               It's okay.\n\n     Margot immediately wrenches Claude from Pauline's grasp.    She\n     looks shocked and angry.\n\n                            MARGOT\n               I got him.\n\n     She leads her son behind the bushes out of everyone's sight.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               It's okay, my baby.\n\n     She gently lets him down. His sneakers squeak and slosh.\n     Claude, soaking wet and ashamed, looks at his mother. She\n     breaks into laughter. Claude wipes the water and tears from\n     his eyes.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Now we're even.\n\n30   INT. PAULINE AND MALCOLM'S DEN - DAY                         30\n\n     Margot, reclining on the couch, drinks a white wine with ice\n     cubes. Pauline passes the doorway and stops. She holds tear-\n     sheets of flowers and wedding decorations from various\n     magazines.\n                         PAULINE\n               Here you are.\n                         MARGOT\n               You've got a problem.\n                         PAULINE\n               What do you mean?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I don't like the girl and I don't\n               like the way Malcolm looks at her.\n\n                                                       38.\n\n\n                    PAULINE\n          Oh, come on, it's sexy.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          You didn't see it. I saw it.\n          You've got a problem.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I'm not worried.\n              (pause)\n          We could teach Claude how to swim.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          He won't want to do it.   It's too\n          late.\n\nPauline waits for more -- nothing comes. She takes a couple\nsteps into the room. She holds out her hand for the glass.\nMargot passes it to her. Pauline sips.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Are you supposed to be doing that?\n\n                     PAULINE\n          No.\n\nShe hands it back.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I liked your last story in, was it\n          Harpers? The one about mom. I was\n          very...I liked it very much.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          It wasn't really about mom.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I thought it was. Anyway. Why\n          don't you want Claude to know how\n          to swim?\n                    MARGOT\n          I didn't say I didn't want him to.\n          Why do you care? It's not in his\n          life -- we're New Yorkers. If he\n          wants to learn when he's older, he\n          can. I'm curious why you're so\n          interested in the whole thing.\n                    PAULINE\n          I'm not. I'm just... As a safety\n          thing and...I'm... Forget it.\n              (pause)\n                    (MORE)\n\n                                                             39.\n\n                         PAULINE (CONT'D)\n               It's interesting -- this is the\n               first time Dick has invited us\n               over.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               But are you really friends?\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Kind of. We're neighbors. We\n               employ Maisy. I mean I don't care,\n               I just think it's interesting.\n                   (pause)\n               Are you excited about the talk? I\n               thought I'd come if that's okay.\n               My friend, Agnes, asked me, \"What's\n               it like to have a celebrity as a\n               sister?\" I said, I've got no\n               problem with celebrity. Alice\n               Munro taught at Bennington and was\n               kind of a friend of mine.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I'm not a celebrity.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Well, you're well known.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               To a very few people.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Just accept the compliment.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I guess I didn't realize it was a\n               compliment.\n\n31   EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY                                     31\n\n     Margot walks the path alone. She hugs herself as a light\n     breeze kicks up. Her footsteps echo in the trees.\n     The little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt.\n     She crouches down and takes it.\n32   CUT TO:                                                    32\n     CLOSE: A note is being written.\n\n     \"...and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your\n     child I will call the police.\"\n\n                                                               40.\n\n\n     The word \"any\" is then underlined twice.   The page is torn\n     from her little brown book.\n\n33   EXT. VOGLER HOUSE - EVENING                                   33\n\n     Margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door.\n     She stops herself. She puts the note on the Welcome mat and\n     holds it in place with the child's shoe. She wanders around\n     to the back of the house. She looks into a lighted window:\n\n     It's a white tiled bathroom.\n\n     A wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced\n     on the sink. Mr. Vogler tears into the plastic. The carcass\n     is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs.\n\n     Mrs. Vogler runs the tub. She pours salt from a box in the\n     water. The man slides his hand in her waist-band. She rubs\n     against him.\n\n     Margot chews her cuticle.\n\n     The man saws the legs. His arm jerks back and forth,\n     straining to cut through the bone. Sweat pours down his\n     temples.\n\n     Margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the\n     window. She peers through her fingers. The blade pierces\n     the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the\n     floor.\n\n     Margot moves to another window.   The pig's face now looks at\n     her.\n\n     Blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. The\n     woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid.\n\n     Suddenly a face appears in the glass. Margot leaps back.\n     It's a thin boy. He says something. The family turns to the\n     window. The father flicks off the bathroom light.\n     From inside Margot illuminates like an apparition.\n     Margot scampers into the trees.   She pushes through branches,\n     her shirt tears. She runs.\n34   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - EVENING                            34\n     Claude sits on the bed. The record sleeve from Blondie's\n     \"Parallel Lines\" rests in his lap. He reads the lyrics to\n     the song, \"Sunday Girl.\" He depresses the red record button\n     on an old portable tape recorder. He sings a cappella and\n     full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can.\n\n                                                              41.\n\n\n     Maisy appears in the doorway and watches.   Claude turns mid-\n     lyric. He jumps, startled.\n\n                            MAISY\n               Singing?\n\n     Fumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder.\n\n                            CLAUDE\n               Hm?     A bit.\n\n     She drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who\n     remains on the bed.\n\n     Margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape.\n     She watches: Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claude's\n     hands. Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth\n     stomach.\n\n                         MAISY\n               Can I make a suggestion?\n\n                            CLAUDE\n               Uh huh.\n\n                         MAISY\n               You should get underarm deodorant.\n\n                            CLAUDE\n               Uh huh.\n\n                         MAISY\n               You kind of smell.\n\n     Claude blushes.\n\n                         MAISY\n               Better I tell you than someone\n               else.\n35   INT. MARGOT'S BATHROOM - EVENING                           35\n\n     Margot puts on mascara and watches Claude, who stands behind\n     her, in the mirror.\n                         MARGOT\n               I think you smell nice.    You smell\n               real.\n\n                            CLAUDE\n               I stink.\n\n                                     42.\n\n\n          MARGOT\nIt causes cancer.\n\n          CLAUDE\nUnderarm deodorant?\n\n          MARGOT\nYes. It's got chemicals and things\nthat are extremely harmful.\n\n          CLAUDE\nI'm not going to die from underarm\ncancer.\n\n           MARGOT\nNo, you'll get it somewhere else.\nLike your stomach or your\ntesticles.\n\n           CLAUDE\n    (laughs)\nTesticles.\n\n          MARGOT\nDon't laugh, that's a serious\nthing.\nWho told you this, anyway? Maisy?\n\n          CLAUDE\nYeah.\n\n          MARGOT\nI hope you're not interested in\nthat girl. I find her\ninsufferable.\n\n          CLAUDE\nWhat does that mean?\n\n          MARGOT\nIt means I can't suffer her. She's\nloud and stupid. She goes on about\nthings of which she knows nothing\nabout.\n          CLAUDE\nShe got into Harvard early.\n          MARGOT\nStupid people get into Harvard\nearly all the time.\n\n                                                             43.\n\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Where did you go again?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Barnard.\n                   (pause)\n               I just don't think you should do\n               anything with her.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n                   (embarrassed)\n               We're just friends.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               If you do, use a condom.\n\n     Claude looks into the toilet. A square of toilet paper with\n     a red lip outline floats on top of the water.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Where are you going?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Are kids coming?\n\n36   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  36\n\n     Claude's POV through the window: Dick and Margot in the back\n     seat of the Volvo. Malcolm and Pauline the front. The\n     ignition turns.\n\n     Claude leaves the window. We hear the car rumble away.\n     Claude and Ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of\n     them. Maisy is cross-legged on Wizard's dog bed and chews a\n     stalk of celery.\n\n                         INGRID\n               Who do we know who's gay?\n                         MAISY\n               How do I know what gay people you\n               know.\n                         CLAUDE\n               Alan and Toby.\n                            INGRID\n               And Bruce.

Claude bites into his burger. His eyes fix on\nthe crease between Maisy's breasts. Maisy says to Claude:\n\n                    MAISY\n          Do you think your mom is fuckable?\n                    CLAUDE\n          I don't know.\n                    MAISY\n          I think she's hot, your mother.\n          I'd do her if I was gay.

The kids turn\n     quickly:\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               What was that?\n\n                         INGRID\n               Is it scary?\n\n37   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                                          37\n\n     The three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats\n     in the fence: The Vogler family eats at an outdoor table. A\n     pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. Mrs. Vogler says\n     something and the kids and Mr. Vogler laugh.\n\n     Maisy climbs over Claude to see better. He feels her breasts\n     press against his back. Suddenly he swats crazily at his\n     ear. Ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass.\n\n38   INT.

It's akin\n          to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory\n          about prison guards and prisoners\n          switching rolls.\n                    DICK\n          That's a charming philosophy.\n\n                                                           47.\n\n\n                     MARGOT\n          Yeah.

Margot and\n     Dick watch out the back window. Pauline sees Malcolm coming\n     and bolts into the woods. Malcolm charges after her.\n\n                         DICK\n               Come back with me tonight.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I've got Claude.\n\n                         DICK\n               Come on, I've been trying to get\n               you up here all year.\n                         MARGOT\n                   (vaguely)\n               She's pregnant.\n     Dick leans over to Margot's neck.

He goes to the door\nand peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and\ndirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into\nthe hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water\ngroans through the old pipes.\n\n                                                              50.\n\n\n                         INGRID\n               Where are you going?

MARGOT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              41\n\n     Claude enters.   It's empty. Her brown notebook rests on the\n     bedside table.   He hesitates then opens it:\n\n     It's packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive\n     in black ink. The name Claude can be made out on the page.\n\n     Claude takes the book and climbs up into bed. He nestles\n     against the pillow and squints to read the writing.\n\n                         MARGOT (O.S.)\n               What are you doing?\n\n     Claude startles.

He hesitates.\n                         CLAUDE\n               Can I sleep in here?\n                            MARGOT\n               No, honey.\n                         CLAUDE\n               We can put a pillow between us.\n\n                                                              51.\n\n\n                          MARGOT\n               Okay.   Just for tonight.\n\n     Claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in\n     the bed. We stay on him as he waits.

HOUSE - MORNING                                       42\n\n     Malcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his\n     mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white\n     tent. A workman holds a pole steadily.\n\n     Pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. Ingrid\n     idles a few feet away. They're in the midst of talking:\n\n                         INGRID\n               Why was it a secret?\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Because I didn't want to get you\n               excited before it was real.

Pauline marches toward Malcolm.\n                         PAULINE\n               Margot told Claude something I\n               expressly told her in confidence.\n               And he told Ingrid.\n                         (MORE)\n\n                                                   52.\n\n                    PAULINE (CONT'D)\n          I'm stunned that she put me in this\n          position.

Pauline hugs\n     her and they spin.\n\n43   CUT TO:                                                     43\n\n     Margot watches from the upstairs window. The mother and\n     daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle.\n     Finally, Margot turns away -- she's in Pauline and Malcolm's\n     room.\n\n     She opens drawers: Underwear, socks, bras. Topless photos\n     of Pauline posing in the bedroom. A photograph of Margot and\n     Pauline in their teens on Halloween dressed as Pat Benatar\n     and Patty Smyth respectively.\n\n     Margot grins.\n\n     Another photo of Margot, Pauline and an obese woman -- Becky -\n     - in their 20's.\n\n     Margot's expression saddens. She opens another drawer.\n     Polaroids of Pauline and Malcolm in different sexual poses.\n\n     She flips through these and drops them on the bureau.\n\n     Amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers.\n     She squints to read the labels. She opens one and shakes out\n     a few blue pills into her palm.

It's\n          hard, I think, to find people in\n          the world you love more than your\n          family.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          I like Malcolm.\n\n                     PAULINE\n          Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do\n          too.\n               (pause)\n          I can teach you to swim if you\n          like.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          No, thanks.\n\nClaude looks at the floor. His sneaker rests next to her\nopen toed sandals. She taps his foot with hers.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          Has your mother talked to you yet?\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          I don't think so.   About what?\n\n                    PAULINE\n          Are you okay? It's hard to see\n          your mom like that -- get attacked\n          like that. Right? It was mean\n          what he did. I think it was really\n          shitty.\n                    CLAUDE\n          Mm hm.\n                    PAULINE\n          You know, I think your mom's going\n          through a rough time right now\n          and...whatever she tells you...like\n          if she says she's leaving your\n          father...remember that she often\n          changes her mind and...\n                    (MORE)\n\n                                                             80.\n\n                         PAULINE (CONT'D)\n               I don't want you to worry about\n               anything right now.\n\n     Claude says nothing.\n\n61   EXT. HOUSE - LATE DAY                                     61\n\n     Pauline's Volvo rolls into the drive. She and Claude get out\n     of the front seats. Margot climbs out of the back holding a\n     big cake box. No one speaks.\n\n     Malcolm, in a fleece vest and safety goggles, drags a\n     chainsaw toward the oak tree. Ingrid runs to her mom.\n\n                         INGRID\n               He's cutting it down.\n\n                            PAULINE\n               Good.\n\n     Pauline passes Maisy reading on the patio.\n\n                         MAISY\n               My dad's late to pick me up.    I\n               hope I'm not a pain.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               You're not a pain.\n\n     Margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with\n     ice. The tent is up. The tables and chairs are placed\n     around the lawn. She watches Malcolm prepare to take the\n     tree down. She puts her pinky in her ear and twists. Claude\n     approaches.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I told Paul I didn't want you guys\n               to come.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               I thought it was interesting.\n                         MARGOT\n               What did Paul say?\n                         CLAUDE\n               I think she liked it.\n                         MARGOT\n               Yeah, right. Did you talk about me\n               afterwards?\n                            CLAUDE\n               No.\n\n                                                           81.\n\n\n                    MARGOT\n          I can tell you're lying.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          We didn't, mom.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          I don't trust her.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          She really loves you.   She does.\n\nMargot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Pauline told me she's very\n          disappointed in you.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          Why?\n\n                    MARGOT\n          She thinks you laze about the\n          house. Ingrid is always offering\n          to help clean or cook. She made\n          bracelets for all the guests. Even\n          Malcolm puts up the tent. You just\n          wait until everyone else does it\n          for you.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          That's not true.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          It is true. You're never helpful.\n          I wish I had taught you better\n          manners.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          I can try to make popovers.   If I\n          can remember how.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Don't bother.\nShe looks at him with grave disappointment.\n                    CLAUDE\n          Why are you looking at me like\n          that?\n\n                                                                82.\n\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I just see how much you've changed.\n               Your body language. You used to be\n               rounder and more graceful. You're\n               so stiff now. So blase.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               What do you mean?\n\n                         MARGOT\n                   (retreating)\n               I can't explain it.\n\n     Margot shakes her head.   She's suddenly distraught.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               It's okay though.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Uh huh.\n\n     Claude looks devastated. He starts toward the beach.\n     Margot's eyes well up -- she says, trying to make things\n     better:\n\n                         MARGOT\n               You're still handsome.\n\n62   EXT. HOUSE - SAME                                             62\n\n     Pauline marches toward Malcolm.    Malcolm wears the safety\n     goggles and revs the chainsaw.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Are you able to do this yourself?\n\n                         MALCOLM\n               Pauline, do you want me to cut it\n               down or not?\n                         PAULINE\n               Watch the tent.\n     The jagged blades pierce the trunk.   Pauline crunches her\n     face. Malcolm stops suddenly.\n     He walks around the tree and inspects the bark.\n                         MALCOLM\n                   (indicating his fleece)\n               I liked how it looked on Vogler.\n     Pauline starts to say something -- stops.    Then:\n\n                                                         83.\n\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I think it's over between Dick and\n          Margot. He was so cruel to her\n          today. And poor Claude had to\n          watch it all. She should just get\n          out of the marriage and then she\n          can fuck whoever she wants, you\n          know. It's cowardly. And Dick\n          Koosman. What a choice. I\n          mean...you know?\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I agree. I hate the idea of Dick\n          fucking Margot.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          What does that mean?   You want to\n          fuck Margot?\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          Pauline, that's not what I said.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I know you have a crush on her, you\n          already told me that.\n\nMalcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again.   They yell\nover the noise:\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I didn't say that. I said I\n          thought she was attractive after\n          you grilled me. She has no\n          interest in me anyway. Not that it\n          would matter if she did.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          Have you ever done anything like\n          that.\n                    MALCOLM\n          What do you mean?\n                    PAULINE\n          Have you ever cheated on me?\n                    MALCOLM\n          No!\nMalcolm shuts the motor.\n                    MALCOLM\n          Can I do this?\n\n                                      84.\n\n\n          PAULINE\nThose emails you had with that\nstudent of mine.\n\n          MALCOLM\n    (exhales)\nUh huh.\n\n          PAULINE\nDid that...I know you said it was\nnothing.\n\n             MALCOLM\nIt was.\n\n             PAULINE\nI just...     Can you say it again?\n\n          MALCOLM\nI just did. Now, can I cut down\nthe tree?\n\n          PAULINE\nYou never did anything with her?\n\n          MALCOLM\nNo. She emailed me after we met at\nthat reading at the college and...\nYou know we were friends.\n\n          PAULINE\nRight, just a regular friendship\nbetween you and a twenty year old\ngirl.\n\n           MALCOLM\nPauline, how many times do I have\nto say it.\n\n          PAULINE\nBut...why don't I believe it?\n          MALCOLM\nBecause Margot can't understand why\nyou're with me and now when she's\naround you look for things.\n          PAULINE\n    (hesitates)\nYou promise.\n             MALCOLM\nI promise.\n\n                                                         85.\n\n\nPauline looks at him long and hard.   Malcolm takes off his\ngoggles.\n\n                      PAULINE\n          Okay.    I'm sorry.\n\n                       MALCOLM\n          It's okay.\n\nMalcolm and Pauline continue to stare at one another. He\nguns the chainsaw. Tears spill suddenly from his eyes.\nPauline startles. He flicks the switch off.\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I'm going to tell you something.\n\n                    PAULINE\n              (suddenly terrified)\n          What?\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I don't want to lose you, though.\n          Okay?\n\nPauline's face goes pale.\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I'm going to tell you...    Just let\n          me... Maisy...\n\nPauline teeters.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I don't want to know.\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          ...we didn't really do anything.\n          We were goofing around, I was\n          making fun of her cause she dates a\n          jock...\n                    PAULINE\n          I don't want to know.\n                    MALCOLM\n          I shouldn't've put myself in that\n          position, I know that. We brushed\n          lips really. It was barely a kiss.\n          And then we stopped. That was it.\nHis nose runs.    He wipes it messily with his arm.\n\n                                                                86.\n\n\n                         MALCOLM\n               Our tongues touched. I don't want\n               to under-sell it either. I mean...\n               We made out. I made out with her.\n               I don't know why. I don't even\n               like her. It's been a heady time.\n                   (Pauline says nothing)\n               What are you thinking? Please,\n               tell me what you're thinking.\n\n     Pauline rushes at the tree -- she smacks her hands on the\n     trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove. It\n     doesn't budge. In frustration and rage, she runs.\n\n63   CUT TO:                                                      63\n\n     Ingrid is the only one on the patio as Pauline approaches.\n\n                         INGRID\n               Has anyone seen Wizard?\n\n                          PAULINE\n               No.   Where's Maisy?\n\n                         INGRID\n               Upstairs, I think with Claude.\n\n64   INT. PAULINE'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY - DAY                         64\n\n     Pauline enters in a daze.   A toilet flushes.    Maisy comes out\n     of Pauline's bathroom.\n\n                         MAISY\n               Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I\n               hope that's okay I used yours.\n\n     Pauline nods strangely. She goes to the window. Her dove\n     grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door.\n\n                         MAISY\n               I love your wedding dress.   It's so\n               unconventional and great.\n     Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and\n     Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at\n     the pictures too.\n     Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows.\n     Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right\n     behind her.\n                         MAISY\n               Is everything okay?\n\n                                                              87.\n\n\n                         PAULINE\n                   (pause)\n               Nothing.\n\n     Maisy stops at the landing.

She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy\n     turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like\n     she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly.\n\n     Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg.\n     Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.\n\n65   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             65\n\n     The deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree.\n     Malcolm is soaked in sweat. Ingrid watches from a few feet\n     away.\n\n     In the distance -- Dick's orange BMW grinds into the\n     driveway. Maisy hurries toward him.\n\n     Ingrid says, buried in the noise:\n\n                         INGRID\n               There's Dick.\n\n     Malcolm sees Dick.

Dick spots Malcolm. He\n     immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear\n     creeps up his neck.\n\n     Dick speeds up.\n     Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts\n     toward the water. Ingrid watches, confused.\n\n                                                           88.\n\n\nDick takes off after him. Malcolm stumbles down the long\nwooden stairs to the beach.\n\nMalcolm runs wobbily -- he pants, already out of breath.\nSweat pours down his face and body.\n\nDick's gait is swift -- his arms stiff, bent at the elbow.\nHis jeans make a swish swish. He takes the stairs two at a\ntime.\n\nMalcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can\nsideways, trying not to fall. He reaches the beach, his feet\nsinking in the sand. He trips and topples forward.\n\nHe looks up -- Dick lunges.\n\nDick pounds Malcolm's head and face.     Malcolm throws his arms\nup and tries to block the punches.\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I didn't do anything!

Malcolm looks -- a mud-\n     and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile.\n\n66   CUT TO:                                                     66\n\n     Wheels sputter in the gravel. Dick's car peels out with\n     Maisy in the passenger seat. Claude and Margot watch from\n     the porch.\n\n67   INT.

The tree sways.\n\n     Pauline thrusts her arms out, seizes Ingrid and hurls herself\n     away from the tree.\n\n                            INGRID\n               Ow!\n\n     Ingrid sobs as they run.

VOLVO - DAY                                            69\n\n     The speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the\n     steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit\n     stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming\n     lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               I thought you couldn't drive.\n\n                         MARGOT\n                   (irritated)\n               I can drive. Why does everyone say\n               that? I used to drive.\n\n     They inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them.\n     The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:\n\n                         PAULINE\n               We have to call people and cancel.\n\n                         INGRID\n               What happened?

The kids follow\n     behind. Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt.\n     She tosses them in the brush.\n\n                          PAULINE\n               Fuck.\n     Margot turns to the kids.

FERRY - DAY                                            71\n\n     Margot and Claude sit, streaked with mud and perspiration.\n     Margot drinks a beer, Claude a Coke. Margot pops a blue pill\n     in her mouth and swallows. Ingrid swings on the rail.\n\n     Pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her\n     sister. She takes the beer and swigs.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               I left mom and Becky a message.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I don't think mom knows how to work\n               the machine.\n     Margot puts her pinky in her ear.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I can hear it flapping.\n                         PAULINE\n               You should take care of that.

In the Chevy next to them sits Mrs.\n     Vogler and the Vogler boy. She sings along to the radio.\n     She runs her hand through her son's hair gently. He nestles\n     into her shoulder.\n\n72   EXT. SEASIDE TOWN STREET - EVENING                         72\n\n     The four of them get out of a taxi.   A small, peeling hotel.\n\n73   INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               73\n\n     A dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall-to-wall\n     carpet. Pauline combs Ingrid's hair on one of the two double\n     beds. Ingrid practices her wedding song. Claude sits on the\n     other bed and looks into the open bathroom door: Margot\n     stands with her back to him. She talks on her cell phone in\n     a whisper. She hangs up. Claude walks inside. The sink\n     drips.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Sweety, there's a bus that leaves\n               to Vermont from town tomorrow\n               morning.

Ingrid and Pauline are\n     already looking out.\n     Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people\n     hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the\n     rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed\n     in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard\n     coffins.\n\n                                                       96.\n\n\n                    PAULINE\n          There's Malcolm.\n\nPauline points to a guy in a vest. As he turns around we see\nit isn't him.

People are living there\n          right?\n\n                    MARGOT\n          You don't want to live there.   It's\n          all young people.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          But what do you think of that idea?\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Maybe. Let's see.

She mutters to herself.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               What have I done? What have I\n               done?\n\n     Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air. A few\n     stragglers still march in the street. Trash and pieces of\n     signage line the gutter. Margot turns into the room. She\n     puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin. She\n     watches her son who removes his jeans for bed.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               What?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Nothing.

Margot sits\n     on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline\n     marches around and across to the other side of the room. She\n     snatches the book out of Margot's hands.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Hey!\n\n                         PAULINE\n               You cannot write about this.

BAR/RESTAURANT - MORNING                            76\n\n     Cheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front.\n     Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot\n     drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids\n     have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a\n     plastic red basket lie between them.\n\n     A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The\n     music begins. The man sways and sings \"On and On\" by Stephen\n     Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes\n     moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the\n     wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers:\n                         MARGOT\n               I'm sorry, sweety. There's\n               something wrong with me.\n                         PAULINE\n               I'm going to call him.\n     Margot quickly turns to her sister.\n                          MARGOT\n               No.   Don't. I'm telling you.\n\n                                                            100.\n\n\n                         PAULINE\n               I...I need some clothes and things.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               He should get the hell out of our\n               house.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               Okay.

She stares at a\n     drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the\n     pay phone. Malcolm is crying.\n\n                         MALCOLM'S VOICE\n               The tent looks so lonely.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               It has no one to get married in it.\n\n78   EXT.

And it's smashed. I'm\n               such a fucking idiot. Please don't\n               take me seriously. I mean take me\n               seriously, but not the fucked up\n               parts, you know. I love you so\n               much. Please marry me.\n\n                         PAULINE\n               You can't do what you did again.\n               Do you understand?\n                            MALCOLM\n               I promise.\n                         PAULINE\n               No matter how tempting.\n     At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent-\n     mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it\n     onto the floor.\n     Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to\n     Claude.\n\n                                                         101.\n\n\n                    INGRID\n          You left it in my room.\n\nIt's a piece of fingernail.   He hesitates then puts it in his\npocket.\n\nAt the phone: Pauline rests her head against the wall.\nMalcolm is bawling on the other end.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I don't know. I don't know.\n\nMalcolm clutches Wizard and sputters:\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          I ate some of the cake.   I don't\n          know why, but I did it.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          What was... How was it?\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          Good.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          It's not too sweet? They sometimes\n          make their stuff too sweet.\n\n                    MALCOLM\n          Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't\n          even notice... They fucked up the\n          cake. How sad. I love our little\n          baby. I miss you.\n\n                    PAULINE\n          I miss you too. Maybe we should do\n          another seminar.\n\nMalcolm says something incomprehensible.\n                    PAULINE\n          I can't understand you, honey.\nMargot finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her\nsister.\n                    INGRID\n          There's gramma and Aunt Becky!\nMargot startles and looks out the window. Across the street\nis an older woman, 70's, and a large woman, mid 30's, eating\nice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window.\n\n                                                                   102.\n\n\n                         PAULINE\n               They didn't get my message.\n\n     Pauline now stands above them.\n\n                          MARGOT\n               I told you she can't work the\n               machine --\n\n     Ingrid's chair scrapes as she stands.      She takes her mother's\n     hand. Margot remains seated.\n\n                          PAULINE\n               What?   You're not coming?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I'm coming, I'm coming.       What did\n               he say?\n\n     Pauline and Ingrid head for the door.

A bus in the distance.   Claude tries to\n     keep pace with his mother.\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               Did you do something?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               What do you mean, do something?\n\n                         CLAUDE\n               I mean, why is the wedding not\n               happening? Is there something that\n               you did?\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Pauline has transferred all her\n               stuff onto me. I don't understand\n               her anymore. Why'd she pick this\n               man? It is really berserk. And\n               you know, she referred to me as her\n               closest friend. We never see one\n               anoth --\n\n     An unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot. The sadness is\n     unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably. She tries to speak:\n\n                         MARGOT\n               I mean we're not close.   Even if we\n               want to be.

Jesus. You think so\n               little of me.\n                   (through her sobs)\n               It's good you're going. You\n               shouldn't be around me either.

She\nperiodically looks behind her. Nobody seems to be following.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n              (growing nervous)\n          Are you angry at me?\n\n                       MARGOT\n          No, honey.

I'm not mad at\n          anyone.\n\nUp ahead is a tiny depot.    People climb onto a white bus.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          Can you come with me?\n\n                    MARGOT\n          No, you know that.\n              (pause)\n          We should talk about the next few\n          months a little bit and what's\n          going to happen --\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          I don't like Vermont.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Your dad will be very happy to see\n          you.

Okay?\nShe watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man.\nMargot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply.\n                    MARGOT\n          You used to need me to watch you\n          when you played.\n\n                                                       105.\n\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          What do you mean?\n\n                    MARGOT\n              (vaguely)\n          When you first started to play with\n          friends, you wouldn't do it unless\n          I watched you. You were afraid I\n          would go out the back door. I\n          don't know where I would go. Our\n          yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.\n\nShe takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T-\nshirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly:\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          I masturbated last night. While\n          everyone was asleep I went into the\n          bathroom and did it.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          You don't have to tell me, sweety.\n\nThe bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          You've got to go.\n\nMargot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's\nhand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          How will you get home?\n\n                    MARGOT\n          I don't know. I'll see. Maybe\n          Dick can drive me to the...\n              (pause)\n          Jesus, I lost the word for a\n          second. The train.\n                    CLAUDE\n          Uh huh.\nHe looks at her longingly.\n                    MARGOT\n          Come on. You always don't want to\n          leave me and you always have a good\n          time once you do.\n              (provocatively)\n          I think you like getting away from\n          me.\n\n                                                      106.\n\n\n                      CLAUDE\n          I do not.    I like hanging out with\n          you.\n\nShe hugs him.   He clutches her.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          The world feels strange to me right\n          now.\n\nMargot nods sympathetically. She kisses his lips and\nreleases him. He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his\nwrap-around punk sunglasses. Margot makes a face.\n\n                      CLAUDE\n          What?\n\n                    MARGOT\n          They make your face look too wide.\n\nClaude removes them and puts them back in the bag.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          See you soon.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Bye, sweety.\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          Say, you'll see me \"soon.\"\n\n                    MARGOT\n          You're acting like a baby.\n\nShe backs away --\n\n                    CLAUDE\n          Don't see Dick.\n\n                    MARGOT\n          Don't worry. I don't think he\n          wants to see me anyway.\n                    CLAUDE\n          Please, Margot. Promise me.\n                    MARGOT\n              (hesitates)\n          Don't call me that.\n\nClaude doesn't move. Margot points at the bus and mouths\n\"Go\". She turns in the other direction. Claude, frustrated\nand anxious approaches the vehicle.\n\n                                                               107.\n\n\n81   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                        81\n\n     Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat.    He\n     puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass.\n\n     Claude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her\n     ear and shakes her head.\n\n     The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the\n     pavement. She starts walking.\n\n     The bus hisses and lurches forward.    Claude strains to see:\n\n     Margot looks back.\n\n     The bus groans as it picks up speed.   Margot sprints.\n\n                          MARGOT\n               Wait!\n\n     She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.\n\n                          MARGOT\n               Wait!   Wait!\n\n     She pants, breathless.\n\n     The bus brakes.\n\n     She passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits.\n     Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and\n     panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving.\n\n                         MARGOT\n                   (almost euphoric)\n               Did you see me running out there?\n\n                          CLAUDE\n               Yeah.\n     Margot cranes her neck to see outside.\n\n                         MARGOT\n               Good. That was a lot of running.\n               I'm out of breath.\n     Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.\n\n\n\n     CUT TO BLACK.\n\n\n\n\n\nMargot at the Wedding\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Noah Baumbach\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:30:42.862078"}
