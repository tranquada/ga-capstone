A ratty looking unpainted plywood\n       addition has been nailed to the top of the\n       cabin. It's partially covered with a blue\n       plastic tarp.\n\n<b>       SUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -\n</b><b>       FALL\n</b>\n       The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked\n       torso emerges from under it. Shane is late\n       twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly\n       going to seed. He looks hung over.\n\n       Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He\n       pulls on the top part of an old patched wet\n       suit and zips it up. He shivers.\n<b>\n</b><b>EXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY\n</b>\nWe're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in\nan old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.\n\nShane has pulled up the attached rubber hood\nto his wet suit so that only the white, pasty\noblong of his face is visible.\n\nIt's still raining as he steers the little\nboat around the sailboats and yachts.\n\nHe pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS\nthe ENGINE.\n\nWith practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to\nthe rear rail of the sailboat and clips a\nbill for services rendered on the sailboat's\nstern line.\n\nHe slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of\nold gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a\nair-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out\nof the dinghy and into the    water.\n\n\n<b>EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY\n</b>\nIt's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane\nfloats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long\nspatula.\n\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nHe attacks the underside of the sailboat\nwhich is covered with green algae muck that\nhangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.\n\nThe spatula scrapes away the green mess\nrevealing the pure white underside of the\nboat.\n\n\n<b>CLOSE ON SHANE\n</b>\nAs he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats\npast him. This doesn't look like fun.\n\nAs he works, he happens to look down and\nnotices something on the bottom.\n<b>\n</b><b>SHANE'S POV\n</b>\nAmidst the beer cans and other trash,\nsomething golden is sitting on the bottom.\n\n\n<b>BACK TO SCENE\n</b>\nShane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it\ngo and drifts down.\n\nA shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky\nwater and reveals a broken trophy half-buried\nin the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks\nit up.\n\nThe trophy is almost a full-size football\nrendered in bronze attached to a broken base.\n\nShane turns \"the ball\" over in his hands. He\ngrips the seams like he's done this before.\n\nThen he holds the football out in front of\nhim.\n\nSuddenly, he starts barking garbled signals\nto an imaginary offense. He turns to his\nrunning back as he yells something like \"Blue\n31!\" It comes out in bubbles\n\nHe cocks his left leg and his wide receiver\ngoes in motion.\n\nThen on the \"snap\" he turns and starts a five\nstep drop.\n\nHe moves in slow motion because hey... he's\nunderwater! He executes a perfect play\naction fake on the third step of his drop,\nand looks \"down field\" for his receivers.\n\nBut there's a blitz! He steps up in the\npocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes\nhis head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves\nin a kind of delicate ballet.\n\nHe rolls left and keeps looking for the open\nman.\n\nSuddenly he points down field, pulls up and\ncocks his arm.\n\nThe \"ball\" comes behind his ear and snaps\nforward in a perfect release.\n<b>\n</b>      The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON\n      Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he\n      throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.\n\n      We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of\n      victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the\n      trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del\n      Rey.\n\n<b>         CUT TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>       EXT.

And what about\n         the strike itself? It\n         has been so ineffective\n         that many predict it\n         will be over before\n         this game ends. Stay\n         tuned as Boomer and Dan\n         join me for strike\n         ball, D.C. style.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

He puts his\nhead down and smacks helmets with the safety.\nThe guy goes down and Shane runs over him and\ninto the end zone.\n\n<b>                    AL (V.O.)\n</b>            Falco scores!\n\n\nON McGINTY\n\nHe jumps into the air.\n\n\n<b>ON O'NEIL\n</b>\nHe jumps out of bed.\n\n\n<b>ON TODD, ROD AND BOB\n</b>\nThey jump on each other.\n\n\n<b>ON ANNABELLE\n</b>\nShe's jumping for joy.\n\n\n<b>ON SHANE\n</b>\nHe spikes the shit out of the ball.   And then\nsees something up field.\n\n<b>                   AL (V.O.)\n</b><b>\n</b>            Wait a minute. Wait a\n            minute. We've got a\n            flag down.\n\nShane stands stock-still in the end zone\nwatching the REF call the penalty.\n\n<b>                    REF\n</b>            Clipping. Number 77\n            offense.\n\n\n<b>ON MICKEY LEE\n</b>\nHe's wearing number 77 and he collapses in\ntears.\n\n\n<b>ON TODD, ROD AND BOB\n</b>\nThey are now sobbing in agony.\n\n\n<b>ON O'NEIL\n</b>\nHe's being helped back to bed by Augustine.\n\n\n<b>ON SHANE\n</b>\nHe's walking slowly back to the line of\nscrimmage.\n\n\nON McGINTY\n\nHe looks sick.\n\nShane walks up to Pacifico who is down. His\narm is being immobilized by a team trainer.\n\n<b>                    PACIFICO\n</b>            I broke my arm.\n                   (big smile)\n            Thank you. You saved\n            my ass.\n\nShane nods.     In his earpiece, he hears\nMcGinty.\n\n                    McGINTY (V.O.)\n            Someday, you can\n            explain what that was\n            all about.

He studies each\nface. And then he comes to rest on Brian\nMurray.\n\nBrian's eyes are shining.   He doesn't need\nwords here.\n\n<b>                 SHANE\n</b>                (to Murray)\n         Yeah. You want it,\n         Brian.

Blue 58!\n            Hut! Hut! Hut!\n\nShane nods.     On the snap, Shane rolls left.\n\n\n<b>ON REESE EVANS\n</b>\nHe cuts his man at the knees.\n\n\n<b>ON MICKEY LEE\n</b>\nHe takes two men down.\n\n\n<b>ON MURRAY\n</b>\nHe cuts on a deep post.\n\n\n<b>ON SHANE\n</b>\nHe steps up and throws a clean bullet\ndownfield.

Reese Evans\njoins him.\n\nWilkinson hugs Jamal.\n\nClifford Franklin, hometown boy, throws\nhimself into the stands where fans mob him.\n\n\n<b>ON EDDIE MARTEL\n</b>\nThe Washington Redskins first-string\nquarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from\nhis seat and turns quickly to go up the steps\nand out of the stadium.\n\nBut he slips awkwardly and falls.     He grabs\nhis knee and screams.\n\n\n<b>ON BRIAN MURRAY\n</b>\nHe's still in the end zone, holding the ball\nup to the crowd. The roar is deafening.\n\n\n<b>BRIAN'S POV\n</b>\nWe HEAR NOTHING, but somehow the pure energy\nof the moment comes through.\n\n\n<b>ON SHANE\n</b>\nIN the SILENCE, he's walking in SLOW MOTION\ntoward Annabelle.
