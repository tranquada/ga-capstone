MARINA DEL REY - DAY\n\n       It's raining lightly in the harbor and the\n       water around the moored boats looks dirty and\n       cold.\n\n       We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in\n       an end slip.\n\n       It's a sea-gull-shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin\n       cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long\n       time. A ratty looking unpainted plywood\n       addition has been nailed to the top of the\n       cabin. It's partially covered with a blue\n       plastic tarp.\n\n       SUPERIMPOSE:   MARINA DEL REY, CALIFORNIA -\n       FALL\n\n       The tarp moves and SHANE FALCO's half-naked\n       torso emerges from under it. Shane is late\n       twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly\n       going to seed. He looks hung over.\n\n       Shane glances up at the sky and rain. He\n       pulls on the top part of an old patched wet\n       suit and zips it up. He shivers.\n\nEXT. MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY\n\nWe're BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in\nan old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY.\n\nShane has pulled up the attached rubber hood\nto his wet suit so that only the white, pasty\noblong of his face is visible.\n\nIt's still raining as he steers the little\nboat around the sailboats and yachts.\n\nHe pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS\nthe ENGINE.\n\nWith practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to\nthe rear rail of the sailboat and clips a\nbill for services rendered on the sailboat's\nstern line.\n\nHe slips on a weight belt,    puts on a pair of\nold gaffer taped goggles,    jams the end of a\nair-hose in his mouth, and    falls backward out\nof the dinghy and into the    water.\n\n\nEXT. UNDERWATER - DAY\n\nIt's dark, dirty and murky. Suddenly, Shane\nfloats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long\nspatula.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nHe attacks the underside of the sailboat\nwhich is covered with green algae muck that\nhangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.\n\nThe spatula scrapes away the green mess\nrevealing the pure white underside of the\nboat.\n\n\nCLOSE ON SHANE\n\nAs he scrapes. Muck from the boat floats\npast him. This doesn't look like fun.\n\nAs he works, he happens to look down and\nnotices something on the bottom.\n\nSHANE'S POV\n\nAmidst the beer cans and other trash,\nsomething golden is sitting on the bottom.\n\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nShane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it\ngo and drifts down.\n\nA shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky\nwater and reveals a broken trophy half-buried\nin the mud. Shane kneels over it and picks\nit up.\n\nThe trophy is almost a full-size football\nrendered in bronze attached to a broken base.\n\nShane turns \"the ball\" over in his hands. He\ngrips the seams like he's done this before.\n\nThen he holds the football out in front of\nhim.\n\nSuddenly, he starts barking garbled signals\nto an imaginary offense. He turns to his\nrunning back as he yells something like \"Blue\n31!\" It comes out in bubbles\n\nHe cocks his left leg and his wide receiver\ngoes in motion.\n\nThen on the \"snap\" he turns and starts a five\nstep drop.\n\nHe moves in slow motion because hey... he's\nunderwater! He executes a perfect play\naction fake on the third step of his drop,\nand looks \"down field\" for his receivers.\n\nBut there's a blitz! He steps up in the\npocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes\nhis head off. He dodges, he bobs, he weaves\nin a kind of delicate ballet.\n\nHe rolls left and keeps looking for the open\nman.\n\nSuddenly he points down field, pulls up and\ncocks his arm.\n\nThe \"ball\" comes behind his ear and snaps\nforward in a perfect release.\n\n      The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON\n      Shane as he watches his pass. Suddenly, he\n      throws both arms up in a touchdown signal.\n\n      We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of\n      victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the\n      trash-covered, muddy bottom of Marina Del\n      Rey.\n\n         CUT TO:\n\n\n       EXT. EDWARD FRANCIS O'NEIL STADIUM (WASHINGTON,\nD.C.) -\n       DAY\n\n      Bam! A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a\n      Washington Redskin running back and lands on\n      his throat, elbow first.\n\n      It's a beautiful fall day in November and\n      Miami is beating the Skins in front of\n      seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans.\n      The Redskins are at their home stadium better\n      known as \"The Big O.\"\n\n\n      INT. CONTROL BOOTH - DAY\n\n      JOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the\n      game in shirtsleeves.\n\n                        SUMMERALL\n                That play, my friends,\n                sums up the Redskins'\n                running game all day\n                long.

SIDELINES - DAY\n\nRedskin quarterback EDDIE MARTEL is\nconferring with Redskin head coach BUD TILDON\nnear the bench. Madden and Summerall\ncontinue OVER.\n\n                 MADDEN (V.O.)\n         Take it all in, people.\n         This could be it for\n         2,000.\n\nWe MOVE TO veteran Redskin center REESE\nEVANS, 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform\ntotally clean.\n\nHe looks near tears.\n\n                 SUMMERALL\n         (V.O.)\n         Once again, if you\n         haven't heard, it was\n         announced during\n         halftime that the\n         N.F.L. Players\n         Association will hold a\n         press conference\n         immediately following\n         this game -- that would\n         make it about five\n         o'clock Eastern time --\n         and it is expected that\n\n            the players' union will\n            announce a strike\n            effective immediately.\n\n\nON REDSKINETTES\n\nTwelve striking-looking women dressed in\nburgundy and gold are doing some inane\nchatter to a section of fans that ignore\nthem.\n\nThe girls are led by pretty ANNABELLE\nFARRELL, a bundle of manic energy inside a\nbody from heaven.\n\n                    MADDEN (V.O.)\n            It's all about money,\n            folks. More money, of\n            course and ain't it\n            always? The shame of\n            it is the big losers\n            are you out there, the\n            fans.\n\n\nON MARTEL\n\nThe Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.\n\n                    SUMMERALL\n            (V.O.)\n            Here we go: Third\n            down, eight seconds to\n            play, ball on the\n            Dolphins' thirty-three\n            yard line. Skins down\n            by a touchdown.\n\nThe huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the\ncenter.\n\n                    MARTEL\n            Green 48! Green 48!\n            Hut! Hut!\n\nThe ball is snapped and Martel drops back.\nHe looks for a receiver and doesn't see\nanybody.\n\nHe steps up in the pocket, sees an opening\nand takes off running down field.\n\n                   MADDEN (V.O.)\n\n          There goes Martel!\n\nMartel is a pretty good broken field runner\nfor a big guy. Plus with the defense\ncovering every possible receiver, he's got a\nlot of daylight.\n\nNobody has touched him as he crosses the\nfifteen. Suddenly, a safety, smaller than\nMartel, looms in front of him at the ten.\n\nMartel goes down in one of those wimpy\nquarterback slides before the safety can even\nhit him.\n\nBANG!   The GUN sounds and the game is over.\n\n\nON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL\n\nThey look at each other in disbelief\n\n                  SUMMERALL\n          Well... Martel goes\n          down ten yards short of\n          a score.\n\n                  MADDEN\n          On maybe the last play\n          of the season.\n\n                  SUMMERALL\n          I think he might have\n          slipped.\n\n                  MADDEN\n          Yeah, there's a lot of\n          that going around.\n\n\nON THREE REDSKIN FANS\n\nWe'll see these guys throughout. They're\ntypical low level Washington bureaucrats\nnamed TODD, ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs\n-- the traditional name for the Redskin\noffensive linemen.\n\nTodd is shirtless and his entire upper body\nis painted Redskin red.\n\nAt that moment, they are livid with their\nquarterback and Bob is speaking for them all.\n\n                    BOB\n         We're    coming to your\n         house    tonight, and\n         we're    gonna fucking\n         kill    you! And if you\n         got a    dog, we're gonna\n         kill    your fucking dog\n         too!\n\n\nON ANNABELLE\n\nBehind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are\nalready walking away. Annabelle looks at\nQuarterback Martel with pure disgust as he\nwalks off the field.\n\n  CUT TO:\n\n\nINT. LARGE BEDROOM - DAY\n\nThe room's blinds are pulled tightly against\nthe bright sunlight.

He's aiming for a low\nwall that separates the first row of fans\nfrom the field.\n\n\nON FOUR FANS\n\nThey see Mickey rumbling at them and they all\nget the picture at the same time. They\nscream!\n\n\nON MICKEY\n\nHe launches himself into the stands in\necstasy.\n\n\nON FOUR FANS\n\nCrunch!
