DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY\n\nOn a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport.\nA man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.\n\nCUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is\nWILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged \"Buddy\" of this story and\nthe observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry,\nironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like\neveryone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,\ntrim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as\nhe walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.\n\nINT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY\n\nCUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his\nticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks\nto a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his\naloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to\nthem. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive.\nWe don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track --\nit is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but\nnow a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if\nslightly annoyed by something.\n\nCUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man\nat the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and\nlooks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE,\nerstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not\nbeen at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness,\nhe is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very\nunpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline\nrepresentative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily.\nHe wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat.\nWe don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the\ntrack.\n\nCUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with\na frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't\nplace him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns\nback to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously\nsaying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl,\nturns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance\naway and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the\ntall, gaunt man at the next counter.\n\nCUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than\nthe first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline\nrepresentatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his\nhead. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is\nsaying: \"I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist.\nWhat's the matter with this friggin' airline?\"\n\nCUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he\nrubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the\nman. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry\nDave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place\nthe man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on\nWillcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at\nthis ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a\ndistance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is \"Dixie,\" played\nwith beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong\nin his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC\nbecomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost\nto know the man.\n\nMAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): \"RAMBLING ROSE\"\n\nThe MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard.\n\nOTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action.\n\nVARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to\nrecognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug,\nturns and walks away with his travel bag.\n\nINT. DELTA TERMINAL - LOUNGE - DAY\n\nWe see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the\nplane.\n\nINT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY\n\nA shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive\nyoung stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He\nis not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face\nwhen he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real\naffection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry\nand ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit\nin a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley\nsheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys,\nthen sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make\ncorrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.\n\nSomething or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight\nfrown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and\nenthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the\ndialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I\nwill put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do\nnot want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will\nbe obvious from the acting.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(not on track)\n\tBuddd-dee! My God, if it ain't\n\tBuddy! Well, if this ain't the\n\tdarnest thing!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an\nidiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained\nembarrassed smile.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(not on track)\n\tExcuse me... your voice is familiar\n\tand I'm sure I know you from\n\tsomewhere...\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(not on track, with\n\t\t delighted injury)\n\tAwww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know\n\tme!\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(not on track)\n\tWell, I... I... ah-h, let's see...\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(not on track)\n\tIt's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie,\n\tdon't you remember me?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(not on track)\n\tOh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how\n\tare you?\n\nThe men shake hands, Dave enthusiastically, Hillyer less so.\nWe see Dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to\nHillyer.\n\nEXT. KENNEDY - DAY\n\nCUT TO a shot of a big Delta jet making its final taxiing\nturn and ROARING into a take-off.\n\nINT. KENNEDY - DAY\n\nCUT TO a dramatic underbelly shot of the jet going up.\n\nEND OF TITLES.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY\n\nA shot of the attractive, young stewardess, harried as she\nfixes drinks.\n\nINT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY\n\nCUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives\nthem drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees\nthe single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an\naggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to\nher. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be\npolite but is less than happy about the encounter.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tWell, I am in the construction\n\tbusiness, Buddy, and without\n\tbraggin' I have done real good at\n\tit. \n\t\t(with a meaningful\n\t\t bitterness)\n\tThere are those who wouldn't have\n\texpected that out of me. \n\t\t(pauses as if waiting for\n\t\t a reaction, but Hillyer\n\t\t is very silent)\n\tRight now I'm buildin' a giant\n\tmotel unit near Alexandria, outside\n\tWashington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm\n\ton the construction side.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(making polite talk)\n\tWell, that's interesting, Dave. I\n\talways liked Washington, it's a\n\tpretty town.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tOh, it's all right, beats Jew York.\n\tBut the niggers have took it over,\n\tjust like every other city we got,\n\tonly worse.\n\nHillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but\nDave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self\nsatisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)\n\tBut I have done real good in the\n\tconstruction field. What I don't\n\tknow about buildin' ain't worth\n\tknowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight\n\tthousand smackeroos last year,\n\thow's that for an old country boy?\n\nDave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down\nwith curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant\nsmile.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)\n\tHa ha, course you make a lot more. \n\t\t(points at the galleys)\n\tWhat's that you got there, Buddy?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(reluctantly)\n\tGalley proof.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tGalley what?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tPage proof of a book I'm working\n\ton.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tHow about that. Well, you always\n\twere a screwball.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(lifts an eyebrow in mild\n\t\t irony)\n\tOh, yeah?\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(unfazed)\n\tI don't mean that the way it\n\tsounds. \n\t\t(stares at galleys as if\n\t\t rattlesnake)\n\tImagine it, a book. And I used to\n\tknow you personal way back when.\n\t\t(pauses, then earnestly)\n\tTell me something, Buddy, how do\n\tyou dream up all that stuff?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(absolutely straight)\n\tWell, actually, we have a little\n\tblack boy named Her---t who lives\n\tin the garage. He does it for me.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(for a moment half\n\t\t believes it, then a slow,\n\t\t stupid grin)\n\tHeh heh heh heh, same old Buddy,\n\talways jokin' around. Almost as\n\tmuch of a joker as your Daddy. \n\t\t(drains his drink,\n\t\t grimaces; a heavy\n\t\t drinker, Dave)\n\tI saw your Daddy a coupla years\n\tago, I was up in Glenville lookin'\n\tat a motel site. I guess that's\n\twhere you're headed, huh, to see\n\thim?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(stares out of plane\n\t\t window)\n\tThat's right, Dave, I'm headed for\n\tGlenville on a whisperin' jet.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(suddenly calls out)\n\tHey, girl! Hey, you, give us\n\tanother drink! \n\t\t(to Hillyer, sullenly)\n\tDumb little bitch, supposed to give\n\tus two in the first place.\n\nWillcox Hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at\nhis temple.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)\n\tThis friggin' airline's out of its\n\tmind. \n\t\t(a martyr)\n\tThe sons of bitches tried to put me\n\tin tourist.\n\t\t(portentuously\n\t\t philosophical)\n\tBut our whole civilization is\n\tscrewed up, Buddy. The heebies and\n\tthe coconuts have took it over and\n\truined it.\n\nWillcox Hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says\nnothing. Gently, he rubs his temple. It is plain Dave Wilkie\ngives him a headache.\n\nINT. DELTA AIRPLANE\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings\ntwo more drinks. Dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by\nher charm.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tTook your time gettin' here.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tShe has other things to do, Dave.\n\nWillcox smiles apologetically at girl.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tSupposed to get two drinks in the\n\tfirst place. This friggin' airline\n\tcan't do nothin' right.\n\nThe stewardess purses her lips at Dave, who is bowed over his\ndrink busy opening it. Hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl\nas if to say, \"Don't blame me because of this damned idiot,\"\nand she half smiles at him.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(obviously getting him off\n\t\t subject)\n\tTell me about that job in\n\tAlexandria, Dave, the big motel\n\tyou're building.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(with pedantic exactitude,\n\t\t the man is a complete\n\t\t pain in the ass)\n\tNear Alexandria. It isn't in\n\tAlexandria, it is outside it.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER\n\tI see. Outside it.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE\n\tThat's correct -- outside it, not\n\tin it. As for the job, well, the\n\tJewboy suppliers give me a lot of\n\tgrief and we use a pile of niggers\n\tto haul and tote and they ain't\n\tworth a sorry-ass damn. \n\t\t(takes big swallow of\n\t\t drink)\n\tBut I can build anything, Buddy.\n\tGive me the plans and I can build a\n\tgoddamn staircase to the moon. It's\n\ta fact, I can build anything... \n\t\t(pauses, then bitterly)\n\t... but she never believed that.\n\tOh, hell, no, she never believed in\n\tme.\n\nThis is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown\n\"she.\" Once again, Willcox Hillyer is deliberately\nunresponsive.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER\n\tUm-m, well...\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(broodingly)\n\tDoubted my ability all along, the\n\tlittle bitch. I never remarried,\n\tBuddy, you know that, don't you?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tWell, no, I didn't actually.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tShe's te reason -- cured me of\n\twomen once and for all. Oh, I got\n\trid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste\n\tno time kickin' that bitch out.\n\tHell, she was screwin' everybody in\n\tSavannah. I caught her in a motel\n\twith this long tall son of a bitch\n\tand boy did I beat the everlastin'\n\tpiss out of him!\n\nDave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it\nand one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the\nman. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a\ndangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade\ncontinues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and\npale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and\nhe is struggling to control himself.\n\nDave's tone and voice are laconically Southern, but the\nhatred and misery in his eyes are raw.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)\n\tShe didn't marry him, though, later\n\tshe married another guy and went to\n\tWinston-Salem. It didn't last\n\tThat girl couldn't have no lastin'\n\tmarriage, she left him and married\n\tanother dumb sucker and went out\n\twest. Little bitch left him, too,\n\tand you know what she's married to\n\tright now?\n\t\t(puts a big finger on\n\t\t Hillyer's chest)\n\tA kike. That's right, some kind of\n\tkike horse doctor named Schapiro\n\tout in Seattle, who's got the nerve\n\tto have the same first name I got.\n\tWouldn't you know it, Rose would\n\twind up married to a goddamn kike?\n\tShe was always out of her friggin'\n\thead and I'll tell you why.\n\t\t(his eyes narrow and again\n\t\t he puts a finger on\n\t\t Hillyer's chest)\n\tBuddy, she was sick in her mind and\n\tbetween her legs, too. She was\n\ta nymphomaniac.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER\n\t\t(he has had enough; with a\n\t\t pale trembling anger and\n\t\t in even tone)\n\tDave, you are as full of shit as a\n\tChristmas turkey and you know it.\n\tNow if you want to start a fight on\n\tthis plane and get yourself in\n\tjail, go right ahead. But I am\n\ttelling you, you are full of shit\n\tright up to your eyeballs.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(with surprising mildness;\n\t\t a little smile almost as\n\t\t if he is pleased)\n\tI don't want to start no fight with\n\tyou, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full\n\tof shit?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tDave Schapiro is no horse doctor\n\tand Rose has been a good wife to\n\thim for a long time. To call her a\n\tnymphomaniac is the most stupid\n\tthing I ever heard in my life.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(again surprisingly mild)\n\tYou loved her, didn't you. Well, so\n\tdid I. \n\t\t(a little shrug)\n\tYou'll have to admit she had four\n\thusbands.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tYeah, it took her a while to grow\n\tup and find Mr. Right, but she did\n\tit. She found him.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(another little smile)\n\tShe used to call me Mr. Right.\n\tRemember that, Buddy?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(he is pale with anger)\n\tYeah, I remember it.\n\nWillcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tWell, I tell you, I don't know what\n\tthe world's come to these days.\n\tThings used to be better. We didn't\n\thave any money, but things were\n\tbetter. \n\t\t(grimaces in anger)\n\tGoddamn niggers and kikes burning\n\tthe flag, rioting, raising hell --\n\tthey ought to shoot their asses\n\toff. I tell you, Buddy, where this\n\tcountry made its mistake was\n\tallowing people without property to\n\tvote.\n\nDuring this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says\nnothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave\nshakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY\n\nA shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta\nairport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of\nthe shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is\npolitely cool, Wilkie under a great strain.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(holds out hand)\n\tWell, got to get a plane to\n\tSavannah. Great running into you,\n\tBuddy. Give my best to your Daddy.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tYeah, I'll do that, Dave.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(sweating, tense, under\n\t\t some kind of awful\n\t\t emotional strain)\n\tAh-h, if you happen to run into\n\tRose sometime... do me a favor,\n\tgive her a message for me, will\n\tyou?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(a trifle wearily)\n\tDave, I haven't seen Rose for\n\tyears.\n\nHillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ\nGIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.\nIn desperation, Dave takes his arm.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\tBuddy, I'm a sick man. I had a\n\theart attack last year, I wasn't\n\texpected to live.\n\nHillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly\nexplains.\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)\n\tYou might see her. She writes your\n\tDaddy, and she and that doctor came\n\tto see him, didn't they? I wish\n\tyou'd tell her something... I never\n\tcould write letters.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(in a different tone,\n\t\t interested, curious)\n\tWhat do you want me to tell her,\n\tDave?\n\n\t\t\tDAVE WILKIE \n\t\t(a painful inward\n\t\t struggle; the man is\n\t\t tormented, miserable)\n\tOh, to hell with it, never mind.\n\tDon't tell her anything. Don't even\n\ttell her you saw me. \n\t\t(half turns his back, his\n\t\t face twisted with strong\n\t\t emotion)\n\tGot to run, Buddy, I'll miss my\n\tplane.\n\nWillcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after\nDave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer\nseems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half\nto himself, half to the Hertz Girl.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tHe still loves her. The poor damn\n\tfool still loves her.\n\n\t\t\tHERTZ GIRL \n\tWho was she?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tA girl named Rose.\n\t\t(pulls himself back into\n\t\t the world of reality)\n\tStill take R75 to Glenville?\n\n\t\t\tHERTZ GIRL \n\tYes, sir.\n\nWillcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag.\n\nEXT.

GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY\n\nOn the red Ford as it speeds along a Georgia Interstate\nthrough red clay hills in green springtime.\n\nINT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY\n\nCUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the\ncar. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion\nis on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with\namusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on\nthe track Louis Armstrong's great version of \"DIXIE,\" or\nmusic of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.\nNow the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the\ntitles, we are beginning to hear it full force.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nBLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK:\n\nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY\n\nA shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a\nhouse in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is\nBUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he\nshades his eyes to look at something far away.\n\nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\nCUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl\nwalking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE\ntakes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase\ntied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are\ndusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and\nseems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her\nprimary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and\nsweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with\nthe back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she\nstares ahead uncertainly at the \"nice\" Southern home which to\nher seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened\nand apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted\nfrom the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She\nblinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces\nherself to walk on.\n\nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH\n\nCUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless,\nunreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an\neven gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his\nhips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a\nmannerism of his father's.\nBuddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always\nwith complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands\nthere, waiting.\n\nEXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY\n\nCUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A\ntentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she\nis nervous and frightened.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tHello. I'm Rose, and I've come to\n\tlive with you and your family.\n\nSilence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen,\nRose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another\nlittle smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the\nsteps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot.\nHe still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his\nexpression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.\n\n\t\t\tROSE (CONT'D)\n\tWhat's your name? What do they call\n\tyou?\n\nFinally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child\nafter all.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tLots of things. Buddy, mostly.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(greatly reassured, a real\n\t\t smile now)\n\tBuddy. Well, now, that's a nice\n\tname, I like it. I am real pleased\n\tto meet you. \n\t\t(solemnly holds out her\n\t\t hand, they shake)\n\tHey, look, do you think you got a\n\tcold drink of ice water somewhere?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\tSure. Let me take your suitcase.\n\nA warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little\ntwinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are\nnot lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes\nboys and men.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYou're sweet.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY\n\nCUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris\nchair in her bedroom study.\n\nMOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly\neccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a\nVictorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment\nMother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history\nbooks are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She\nis drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a\nbobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room.\nThe CAMERA pulls back to include him.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tThe new girl is here.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWonderful. What's she like,\n\tBrother? What is your impression of\n\ther?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tShe talks a great deal and smiles a\n\tlot. She's very pretty, she has a\n\treal good figure. She's very\n\tgirlish or womanish, if you know\n\twhat I mean. She wouldn't hurt\n\tanybody, this girl. She couldn't.\n\nMother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as\nperfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tYour impression is very reassuring,\n\tBrother. Of course she's had\n\ttroubles, poor thing, but I sensed\n\tthat was that the girl was like and\n\tI'm glad to have it reconfirmed.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tYou mean confirmed, Mother. I\n\tdidn't confirm it before. I would\n\thave had to confirm it previously,\n\tin order for it to be reconfirmed.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tAll right, all right. Doll and\n\tWaski are upstairs taking their\n\tnap, you go get them and bring them\n\tdown to the living room. Where is\n\tthe girl?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tIn the kitchen drinking all the ice\n\twater in Glenville. She walked out\n\there, she didn't go by the hotel.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWalked, in all that heat? It's a\n\twonder she hasn't got sunstroke.\n\tI'll phone Daddy and you go get\n\tDoll Baby and Waski.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM\n\nA shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living\nroom of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl\nof about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle,\nvery sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own\nchildren has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than\noffensive.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tRose, this is Waski. His real name\n\tis Warren but we call him Waski. He\n\tdoesn't like it much and I suppose\n\tsomeday we'll have to stop calling\n\thim that.\n\n\t\t\tWASKI\n\tYou can stop it right now.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWhen he was baby we called him \"Wa\n\tWa,\" a baby name, you know. You\n\twill find him a very good boy. His\n\tbrother can be bad and so can his\n\tsister, but Waski is a very good\n\tboy. And as you can see he's\n\tbeautiful.\n\n\t\t\tWASKI \n\tOh, Mother, cut it out.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(serenely)\n\tThere are plenty of girls who would\n\tgive thousands of dollars to have\n\tyour auburn hair. Beauty is beauty\n\tand that's all there is to it.\n\tBeauty is there and we have to\n\trecognize it. Now Rose, the little\n\tgirl sitting across from you with\n\tthe blue eyes is Doll Baby. She\n\tlooks like an angel and she is an\n\tangel, but she can be a naughty\n\tangel sometimes, although her\n\tfather won't believe it. Her real\n\tname is Frances, but we call her\n\tDolly or Doll.\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\tI don't like that, either, it's\n\tworse than Waski. I want to be\n\tcalled Fran.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tDaddy wouldn't hear that. Now the\n\tredhaired boy you see sitting\n\tthere, of course you have met him,\n\the is my oldest son and my most\n\tbrilliant child. All children have\n\tgreat creative powers, but I don't\n\twant to rattle on about my\n\tchildren, they say I brag too much\n\tabout them, especially about\n\tBrother. Am I boring you, Rose?\n\nRose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is\nstaring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(feebly)\n\tOh, no, ma'am.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWell, it's rather interesting about\n\tBrother, actually. I realized the\n\tremarkable thing he had when he was\n\tsix weeks old. He looked at me and\n\tunderstood me, he knew exactly who\n\tI was. I know it sounds crazy but\n\tit's true. He's very remarkable, he\n\twas born for the ministry and could\n\tmove millions, but he doesn't know\n\tthat yet. I have to warn you about\n\thim, he can be very dangerous,\n\tthere is an evil streak in him, a\n\tstreak of pure sheer meanness. But\n\tat heart Brother is saintly and\n\tthat is why he was born for the\n\tministry even if he doesn't know\n\tit.\n\nThus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with\nreality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and\nvery, very gentle and kind.\nHer style, however, takes a little getting used to and her\nlong speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in\nspeechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word.\n\nThe CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips,\nswallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous.\nNow she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine\nVOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer,\nBuddy's father.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY'S VOICE \n\tHoney, you'll scare the gizzard out\n\tof the girl going into the fourth\n\tdimension like that.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He\nis a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner\nall his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and\nfunny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern\ndignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a\ncomedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the\ncharacters in this story love and fear him. We see now where\nBuddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on\nthe hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the\nback of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his\nhand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what\nseems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude\nreally is inscrutable.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tIt isn't the fourth dimension. To\n\tyou it's the fourth dimension,\n\tmaybe, to me it's simply the truth.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(staring fiercely at Rose)\n\tWell, well, well. So Miss Rosebud\n\thas arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all\n\tassembled here. Yes, indeed. Un\n\thmmm.\n\nDaddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious\nhe scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually\nas if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her\nknees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she\nhas a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of\nhim, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair\nbeside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins\na long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no\nclown, he is not \"being funny,\" he means every word he says.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY (CONT'D)\n\tWell, Rosebud, now you are here,\n\tdarling, and I swear to God\n\tgraceful as the capital letter S.\n\tYou will adorn our house, Rosebud,\n\tyou will give a glow and a shine to\n\tthese old walls. If there's one\n\tthing I like to have around, it's a\n\tfrizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume\n\tMrs. Hillyer and the children have\n\tintroduced themselves and made your\n\tacquaintance, and so forth and so\n\ton?\n\nRose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on\nhim, a half whisper.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYes, sir.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tAll right. Now as head of this\n\thousehold I have a couple of\n\tremarks to make. It is my dear\n\twife's belief, which I accept\n\talthough I do not totally grasp it,\n\tthat to hire a person to do\n\thousehold work is a criminal\n\tpractice. Therefore, you are here\n\tnot as a servant, you are here as a\n\tfriend, as a guest and hopefully as\n\ta member of this family. You will\n\teat your meals with us, you will\n\tshare life itself with us -- in\n\tlove and harmony, dear Rosebud, in\n\tlove and harmony. Do you understand\n\tme?\n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\t\t(a half whisper)\n\tYes, sir.\n\nDaddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness\nand kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes\nbegin to well with tears.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tNow, I know you've had some\n\ttroubles in your life, those...\n\tscoundrels in Birmingham and so\n\tforth trying to... lead you astray.\n\tI hope you find a safe haven here,\n\thoney, I know you've had a hard\n\ttime. Life can be cruel to a young\n\tgirl all alone. We welcome you to\n\tour home, Rosebud, we all welcome\n\tyou from the heart and hope you are\n\thappy here.\n\nRose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an\ninaudible whisper.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYes, sir.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME\n\nVARIOUS SHOTS of Rose doing household chores: sweeping the\nfloor, vacuuming, cooking. She is cheerful in her work,\nsmiling, good-humored and she works hard. It is obvious she\nis happy. We see the children in most of these shots. It is\napparent Rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new\nhome.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY\n\nRose is washing the dishes while the children finish\nbreakfast. Buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a\nslightly sly expression.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tRose, who were those scoundrels in\n\tBirmingham?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tNobody.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tBut who were they?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tThey were just bad men, that's all.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tIn what sense were they bad?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no\n\tsense to it.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tDid they try to induce you to\n\tbecome a prostitute?\n\nRose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the\ndishcloth.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI don't answer talk like that,\n\tBuddy. I just don't hear it, I turn\n\tmy back and look away.\n\nRose turns her back on him.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWas that what they tried to do? Was\n\tthat why Daddy gave you the job, to\n\tsave you from those scoundrels?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYour Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll\n\tsay that. He's the best and most\n\tkind-hearted man in the world.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tHey, Rose, did you hear about that\n\tterrible thing down in Cave\n\tSprings?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tWhat terrible thing in Cave\n\tSprings?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tThere was this old man that ate his\n\tniece.\n\nRose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips\ntogether.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI didn't hear you. I didn't hear\n\tthat.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tHe really did, he ate his little\n\tniece. He made pork chops out of\n\ther.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI don't hear you. I just turn my\n\tback on that kind of talk and look\n\taway.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWell, it's only the truth. There\n\tare horrible things in the world,\n\tRose.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBuddy, you are in one of your evil\n\tmoods, I don't want to talk to you.\n\tI'm going out and sweep the patio.\n\nRose exits and the CAMERA stays on Buddy, Doll and Waski.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tRose is almost as sentimental as\n\tMother. If there's one thing I\n\tcan't stand it's sentimentality. In\n\tChattanooga this man committed an\n\talmost perfect murder. He killed\n\this wife with a black widow spider.\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\tOh, shut up, Buddy.\n\n\t\t\tWASKI \n\tYeah, shut up.\n\nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY\n\nCUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer\nhouse, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and\ncrabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The\nCAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer,\nMother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the\npatio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down\ncuriously at her.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tWhat are you studying now, Mrs.\n\tHillyer?\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tMore history, Rose.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tAre you going to get your degree\n\tsoon?\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWell, I am working on my thesis.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(as she busily sweeps)\n\tIt must be wonderful to be so\n\tsmart. I don't see how you do it,\n\treading all those books, learning\n\tall that stuff.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(looks up, and gently)\n\tRose, you work too hard. Why don't\n\tyou go sit down somewhere and drink\n\ta Co-Cola?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(smiles, trusts and knows\n\t\t Mother now, not at all\n\t\t afraid of her)\n\tYou're so sweet.\n\nRose again busily sweeps.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tReally, why don't you go sit down\n\tsomewhere?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI like to work. I don't mind work.\n\tIt's the least I can do after all\n\tyou and Mr. Hillyer have done for\n\tme. \n\t\t(stares worshipfully at\n\t\t Mother)\n\tYou're so sweet. There never was\n\tnobody like you.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(gently)\n\tWell, you run on now.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYes, Ma'am.\n\nExit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of\na history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound\nof an approaching CAR and she glances up.\n\nEXT.

Beautiful\n\tday.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tYes, it's so nice I thought I'd\n\twork outside.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tHow goes it, darlin'?\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tSlow, hon. But at least I can\n\tconcentrate now that Rose is here.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tWhat do you think of her, honey?\n\nMother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her\nnotebook.

I don't\n\tunderstand all this skepticism. I\n\tthought you liked Rose.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tI love Rosebud, I am wild about\n\tRosebud. I just hope she doesn't\n\tturn out to be a hidden hotcha\n\tcharacter, that's all. We have\n\tgrowing children in the house.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tHotcha character. If I had to live\n\twith your cynicism, I wouldn't want\n\tto live at all.

A\n\tthousand millionaires.\n\nRose suddenly makes up her mind, places her hand on his\nshoulder, turns sideways, sits down on his lap, puts an arm\naround his neck.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tOh, oh! Oh, Mr. Hillyer, I love\n\tyou, I love you so much! I've\n\ttried, but I can't help it! Please\n\tkiss me -- will you kiss me?\n\nFor a long time Daddy stares groggily at her with a half\nfrown as if he can't believe it. In order to stare at her, he\nmust tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he\nlooks a bit like a startled rooster. Her breasts are pressed\nagainst him, and her eager -pink lips are waiting for a kiss.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(finally clears his\n\t\t throat)\n\tAhh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap.\n\tWhat are you doing, girl? Are you\n\tcrazy?\n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\tYes, crazy about you!

Please kiss me, Mr.\n\tHillyer, I love you, I love you so\n\tmuch...\n\nRose breaks down and begins crying, her head on his shoulder.\nShe has her arms wound tight around him and Daddy seems at a\nloss what to do.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY\n\t\t(in a shaken voice)\n\tAll right, all right. Now calm\n\tdown, Rose, the children will hear\n\tyou. Calm down, let's talk... about\n\tthis thing, let's discuss it.\n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\t\t(sobbing)\n\tDon't make me... me... me... get\n\tup!\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tCalm down, Rose, let's calm down\n\tand discuss it ...\n\nINT.

The CAMERA\nFOLLOWS them as they tiptoe out of the living room.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STAIRS - NIGHT\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy and Doll as they tiptoe up the front\nstairs.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT\n\nON Buddy and Doll at the top of the stairs. They pause to\ntalk and now they don't have to whisper. Doll is happy,\npleased.\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\tWasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted\n\tto kiss her some more and play with\n\ther, but he didn't, because he\n\tloves Mother and all of us, and he\n\tloves Rose, too. Isn't he\n\twonderful, isn't he great?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(dryly, aloof; he doesn't\n\t\t mean this really)\n\tWonderful? He kissed her and played\n\twith her titty, and I don't see\n\tanything so great about that. He\n\twas probably afraid Mother would\n\tcome back early and catch him.\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\tYou know, Buddy, sometimes you make\n\tme sick.\n\nDoll gives him a venomous glance and walks away. The CAMERA\nSTAYS on Buddy as he stares after her with a thin little\nsmile. Be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry.\nAfter a moment, he turns and stares in the direction of\ndownstairs and his face changes. His smile fades, then slowly\nreturns as he thinks of what has happened.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(quietly, to himself)\n\tThermopylae. The Persians shall not\n\tpass.\n\nIt is obvious that secretly Buddy admires very much his\nfather's behavior.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nA shot of Buddy at night in his small bedroom.\n\nHe wears a rather skimpy old-fashioned nightshirt that comes\nmidway between his hips and knees. At the moment he is\nfinishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old\nfashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he\nwalks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. He\nlooks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his\nbed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a\nsmall \"book\" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it.\n\nCLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall\ntitle: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND\nDAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: \"Mr. Dithers\nComes to Dinner -- and How!\" We see Buddy's hands in the\nshot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a\nglimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing\nmaybe of \"Blondie\" stark naked with a finger in her mouth\ngoing, \"Tee-Hee!\"\n\nON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the\nLittle Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to\nthe bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the\nbed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the\nflashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a\nfaint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the\ncovers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and\nthrows the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on\npillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his\nroom OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. The\nshot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands over\nhis bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half\ncrying.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBuddy... are you asleep?\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on both of them. Buddy stares at her in\nsurprise. It is dim in the room, but we can see them in the\nmoonlight.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\tNo, I'm awake. What's the matter?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBuddy, I am wandering in a\n\twilderness, lost. \n\t\t(sits glumly on edge of\n\t\t bed)\n\tI just feel awful. Do you mind if I\n\tget in bed with you for a little\n\twhile?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWell, all right.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed in the moonlight.\nIt is all innocent enough, Buddy is a child and Rose\nobviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed. She\nlies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a\ncigarette.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI thought I'd go crazy back there\n\tin that room all by myself with\n\tnobody to talk to. As a child, I\n\tnever had no room all to myself, we\n\twere awful poor. Buddy... I have\n\tgot a confession to make.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWhat is it, Rose?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tIt's so terrible I can't tell you.\n\tOh, Buddy, you don't know how it\n\thurts to have a broken heart, what\n\ta terrible feeling it is, and I've\n\thad a broken heart so many times.\n\tMen, I don't understand them, I\n\tcan't figure them out and they\n\tbreak my heart, that's all. I can't\n\tfind Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find\n\thim no matter how hard I look, all\n\tI find is a whole pile of Mr.\n\tWrongs. But this is the worst ever\n\tbecause it wasn't his fault. It was\n\tmy fault, oh yes, my fault, I was\n\tbad -- oh God, I was bad, you\n\twouldn't believe how bad I was.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(a little smile)\n\tWhat'd you do, Rose?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBuddy, I was horrible. I can't tell\n\tyou who it was, but do you know\n\twhat I did? I sat on his lap and\n\tgot ahold of him and wiggled and\n\twiggled my ass on him and was\n\tworse'n you could know, a child\n\tlike you. Why, I let one of my tits\n\tfall out deliberate on purpose and\n\tpractically smack him in the face\n\twith it and I let my dern skirt\n\tcome up so he could see my\n\tdrawers... \n\t\t(pauses, realizes this\n\t\t isn't too dignified)\n\tBut to get back serious to what I\n\twas sayin', it is not only, Buddy,\n\tthe loss of him but my own bad\n\tbehavior what bothers me so...\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tYou were pretty bad, huh?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tWhy, it has just made me ill,\n\tBuddy. I'm sick. I don't want to\n\teat nothin', I don't, and me I got\n\ta good appetite, that ain't nat'ral\n\tfor me. I'm ill.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\t\t(slyly, pretends he\n\t\t doesn't know)\n\tBut, Rose, what is the cause of it\n\tall?\n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\tPromise not to tell Doll? -- or\n\tnobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm\n\tso much in love with him I am out\n\tof my mind!\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\tBut, Rose, how could such a thing\n\tas that happen?\n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\tI fell madly in love with him when\n\the called me Rosebud. You know that\n\tfirst day when I come and he said I\n\tlooked graceful like a capital\n\tletter S and called me Rosebud? I\n\tfell madly in love with that man\n\tright then.\n\t\t(sighs tragically)\n\tBut it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a\n\tgood man and won't have nothin' to\n\tdo with me.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has\npropped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the\nmoonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the\nopen V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself\nconscious with him.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(casually)\n\tCan I touch you here?\n\nBefore she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger\nthrough her nightgown.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY (CONT'D)\n\tHmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(casually, doesn't object)\n\tWhat did you expect?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWell, I thought they were more like\n\ta cantaloupe.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tHa ha ha, that's some idea, a\n\tcantaloupe.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(touches her breast more\n\t\t boldly, his hand outside\n\t\t the nightgown)\n\tThere's some kind of gristle in it,\n\tthough.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBuddy, quit that, you're just a\n\tchild, you're not supposed to be\n\tinterested in such things.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tActually, I am, though.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(dreamily, thinking of\n\t\t Daddy as she smokes\n\t\t cigarette and stares up\n\t\t at the ceiling)\n\tYou know, that Daddy of yours is\n\tthe funniest man, the things he\n\tsays, you never know what's going\n\tto come out of his mouth next.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\tCan I put my hand inside your\n\tnightgown, Rose?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tNo, you can't. And I'll tell you\n\tthis -- he scares me. As kind as he\n\tis, he scares me. You can't fool\n\taround with him, not with that man.\n\tAnd, boy, I sure better not try\n\tnothin' like that with him again,\n\the'll fire me.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\tRose, can't I see what the nipple\n\ton it is like?\n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\t\t(frowns)\n\tBuddy, what's come over you?

Quit\n\tit, get you hand away...\n\nTakes his wrist.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tJust for a second. Please, Rose,\n\twhat's the harm?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(gently)\n\tBuddy, you don't realize it but\n\twhat you're doing isn't nice.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tAw, come on, Rose, I want to see\n\twhat the nipple on it is like.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYou don' t need to know that. It's\n\tnone of your business.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tAw, be a good sport, Rose. \n\t\t(sweetly, almost sugarily)\n\tYou like me, don't you? I like you\n\ta lot.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We\nsee Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly\nout into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in\nthe background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in\nthe grip of \"insomnia in reverse.\"\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet\ntalked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in\nher nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on\nRose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.\nBuddy seems quite fascinated, however.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tWell, are you satisfied now? Can we\n\tjust lie and talk, huh?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tHmmph. It has a nipple, all right.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t'Course it does.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tFirst I couldn't feel it, but now I\n\tfeel it easily, it's like a little\n\tacorn.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(moistens her lips,\n\t\t swallows; it is affecting\n\t\t her; she frowns)\n\tAll right, that's enough. \n\t\t(firmly pushes his hand\n\t\t away)\n\tYou're just a child and wouldn't\n\tunderstand it, but that type of\n\tthing can stir a girl up. Now lie\n\tback and we'll talk.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tThat was very interesting. Thank\n\tyou, Rose.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(lighting cigarette)\n\tDon't mention it.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\t\t(pensively, with the\n\t\t solemn pedanticness of a\n\t\t precocious child)\n\tIt was softer'n I thought, that was\n\tmy main impression. You know, if\n\tyou hit a girl there it would hurt\n\ther a lot.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tWho would want to do such a thing\n\tas that?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWell, some fiend might.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(stares wonderingly at\n\t\t him)\n\tYou know, Buddy, sometimes I can't\n\tfigure you out at all.

What\n\tan awful thing to say, and where\n\tdid you get any such idea as that,\n\tanyhow?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tI'm curious to see what it's like.\n\tI'm very curious, Rose.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tWell, now that is just too bad!\n\tCuriosity killed the cat.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tYeah, but satisfaction brought him\n\tback.

Be\nglances over his shoulder as we hear Mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWhat's the matter, hon? Is anything\n\twrong?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tNo, darlin'. Just that damnable\n\tinsomnia in reverse. I sleep like a\n\tbaby for an hour then I'm wide\n\tawake. You go back to sleep.\n\nDaddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares\nout at the moonlit night.\n\nThe CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER on his face and we see a weariness\nand strain he has not shown before.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tThe Depression has got me. That\n\tmiserable hotel, no money anywhere,\n\tstrong men out of work, children\n\thungry. It's a great life if you\n\tdon't weaken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nA shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has\nweakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can\nonly surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders\nand a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A\ndifferent look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she\nis listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely\nhaunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble\nvoice.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYou better quit that.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tBut Rose...\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI must be outta my mind. Buddy,\n\tquit it.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tAm I hurting you?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(pauses, stares off as if\n\t\t listening, then in an\n\t\t even feebler tone, a half\n\t\t whisper)\n\tNo. No, you're not hurting me. \n\t\t(moistens her lips,\n\t\t swallows)\n\tBut I think you better quit it.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tBut why, if I'm not hurting you?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYou wouldn't understand.\n\t\t(puts a hand on his\n\t\t shoulder as if to push\n\t\t him away, but can't; puts\n\t\t her other hand over her\n\t\t eyes)\n\tOh, God, I must be outta my mind.\n\tWhat would your Momma think?\n\nThe hand falls limply from Rose's eyes and she turns her head\nto the side and closes her eyes. Helplessly, she lies there\nas the boy fiddles with her.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in a\nbathrobe and slippers. He looks very frowzled and sleepy.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nON Daddy as he walks into the kitchen, turns on the light. He\ngoes to the ice box, an old-fashioned type made of wood that\ntakes cakes of ice. Be pours out a glass of milk.\n\nINT. HILLYER ROME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO a very CLOSE SHOT on Rose's face. The light is dim but\nwe see perspiration on her forehead. Her breathing is not\nnormal. Her eyes are shut tight, her teeth are clenched.\n\nCUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy. We do not see what he is doing,\nbut evidently he is fiddling with her. He seems quite\ninterested in the proceedings.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tRose, beyond a doubt this is the\n\tmost fascinating experience of my\n\tlife.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO a shot of Daddy in the kitchen as he sits rather\ngloomily at the kitchen table drinking the glass Of milk.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(to himself)\n\tEhh-hh, Lord, man born of woman\n\thath few days and they are full of\n\ttrouble.\n\nINT.

Ohhh-hh! \n\t\t(it's all over; she twists\n\t\t sideways, puts both arms\n\t\t around him)\n\tOh, Buddy, you're so sweet. I love\n\tyou a lot.\n\nINT.

The extremity of\nher crime has dawned on Rose and she is sitting up in the bed\nwith a look of horror on her face. Buddy is staring worriedly\nat her.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tRose, are you all right? Are you\n\tsick or something?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(staring off in space,\n\t\t lost in horror)\n\tNo. No, I'm all right. \n\t\t(turns, stares at him,\n\t\t puts a hand in woe on her\n\t\t forehead)\n\tOh, God, what have I done? I have\n\trobbed a cradle and fallen into\n\thell!\n\t\t(fumbles desperately on\n\t\t bed for cigarettes)\n\tI must be crazy, a child like you.\n\tOh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful,\n\tthis is terrible, I gotta get outta\n\there!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy as Rose in a panic gets out\nof the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward\nthe door. She stops and looks back as a chilling thought\noccurs to her.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBuddy, you wouldn't tell nobody,\n\twould you?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(a trifle too piously)\n\tDon't worry, Rose, I won't tell a\n\tsoul.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI sure hope you don't.\n\t\t(still in a panic)\n\tI gotta get outta here, good night.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(sweetly)\n\tGood night, Rose.\n\nINT. HILLYER SOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND DOWNSTAIRS HALL\n\nCUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in\nhis bathrobe. The shot is down the staircase and Rose in the\nupstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. A floorboard creaks\nand he looks up and sees her.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tRose, what are you doing up?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tNothin', just goin' to the\n\tbathroom.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tIs anything wrong?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tNo, sir.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tWell, good night.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE on Rose in the upstairs hall. Fortunately for\nher the light is dim. Her knees are shaking beneath the\nnightgown, she looks as if she might faint.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tGood night.\n\nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she goes on shaky legs down the\nhall.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom.\nFeebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind\nher then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror.\nThe horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With\ntrembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty\npack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau.\nHer hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has\nnot turned on the light in her room and her considerable\ncharms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match.\nBurning match in her fingers, she stares at her own\nreflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible\nrealization.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - DREAM - CELLAR\n\nQUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is\nblurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. The\nshot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous Buddy\nand an astonished, awed DOLL. They are in some far dark\nrecess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive,\nmurky, cobwebby.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWait till you hear what happened!\n\tNow you wont believe this, Doll,\n\tbut Rose came in my room and got in\n\tmy bed last night...\n\nANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy from below with candlelight giving his\nchild's face a sinister look. Now he has \"Dracula\" teeth and\nevil arched eyebrows.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY (CONT'D)\n\t... and she sweated and snorted\n\tlike a horse and had a horrible\n\tfit, her eyebrows were all\n\tscrunched up and she groaned like\n\tshe was eying and foamed at the\n\tmouth!\n\nINT.

The border of the screen is blurred, it is another flash\nof fantasy.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tYes, dear, what is it?\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\tMother, Buddy says Rose got in his\n\tbed last night and he fiddled with\n\ther and she snorted and had a fit --\n\tand he says I would too if I was\n\tgrown-up. Is it true, Mother --\n\twould I sweat and snort and froth\n\tat the mouth and have a horrible\n\tfit like he says?\n\nMother stares in consternation at Doll.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQUICK CUT TO:\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT\n\nA shot of Daddy and Rose on the front porch of the house. The\nscene is murky, dark, gloomy night and the weather is bad.\nDaddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down\nthe driveway. A weeping, slumped Rose sadly walks down the\nsteps carrying her cardboard suitcase. Fantasy.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tOut! Out, you viper in the grass!\n\tOut! Never darken our doorstep, you\n\timmoral, terrible girl!\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT BACK to Rose standing before the mirror, sick with\nhorror. A feeble whimper-like groan comes from her.\n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\tOhh-hh, ohhh-hh... \n\t\t(match burns her fingers,\n\t\t she shakes it out)\n\tOuch! Oh-hh... ohh...\n\nANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she turns from the bureau and stares\noff into space, a very badly frightened girl. Half-crying,\nshe speaks to herself.\n\n\t\t\tROSE (CONT'D)\n\tHe'll tell 'em for sure, he will.\n\tOh, Lord, what can I do?\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO a shot of Buddy half asleep in bed. The light of the\nlamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. The\nCAMERA COMES BACK and we see Rose in her nightgown standing\nby his bedside. She is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tI hate to turn on this light, you\n\tDaddy's awake downstairs, but I\n\thave to take the chance.\n\t\t(sits by him on bed)\n\tBuddy, please don't tell on me.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\t\t(rather coolly)\n\tI said I wouldn't. \n\n\t\t\tROSE\n\t\t(her lip trembles)\n\tBuddy, I have to ask you, as bad as\n\tI've been please have pity on me\n\tand don't ruin me by telling them\n\twhat I did. I know it was bad, it\n\twas bad and dumb. But mostly it was\n\tdumb, I didn't mean you no harm,\n\tI'd never want to hurt a hair on\n\tyour head and that's the truth. I\n\tlove you. But they'd think I did,\n\tthey'd think I was awful, they'd\n\tdespise me and hate me...\n\nRose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.\n\nCUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of Rose\nweeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty child's\nheart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it\nyet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain \"cool\"\nand not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips,\nswallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scene\nwith Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at\nThermopylae, he shrugs.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tWell, I don't know what you're\n\tworried about. It was my idea, I\n\twas the one who thought of it, not\n\tyou.\n\nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Rose. She is staring at the\nboy with hopeless despair.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYou don't understand. They'd blame\n\tme, not you. And they'd think I was\n\tawful, a disgustin' girl, which I\n\tam, but Buddy, please don't tell\n\tthem. Please don't. Ill have to go\n\tand I love it here, I love your\n\twhole fam'ly, your Daddy, your\n\tMother... \n\t\t(pauses, then makes her\n\t\t final and ultimate plea\n\t\t in a shaking voice as\n\t\t tears run down)\n\tBuddy, I know I'm no good, I'm a\n\tbad girl but I can't help it,\n\tplease have pity on me and don't\n\ttell! Please don't, please...\n\nToo much for Buddy, he loses his \"cool.\" He swallows and\nblinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and\nsquares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression Daddy\nstyle.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(very solemnly)\n\tRose, they could stick splinters\n\tunder my fingernails, and I will\n\tnever say a word! I will never tell\n\tthem, because... I love you!\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(sees that he means it,\n\t\t smiles in relief and\n\t\t throws her arms around\n\t\t him)\n\tOh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew\n\tyou did, knew it all the time...\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nCUT TO a shot of Daddy, lying in bed and staring up\nsleeplessly at the ceiling.

I wasn't\n\tgonna run around, but when I start\n\tbotherin' your Daddy and worse\n\trobbin' a cradle, I gotta face the\n\tfacts of life. \n\t\t(pauses, then with firm\n\t\t resolution)\n\tTomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get\n\tmyself up and go out.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(a wee mite puzzled)\n\tYou're going to get yourself up and\n\tgo out?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tBuddy, Mr. Right is out there\n\tsomewhere and I'm gonna find him!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY\n\nA shot of a coolly angry Mother in the kitchen. It is late\nmorning. As she talks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show a\nsheepish Buddy standing \"on the carpet before her. The other\nchildren, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table\nhaving hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling with\nschadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tBrother, when I have to wake you up\n\tat eleven o'clock in the morning\n\tyou're either sick or you were up\n\tvery late last night. \n\t\t(points a finger at him)\n\tAnd you weren't reading Huckleberry\n\tFinn. I looked and its not in your\n\troom. Now what were you doing?\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\t\t(sheepish)\n\tMother, I have to tell the truth. I\n\twasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I\n\twas reading one of those Little\n\tDirty Comic Books.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(sadly)\n\tOh, Brother, I am so disappointed\n\tin you. You mustn't look at those\n\thorrible things, they degrade the\n\thuman image.\n\n\t\t\tBROTHER \n\t\t(hangs head)\n\tThey're filthy, Mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tSex isn't ugly, sex is one of the\n\tmost beautiful things in life, the\n\tcreative power of the universe is\n\tbehind it.\n\n\t\t\tBROTHER \n\tI know, Mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tBut we must respect that power, we\n\tmust be in awe of it.\n\n\t\t\tBROTHER \n\tI am in awe of it, Mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tI don't think you are sufficiently\n\tin awe of it. Get the castor oil.\n\n\t\t\tBROTHER \n\t\t(winces, as Doll and Waski\n\t\t happily smile)\n\tOh, Mother, not the castor oil.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tThis isn't punishment, I don't\n\tbelieve in punishment. It's for\n\tyour health. Obviously you're sick\n\tif you can act like that.\n\nAs she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil\nand a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling\nDoll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He\nmakes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a\ntablespoon of castor oil.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\t\t(wanly)\n\tMother, cant you make it calomel\n\tinstead of castor oil?\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tThis is for your own good. When you\n\tlook at negative, destructive\n\tthings like those little filthy\n\tcomic books, you are sick. Here,\n\ttake this.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\t\t(he is resigned, there's\n\t\t no way out; he makes a\n\t\t face, swallows the castor\n\t\t oil)\n\tGeccch, yehh, guhhhh!\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tStop gagging like that and putting\n\ton a show, and swallow it. \n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tUhhh, gahdam stuff! \n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWhat did you say, Brother? \n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tI said ahhh-dam stuff. \n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tNo, you didn't say that, Brother.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tYes, I did, mother. Your hearing\n\taid isn't working right. I said\n\tahhh-dam stuff.\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\tNo, Mother, he's lying...\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY\n\tShut up, Doll.

She is\nquite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink\nrouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in\nsome outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most\nremarkable thing of all.\n\nThe skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin\nmaterial and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could\nbe rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the\nleast. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white\nsleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white\nmaterial that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her\nbreasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material.\nIt is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear\nof any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing\nsuit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black\npatent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent\nleather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is\non her face.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tHow do you like my outfit? I made\n\tmost of it myself.\n\nRose walks in, \"modeling\" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP\nMother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(smiling, slightly aghast)\n\tWell, it's... very gay.\n\nWe hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tHere comes Daddy.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(staring down admiringly\n\t\t at the outfit)\n\tI have a knack for designing\n\tclothes. But I had to buy the shoes\n\tand the pocketbook.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(makes up her mind to\n\t\t defend Rose)\n\tWell, I think it's charming, Rose. \n\t\t(tactfully)\n\tBut don't you think... ah, the\n\tskirt is a little tight?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tOh, no, that's the style. It's\n\tmeant to be clinging.\n\nWe hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances\naround. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening.\n\nCUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual,\nhe has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw\nhat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he\nis hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tYe gods and little fishes. What\n\thave you done to yourself, Rose?\n\nON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of\nattention.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tNothin'. I got myself up, that's\n\tall.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tGot yourself up?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tYeah. I'm goin' out.\n\nDaddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at\ntable.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tUm-hmm. Well, that is the damndest\n\toutfit I ever saw in my life. You\n\twalk down the street like that and\n\tthey'll put you in jail, Rose.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWhy, they won't either. She looks\n\tpretty. And I wish you wouldn't\n\tpick on the poor girl all the time.\n\tDon't listen to him, Rose, you look\n\tpretty, even beautiful.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(smiles affectionately at\n\t\t Mother)\n\tYou're so sweet.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tIf you've got time before you go\n\t\"out,\" get me a half-a-cup of\n\tcoffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a\n\thalf-a-cup.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tWhy, sure, always got time to get\n\tyou a half-a-cup, and one of these\n\tdays I'm gonna get you a whole cup\n\tand see what happens.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(a growl, doesn't like\n\t\t jokes about his foibles)\n\tUm-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole\n\tcup, my nerves can't stand the\n\tcaffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful\n\tinsomnia in reverse last night. Lay\n\tthere and sweated blood for hours.\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\t\t(sweetly)\n\tDaddy, Buddy was up late last night\n\treading little dirty comic books.\n\tMother gave him a dose of castor\n\toil and he cursed it, he took the\n\tLords name in vain, then claimed he\n\thadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tYou mustn't be a tattletale, dear.\n\tYou mustn't be Delilah-ish and\n\tJezebel-ish toward your brother,\n\tdear.\n\n\t\t\tDOLL \n\tI'm only trying to help him,\n\tMother.\n\n\t\t\tBUDDY \n\tHeh, what a hypocrite.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(to Daddy)\n\tI do wish you'd speak to Brother.\n\tIt's true he's been looking at\n\tthose horrible little books again.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(stares sternly at Buddy)\n\tLay off of that stuff, son. It\n\tupsets your mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(genuinely worried)\n\tI'm serious. We forget he's just a\n\tchild. I wish you'd speak to him.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tI'll take him with me downtown. \n\t\t(glances at Rose as she\n\t\t comes with coffee)\n\tAnd you, too, Rose, if you want a\n\tride.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tSure, love one. Here's your half-a\n\tcup of coffee.\n\nDaddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt.\nHe slowly shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tThat's a pretty stylish skirt,\n\tRose. The only thing I don't\n\tunderstand is how did you ever get\n\tit on.\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\t\t(happy, pleased by his\n\t\t interest)\n\tWell, it has buttons.\n\nPoints to little buttons on right side of the skirt.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tHow can the buttons stand the\n\tpressure?\n\n\t\t\tROSE \n\tThere are more on the other side.\n\nPoints to buttons on left side.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tTurn around, darlin'.\n\nHappy to oblige, Rose turns around.

Boy friends of Rose,\n\tchat's what they were, and why\n\tshouldn't she have boy friends? Do\n\tyou want her to be unnatural? Don't\n\tyou think she's human the same way\n\tyou are yourself?

The scene is\nhis office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk.\n\nAs he speaks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Daddy, Mother and\nthe Hillyer children.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\tWell, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is\n\tstrong as an ox and that is what is\n\tkeeping her alive. But not many\n\tpeople walk away from double\n\tpneumonia, Madam, not many.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tShe looks terrible, just awful.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\tOf course she does and I must say\n\tI'm puzzled by your delay in\n\tgetting her to the hospital. I\n\tshould think ordinary powers of\n\tobservation would have suggested to\n\tyou that she was seriously ill.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tShe hid it from us, Doctor. She's\n\tafraid of the hospital.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\t\t(a thin superior smile)\n\tAfraid of the hospital?\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tDeathly afraid of it. Her people\n\twere poor tenant farmers and she\n\tdoesn't know anything about doctors\n\tor medicine or hospitals.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\t\t(frowns in open disbelief)\n\tA tenant farm? Are you trying to\n\ttell me that girl is a product of\n\tthe hookworm and pellagra belt?\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWell, her people were very poor.\n\tShe says she was often hungry as a\n\tchild, and I'm sure the food she\n\tate was pretty awful, not a\n\tbalanced diet at all.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\tExactly, and that's why she\n\tcouldn't possibly have come from\n\tsuch a farm.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(icily polite)\n\tExcuse me, sir, are you calling my\n\twife a liar?\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(embarrassed)\n\tHoney, please...\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\t\t(a thin unpleasant smile)\n\tIt's simply that I find it\n\tincredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from\n\tthe girl's illness at the moment,\n\tshe is very strong, a very healthy\n\tspecimen of a young human female --\n\tand a comely one, too. She must\n\thave gotten protein somewhere as a\n\tyoung child, if only sporadically.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tIt is kind of amazing. The dentist\n\tsays she has perfect teeth, there\n\tisn't a cavity in her mouth.\n\n\t\t\tMR. MARTINSON \n\t\t(tries to make a\n\t\t supercilious joke)\n\tHer entire mouth is a cavity,\n\tMadam, ha ha ha.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(dryly, doesn't like the\n\t\t man a bit)\n\tHa ha ha ha.\n\nMother frowns at Daddy and Dr. Martinson gives him an aloof\nglance.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\t\t(with spurious dignity)\n\tThe point is you don't grow up like\n\tthat on a diet of sorghum and\n\thominy grits. She got protein\n\tsomewhere, she's a very strong girl\n\tand I think she'll live... despite\n\tthe delay in medical treatment.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tThat's all I want to know. \n\t\t(rises)\n\tLets get out of here before I get\n\tthe epizootics myself. Thank you,\n\tDoctor, for your discourse, it was\n\tfascinating, no doubt.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tYes, thank you, Doctor.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\t\t(as they leave)\n\tI beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do\n\tyou mean \"epi-zoo-ot-tics,\" an\n\tanimal epidemic?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(icily polite, from the\n\t\t door)\n\tNo, I mean epizootics.\n\nINT.

Listen here,\n\tBuddy, besides all his vast medical\n\tknowledge, he has the most kindest\n\theart beneath the professor way he\n\tacts -- he wants justice in the\n\tworld and he's got some real\n\tinterestin' ideas.\n\nINT.

MARTINSON \n\tI'm sorry the truth nauseates you,\n\tMrs. Hillyer, because before you\n\tleave there's a bit more of it I'd\n\tlike to put to you. This operation\n\tprovides a therapeutic opportunity\n\tthat I feel is quite important in\n\tregard to this particular girl, who\n\tsuffers not only from an ovarian\n\tcyst but from a certain\n\tpsychoneurotic condition as well.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tWhat do you mean, what kind of\n\tgobbledygook talk is that?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tGo ahead, Doctor, I think I am\n\tfollowing you.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\t\t(gives Mother an aloof\n\t\t glance, then to Daddy)\n\tFirst, about the girl's history.\n\tEvidently she's been very\n\tpromiscuous since early childhood,\n\tshe has no control over her sexual\n\timpulses. Furthermore, she is\n\tpermanently barren, she can't have\n\tchildren.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tGo on, Doctor.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\t\t(quietly)\n\tYes, go on.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\tI am thinking particularly of the\n\tother ovary. As a rule I don't\n\tbelieve in removing it. The woman's\n\thormonal system is profoundly\n\tdisturbed, she is subject to\n\tpossibly serious depression, she\n\tloses many of her secondary sexual\n\tcharacteristics for example, her\n\tbreasts might shrink and become\n\tflabby, facial hair might appear\n\talong with a coarsening of the\n\tfeatures, and of course her sexual\n\tdrive is greatly diminished,\n\tespecially in a girl or young\n\twoman. For these reasons I am\n\topposed to removing the other\n\tovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tI am ahead of you.\n\n\t\t\tDR.

I don't\n\tunderstand all this mumbo jumbo and\n\tthe funny looks on your faces.\n\n\t\t\tDR. MARTINSON \n\tMrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in\n\tmore ways than one. She is an\n\textreme psychoneurotic with\n\tuncontrollable sexual impulses. It\n\twould be a mercy to spare her the\n\tsuffering she causes herself and\n\tothers. Therefore I recommend as a\n\ttherapeutic measure the removal of\n\ther second ovary. It is ethically\n\tand medically the only proper\n\tdecision in this case and I suspect\n\tyour husband agrees with me.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tReluctantly, I do. It would be a\n\tblessing to her and everyone else.\n\tThe girl is oversexed and I say --\n\tspay her!\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\t\t(slowly rises to her feet\n\t\t and in a trembling voice)\n\tOver... my... dead... body!\n\nA long, frozen pause as both Daddy and Dr. Martinson stare at\nMother in surprise.

You\n\taren't a male monster, that man is\n\tbut you aren't. Look me in the eye\n\tand tell me, do you really want to\n\ttake Rose's womanhood away from her\n\twhen it's all she has got?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tWell, I... I hadn't thought about\n\tit that much. I was thinking...\n\twell, it's an idea, the girl is\n\toversexed, and...\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER \n\tRose isn't oversexed, that's\n\tridiculous. If you're going to talk\n\tnonsense, I don't want to talk to\n\tyou at all. Rose is exactly the\n\tsame as the rest of us, except more\n\tso.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tWell, I know, more so.

I was going\n\tto write you about it, but since\n\tyou were coming down anyway I\n\tthought I'd wait till you got here.\n\tWhat did Dave Wilkie have to say?\n\nANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they\nsit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not\ndisturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual\nand offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news\nreally is.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tThe pitiful son of a bitch said\n\tRose was a nymphomaniac.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tUm-hmm, and I suppose that incensed\n\tyou?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tYou're damn right it incensed me,\n\tthe miserable bastard. He also said\n\tthe kikes and the niggers have\n\ttaken over Washington. D.C.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY\n\t\t(nods somberly)\n\tYeah, I know, he was up here. It's\n\tpitiful like you say. When he lost\n\tRose it ruined the man, it\n\tdestroyed him totally when he lost\n\tRose.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tHe didn't lose her, he threw her\n\taway.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tYes, I guess he did. He threw her\n\taway and it was the mistake of his\n\tlife.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(staring off pensively\n\t\t into space)\n\tYou know, I don't know this town\n\tany more. All this traffic, new\n\tbuildings, prosperity...\n\t\t(pauses, almost as if in\n\t\t pain)\n\tWhere have the years gone, Daddy?\n\tWhere is the little town I knew as\n\ta boy?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tAt rest in the creative universe\n\twith Mother, son.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(a little smile)\n\tThat's what she would say herself.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY\n\t\t(simply, he is not\n\t\t emoting)\n\tA wonderful woman, boy.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tIt always gives me a funny feeling\n\tto come home. Dear old Southland.\n\tGone. It's all gone, Daddy --\n\t\t(a fond little smile)\n\t-- except you, you're still here.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(matter-of-factly)\n\tNot for long, boy. I've outstayed\n\tmy welcome already.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tIt's funny you would mention Rose,\n\tI was thinking about her all the\n\tway up in the car.\n\t\t(gives him a glance)\n\tOr maybe it isn't so funny.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(as if in previous\n\t\t thought)\n\tI'm older than hell, boy. But this\n\tYankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll\n\tsay that.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER\n\tAll right, Daddy. We have our\n\tdrink, we're out on the patio, you\n\thave prepared me for it. Rose's\n\tcancer has come back, hasn't it?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(simply, quietly)\n\tNo, son, she is dead. \n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(numb with shock, for a\n\t\t moment can't speak or\n\t\t think)\n\tDead, Rose is dead? You mean... she\n\tdied?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tI am afraid so, son. About a week\n\tago. Her husband phoned me, she had\n\tasked him to call me if anything\n\thappened.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(in awful shock)\n\tBut... but how? She was young! Rose\n\twasn't old!\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tShe was fifty-six, son. Of course\n\tshe didn't look it, nowhere near\n\tit. The cancer came back, I'm\n\tafraid I fibbed about that. But it\n\twas very quick, son. She was in the\n\thospital only two weeks, and the\n\tlast week she didn't know anything.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\t\t(in distress, a slightly\n\t\t choked voice)\n\tExcuse me, I'll be right back.\n\nWillcox Hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across\nthe patio to the kitchen door.\n\nINT. HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY\n\nCUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he goes into the kitchen.\nHe picks up the whisky bottle and pours himself a very large\ndrink.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Willcox Hillyer as he stares across\nthe kitchen lost in thought.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nBLUR-BORDERED SHOT OF ROSE\n\nin the kitchen, a sunny smile on her face as she pours coffee\nfor Daddy. A very quick moment, only a few seconds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nA CLOSE SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER\n\nin the kitchen, drink in hand, a look of grief on his face.\nHe struggles to control himself, puts a hand over his eyes,\nthen pulls himself together, turns from the kitchen.\n\nSHOT OF THE PATIO\n\nON Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as the former walks up with his\nrefreshed drink and sits down. He is in control now, his face\nis expressionless and he is seemingly calm.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tWell, you have knocked me for a\n\thell of a loop, old man. A hell of\n\ta loop.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(simply)\n\tI know. You loved her. So did I. It\n\twas an awful shock to me, too. An\n\tawful shock. Rose was so alive it's\n\thard to believe.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tI can't believe it, Daddy. I know\n\tit must be true, but I can't\n\tbelieve it.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tIt's true, son. The girl with the\n\tcornflower eyes is dead, she is no\n\tmore,\n\nDaddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on\nhimself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful\nfeeling is behind his words.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY (CONT'D)\n\tShe got cancer of the breast, was\n\toperated on and had a seven-year\n\trecovery, then after a brief\n\tillness passed on in her sleep, as\n\tthe man with whom she'd lived in\n\tbeautiful love and harmony for\n\ttwenty-five years held her hand.\n\tThat is what happened, son, and God\n\trest her lovely soul!\n\nCUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his efforts\nto control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his\nteeth, takes a big swallow of his drink.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY (CONT'D)\n\tAnd now, if you are through with\n\tthat Yankee whisky, we'll go to the\n\tHoliday Inn and get some dinner.\n\nSHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER AND DADDY\n\nas they walk toward the red rental Ford. Daddy uses a cane.\nHe is a very old man. Willcox Hillyer looks in pain, he\ngrimaces as they walk along.\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tWhy Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\tNobody lives forever, boy. Who'd\n\twant to?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER \n\tThat's a hell of a thing to say.\n\tWhy, Rose?\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(stops and firmly)\n\tNow look, boy, get a grip on\n\tyourself. Rose had a good life. She\n\tfound her. Right, didn't she? She\n\ttriumphed over everything, what are\n\tyou blubbering about?\n\n\t\t\tWILLCOX HILLYER\n\tI'm not blubbering.\n\nCUT TO a shot of the red Ford going down the familiar\ndriveway.\n\nSHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER\n\nin the car. Daddy is staring fiercely ahead, Willcox Hillyer\nstares ahead in gloom.\n\nSHOT OF THE RED FORD\n\nas it pulls up in front of the Holiday Inn we have already\nseen.\n\nSHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER\n\nin the car. Willcox Hillyer sits there staring off into space\nin deep gloom. Daddy eyes him and now relents. We see\nsympathy in his face.\n\n\t\t\tDADDY \n\t\t(gently)\n\tRose isn't dead, son. Not really.\n\tSome of us die, but some of us\n\tdon't. Rose lives. As long as some\n\tlittle girl somewhere gets herself\n\tup and goes out, Rose lives.\n\nCUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy, now middle-aged Willcox\nHillyer, as they walk toward the entrance of the Holiday Inn.\nMUSIC.\n\t\t\t\t  THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRambling Rose\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Calder Willingham\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:34.692123"}
