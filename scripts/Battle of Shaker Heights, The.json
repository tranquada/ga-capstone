Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep \n               Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.\n\n               A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.\n\n               It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.\n\n               Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias \n               indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.\n\n               His face might be attractive, under other conditions.\n\n               He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-\n               issue field jacket.\n\n<b>                                     KELLY\n</b>                         Where the hell are those Krauts?\n\n               To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's \"I'll Be \n               Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]\" while maneuvering \n               the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.\n\n               He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and \n               tries to go over it.\n\n               The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.\n\n               The BACK TIRES spin.\n\n               Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his \n               face. Assesses the situation.\n\n               He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever\n\n               the Jeep free. When --\n\n               The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.\n\n               The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight.

Kelly's too far away to \n               hear them but he watches their every move.\n\n               They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their \n               Karabiners rest slung across their backs.\n\n<b>                                     KELLY\n</b>                         Bingo.\n\n<b>               AGAINST THE TREE\n</b>\n               Kelly focuses himself.\n\n               Then he shoulders his carbine.\n\n               Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.\n\n<b>                                     KELLY\n</b>                         \"And so they buried Hector, breaker \n                         of horses.\"\n\n               He takes his Smith &amp; Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt \n               and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the \n               guards.\n\n               Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see \n               him.\n\n               But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.\n\n               Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but \n               does not aim it.\n\n               Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself \n               an easy target.\n\n               Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get \n               himself killed.\n\n<b>               EXT.
