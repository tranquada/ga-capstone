FOREST - DAY\n\n               DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE\n\n               Muffled by the wet green forest.\n\n               The very earth seems to tremble.\n\n               A RABBIT\n\n               Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs \n               the air.\n\n               LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES\n\n               VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR \n               SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.\n\n               A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.\n\n               A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched \n               over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.\n\n               For a moment the forest takes a breath.\n\n               Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep \n               Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.\n\n               A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.\n\n               It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.\n\n               Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias \n               indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.\n\n               His face might be attractive, under other conditions.\n\n               He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-\n               issue field jacket.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Where the hell are those Krauts?\n\n               To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's \"I'll Be \n               Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]\" while maneuvering \n               the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.\n\n               He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and \n               tries to go over it.\n\n               The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.\n\n               The BACK TIRES spin.\n\n               Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his \n               face. Assesses the situation.\n\n               He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever\n\n               the Jeep free. When --\n\n               The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.\n\n               The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls \n               in the mud.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Shit.\n\n               Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on \n               foot through the forest.\n\n               EXT. CLEARING\n\n               Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against \n               a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.\n\n               Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.\n\n               But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around \n               the corner of it.\n\n               Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.\n\n               Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to \n               hear them but he watches their every move.\n\n               They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their \n               Karabiners rest slung across their backs.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Bingo.\n\n               AGAINST THE TREE\n\n               Kelly focuses himself.\n\n               Then he shoulders his carbine.\n\n               Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         \"And so they buried Hector, breaker \n                         of horses.\"\n\n               He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt \n               and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the \n               guards.\n\n               Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see \n               him.\n\n               But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.\n\n               Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but \n               does not aim it.\n\n               Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself \n               an easy target.\n\n               Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get \n               himself killed.\n\n               EXT. BARN\n\n               Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into \n               the air and waves --\n\n               -- when from behind him comes a voice.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                              (O.S.)\n                         Eine maus findet den kase.\n\n               Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER.\n\n               His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young \n               face. Point blank range.\n\n               Only - Kelly doesn't fire.\n\n               He just lowers the pistol.\n\n               The German smiles.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Kill me Adolf.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                         Mien Prisoner!\n\n               The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come \n               running.\n\n               One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes \n               him into the barn roughly.\n\n               Kelly doesn't struggle.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Hey, Siegfreid and Roy.

One of the \n               Germans shines a flashlight in his face. Kelly squints.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Come on you pussies. Let's get this \n                         over with.\n\n               The German Officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain \n               pen.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                              (German accent)\n                         You will write your mother.

After a few lines, the \n               Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an \n               Infantryman.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                         Enough.

He seems \n               to be getting a bit hysterical.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                         I am the fucking protocol.\n                              (to Kelly)\n                         Beg!\n\n               He and Kelly glare at each other.\n\n               The Officer FIRES his Luger into the rafters.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                         Beg - for - your - life!\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         You got to be kidding me.\n\n               The Officer grabs his throat.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                         Silence. Now I have a little fun.\n\n               Kelly laughs. The officer slaps him. Kelly jerks away.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Now that's against the rules.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                              (sneers)\n                         There are no rules in war.\n\n               Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in \n               the shadows.\n\n               Only Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly \"keep talking\" \n               while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                              (to Officer)\n                         You've never killed anyone before, \n                         have you?\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                         I shower in the blood of my victims --\n\n               The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated \n               pain and commence death throes.\n\n               Quick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German \n               Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand.\n\n                                     GI\n                         No wonder you smell so bad.\n\n                                     GERMAN OFFICER\n                         Don't shoot, please.\n\n               The GI's eyes widen.

BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack. \n               Minnie opens the door.\n\n                                     MINNIE\n                         Kelly? Bart's not here, he -\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm \n                         here to see Tabby. Just to do a little \n                         painting with her.\n\n                                     MINNIE\n                         She's out back in her studio.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Thanks.\n\n               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO\n\n               Tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in \n               her hand.\n\n               Music's playing. Jeff Buckley. She looks over as the door \n               opens, surprised.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Kelly?\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Hey. I warned you I'd come.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         You did.\n\n               She goes back to painting. Kelly stands there for a minute, \n               waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation.\n\n               She doesn't. Until she looks up and sees him standing in the \n               same place.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Maybe I should go --\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set \n                         your canvas up. Use one of the ones \n                         in the corner.\n\n               Kelly looks through them and picks one.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in \n                         the drawer.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         I brought my own.\n\n               He takes off his backpack and opens it.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Well then.\n\n               Kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies.\n\n               He can't help but look at her. The light hits her hair and \n               she glows. She catches him looking.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Does it mess up your concentration? \n                         Me being here?\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         No.\n\n               She turns back to her painting.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Oh. That's good.\n\n               Kelly sets up his canvas.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Just don't talk.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Why would I?\n\n                                     TABBY\n                              (pause)\n                         I'm kidding.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Right. Irony. I like that.\n\n               Kelly feels the tubes of paint. Nervous. Squirts some color \n               out. Looks over his shoulder at her.\n\n               He's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being \n               there, in the studio, alone with her. Trying to figure out \n               how to play it.\n\n                                     MINER\n                              (O.S.)\n                         Hey! Hey babe.\n\n               Miner opens the door. See Kelly. Smiles like the stockbroker \n               he is and crosses to him.\n\n                                     MINER\n                         Miner Webber.\n\n               Miner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned shake.\n\n               Kelly takes it.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Webber Miner.\n\n               Miner looks confused.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Kelly.

He paints.\n\n                                     MINER\n                         Oh? What's your real job?\n\n               Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         That would be stock boy at the Shop \n                         Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky \n                         says, every employee is part owner. \n                         So you could say I'm a captain-of-\n                         industry in training. Kind of \n                         capitalist larva.\n\n                                     MINER\n                         That's quite an image.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Only if you see the most magical \n                         part. Do you see?\n\n                                     MINER\n                         What?\n\n               Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly. \n                         First I'll have to be a pupa though. \n                         I figure I won't be going out much \n                         then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence \n                         of the insect world.\n\n               Miner stares at Kelly. He can't tell what he might be making \n               fun of, or if it might be him.\n\n                                     MINER\n                         Whatever it takes to get you through \n                         the day.\n\n               Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though \n               Miner doesn't see it. He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls \n               her to him.\n\n                                     MINER\n                         I have the afternoon off.

I promise.\n\n               Tabby kisses Miner. He realizes there's no convincing her \n               and sighs.\n\n                                     MINER\n                         Like tonight?

Probably.\n\n               Miner looks at Kelly, who looks away.\n\n               Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves.\n\n               Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while. Kelly moves \n               around to look at his canvas from different angles, like \n               he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Is he always like that?\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Like what?\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Overbearing.\n\n               Tabby stops and puts down her brush.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         Just because he didn't want to picture \n                         you as a pupa?\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Oh, he will - later. When he's alone. \n                         Whether he wants to or not.\n\n               Kelly paints.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Not that though. How he wanted you \n                         to stop.\n\n                                     TABBY\n                         He wants to be with me. What's so \n                         bad about that?\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         Just because some one wants to be \n                         with you doesn't mean they're good \n                         for you.\n\n               Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. He has a \n               hard time making eye contact with Tabby.\n\n                                     KELLY\n                         No one should ever ask you to stop. \n                         If you stop, you might not be able \n                         to start again.
