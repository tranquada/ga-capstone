It's important.\n\n                                     ED\n                         Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.\n\n                                     DORIS\n                         Oh, don't be a grump.\n\n               SALES FLOOR\n\n               It is festooned with streamers.\n\n               Ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the \n               other bringing a cigarette to his lips.\n\n               Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the \n               dance floor. Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms \n               over their knees.\n\n               A thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed, watching, \n               his Adam's apple bobbing.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Wild, man!\n\n               He goes out onto the dance floor. Ed, left by himself, gazes \n               across the floor.\n\n               His view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows Big Dave worriedly \n               talking to Doris.\n\n               Doris reacts angrily.\n\n               Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris. He \n               glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation. \n               He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         You in ladies' wear?\n\n               The young man with the Adam's apple is back, looking out at \n               the floor, snapping his fingers.\n\n                                     ED\n                         ...Huh?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Haven't I seen you up in ladies' \n                         wear?\n\n                                     ED\n                         I don't work here. My wife does.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?\n\n                                     ED\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Check out the rack on that broad in \n                         the angora.\n\n                                     ED\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n               A hand is laid on Ed's shoulder. It is Big Dave; he leans in \n               to murmur:\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Ed. Can I talk to you?\n\n               BIG DAVE'S OFFICE\n\n               Music from the party drifts in only faintly. The office is \n               built into a corner of the sales floor. It is dominated by a \n               large desk. A large window on the far side affords a partial \n               view of the floor.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Siddown. Siddown...\n\n               Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk. Dave fumbles \n               nervously on top of the desk for a cigar. He trims the end \n               of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel \n               grip.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         ...Souveniered it off a Jap in New \n                         Guinea.\n\n               He hands one cigar to Ed, takes one for himself, then drags \n               up a chair to face Ed's.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         ...I guess you're wondering what \n                         Doris was so hot about.\n\n               The office is dark, the only illumination coming from the \n               window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave. Ed leans \n               forward for Dave to light his cigar.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         ...These're Havanas. Romeo and \n                         Juliets. Private stock.\n\n               Dave, having lit Ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         ...Ed, I...\n\n                                     ED\n                         What is it, Dave?\n\n               Dave breaks down, weeping. He buries his face in his hands, \n               the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his \n               hair.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Ed, I've been weak...\n\n               His shoulders heave.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         ...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.\n\n               Ed has taken Dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         ...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been \n                         carrying on with a married woman. \n                         Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh--\n                         what is it they say?--the--the--the \n                         chickens are coming home to roost.\n\n               Ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars.\n\n                                     ED\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, \n                         uh, that's not the worst of it. I \n                         got a note. A blackmail note. You \n                         know, come across or everybody knows.\n\n                                     ED\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Well, you know what that would do to \n                         me.\n\n                                     ED\n                         I guess it would be pretty awkward.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Awkward?!

I don't know what to do, \n                         Ed.

But Jesus, Ed, you're \n                         the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm \n                         sorry I...

It is the music department; \n               pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor.\n\n                                     ED (V.O.)\n                         In a way I felt bad for Big Dave.

He takes \n               out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar.\n\n                                     ED (V.O.)\n                         ...But Doris was two-timing me and I \n                         guess, somewhere, that pinched a \n                         little too.\n\n               His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. Someone \n               is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room.\n\n               The person can only be seen only obscurely, from three-\n               quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of \n               haphazardly arranged instruments. The person begins to play.\n\n               Ed listens. The piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby.\n\n               The player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and \n               Ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his \n               face.\n\n               The piece ends.\n\n                                     ED\n                         That was pretty.\n\n               The player turns, surprised.

He sits on a sofa, hands clasped \n               behind his head, listening.

As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion \n               his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, \n               and he starts lightly to snore.\n\n               BARBERSHOP\n\n               The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at \n               the cut.

Anyway, he's got \n                         this theory, you wanna test something, \n                         you know, scientifically--how the \n                         planets  go round the sun, what \n                         sunspots are made of, why the water \n                         comes out of the tap--well, you gotta \n                         look at it. But sometimes, you look \n                         at it, your looking *changes* it.

So there *is* no 'what \n                         happened.' Not in any sense that we \n                         can grasp with our puny minds. Because \n                         our minds... out minds get in the \n                         way. Looking at something changes \n                         it. They call it the 'Uncertainty \n                         Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy, \n                         but even Einstein says the guy's on \n                         to something.\n\n               His gaze up at the window breaks.

It \n               is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests \n               too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas \n               are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the \n               one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its \n               feeble light.\n\n               Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across \n               from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of \n               the murmuring.

He is \n               murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, \n               glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand.\n\n               Ed's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets \n               the phone down and comes to the door.\n\n                                     WALTER\n                         Ed, how're you holding up?\n\n                                     ED\n                         I'm OK, Walter, thanks.\n\n               Walter opens the door to him.\n\n                                     WALTER\n                         I'm so damn sorry about your loss. \n                         Terrible thing.

There are a lot of things \n                         that haven't worked out for me. Life \n                         has dealt me some bum cards...\n\n               He is loading a cigarette into his mouth.\n\n                                     ED\n                         ...or maybe I just haven't played \n                         'em right, I don't know.

Never when he's in \n                         the house. He can smell it a mile \n                         off.\n\n               Ed is pocketing the cigarette.\n\n                                     ED\n                         Sure...

A kid really, your whole life \n                         ahead of you. But it's not too soon \n                         to start thinking... to start making \n                         opportunities for yourself. Before \n                         it all washes away.\n\n                                     BIRDY\n                         Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so \n                         too.

However, the music, if \n                         you want to pursue it, well, the \n                         lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only \n                         take you so far. There's this guy in \n                         San Francisco, I've made inquiries, \n                         everybody says he's the best. Trained \n                         lots of people who've gone on to \n                         have big concert careers, symphony \n                         orchestras, the works. His name is \n                         Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure \n                         I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, \n                         he's a Frenchman.\n\n                                     BIRDY\n                         Boy.\n\n                                     ED\n                         You've got talent, anyone could see \n                         that. And he's the best. If he thinks \n                         a student has talent, he'll take 'em \n                         on for next to nothing. You're a \n                         cinch to be accepted, I could cover \n                         the cost of the lessons, like I said, \n                         it's pretty modest--\n\n                                     BIRDY\n                         Oh, Mr Crane--\n\n                                     ED\n                         I have to do it. I can't stand by \n                         and watch more things go down the \n                         drain. You're young, you don't \n                         understand.\n\n                                     BIRDY\n                         Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't \n                         really thought about a career or \n                         stuff.\n\n                                     ED\n                         I know you haven't. Look, just go \n                         meet him as a favor to me. I talked \n                         to this guy. Hope I pronounced his \n                         name right. He sounded very busy, \n                         but he's not a bad egg; he loosened \n                         up a little when I told him how \n                         talented you are. He agreed to see \n                         you this Saturday. He said maybe you \n                         were a diamond in the rough. His \n                         words.\n\n                                     BIRDY\n                         Geez, Mr Crane.\n\n                                     ED\n                         Just see him, as a favor to me.\n\n               STUDIO WAITING ROOM\n\n               It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set \n               against the walls. At the far end of the room a door leads \n               to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a \n               fast and difficult piece of music.\n\n               Ed sits waiting. He is the only adult; two or three youngsters \n               of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons.\n\n               Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow \n               tie. He is perhaps eleven. His hair is greased back in a \n               Junior Contour.\n\n               Another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch.\n\n               The piano piece is ending. There is the murmur of voices. \n               Dull footsteps.\n\n               The studio door swings open.\n\n               A small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette \n               ash is bowing Birdy out the door. He has a goatee and a \n               knotted foulard. His eyes flit over the waiting room and \n               settle on Ed.\n\n                                     CARCANOGUES\n                         ...You are ze fahzer?\n\n                                     ED\n                         No. Uh... family friend.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         I am Carcanogues.\n\n               He smiles at Birdy.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         ...You wait, my dear?\n\n                                     BIRDY\n                         Sure, Mr K.\n\n               A jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise.\n\n               STUDIO\n\n               Ed enters, uncomfortable. He looks around, taking in the \n               high-ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano.\n\n               Carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap.\n\n                                     CARCANOGUES\n                         I speak to you on ze phone, non?

I thought, \n                         what keeps it growing? Is it like a \n                         plant in soil? What goes out of the \n                         soil? The soul? And when does the \n                         hair realize that it's gone?\n\n               We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head \n               resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. We boom \n               down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. As we move \n               we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry.\n\n               The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright \n               revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it \n               disappears, leaving only black.\n\n               FADE IN\n\n               Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a \n               cigarette in the late afternoon light.\n\n               A dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children \n               are playing somewhere up the street.\n\n               Ed looks down at his watch. It is 5:30.\n\n               Something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway \n               stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat. He is a small \n               figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway.\n\n               After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the \n               house, and jots something down.\n\n               He finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and \n               is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is \n               being watched. His manner instantly warms.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Hello!\n\n                                     ED\n                         Hello.\n\n               The man starts up the walk.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         I notice you still have peastone in \n                         your driveway.\n\n               Yeah.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Well, of course, you don't have to \n                         rejuvenate that once every couple of \n                         years, don't you, when the peastone \n                         thins out.\n\n               Ed shrugs.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         ...Where does it go, huh?
