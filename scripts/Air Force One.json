He removes his \n               glasses and looks out into the crowd.

He quells the \n               incoming volley for a moment.\n\n                                     MARSHALL\n                         What about my family?\n\n                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT #\n                         I have a family, too, sir.

THREE. GO!\n\n               The agent combat-rolls into the open and fires. He advances \n               down the gangway acting as a shield for the president, \n               shooting blindly.  Marshall watches as he's hit repeatedly, \n               but it gives him the time he needs to dive for the pod.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE - VLAD AND NEVSKY\n\n               behind the bulkhead. When the agent drops, Nevsky and Viad \n               rush down the gangway. They arrive at the closed pod just as \n               it begins to slide on its rails. They let loose dozens of \n               rounds from their MP55, but the bullets just plink off.\n\n               The pod-lock doors slide shut.

Ready for action.\n\n               The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.\n\n               The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still \n               plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.\n\n               It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead.

As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service \n               agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening \n               watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad \n               continues to the staff Cabin.\n\n               INT. STAFF CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a \n               weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and \n               phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of \n               the walls.\n\n               Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...\n\n               A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating\n\n               table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any \n               medical emergency the president might encounter.\n\n               But too late.

Marshall lunges with his knife, but \n               Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's \n               belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the \n               floor.\n\n               Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his \n               victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his \n               head. Recognizes him.\n\n                                     VIAD\n                              (wonderment)\n                         The President.\n\n               But Marshall's eyes flash open.\n\n                                     MARSHALL\n                         That's right, asshole.\n\n               He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket \n               and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just \n               happened.\n\n               Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting \n               knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his \n               face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The \n               mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's \n               face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink, \n               swirling into the drain.\n\n               Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.\n\n               He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall \n               with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against \n               the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's \n               throat.

Viad pulls the \n               trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.\n\n               Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's \n               face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into \n               the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering\n\n               UNDERNEATH A CABINET.\n\n               Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his \n               legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it \n               around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing \n               at the tube.\n\n               HE SPOTS A DEFIBRILLATOR, REACHES AND SWITCHES IT ON.

He fires \n               off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the \n               corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some \n               gauze.\n\n               The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the \n               stairs to take position.\n\n               Marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made Molatov\n\n               cocktail and throws it down the corridor. The bottle crashes \n               into a BALL OF FLAME. Catching Bazylev on fire. He yells, \n               drops and rolls. FIRE SUPPRESSING FOAM immediately sprays \n               down from overhead.\n\n                                     KORSHUNOV\n                         Go after him.\n\n               Serge hops Bazylev's burning body and heads down the corridor, \n               looking for this new wildcard. Korshunov grabs a fire \n               extinguisher from the galley and attends to Bazylev.\n\n               INT. CORRIDOR, TOWARD THE REAR OF AIR FORCE ONE.\n\n               Marshall retreats behind a divider. Sees Serge coming. Fires \n               a few rounds, then retreats to the next divider. Working \n               toward the rear of the plane.\n\n               Serge picks his way through the rear cabins, advancing \n               cautiously.\n\n               INT. REAR GALLEY/BATHROOMS.\n\n               Marshall's out of plane. Nowhere to hide in the galley.\n\n               Marshall eyes the bathrooms, doors flapping.\n\n               FOLLOWING SERGE...\n\n               as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms. Marshall is \n               nowhere to be seen. But the bathroom doors are all closed.\n\n                                     SERGE\n                         I know you're in there.

Have it your way.\n\n               Time for a deadly version of the shell game. serge fires \n               several rounds into the first closed bathroom door. The \n               bullets slice easily through the thin doors. He kicks the \n               riddled door open. The stall is empty.\n\n               Serge moves to the next one. Same procedure. It's empty.\n\n               Moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. He wails \n               with his MP5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. Waits a \n               beat, then...\n\n               Kicks it in. It's empty too.\n\n               Serge looks around.

LOWER GALLEY, BAGGAGE LEVEL -\n\n               Marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter, \n               breathing heavy. He slumps against the bulkhead and slides\n\n               down to the ground.\n\n               He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his \n               head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the \n               weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a \n               handfull of rounds left. He slaps it back in and switches \n               from automatic fire to single-shot then pantomimes firing.\n\n                                     MARSHALL\n                         The NRA'll love this.\n\n               Looking down the barrel of the gun, he notices bins loaded \n               with luggage.\n\n               INT.
