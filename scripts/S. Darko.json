Her coppery hair flows past her\n          shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite\n          golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in\n          the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...\n          \n          She smiles, and starts walking.\n          \n          \n          EXT.

She rubs the sleep from her eyes,\n          greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She\n          finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.\n          \n                              COREY\n                    What time is it?\n          \n                               SAM\n                    Early...\n          \n          Corey adjusts her seat.

Sam gets out of the\n          car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.\n          \n          Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the\n          steam.

WINDMILL - NIGHT\n          \n          Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER\n          TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees\n          Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30\n          feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of\n          his ski mask...\n          \n          \n          ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM\n          \n          Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of\n          which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,\n          CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his\n          arms...\n          \n          His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to\n          what is sitting right beside him --\n          \n          REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,\n          and she stares off into distance.\n          \n                              SAM\n                    The sky's so beautiful here...\n          \n          Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at\n          her.

RIPPLES swell throughout the\n          clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his\n          hand remains glued to the spot.\n          \n          Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to\n          Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of\n          herself.\n          \n          The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to\n          shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the\n          COSMOS:\n          \n                              DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)\n                    15 days... 18 hours... 45\n                    minutes... 6 seconds.

O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when\n          she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.\n          \n                              OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)\n                    Got anyplace to be?\n          \n          Sam manages to find her voice.\n          \n                                 SAM\n                    The motel.\n          \n          She takes his hand and rises.\n          \n          \n          I/E.

On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER\n          and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC.

Corey\n          freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY\n          HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.

The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go\n          back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy\n          disappears.\n          \n                              PHIL (O.S.)\n                    What's goin' on out here?\n          \n          Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,\n          having come out of a room near the lobby.

STREET - NIGHT\n          \n          Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road\n          about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is\n          guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.\n          \n          The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in\n          space-time materializes.\n          \n          There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF\n          THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,\n          swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-\n          dimensional realm of darkest night.\n          \n                                                                     54.\n          \n          \n          The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL\n          RAINS are visible within...\n          \n          Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE\n          AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --\n          \n          \n          INT.

Tom says\n          nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her\n          there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.\n          \n          After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,\n          Tom begins to speak:\n          \n                               VIETNAM TOM\n                    My mom told me someday everybody\n                    would understand.

His eyes\n          drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.\n          Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.\n          \n          When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with\n          emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.\n          \n                              SAM\n                    Do you like to read?\n          \n          Tom says nothing.\n          \n                              SAM (CONT'D)\n                    You can borrow it...\n          \n          Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly\n          and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.\n          \n          \n          INT.
