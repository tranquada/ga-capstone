ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT\n</b>\nA million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an\ninsect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides\neffortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.\n\nThe insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS\nunceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down\nthe road.\n\n<b>INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT\n</b>\nThe DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers,\nsmearing the remains all over.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\t\tGoddamn bugs.\n\nHe squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but\nnow he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight\nof them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.\n\nHe bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He\nspeaks in Spanish, which is subtitled.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDRIVER (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tDeja me hablar.\n\t\t\t(Let me do the talking.)\n\n<b>EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT\n</b>\nThe van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue\nfour doors with \"INS\" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS\nstand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward\nand comes to the window.\n\nThe DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also\ngovernment issue, looks at him and sighs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tWell. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where\n\t\tyou comin' from?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\t\tI was fishing in Cuernavaca.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tSure you were.

Agent Janus\nlooks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his\nhead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tMe, I woulda thrown 'em back.\n\t\t\t(to the passengers, in Spanish)\n\t\tVamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!\n\t\t\t(Let's go. Out. Form a line!)\n\nThey pile out of the van. Some are parents with small children.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tWhat do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a\n\t\thead?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all\n\t\tfor your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna\n\t\tneed --\n\nHe stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching,\nfast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several\nAgents pull their weapons.\n\nThe new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS\ncars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their\nheadlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.\n\nTWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple\nblack ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of\nworld-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach\nthe INS agents.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tWe'll take it from here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tWho the hell are you?\n\nKay and Dee flash some form of ID.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tINS Division 6.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tDivision 6? I never heard of Division 6.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tReally?\n\nKay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tWhat're we thinking, Dee?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE\n</b>\t\tTough call, Kay.\n\nHe walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in\nSpanish.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\t!Oye!

When he\nreaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tQue dices si te rompo la cara?\n\t\t\t(What do you say if I\n\t\t\tbreak your face?)\n\nThe Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a\nhand on the Guy's shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tNo hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,\n\t\tverdad, amigo?\n\t\t\t(You don't speak a word\n\t\t\tof Spanish, right, friend?)\n\nAgain, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tWe got a winner.\n\t\t\t(to the others)\n\t\tLos restos estan libres a irse. Largense!\n\t\t\t(The rest of you are free\n\t\t\tto go. Scram!)\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tSir!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tTomen el camion, y vayeuse.\n\t\t\t(Get on the road and go.)\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tSir, you can't just --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tDon't \"Sir\" me! You have no idea who you're\n\t\tdealing with!\n\nSilence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the\nvan. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t\t(to Janus)\n\t\tWe're gonna have a little chat with our\n\t\tfriend here. You boys can hit the road ...\n\t\tand keep on protecting us from dangerous\n\t\taliens.\n\nKay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise,\nleaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tYou ever heard of Division 6?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t2ND INS AGENT\n</b>\t\tThere is no Division 6.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t3RD INS AGENT\n</b>\t\tWho are those guys?\n\n<b>EXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT\n</b>\nKay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush. Dee\npulls an enormous handgun from a shoulder holster and stays a pace or two\noff, covering him. Kay has an arm draped around the man's shoulders.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tI think you jumped off the bus in the wrong\n\t\tpart of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet\n\t\tdollars to pesos that you're not --\n\nHe pulls out a small laser device, which he ZIPS neatly down the front of\nthe man's clothes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t-- from anywhere near here.\n\nThe man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is\nunderneath -- A SCALY SPACE BASTARD, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with\na snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at\nthe top of his head.\n\nThe only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the\nhumanesque \"head,\" which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's\npropped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions\nas he holds it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tMikey?! When did they let you out of jail?\n\nMIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and\nsaliva.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tPolitical refugee. Right.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE\n</b>\t\tYou know how many treaty articles you've\n\t\tjust violated?\n\nMikey makes a lame SQUEAK.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tOne, my ass. Try seven.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE\n</b>\t\tFrom unauthorized immigration to failure to\n\t\tproperly inoculate prior to landing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\t\t(off Mikey's objections)\n\t\tOkay, that's enough. Hand me your head and\n\t\tput up your arms.\n\nFrom behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.\n\nKay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall\nstalk, whips around too. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just\nover the rise, staring in frozen amazement.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tAh, shit.\n\nAgent Janus SCREAMS. Mikey rips free of the rest of the \"Mexican\"\ndisguise, knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus,\nSCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech. Janus freezes, terrified.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tDee! Shoot him!\n\nDee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell\nout of his hand as he hit the ground.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tDee, for Christ's --\n\nMikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps\non a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide\nopen --\n\n-- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --\n\n-- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the\nground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay\nstands, smoking weapon in hand.\n\n<b>EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT\n</b>\nOn the road, the INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.\n\n<b>EXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT\n</b>\nKay has an arm around Janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing.\nJanus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tTh -- th -- th --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\t\t(helping)\n\t\t\"That.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tThat wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tHuman, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on\n\t\tyou.\n\nHe takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does,\nJanus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the\nstars.\n\nThe other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tOkay, everybody, situation's under control,\n\t\tcalm down. If you'll just give me your\n\t\tattention for a moment I'll tell you what\n\t\thappened.\n\nFrom over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start\nto flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular\nmetallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch,\nfigures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the\ndevice up to \"08.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThis is called a \"neuralyzer.\" A gift from\n\t\tsome friends from out of town. The red eye\n\t\there isolates and measures the electronic\n\t\timpulses in your brain. More specifically,\n\t\tthe ones for memory.\n\nBehind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses,\ncome over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tGimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;\n\t\tholes at 40, 60, and 80.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t2ND INS AGENT\n</b>\t\tWhat in the hell is going on?!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tExactly the right question. And the answer\n\t\tlies right -- here. Pay attention.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJANUS\n</b>\t\tWho are you, really?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tReally? I'm just a figment of your\n\t\timagination.\n\nHe holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches\ninto his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses --\n\n-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a\ntenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tGod, we're a gullible breed.\n\nBehind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the\nMen in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming\naround, as if awakening from a concussion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tI mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be\n\t\talive after a blast like that.\n\nThe Agents look around, confused.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAGENT JANUS\n</b>\t\tWhat -- blast?\n\nKay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire\nextinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tUnderground gas vein, genius. You guys need\n\t\tto exercise more caution before discharging\n\t\tyour firearms.\n\nHe jabs a finger into Janus' chest.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tEspecially you.\n\nDee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at\nthe night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away\nfrom the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry. About...back there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tHappens.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE\n</b>\t\tDidn't used to.\n\nHe holds up his hands, which tremble with age.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThe spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of\n\t\tme...\n\nHe looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThey're beautiful, aren't they?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEE\n</b>\t\tThe stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.\n\t\t\t(back to Kay)\n\t\tI'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.\n\nKay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tNo. You won't.\n\n<b>EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT\n</b>\nA shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN\n<b>DOWN TO...\n</b>\nA pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the\nPERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.\n\nA new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC\nCOP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet\nbehind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.\n\nEdwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a\nchain under his shirt.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tStop! NYPD!\n\nHe continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS,\noverweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOP\n</b>\t\tAll yours, Edwards!\n\nThe Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.\n\n<b>TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP\n</b>\nAs they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties.\nThe Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's\na thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first\nStreet below.\n\nEDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He,\ntoo, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...\n\n<b>EXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown\ntraffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS,\nand it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.\n\nEDWARDS pushes through the crowd...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tGrand Central Station off to your left,\n\t\tfolks...\n\nWith the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs\nout through the side door.\n\nHe spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tDammit, man, you're making me sweat up my\n\t\tgear!\n\nEdwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with\nthe open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.\n\n<b>EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT\n</b>\nTHE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into\nframe, leaning off the back of the truck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tYo, man, your luck just ran out.\n\nHe leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the Perp.\n\nThe Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPERP\n</b>\t\tHe's coming! He's coming!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tAnd when he gets here, I'll kick his ass\n\t\ttoo.\n\nEdwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp blinks. Nothing\nunusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white\neyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also.\n\nEdwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to\npull out...\n\nHis WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting\nquickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand.\n\nTHE WEAPON smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and\nSHATTERS into a million pieces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tWhat the...\n\nWHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and\ntakes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain.\n\nThe Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards\ntries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the\nPerp is gone.\n\n<b>EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT\n</b>\nEdwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it,\nand in the next instant...\n\nThe Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of\nthe Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.\n\nEdward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and\nruns inside.\n\nHe runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.\n\n<b>EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT\n</b>\nOn the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES\nto the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's\nlocked.\n\nHe tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --\n\n-- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon\nat the Perp.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tWassup?\n\nThe Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics. He backpedals, toward the edge of\nthe roof.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPERP\n</b>\t\tHe's coming! He's coming because I failed,\n\t\tand now he'll kill me too!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tStop!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPERP\n</b>\t\tYou don't understand. Your world is gonna\n\t\tend.\n\nBut the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and now he starts\nto fall over. The Perp blinks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tWhat are you?!\n\nThe Perp looks down. He decides.\n\n-- and he falls, SCREAMING, to his death.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

You mean blinked with both eyes?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tNo, sir. He blinked once with one set, then\n\t\tagain with another completely different set.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n</b>\t\tSort of a low beam, high beam.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tINSPECTOR\n</b>\t\tWas that before or after he drew the weapon\n\t\twhich you claim evaporated into a million\n\t\tpieces?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tAfter, sir.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tINSPECTOR\n</b>\t\tAnd why do you suppose none of the other\n\t\tofficers saw either of these two events?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\t'Cause some of the other officers are a\n\t\tlittle soggy in the midsection.

INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT\n</b>\nA woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish,\ndark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above\nhim. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and\nsaw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then\nwhispers to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLAUREL\n</b>\t\tLaurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I\n\t\tbelieve you. I opened him up. Find me at\n\t\tthe morgue.

He turns the card over and looks at the\nother side. There's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no\ne-mail address. Just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMIB\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm\ncountry. Several lights are on and through a window we can see the\nsilhouette of a MAN sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a\nWOMAN hovering over him, bringing things to him.\n\nThe Man (EDGAR) waves his arms, ranting.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tI go out, I work my butt off to make a\n\t\tliving, all I want is to come home to a\n\t\tnice clean house with a nice fat steak on\n\t\tthe table, but instead I get this -- this\n\t\t-- I don't even know what you call this!\n\nIn the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something\nstrange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tI'll tell you what it looks like, it looks\n\t\tlike poison. Don't you take that away, I'm\n\t\teating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't\n\t\tit?!\n\nNo, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes\nfrom a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way\ninto fruit metaphors.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tI swear to God, I would not be surprised if\n\t\tit was, the way you skulk around here like\n\t\ta dog been hit too much -- or ain't been\n\t\thit enough, I can't make up my mind.\n\nOkay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting\nto glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight\ntoward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.\n\nThe blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tYou're useless, Beatrice! The only thing\n\t\tthat pulls its weight around here is my\n\t\tgoddamn truck!\n\n-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A\nconcussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tStay here!\n\nThe silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws\nit open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty,\nbug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he\nwalks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck.\nThe skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering\nhole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR\n</b>\t\tFigures.\n\nHe walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt\ntail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole.\n\nIN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights.\nEmbedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across.\n\nBEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEATRICE\n</b>\t\tWhat is it, Edgar?!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR\n</b>\t\t\t(turns to her)\n\t\tGet your big butt back in that house!\n\nBeatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back\nto the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY\nVOICE comes from deep in the hole.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tPlace projectile weapon on ground.\n\nEdgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises\nthe weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR\n</b>\t\tYou can have my gun when you pry it from my\n\t\tcold, dead fingers!\n\nThere is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it\nresponds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tYour proposal is acceptable.\n\nA long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and\npulls him down into the hole.\n\nFrom deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet\nbeing torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment\nlater, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to\nthe truck.\n\nIt's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face,\narms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now\nhe just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the\nprom.\n\nThe shotgun flies out and lands beside him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n</b>\nBEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears\nfrom Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the\nkitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind\nhim. He carries the shotgun.\n\nShe looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEATRICE\n</b>\t\tWhat on earth was it?!\n\nHe looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than\nbefore. More refined.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR\n</b>\t\tSugar.\n\nPause.

She dumps some of\nthe sugar into it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tMore.\n\nShe puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a\nknife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.\n\nEdgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no\nidea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBEATRICE\n</b>\t\tEdgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just\n\t\thanging off your bones!\n\nEdgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He\nreaches up --\n\n-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the\nskin of his neck back into his shirt collar.  He looks at her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDGAR\n</b>\t\tThat better?\n\nBeatrice faints.\n\n<b>EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nStillness. Silence. A loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the\nspaceship.\n\nThe nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving,\nand finally CRUNCHES to the ground outside the pit.\n\nEDGAR climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. He dusts himself off and\ncontinues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY\n</b>\nThe next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his\nhand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the\nutterly nondescript building in front of him.

MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nEDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre\nroom. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel\nvent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an\nOLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding\nmetal chair halfway across.\n\nEdwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUARD\n</b>\t\tHelp you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tMaybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGUARD\n</b>\t\tElevator. Push the \"call\" button.\n\nAnd he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more\nthan curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator.\nAs he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.\n\n<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY\n</b>\nEdwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. He pushes the\n\"call\" button and waits, but the elevator doesn't move. Instead, doors on\nthe other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him. Edwards\nwaits, unaware.\n\nFrom behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and\nfinds himself standing in --\n\n<b>INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThis back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway.\nStanding at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an\nold school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last\nnight. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at\nEdwards.\n\nOne chair is empty.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tZED\n</b>\t\tYou're late. Sit down.\n\nEdwards takes the remaining chair.

MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY\n</b>\nThe recruits scribble away at the written test. It's a thick document --\nreasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  The RECRUITS seem to be\nreally powering through it, filling in answer after answer.\n\nBut no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their\nchairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees.\n\nEDWARDS is really struggling. He writes two words on one answer, then\ndecides to erase it. The lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy;\nhis pencil even TEARS through the page.\n\nHe looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table.\nEdwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --\n\n-- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody\nlooks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.\n\nEdwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That's better.\n\nZed raises an eyebrow. He stares at Edwards, then looks up, toward a\nsmoked glass window. Behind the dark glass, a FIGURE stands, staring,\nunemotional.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

The whole room pulsates and the air is\nsuddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both\nhuman and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic\nmass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously.\n\nThe Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX\nSHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is\nfired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last.\n\nThere's an awkward silence. Then the door opens.

Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a\nlarge hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back\ncorner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty\neight-year-old girl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tZED\n</b>\t\tMay I ask why you felt little Tiffany\n\t\tdeserved to die?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tEDWARDS\n</b>\t\tShe was the only one who actually seemed\n\t\tdangerous.

Answer; it's\n\t\tnot his head. His head is that butt-ugly\n\t\tbean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you\n\t\tlook at the snarling beast-guy, he's not\n\t\tsnarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues\n\t\tin his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,\n\t\tthe girl's books were way too advanced for\n\t\tan eight-year-old's.

So we masked all\n\t\tevidence of their landing.\n\nAnother picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under\nconstruction.

Most of the Aliens stay in\nthe background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling,\nshuffling papers.\n\nKAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out\nover the whole place.\n\nKay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of\npassport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking\nthe documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen\nbizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien\ntongues.\n\nEdwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as\nhe addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPASSPORT OFFICER\n</b>\t\tPurpose of trip?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tARQUILLIAN\n</b>\t\tDiplomatic mission.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPASSPORT OFFICER\n</b>\t\tDuration of stay?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tARQUILLIAN\n</b>\t\tLunch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPASSPORT OFFICER\n</b>\t\tCarrying any fruits or vegetables?\n\nEdwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries\nhim along.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKAY\n</b>\t\tLet's go.

With a soft\n<b>CLICK --\n</b>\n-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.\n\nJay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and\nRosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES\nOPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial\nskull.\n\n<b>A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.\n</b>\nThough not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded.
