You follow me? You get the coat back or you give me the three seventy-nine my ex-wife paid for it at Alexander's. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Manager looks o.s., and begins speaking in Italian. Chili reacts as we hear the name RAY BARBONI mentioned a couple of times. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MANAGER\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Explain to him how Mr. Barboni borrow the coat. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A WAITER joins Chili and the Manager in the doorway. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Ray Bones took my coat?

So Mr. Barboni, he put on this other coat that fit him pretty good. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You mean my coat. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WAITER\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">He was wearing it, you know, to go home.

You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MANAGER\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Mr. Barboni a good customer.\n<br/></p><p id=\"spkdir\">(making sure to add)\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Works for Jimmy Capp. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I know who he works for.

It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Don't worry about it.

One punch. No need to throw the left. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RAY BONES\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Jesus . . . Oh, God . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili then steps over him into the room and grabs his coat from a chair. He looks over at Ray Bones bent over, blood running from his nose and mouth, blood all over his hands, his shirt. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RAY BONES\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Fuck, man . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili walks out.

Aims once more -- probably lower this time -- but doesn't fire as Ray Bones grabs his head and stumbles out of there. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RAY BONES (O.S.)\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Somebody call 9 fucking 111. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.

It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand.

You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.

Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">How much is the wife offered? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili starts to speak, but Harry cuts him off. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HARRY\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Three hundred grand, and they take it, money in hand, babe. The guy has his wife cash the check and he takes off for Las Vegas with the dough. Gets there, he's supposed to call her, tell her when to come out. But she never hears from him again. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Meanwhile, the guy's hot, runs the three hundred up to half a million . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">He comes to L.A. . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Harry raises his hand to stop Chili. He's rolling, turns to Karen now . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HARRY\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">It drives the guy nuts, he's winning but can't tell anybody who he is. You show in a back story his motivation, his desire to be famous, you know, pal around with celebrities, the headliners doing the big rooms. Now he's got the dough to buy his way in, mix with celebs and he can't resist . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Harry then turns back to Chili. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HARRY\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">So he comes to L.A. . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new.

Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">The shylock's the good guy. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HARRY\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">The shylock?

He looks over at . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A BIG MAN, bearded, wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt, and carrying a three-year-old GIRL in his arms.

What is it, Harry, a porno flick? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He reaches for the script. Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest.

All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies?

This Mr. Lovejoy.

Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie Fingers. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.\n<br/></p><p id=\"spkdir\">(then)\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">So whatta you think of the script? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script, begins flipping through it. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili flips through the script, sees a name . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">There's Ilona. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">What about her? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Get something going there. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">She's . . . young. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Young?

Have you read the script? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Who? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bo Catlett studies Chili a moment, smiles . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You know what I'm thinkin'?\n<br/></p><p id=\"spkdir\">(leans forward)\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You wanna make the girl older. I don't like the ending. We could do that, you and me, sit down and write the script over where it needs it. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili fips through the script a moment . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You know how to write one of these? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words . . . although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">That's all there is to it, huh? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">That's all. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili sits forward, stabs out his cigarette, exhales into Bo Catlett's face . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Then what do I need you for? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bo Catlett starts for the door. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I really think I can be of service on this one. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.

Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">We talk different? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You mean like we don't give a shit. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah.

Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili exchanges a look with Karen who sits back now.

Not since I walked out of a loan-shark Operation in Miami. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">What happened?

A guy owes you fifteen grand and he skips, leaves town. What do you do? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili watches as the movie star hunches over, narrows his shoulders. For a few moments he holds his hands together in front of him, getting a shifty look in his eyes. Karen shakes her head . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, for Christ's sake -- \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Karen watches as Martin stares at Chili, his expression gradually becoming deadpan, sleepy . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Martin, look at me. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I'm looking at you. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">So is Karen, for that matter. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTIN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Like this? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">What you're telling me, you're tired?

How about this? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Now you're squinting like you need glasses. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Karen looks away now, fighting a smile. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Look at me. I'm thinking, You're mine. I fuckin' own you. What I'm not doing is feeling anything about it one way or the other. You understand?

Mr. ESCOBAR, the older, meaner one . . . steps into the office . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Where is my nephew? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Your who? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Yayo. Where is he? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bo Catlett stiffens . . . Uh oh. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. GARAGE -- DAY \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As the two back doors of a limo slum shut. There's half dozen other limos wedged in here. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. LIMO -- SAME TIME \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bo Catlett sits in the back, wedged in between the two bodyguards, neither of whom has removed his shades. He faces Escobar on the opposite seat. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Sure. Family. I know how that goes. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You gave him the money? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"spkdir\">(flat)\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">A zillion, huh? That's a lot. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Escobar studies him a moment. Bo Catlett shrugs. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Maybe your nephew panicked, took off. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">He's around someplace. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.\n<br/></p><p id=\"spkdir\">(then)\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bo Catlett barely glances at the bodyguards, smiles the gleamy smile to the Latin guy in front of him . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BO CATLETT\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I went to UC San Diego.\n<br/></p><p id=\"spkdir\">(then)\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">One of the bodyguards says 'Your nephew' in Spanish. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ESCOBAR\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, yeah, and Yayo, too. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Harry. Don't you pass out on me. Look up here . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Harry, a crumpled heap, looks up and we see his bloody pummeled face as Ray Bones quickly crosses the room.

This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BONES\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ronnie opens his jacket so that Ray Bones can see the .357 Ronnie's got tucked into his belt. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RONNIE\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, well, I just closed it. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Bones looks at the gun, looks up at Ronnie standing there, hands on his hips, holding his jacket open.

Harry raises his hand, makes a gurgling noise as . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ronnie goes for his gun. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Boom. Boom. Boom.

He's already dead.' \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ray Bones crouches down beside him. Harry winces as Ray puts the gun in Harry's broken hand. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BONES\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">But see, the cops got these tests, tell them whether or not a person fired a gun. And I was never here. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Harry looks pleadingly at Ray Bones. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BONES\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You understand, Harry? I was never here. You say I was, and I'm gonna come back here throw you out that fuckin' window. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Harry looks at the gun, feebly aims it at Bones. Bones frowns, pushes the gun away . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BONES\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">C'mon, knock it off, Harry.

He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Depends, who pays? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Chili looks at Karen a moment. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">How'd you meet Martin anyway? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Not unlike the way Nicki met him.

Why? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">You don't like Martin much, do you? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, I like him. I just think he's . . . short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Feeling him staring, she keeps her eyes on the sunset, and tries to change the subject . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">So what about your story. You thought of a title yet? \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">That's a different story.

Let's talk about it tomorrow. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">But Chili can't stop thinking about this now . . . \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CHILI\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -- \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KAREN\n<br/></p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, Chili? Look at me. \n<br/>\n<br/></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She leans over and kisses him. Is still kissing him when the PHONE RINGS.
