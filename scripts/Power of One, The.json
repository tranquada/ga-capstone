Jannie,\n     willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's\n     point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout\n     punches.

PK plants one, then two,\n     then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus-\n     trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries\n     to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves\n     and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary.

It is true. Look.\n               The cactus is humble but not\n               submissive. It grows where no\n               other plant will grow. The sun\n               bakes its back, the wind rips it\n               from cliffs, or drowns it in the\n               dry desert sand. Not a complaint.\n               In good times or bad it will\n               still flower. It protects itself\n               from danger.\n\n     Doc touches a cactus needle.\n\n<b>                             DOC\n</b>               But it harms no other plant.

That is saintliness of\n               the highest order I think. Ja?\n               From cactus comes medicine to\n               heal the wounds of men and little\n               buttons if you eat one you can\n               touch the face of God or stare\n               into the mouth of hell. It is\n               the plant of patience, solitude,\n               love, and madness. Modesty,\n               beauty.

PK\n     keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches.\n     The opponent unloads, banging away at PK with everything\n     he has. PK backs up two steps, then shifts positions.\n     The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes.

PRISON BOXING ROOM - CLOSEUP - GEEL PIET                225\n</b>\n<b>                              GEEL PIET\n</b>                First with the head, then with the\n                heart. Little defeat big when\n                little is smart.\n\n<b>                                                  SMASH CUT TO:\n</b><b>226   PK                                                           226\n</b>\n      pounds into Botha's ribs under another wild swinging\n      punch by the giant. Botha shouts and keeps advancing,\n      swinging. PK backs up, peppering him, leading him\n      forward. Left-right. He punishes Botha for each punch\n      the big man throws, but always backing up. Botha, half\n      blind, spitting blood follows.\n\n      The crowd screams for him to move side to side.   The\n      betting changes fast and furious.\n\n      PK glances over his  shoulder to the cement wall behind\n      him. He takes two   more steps and then fires two jabs\n      at Botha's face and  then stands stock still. Wild with\n      anger, Botha throws  a huge right hand to PK's head.\n\n<b>                                                  SMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>227   CLUB                                                         227\n</b>\n      coming down on Maria's head.\n<b>                                                  SMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>228   PK                                                           228\n</b>\n      At the last moment PK sidesteps. Botha's hand    smashes\n      into the cement wall. His hand shatters into    a hundred\n      pieces. The pain is so immense he is rendered    helpless.\n      PK doesn't waste a second. He starts banging    away at\n      Botha with hard, fast combinations.\n\n<b>                              PK\n</b>                Want to see the wages of hate?\n      Botha feels the punches.   He steps back, faltering.\n      PK pursues him.\n\n<b>                               PK\n</b>                Here.   Here is what hate gets you.\n\n      PK hammers away, punching with each word, harder and\n      faster.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                               153.\n</b>\n<b>                               PK\n</b>                 For my chicken.

It catches Botha square in the jaw. Botha\n      goes over onto his back like a tree falling.\n      The crowd outside screams and yells with delight.     Money\n      changes hands.\n\n      PK collects himself and steps over Botha.   He unbolts\n      the door and steps outside.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>229   EXT.

The crowd parts.\n      PK, looking neither right nor left, begins to walk away.\n\n<b>                               PK (V.O.)\n</b>                 I knew as I walked out of the\n                 mines, out of Africa, that I\n                 wasn't fleeing. That one day\n                 I would return. Inkosi\n                 Inkosikasi was right. I was a\n                 man for all Africa. Bound to\n                 her by my spirit. Bound by my\n                 dreams. And Africa had taught\n                 me the lesson I would take out\n                 into the world and one day bring\n                 back. Great changes can come from\n                 the power of many. But only when\n                 the many join together and create\n                 what is invincible.
