A huge Zulu jumps out of the\n    front passenger seat and opens the rear door. A moment\n    passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from\n    the car and settle into the dust. INKOSI INKOSIKAZI,\n    100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard\n    whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his\n    shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed\n    chicken in the other, exits the car.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n\n4   EXT.

The Boy\n    sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi\n    Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the\n    dust with a stick.\n\n                                                              4.\n                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)\n               Legend had it that Inkosi\n               Inkosikazi was the last son of\n               the great Zulu king, Dingaan,\n               who fought both the Boers and\n               the British to a standstill\n               nearly 100 years before, and the\n               night Inkosi Inkosikazi was\n               conceived stars fell from the\n               sky until the sun rose.\n    The circle    complete, the old man sits down opposite the\n    Boy. From     a leather pouch he produces several bones. He\n    throws the    bones on the ground and studies them for a\n    moment. He     begins to wave the fly switch back and forth\n    in front of    the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. The\n    Boy's eyes    grow heavy; his lids droop.\n\n\n5   DREAM - EXT.

PK and Morrie,\nin FULL FRAME, reveal PK in a boxing robe with taped\nhands, and Morrie with towel and bucket.\n\n                        ANNOUNCER\n          And at the end of six matches in\n          all weight divisions, the score\n          is Prince of Wales three victories,\n          Helpmakeer three victories.\n\nThe stands explode with cheers.\n\n                        ANNOUNCER\n          And now for the final bout to\n          determine which school will win\n          the Johannesburg 1950 public\n          school boxing team championship.\n          In this corner, weighing 140\n          pounds, standing 5'8\", from the\n          Helpmakeer School with a record of\n          13-0 on the year, Jannie\n          Geildenhaus.\nA huge cheer goes up for JANNIE, muscular, bare-chested,\nas he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd.\n\nPK enters the ring. He stands, robe on, eyes intent on\nJannie. When the noise subsides the Announcer continues.\n\n                        ANNOUNCER\n          And in this corner, representing\n          the Prince of Wales School, the\n          current Johannesburg Public School\n          welterweight champion, also with\n          a record of 13-0 on the year, also\n          140 pounds, Kid P.K.\n\nNow the English schoolboys cheer for their man, but PK\ndoes not respond. He barely moves. He raises an arm in\nbare acknowledgment. His attention stays focused across\nthe ring on his shadowboxing opponent. PK watches Jannie\ndance closely when a low CHANTING begins from outside the\nstadium -- African, tribal, mystical harmonies of black\nvoices building until the white voices inside the stadium\nare stunned to silence. The song carries beautifully in\nthe night. For the first time PK's focus is broken, but\nnot like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue\nas to what's happening. He has heard this before. This\nis familiar.\n\n                                                             18.\n\n     This is for him. A distant knowing flickers in his eyes\n     like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his\n     name.\n\n     Over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable -- the\n     chorus of the song. \"Ono  bi shobi ingelosi.\" The\n     chanting stops as suddenly as it began. A moment passes\n     before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon.\n\n     The Announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention\n     back to the business at hand.\n\n                             ANNOUNCER\n               We thank the native population for\n               their spirited display of\n               enthusiasm. But now, on to the\n               main event. Fighters to center\n               ring, please.\n\n     PK, focused again, meets Jannie at the REFEREE.\n\n                             REFEREE\n               You both know the rules.

Good luck     to you.\n     The fighters slap leather. PK turns back to his corner\n     when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the\n     crowd.\n\n\n23   HIS POV - FRONT ROW - HALF-DOZEN SCHOOLGIRLS               23\n\n     sit; one of them MARIA ELIZABETE MARAIS, 17, with honey-\n     blonde hair and lapis-blue eyes, turns her head and\n     engages PK's eyes and his heart. She quickly looks\n     away. But a  connection has been made -- fire passed.\n\n\n24   PK                                                         24\n\n     goes back to his corner and takes off his robe.

Let's keep our\n               mind on that, hey?\n\n     He jams the mouthpiece into PK's mouth as the BELL RINGS.\n     PK turns to an onslaught by Jannie, a real brawler.\n     Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail PK until he\n     finds his footing and dances away. Jannie comes after\n     him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. But\n     PK's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed-\n     iate disadvantage. It is a classic battle of a boxer\n     versus a fighter. PK's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's\n     length, until he closes with a combination. Jannie,\n     willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's\n     point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout\n     punches. When he has had enough punishment he lunges\n     into a clinch.\n\n                                JANNIE\n               Blery Rooinek.     I'll kill you.\n\n     PK pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys. Backing\n     up, PK repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the\n     face. PK works Jannie, turning him left then right,\n     working the angles, keeping him off balance while he\n     racks up the points. Jannie goes left. As PK chases\n     him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring.\n\n\n25   HIS POV - REAR EXIT DOOR - TALL BLACK MAN                   25\n\n     with a younger black companion of more average height,\n     the only black faces in a crowd of 2,000 people.\n\n\n26   BACK TO SCENE                                               26\n\n     Their presence distracts    PK for a split second, and in\n     that split second Jannie    seizes the opportunity. He\n     comes across with a big    right hand to PK's jaw. Jannie\n     connects. PK goes down     hard. The crowd goes wild.\n     Morrie leaps up and down    in the corner.\n                                MORRIE\n               Get up!     Get up!\n\n     But PK is seeing double.    He shakes his head, trying to\n     clear it.\n\n                                MORRIE\n               Up!

The Ref checks him.\n\n                                REFEREE\n               Okay.   Fight.\n\n     Jannie comes rushing in, banging PK with a series of\n     hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws\n     one. PK absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing\n     up, dancing away. Jannie is all over him just as the\n     BELL RINGS. Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant.\n     PK goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex-\n     pression. Morrie goes to work on a small cut over\n     his eye.\n                             MORRIE\n               What are you trying to do,\n               bankrupt us? What happened?\n\n     PK turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door.\n     Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men.\n\n                             MORRIE\n               Christ!

In\n               case you haven't noticed, this\n               Boer bastard is trying to kill\n               you.\n\n                             PK\n               You see the way he drops his left\n               when he throws the right?\n\n                                MORRIE\n               Yeah?\n\n     The BELL RINGS. PK and   Morrie trade a look. Jannie\n     comes rushing over and  throws a big right. PK steps to\n     his own right side and  pops Jannie right over his dropped\n     left hand. He looks at   Morrie again.\n\n                                                               21.\n29   ANGLE ON MORRIE                                            29\n\n                             MORRIE\n               Thank you, God.\n\n     Jannie comes after PK, paying for each big right he\n     throws as PK finds his mark. PK plants one, then two,\n     then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus-\n     trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries\n     to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves\n     and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary. PK begins\n     to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com-\n     binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left\n     hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. Jannie\n     goes down in a heap. The crowd goes wild. The Referee\n     counts him out. Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to\n     lift their fallen fighter. Morrie also rushes in,\n     followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team. They hoist\n     PK up on their shoulders.\n\n\n30   PK'S POV - MARIA MARAIS                                    30\n\n     rising from her seat, and leaving with the other girls.\n     Their eyes meet.

Morrie comes bouncing through the\n     crowd, until he enters the empty dressing room in the\n     rear, where PK is getting dressed. Morrie takes a wad\n     of money out of his pocket.\n\n                             MORRIE\n               Here you go, pal.\n     He hands PK the money.\n\n                             PK\n               You're the treasurer of this\n               company.

Ja?\n               From cactus comes medicine to\n               heal the wounds of men and little\n               buttons if you eat one you can\n               touch the face of God or stare\n               into the mouth of hell. It is\n               the plant of patience, solitude,\n               love, and madness. Modesty,\n               beauty. Toughness and gentleness.\n               Of all the plants I think it is\n               closest to God.

PK's opponent\n     starts punching, jabbing, probing. After two feints he\n     comes after PK in earnest. PK steps left and peppers\n     him with three quick blows to the face. Solly's interest\n     is suddenly piqued. Again the fighters circle. Again\n     the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks.\n     This time PK dodges, hits him hard and spins him around,\n     hitting him twice more. A smile appears on Solly's face.\n     The opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive. PK\n     keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches.\n     The opponent unloads, banging away at PK with everything\n     he has. PK backs up two steps, then shifts positions.\n     The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes. As\n     he comes off the ropes PK throws him an eight-punch\n     combination, demolishing his opponent. PK steps back.\n     The opponent sags.

PK looks  down at\n      Mandoma in silence. Mandoma        rises unsteadily.

When he finishes the    bottle he takes\n      another one out of a case sitting by his   side and begins\n      to drink anew.\n                              PK (V.O.)\n                Friendships are rare--arising\n                out of mutual need rather than\n\n                                                                 133.\n                any shared interests.

PK, coming behind him, grabs him by the\n      collar and flings him into the safety tunnel, diving\n      after him a second later, just as the BOMB EXPLODES. A\n      few rocks come down, but nothing else.\n      The Africans look at each other with real apprehension.\n\n      PK rises from Elijah and peeks out.\n\n\n191   HIS POV - HANGUP                                           191\n\n      is still in place.\n\n      PK studies the hangup, stepping out onto the grizzly,\n      listening, looking. The hangup groans. The Africans\n      are petrified at the mouth of the tunnel.\n      PK stops midway on the bars. He studies the hangup\n      intently, then picks up a rock. Choosing a target he\n      heaves the rock with all his might toward the hangup\n      and runs like hell. The rock hits the hangup. PK\n      springs off the grizzly, right into the Africans as the\n      hangup thunders down. Dust and small rocks fill the\n      safety tunnel.\n\n      When the avalanche has stopped PK raises himself off the\n      Africans. They are all covered in dust but smiling and\n      babbling, happy to be alive.\n\n      PK peeks out and up. He signals to Elijah who hits the\n      LL-CLEAR WHISTLE.

PK sidesteps and hits him with a\n      left hook. The punch has no effect. Botha swings out\n      wildly. PK easily dances away. Botha picks up\n      another table and heaves it at PK. PK jumps to avoid\n      it, but trips on an overturned stool. He goes down.\n      The miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout.\n      People start to make bets.\n\n      Botha charges PK as PK scrambles up. Botha swings. The\n      blow glances off PK's shoulder and sends him flying,\n      spinning over a table. Botha leaps at PK, driving him\n      into the wall. PK grimaces, sagging. Botha picks him\n      up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive\n      arms. PK, his hands free, starts to pound on Botha's\n      ears with his palms. Botha screams as the powder head-\n      ache accelerates through the top of his skull. He\n      drops PK. PK rolls away and swings a stool at Botha's\n      midsection. Botha is driven back. PK goes to swing\n      the stool again. Botha catches it as if it were made\n      of balsa. He rips it out of PK's hand and flings it\n      back at him, charging behind it.\n\n      PK goes topping end over end. Botha gets a hand on him\n      and lifts him from behind. He flings PK over the bar.\n      PK hits the floor, stunned. Botha pulls at the bar\n      trying to get at PK.\n\n      He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as PK is trying to\n      regain his bearings. Finally, with one tremendous rip,\n      the bar comes away from its bolting. Botha pulls it\n      aside.\n\n      PK rises just as Botha moves in. PK hits him three\n      solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels\n      them. He grabs PK and starts to squeeze him again.\n      Face to face, Botha's crazed eyes watch the life\n      fade from PK's.\n\n\n217   CLOSEUP                                                       217\n\n      PK's eyes going blank.\n                                                    SMASH CUT TO:\n\n218   PK                                                            218\n\n                                                              151.\n\n      diving off a waterfall into the turbulent water below.\n\n                                                   SMASH CUT TO:\n\n219   BOTHA                                                        219\n\n      squeezing harder, breaking PK's concentration.\n\n                                                   SMASH CUT TO:\n220   PK                                                           220\n\n      swimming, exhausted, climbs on a rock, one more in\n      front of him.
