A SUMMER DAY\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               Just east of Webster Avenue in the North Bronx, 187th Street \n               is a predominantly Italian community and the commercial avenue \n               of the neighborhood. Fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias, \n               butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish. \n               It is Saturday morning around eleven o'clock -- a market \n               day.\n\n               WOMEN, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags, \n               baby carriages. MERCHANTS at their improvised street stands, \n               hawking their wares, disputing with their CUSTOMERS, roaring \n               salutations to PASSERSBY.\n\n               In the midst of all this, CAMERA HOMES IN on a typical \n               neighborhood...\n\n               BUTCHER SHOP.\n\n               Delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of \n               garlic. PATSY, the boss, a swarthy man of sixty, is flopping \n               a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty-\n               year-old MATRON. There are three or four other WOMEN in the \n               shop, all talking to one another. A four-year-old BOY lazily \n               chases a cat.\n\n               The white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher, \n               MARTY PILLETTI, comes out carrying a large leg of lamb. Marty \n               is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty-four. \n               His charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor. He \n               drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up \n               for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the \n               block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb. He \n               sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts \n               as he chats with his customer, MRS. FUSARI.\n\n                                     MRS.

With his free hand he wipes the gathering \n               sweat on his brow.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...Oh, hello there, is this Mary \n                         Feeney? Hello there, this is Marty \n                         Pilletti. I wonder if you recall \n                         me... Well, I'm kind of a stocky \n                         guy. The last time we met was in a \n                         movie, the RKO Chester. You was with \n                         another girl, and I was with a friend \n                         of mine named Angie. This was about \n                         a month ago...\n\n               The girl apparently doesn't remember him. A sort of panic \n               begins to seize Marty. His voice rises a little.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         The RKO Chester in Westchester Square. \n                         You was sitting in front of us, and \n                         we was annoying you, and you got \n                         mad, and... I'm the fellow who works \n                         in a butcher shop... Come on, you \n                         know who I am!... That's right, we \n                         went to Howard Johnson's and we had \n                         hamburgers. You hadda milkshake... \n                         Yeah, that's right. I'm the stocky \n                         one, the heavy-set feller... Well, \n                         I'm glad you recall me, because I \n                         hadda swell time that night, and I \n                         was just wondering how everything \n                         was with you. How's everything?... \n                         That's swell... Yeah, well, I'll \n                         tell you why I called...I was figuring \n                         on taking in a movie tonight, and I \n                         was wondering if you and your friend \n                         would care to see a movie tonight \n                         with me and my friend...\n                              (his eyes are closed \n                              now)\n                         Yeah, tonight. I know it's pretty \n                         late to call for a date, but I didn't \n                         know myself, till... Yeah, I know, \n                         well how about... Yeah, I know, well \n                         maybe next Saturday night. You free \n                         next Saturday night?... Well, how \n                         about the Saturday after that?... \n                         Yeah, I know... Yeah... Yeah... Oh, \n                         I understand, I mean...\n\n               He hangs up, sits for a moment, then rises, opens the sliding \n               doors, enters...\n\n               THE DINING ROOM.\n\n               He sits at the heavy, wooden table with its white-on-white \n               table cloth.\n\n               THE KITCHEN.\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti ladles portions of food from the steaming \n               kettles onto a plate that she brings into...\n\n               THE DINING ROOM.\n\n               ...and sets it down before her son. Without a word, he picks \n               up his fork and spoon and plunges into the mountain of \n               spaghetti, adds cheese, eats away. Mrs. Pilletti takes her \n               seat, folds her hands on the table, and sits watching Marty \n               eat.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         So what are you gonna do tonight, \n                         Marty?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked \n                         out. I may just hang arounna house.\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti nods a couple of times. A moment of silence.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Why don't you go to the Stardust \n                         Ballroom?\n\n               This gives Marty pause.

Who told you about the Stardust \n                         Ballroom?\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Thomas.

Ma, it's just a big dance \n                         hall, and that's all it is. I been \n                         there a hundred times. Loaded with \n                         tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Marty, I don't want you hang arounna \n                         house tonight. I want you to go take \n                         a shave and go out and dance.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Ma, when are you gonna give up? You \n                         gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't \n                         never gonna get married.\n\n                                     MRS.

I chased \n                         enough girls in my life. I went to \n                         enough dances. I got hurt enough. I \n                         don't wanna get hurt no more. I just \n                         called a girl just now, and I got a \n                         real brush-off, boy. I figured I was \n                         past the point of being hurt, but \n                         that hurt. Some stupid woman who I \n                         didn't even wanna call up. She gave \n                         me the brush. I don't wanna go to \n                         the Stardust Ballroom because all \n                         that ever happened to me there was \n                         girls made me feel like I was a bug. \n                         I got feelings, you know. I had enough \n                         pain. No, thank you.\n\n                                     MRS.

A fat ugly man.\n\n                                     MRS.

Leave me alone!\n\n               He stands abruptly, his face pained and drawn. He makes half-\n               formed gestures to his mother, but he can't find words at \n               the moment. He turns and marches a few paces away, turns to \n               his mother again.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Ma, waddaya want from me?! Waddaya \n                         want from me?! I'm miserable enough \n                         as it is! Leave me alone! I'll go to \n                         the Stardust Ballroom! I'll put onna \n                         blue suit and I'll go! And you know \n                         what I'm gonna get for my trouble? \n                         Heartache! A big night of heartache!\n\n               Sullenly, he marches back to his seat, sits down, picks up \n               his fork, plunges it into the spaghetti, stuffs a mouthful \n               into his mouth, and chews vigorously for a moment. It is \n               impossible for him to remain angry long. After a while, he \n               is shaking his head.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Loaded with tomatoes...boy, that's \n                         rich.\n\n               He plunges his fork in again, starts to eat. Mrs. Pilletti \n               watches Marty anxiously as we...\n\n               FADE OUT.\n\n               FADE IN\n\n               NEW YORK CITY, WEST FARMS SQUARE. NIGHT\n\n               West Farms Square is a big street in the Bronx, filled with \n               stores, bowling alleys and bars. Cars push along between the \n               pillars of the elevated subway structure. The NOISE of the \n               subway trains ROARS by overhead every few moments.\n\n               CAMERA FINDS and ESTABLISHES the Stardust Ballroom. It \n               occupies the second floor of a large, dirty gray three-story \n               building. It is a hot June night, and the windows are open \n               for ventilation purposes. MUSIC manufactured by Dave \n               Greenglass and His Band blends with the NOISES of the street.\n\n               STARDUST BALLROOM. ENTRANCE VESTIBULE/STAIRS.\n\n               MUSIC plays in the background. CAMERA views CLARA, a plain \n               girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, MILLIE, \n               prettier; Millie's fiance ANDY, 30; and a second young man \n               DR. KEEGAN, also 30, who is a resident at Fordham Hospital. \n               They are all huddled over a cigarette machine near the street \n               door.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                              (in a low voice)\n                         I told you she wasn't especially \n                         attractive, but that she had a good \n                         deal of charm, and she's really a \n                         real nice girl...\n\n                                     DR.

It's just \n                         that I get one Saturday night off \n                         every three weeks, and I was expecting \n                         something better, that's all.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         I told you she wasn't attractive...\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         You told me that she was a little \n                         tall, but that she wasn't bad looking \n                         at all.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         Millie's been after me to fix her up \n                         with a date, so I...\n\n                                     DR.

They are halfway up, \n               when two GIRLS come in at the top of the stairs and start \n               down. Dr. Keegan, who is holding Clara's arm, looks up, nods.\n\n               STARDUST BALLROOM, ANTEROOM.\n\n               This is a small, carpeted lobby with TICKET TAKER in booth, \n               a cloak room and rest rooms. Painted posters on the walls \n               announce coming events and caution against smoking. There \n               are also large blow-ups of musicians who had played this \n               ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things. About six \n               or seven PEOPLE congregate in the lobby, engaged in various \n               indifferent activities.\n\n               CAMERA ANGLES include the swinging doors, as Clara, Andy, \n               Millie and Dr. Keegan come in. As they enter, the doors to \n               the ballroom proper are pushed out, and a GIRL in a black \n               dress, quite pretty, comes in. She starts across the anteroom \n               toward the cloak room, when Dr. Keegan calls out suddenly to \n               her.\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         Hey!\n\n               The girl turns. Recognition floods her face.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         Herbie!

Dr. Keegan \n               turns to Clara.\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         That's a girl used to know.\n\n               BALLROOM, LOUNGE.\n\n               A fairly long room, lined on one side by a bar and on the \n               other by cheap leatherette booths. It is brightly lit and \n               crowded. There is a constant movement in and out of the \n               lounge. At the far end of the lounge, there are two large \n               iron fire doors open to allow the heat to flow out. Dance \n               MUSIC from dance floor.\n\n               Clara, Dr. Keegan, Millie and Andy come into the lounge and \n               form a little group in the midst of moving PASSERSBY around \n               them. A kind of strange excitement has begun to enter Dr. \n               Keegan. He stands with the others, but his attention is \n               devoted to ogling the passing GIRLS, occasionally looking \n               back to the doors leading to the anteroom.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         Boy, it's packed in here.\n\n                                     MILLIE\n                              (to Clara)\n                         Some of these kids are awful young. \n                         Aren't you afraid you'll bump into \n                         one of your students?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (nervously looking at \n                              Dr. Keegan)\n                         I wouldn't think so.

I'll be \n                         right back.\n\n               He turns and moves quickly through the crowded lounge, back \n               to the swinging doors leading into the anteroom. CAMERA STAYS \n               with Clara, Millie and Andy staring after him.\n\n                                     ANDY\n                         So what do you say, Clara? Wanna see \n                         if we can get a table?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         All right.\n\n               They turn and move toward the booths.\n\n               BALLROOM.\n\n               The dance floor is fairly dark. A romantic effect is achieved \n               by papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 over the chandeliers. Around the walls are \n               the stag lines -- the MEN and waiting GIRLS. They stand singly \n               or in small uneasy groups. There is constant flux and \n               movement.\n\n               CAMERA DOLLIES slowly past the stag line, moving past faces, \n               short, fat, tall, thin stags. Some pretend indifference. \n               Some exhibit patent hunger.\n\n               CAMERA HOLDS ANGLING to include Marty, Angie near the end of \n               the stag line. They are freshly shaved and groomed.\n\n               MARTY AND ANGIE.\n\n               They are leaning against the wall smoking, watching their \n               more fortunate brethren on the floor in the background.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                         Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         There was one nice-looking one there \n                         inna black dress and beads, but she's \n                         dancing now.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                              (looking off-screen)\n                         There's a nice-looking little short \n                         one for you right now.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (following his gaze)\n                         Where?\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                         Down there. That little one there.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE PAST Marty and Angie across the dance floor \n               toward the wall opposite, where three GIRLS are standing. \n               Two are leaning against the wall. The third is facing them \n               with her back to the dance floor. This last girl is the one \n               Angie has in mind. She is a cute little kid about twenty and \n               wears a bright smile.\n\n               MARTY AND ANGIE.\n\n               They stare off toward the three girls across the room.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Yeah, she looks all right from here.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                         Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask \n                         them? I'll take the one inna green \n                         dress.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I think this number is a little fast. \n                         Wait a minute.\n\n               He tries a few tentative steps, testing for tempo.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         It's all right, I think. They still \n                         there?\n\n               The two cavaliers turn their heads and look off-screen in \n               the direction of the three girls. Apparently, the girls are \n               still there. Marty and Angie relinquish their lounging \n               positions against the wall and slouch along past the line of \n               stags with a show of determined unconcern. They edge through \n               the crush of people on the non-dancing margin of the dance \n               floor and slowly push their way toward the...\n\n               THREE GIRLS.\n\n               Marty and Angie come in and start to approach the three girls. \n               The girls, aware of the boys' presence, stiffen and their \n               chatter comes to a halt. Angie advances to one of the girls.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                         Waddaya say, you wanna dance?\n\n               The girl looks surprised, as if this were an extraordinary \n               invitation to receive in a dance hall, looks confounded at \n               her two friends, shrugs, detaches herself from the wall, \n               moves to the outer fringe of the pack of dancers, raises her \n               hand languidly to dancing position and awaits Angie with \n               ineffable boredom. Marty, smiling tentatively, addresses the \n               SHORT GIRL.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Excuse me, would you care for this \n                         dance?\n\n               The Short Girl gives Marty a quick glance of appraisal, then \n               looks quickly at her remaining friend.\n\n                                     SHORT GIRL\n                              (but not unpleasantly)\n                         I don't feel like dancing just yet.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Sure.\n\n               He turns and heads sluggishly in the direction of the stag \n               line.\n\n               THE STAG LINE.\n\n               A TRAVEL SHOT follows Marty, as he moves past the line of \n               stags, all of whom are watching him. CAMERA HOLDS as he finds \n               his old niche by the wall, leans there. A moment later, he \n               glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her friend \n               are.\n\n               MARTY'S P.O.V.: The Short Girl is approached by a dapper \n               young BOY who asks her to dance. She smiles, excuses herself \n               to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor.\n\n               Marty stares at the Short Girl. He shrugs, he's used to this \n               kind of thing, then turns his attention bleakly back to \n               watching...\n\n               THE DANCE FLOOR.\n\n               The band starts up again and the MUSIC blares. It's a Lindy \n               Hop number. Couples swirl past; the MUSIC comes up BIG.\n\n               THE BALLROOM.\n\n               Marty leans against the wall, smoking and watching the dancers \n               swirl past. Dr. Keegan's VOICE is heard.\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                              (off-screen)\n                         You here stag or with a girl?\n\n               Marty's attention is on the passing couples, so he doesn't \n               seem to hear. ANGLE WIDENS to include the Doctor standing on \n               Marty's right. Suddenly aware of the Doctor, Marty turns his \n               head.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         You say something?\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         Yeah. I was just asking you if you \n                         was here stag or with a girl.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I'm stag.\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on \n                         a blind date with a dog, and I just \n                         met an old girl I used to know, and \n                         I was wondering how I'm gonna get \n                         rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody \n                         to take her home, you know what I \n                         mean? I'd be glad to pay you five \n                         bucks if you take her home for me.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (confused)\n                         What?\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         I'll take you over, and I'll introduce \n                         you as an old army buddy of mine, \n                         and then I'll cut out. Because I got \n                         this other girl waiting for me out \n                         by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you \n                         five bucks.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (stares at the man)\n                         Are you kidding?\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         No, I'm not kidding.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         You can't just walk off onna girl \n                         like that.\n\n               Dr. Keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys. Marty \n               turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition. \n               The Doctor approaches THREE STAGS and obviously broaches the \n               subject with one of them. This STAG seems more receptive to \n               the idea. Dr. Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a \n               five dollar bill. The Stag detaches himself from the wall \n               and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor.\n\n               Marty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the \n               Stag, who come in and move past him. Concerned and curious, \n               Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning \n               position, following in their general direction.\n\n               Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the \n               area around the dance floor.\n\n               ALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY.\n\n               As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor \n               proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the \n               booths.\n\n               LOUNGE.\n\n               Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. Dr. \n               Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her. She is \n               looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola \n               glass. Dr. Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara \n               and is going through some story about being called away on \n               an emergency. The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who \n               will see to it that she gets home safely.\n\n               Clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying \n               hard not to seem affected. She politely rejects the Stag's \n               company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway. \n               Dr. Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and \n               the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway.\n\n               ARCHWAY.\n\n               From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr. \n               Keegan and the Stag. The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty, \n               and he catches their conversation.\n\n                                     DR. KEEGAN\n                         ...in that case, as long as she's \n                         going home alone, give me the five \n                         bucks back...\n\n                                     STAG\n                         Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks. \n                         I was willing. It's my five bucks...\n\n               They move past and away and Marty stares after them before \n               he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen.\n\n               Clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the \n               glass of Coca Cola in front of her. Her eyes are closed. \n               Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out \n               of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next \n               to do. As she glances around, CAMERA ANGLES to include a \n               sign over an exit that reads \"Fire Escape.\" Clara starts \n               moving toward that door.\n\n               Marty is staring off-screen toward Clara. He slowly works \n               his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction \n               of the fire escape.\n\n               LOUNGE.\n\n               Near the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view. \n               Background sounds continue steadily.\n\n               Marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops \n               and stares off-screen.\n\n               Clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape \n               outside.\n\n               Marty watches. Then he continues on, crossing the threshold \n               of the...\n\n               FIRE ESCAPE.\n\n               It is sizeable, almost a small balcony. It looks out onto \n               the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses. Clara \n               is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her \n               head sunk down. She is crying. Marty watches her for a moment \n               before moving a step or two forward.\n\n               Clara doesn't turn. Marty tries to think of something to \n               say.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (finally)\n                         Excuse me, Miss, would you care to \n                         dance?\n\n               Clara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, \n               her lips trembling. Then, in one of those moments of \n               simultaneous impulse, she lurches to Marty with a sob, and \n               Marty takes her to him.\n\n               They stand in an awkward embrace, Marty a little embarrassed, \n               looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge, \n               wondering if anybody is seeing them. He reaches back with \n               one hand, and contrives, with some effort, to push one of \n               the heavy iron doors shut. He returns his hand around the \n               girl's shoulders. He stands stiffly, allowing her to cry on \n               his chest, as we...\n\n               FADE OUT.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               BRONX APARTMENT HOUSE, STAIRWAY. NIGHT\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti, in her hat and coat and carrying a purse, is \n               making her heavy way up the last few steps toward the landing. \n               She pauses to catch her breath on the landing. Then she moves \n               down the hallway to...\n\n               ENTRANCE TO APARTMENT 4-B.\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti rings the bell. The SOUND can be heard as she \n               waits. The door is opened by Virginia.\n\n                                     VIRGINIA\n                         Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in.\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti enters the apartment.\n\n               APARTMENT.\n\n               Virginia closes the door after Mrs. Pilletti enters, and \n               they stand in a small narrow hallway, brightly lit. At the \n               far end to the right is the living room in the background.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                              (in a low voice as \n                              she pulls off her \n                              coat)\n                         Is Catherine here?\n\n               Virginia helps her with her coat.\n\n                                     VIRGINIA\n                              (nods, keeping her \n                              voice low)\n                         We didn't tell her anything yet. We \n                         thought that we'd leave it to you. \n                         We thought you'd put it like how you \n                         were lonely, and why don't she come \n                         to live with you. Because that way \n                         it looks like she's doing you a favor, \n                         insteada we're throwing her out, and \n                         it won't be so cruel on her. Do you \n                         want Tommy and me to stay here with \n                         you?\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I think it be a better idea if you \n                         and Thomas go out, because otherwise \n                         she's gonna start a fight with you, \n                         and everybody's gonna be yelling.\n\n               Thomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an \n               anxious smile on his face.\n\n                                     THOMAS\n                         Hello, Aunt Theresa.\n\n                                     MRS.

And wouldn't she \n                         come and keep you company, because \n                         that way, you see...\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a \n                         the whole thing.\n\n               A shrill, imperious woman's voice breaks into the whispered \n               conference in the hallway.\n\n                                     CATHERINE'S VOICE\n                              (off-screen)\n                         Who's there?! Who's there?!\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti heads up the foyer to the living room, followed \n               by Virginia and Thomas.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                              (calling back)\n                         It's me, Catherine! How you feel?\n\n               CATHERINE comes in at the end of the foyer. She is a gaunt \n               woman with a face carved out of granite. She is tough, \n               embittered, with a history of pain and mirthless hard work \n               ingrained into her features.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         Hey! What are you doing here?\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I came to see you. How you feel?\n\n               The two sisters quickly embrace and release each other.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         I gotta pain in my left side, and my \n                         leg throbs like a drum.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I been getting a pain in my shoulder.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I \n                         have a pain in my hip, and my right \n                         arm aches so much I can't sleep. \n                         It's a curse to be old. How you feel?\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I feel fine.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         That's nice.\n\n               Now that the standard greetings are over, Aunt Catherine \n               abruptly turns and goes back into the living room. Mrs. \n               Pilletti follows. Virginia and Thomas remain in the doorway.\n\n               LIVING ROOM.\n\n               Catherine and Mrs. Pilletti enter and Catherine heads straight \n               to a chair -- obviously her chair. It is an old heavy oaken \n               chair with thick armrests. The rest of the apartment is \n               furnished in what is known as \"modern.\" A piece from House \n               Beautiful here, a piece from American Homes and Gardens there. \n               Aunt Catherine sits erect and forbidding in her chair. Mrs. \n               Pilletti seats herself with a sigh in a neighboring chair. \n               Thomas and Virginia remain off-screen in the hallway for a \n               moment to hang up Mrs. Pilletti's coat. The two old sisters \n               sit for a moment.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Well, how's everything with you?\n\n               Aunt Catherine grimaces to describe how everything is with \n               her.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         My son Marty's fine. Everybody's \n                         fine...\n\n               Thomas comes in from the hallway, stands in the back of the \n               room, somewhat apprehensively.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         We gotta postcard from my son Nickie \n                         and his bride.

The two old sisters sit rigidly until they hear \n               the SOUND of the door closing. Catherine cocks an eyebrow \n               and promptly launches into her statement.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         I wake up this morning, I hear the \n                         baby crying.

Leave \n                         him in peace. He wantsa be alone \n                         with his wife. They don't want no \n                         old lady sitting inna balcony.

You are an \n                         old goat, and she has an Italian \n                         temper. She is a good girl, but you \n                         drive her crazy. Catherine, you are \n                         no fool. You know this is no good, \n                         an old woman living with a husband \n                         and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, \n                         anna house burns down.\n\n               Catherine stands abruptly. She is deeply hurt.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         So I am an old garbage bag, put inna \n                         street.\n\n                                     MRS.

You come to my house where \n                         you know you be happier yourself.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         It pains that they should do this.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I know it pains.\n\n               Catherine turns and meanders a few steps. The stiff edge of \n               mordant humor that has been her one defense against life has \n               deserted her, and she is just a hurt old lady now.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         These are the worst years, I tell \n                         you.\n\n               She seats herself on an Eames chair. On her right, a Modern-\n               Age lamp towers slimly. On her left is a Modern-Age endtable \n               with a Modern-Age ashtray on it. The hardened muscles in her \n               face suddenly slacken.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                              (with deep compassion)\n                         Catherine, you are very dear to me. \n                         We have cried many times together. \n                         When my husband died, I would have \n                         gone insane if it were not for you. \n                         I ask you to come to my house, because \n                         I can make you happy. Please come to \n                         my house.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         These are the worst years. I tell \n                         you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm \n                         afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid \n                         I'm gonna see an old lady with white \n                         hair, like the old ladies inna park, \n                         little bundles inna black shawl, \n                         waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty-\n                         six years old. What am I to do with \n                         myself? I have strength in my hands. \n                         I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna \n                         make dinner for my children. Am I an \n                         old dog to lie in fronta the fire \n                         til my eyes close? These are the \n                         terrible years, Theresa! Terrible \n                         years!\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Catherine, my sister...\n\n               Catherine stares distraught at Mrs. Pilletti.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         It's gonna happen to you! It's gonna \n                         happen to you! What will you do if \n                         Marty gets married?! What will you \n                         cook? What happen to alla children \n                         playing in alla rooms? Where is the \n                         noise?! It is a curse to be a widow! \n                         A curse. What will you do if Marty \n                         gets married?! What will you do?\n\n               She stares at Mrs. Pilletti, her deep eyes haggard and pained. \n               Mrs. Pilletti stares back for a moment, then her own eyes \n               close. Catherine has hit home. Catherine sinks back onto her \n               chair, sitting stiffly, her arms on the thick armrests. Mrs. \n               Pilletti sits hunched a little forward, her hands folded \n               nervously in her lap.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                              (continuing quietly)\n                         I will put my clothes inna bag, and \n                         I will come to you tomorrow.\n\n               The two sisters, somber and silent, continue to just stare \n               at one another.\n\n               THE STARDUST BALLROOM. NIGHT\n\n               CAMERA PANS the crowd, picking up Marty and Clara dancing \n               cheek-to-cheek on the crowded, darkened dance floor. The \n               MUSIC rides over the top of the scene.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         You come up here often?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I was up here twice before. Once \n                         with a friend of mine and once I \n                         came up alone. The last time... do \n                         you see that girl in the gray dress \n                         sitting over there?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Well, the last time I was up here, \n                         that's where I sat. I sat there for \n                         an hour and a half, without moving a \n                         muscle. Now and then, some fellow \n                         would sort of walk up to me and then \n                         change his mind. I'll never forget \n                         just sitting there for an hour and a \n                         half with my hands in my lap. Then I \n                         began to cry, and I had to get up \n                         and go home.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         This is something recent with me, \n                         this bursting into tears at the least \n                         thing.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Oh, I cry all the time, any little \n                         thing. My brothers, my brother-in-\n                         laws, they're always telling me what \n                         a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you \n                         don't get goodhearted by accident. \n                         You get kicked around long enough, \n                         you get to be a real professor of \n                         pain. I know exactly how you feel. \n                         And I also want you to know I'm having \n                         a very good time with you now and \n                         really enjoying myself. So you see, \n                         you're not such a dog as you think \n                         you are.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I'm having a very good time, too.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         So there you are. So I guess I'm not \n                         such a dog as I think I am.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         You're a very nice guy, and I don't \n                         know why some girl hasn't grabbed \n                         you off long ago.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I don't know either. I think I'm a \n                         very nice guy. I also think I'm a \n                         pretty smart guy in my own way.\n\n               Clara smiles briefly at this.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Now I figure, two people get married, \n                         and they gonna live together forty, \n                         fifty years. So it's just gotta be \n                         more than whether they're good looking \n                         or not. You tell me you think you're \n                         not very good-looking. My father was \n                         a really ugly man, but my mother \n                         adored him. She told me that she \n                         used to get so miserable sometimes, \n                         like everybody, you know?

That's \n                         one of the most beautiful things I \n                         have in my life, the way my father \n                         and mother were. And my father was a \n                         real ugly man. So it doesn't matter \n                         if you look like a gorilla.

NIGHT.\n\n               Once a candy store, now a soda fountain where booths have \n               been installed in the rear. One wall of the luncheonette in \n               front is covered with magazines from floor to ceiling. It is \n               a nice clean joint, brightly lit. Several CUSTOMERS are \n               occupying three of the four booths.\n\n               BOOTH.\n\n               They sit opposite each other in the booth. Each has a cup of \n               coffee. Marty is still talking, but now he is apparently \n               telling a story so funny that he can hardly get the words \n               out. The hilarity has communicated itself to Clara. Her eyes \n               are burning with suppressed laughter. Every now and then she \n               has to gasp to control the bubbly giggling inside of her.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...so I'm inna kneeling position, \n                         and if you ever try shooting a BAR \n                         inna kneeling position, you know \n                         what I mean.

He lets out a sudden guffaw and \n               instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders. Clara hides \n               her face in her hands and giggles desperately. Some of the \n               other people turn to look at them.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         So my target goes down, and a minute \n                         later, the flag comes up.

Then slowly, Marty begins to giggle \n               again. It communicates itself to Clara. In a moment they are \n               hiding their faces in their hands, their shoulders shivering \n               with laughter.\n\n               STARDUST BALLROOM.\n\n               CLOSE ON Angie.

Suddenly he calls out.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                         Hey, Marty!

Clara has left half of her \n               pie. Also an empty pack of cigarettes, and another pack half-\n               gone. They are both smoking. Marty is still talking, but the \n               mood is no longer laughter. A pensive, speculative hush has \n               fallen over them. They have been talking for hours, and they \n               have reached the stage where you start tearing designs in \n               the paper napkins.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         ...When I got outta the army, Clara, \n                         I was lost. I didn't know what I \n                         wanted to do. I was twenny-five years \n                         old, what was I gonna do, go back to \n                         my old job, forty cents an hour. I \n                         thought maybe I go to college under \n                         the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? \n                         But I wouldn't graduate till I was \n                         twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, \n                         even if I made it in three years. \n                         And my brother Freddie wanted to get \n                         married, and I had three unmarried \n                         sisters -- in an Italian home, that's \n                         a terrible thing. And my kid brother \n                         Nickie, he's a one got married last \n                         week. So I just went to pieces. I \n                         used to walk inna streets till three, \n                         four o'clock inna mornings. My mother \n                         used to be so worried about me. My \n                         uncle Mario come over one time. He \n                         offered me a job driving his hack \n                         onna night shift. He got his own \n                         cab, you know. And God forgive me \n                         for what I'm gonna say now, but I \n                         used to thinka doing away with myself. \n                         I used to stand sometimes in the \n                         subway, and God forgive me what I'm \n                         going to say, I used to feel the \n                         tracks sucking me down under the \n                         wheels.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (deeply sympathetic)\n                         Yes, I know.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I'm a Catholic, you know, and even \n                         to think about suicide is a terrible \n                         sin.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Yes, I know.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a \n                         frienda my father -- he offered me \n                         this job in his butcher shop, and \n                         everybody pleaded with me to take \n                         it. So that's what happened. I didn't \n                         wanna be a butcher.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         There's nothing wrong with being a \n                         butcher.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant \n                         profession. It's in a lower social \n                         scale. People look down on butchers.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I don't.\n\n               Marty looks quickly up at her, then back down.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa \n                         sell his shop now, because he and \n                         his wife are lonely, and they wanna \n                         move out to California in Los Angeles \n                         and live near their married daughter. \n                         Because she's always writing them to \n                         come out there. So it's a nice little \n                         shop. I handle his books for him, so \n                         I know he has a thirty-five percent \n                         markup which is not unreasonable, \n                         and he takes home net maybe a hundred, \n                         hundred and fifty bucks a week. The \n                         point is, of course, you gotta worry \n                         about the supermarkets. There's two \n                         inna neighborhood now, and there's \n                         an A&P coming in, at least that's \n                         the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade \n                         is strictly Italian, but the younger \n                         Italian girls, they get married, and \n                         they don't stick to the old Italian \n                         dishes so much. I mean, you gotta \n                         take that into account too.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         It's my feeling that you really want \n                         to buy this shop, Marty.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         That's true. I do. But I'm gonna \n                         have to take outta loan inna bank \n                         eight thousand dollars. That's a big \n                         note to carry, because I have to \n                         give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and \n                         what I have to weigh is: will it pay \n                         off in the end more than I can make \n                         onna salary?\n\n               Clara looks down at her fingers, her face alive and sensitive. \n               She carefully assembles her words in her mind. Then she looks \n               at the squat butcher across the table from her.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Marty, I know you for three hours, \n                         but I know you're a good butcher. \n                         You're an intelligent, sensitive, \n                         decent man. I have a feeling about \n                         you like sometimes a kid comes in to \n                         see me for one reason or another. \n                         And some of these kids, Marty, in my \n                         classes, they have so much warmth in \n                         them, so much capacity. And that's \n                         the feeling I get about you.\n\n               Marty shuts his eyes, then opens them quickly, bows his head.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         If you were one of my students, I \n                         would say, \"Go ahead and buy the \n                         butcher shop. You're a good butcher.\"\n\n               Clara pauses.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (not quite trusting \n                              the timbre of his \n                              voice)\n                         Well, there's a lotta things I could \n                         do with this shop. I could organize \n                         my own supermarket. Get a buncha \n                         neighborhood merchants together. \n                         That's what a lotta them are doing.\n\n               He looks up at her now.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Wadda you think?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I think anything you want to do, \n                         you'll do well.\n\n               Tears begin to flood his eyes again. He quickly looks away. \n               He licks his lips.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (still looking down)\n                         I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?\n\n               Clara looks down at her hands.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (also in a low voice)\n                         Yes, I am.\n\n               Marty looks up at her.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I only got about three bucks on me \n                         now, but I just live about eight \n                         blocks from here on the other side \n                         of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk \n                         back to my house? I'll run in, pick \n                         up some dough, and let's step out \n                         somewhere.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I really should get home...\n\n               She twists in her seat and looks toward the back of the \n               luncheonette.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         It's only a quarter of twelve.

NIGHT.\n\n               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Angie meandering down the street on which \n               the neighborhood bar is located. It is near midnight, and \n               the street is empty except for Angie and the CLACKING of his \n               leather heels on the pavement. He comes to the bar, opens \n               the door, enters...\n\n               THE BAR. NIGHT.\n\n               The SOUNDS of Saturday night revelry are loud, coming mostly \n               from the Irish contingent of the neighborhood. They are \n               grouped along practically the whole bar. Three or four WOMEN \n               and a number of shirtsleeved MEN, mostly in their late \n               forties, early fifties.

The \n               cars are parked bumper-to-bumper in lines along the curb. \n               The five-story apartment buildings are mostly dark, an \n               occasional window lit.\n\n               Marty suddenly stops and bends down; his shoe lace has become \n               untied.

He fidgets self-consciously, bends down \n               and begins to retie it.

The car backs and fills once or twice and eventually \n               clears and whisks into the street.\n\n               Marty stands looking after the departing car, then slowly \n               turns and goes back up the sidewalk.

Marty closes the porch door.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         This is the kitchen.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Yes, I know.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Come on inna dining room.\n\n               He turns the light on as he enters.

Just take off your coat a \n                         minute.\n\n               He helps her off with her coat. He remains behind her, looking \n               down at her. Conscious of his scrutiny, she sits \n               uncomfortably, breathing unevenly. Marty takes her coat into \n               the dark living room. Clara is patient but nervous. Marty \n               comes back, sits on another chair, and there is an awkward \n               silence.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         So I was telling you, my kid brother \n                         Nickie got married last Sunday. That \n                         was a very nice affair. And they had \n                         this statue of some woman, and they \n                         had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. \n                         I never saw anything so grand in my \n                         life.\n                              (the silence again \n                              falls between them.)\n                         And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I \n                         know a good hunka steak when I see \n                         one. That was choice filet, right \n                         off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty \n                         a pound. Of course, if you wanna \n                         cheaper cut, get rib steak. That \n                         gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes \n                         to about a buck and a quarter a pound, \n                         if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make \n                         yourself comfortable. You're all \n                         tense.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Oh, I'm fine.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         You want me to take you home, I'll \n                         take you home.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Maybe that would be a good idea.\n\n               She stands. He stands. He's a little angry. He turns and \n               sullenly goes back to the living room for her coat. \n               Wordlessly, he begins to help her into the coat.\n\n               Standing behind her, he puts his hands on her shoulders, \n               then suddenly seizes her, and begins kissing her on the neck. \n               As Marty holds Clara, kissing the back of her neck, the \n               dialogue drops to quick, hushed whispers.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         No, Marty, please...\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I like you.

I'll take you home! All \n                         right!\n\n               He marches a few paces away, deeply disturbed. He turns back \n               to her.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         All I wanted was a lousy kiss!

What am I, \n                         a leper or something?!\n\n               He turns and goes into the living room to hide the flush of \n               hot tears threatening to fill his eyes. Clara is also on the \n               verge of tears.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (more to herself than \n                              to him)\n                         I just didn't feel like it, that's \n                         all.\n\n               Slowly, she moves to the archway leading to the living room. \n               CAMERA ANGLES to include the living room where Marty sits on \n               the couch with his hands in his lap, staring straight ahead. \n               The room is dark except for the slanted light coming from \n               the dining room.\n\n               Clara goes to the couch and sits on the edge beside him. He \n               doesn't look at her.\n\n               LIVING ROOM.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I'm old enough to know better.

Let me getta \n                         packa cigarettes, and I'll take you \n                         home.\n\n               He starts to rise but instead sinks back onto the couch, \n               looking straight ahead. Clara looks at him, her face \n               peculiarly soft and compassionate.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I'd like to see you again. Very much. \n                         The reason I didn't let you kiss me \n                         was because I just didn't know how \n                         to handle the situation. You're the \n                         kindest man I ever met. The reason I \n                         tell you this is because I want to \n                         see you again very much. I know that \n                         when you take me home, I'm going to \n                         just lie on my bed and think about \n                         you.

CAMERA ANGLES to include \n               door to bedroom. Marty opens his bureau drawer and extracts \n               a pack of cigarettes. He comes back out and looks at Clara \n               for the first time. They start to walk to the dining room. \n               In the archway, Marty pauses and turns to her.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Nothing.\n\n               They quietly slip into each other's arms and kiss. Slowly \n               their faces part, and Marty's head sinks down upon her \n               shoulder. He is crying, detectable from the slight shake of \n               his shoulders. The girl presses her cheek against the back \n               of his head. They stand. The SOUND of the kitchen door opening \n               splits them out of their embrace. A moment later Mrs. \n               Pilletti's voice is heard.\n\n                                     MRS.

PILLETTI\n                              (to Clara with a sigh)\n                         It's a very sad business, I tell \n                         you. A woman, fifty-six years old, \n                         all her life, she had her own home. \n                         Now she's just an old lady, sleeping \n                         on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's \n                         a curse to be a mother, I tell you. \n                         Your children grow up and then what \n                         is left for you to do? What is a \n                         mother's life but her children? It \n                         is a very cruel thing when your son \n                         has no place for you in his home.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Couldn't she find some sort of hobby \n                         to fill out her time?\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Hobby! What can she do? She cooks \n                         and she cleans. You gotta have a \n                         house to clean. You gotta have \n                         children to cook for. These are the \n                         terrible years for a woman, the \n                         terrible years.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         You mustn't feel too harshly against \n                         her daughter-in-law. She also wants \n                         to have a house to clean and a family \n                         to cook for.\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti darts a quick, sharp look at Clara. Then she \n               looks back to her own hands, which are beginning to twist \n               nervously.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         You don't think my sister Catherine \n                         should live in her daughter-in-law's \n                         house?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Well, I don't know the people, of \n                         course, but as a rule, I don't think \n                         a mother-in-law should live with a \n                         young couple.\n\n                                     MRS.

In real \n                         life, it don't work out that way. \n                         You wait till you are a mother.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         It's silly of me to argue about it. \n                         I don't know the people involved.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. \n                         It's getting late, and the buses \n                         only run about one an hour.\n\n                                     MRS.

PILLETTI\n                         Goodnight.\n\n               Marty and Clara go out through the kitchen. CAMERA STAYS on \n               Mrs. Pilletti, who stands expressionlessly by her chair, \n               staring after them. She remains there rigid even after the \n               kitchen door has OPENED and SHUT.\n\n               FORDHAM ROAD. NIGHT\n\n               The biggest intersection in the Bronx is near the Grand \n               Concourse at Fordham Road, which is the biggest boulevard. \n               Despite the hour, the sidewalks are crowded with PEOPLE. The \n               TRAFFIC is heavy with buses.\n\n               We PICK UP Angie walking up Fordham Road just about to the \n               Grand Concourse. As he reaches the northeast corner of the \n               intersection and stands, waiting for the light to change, he \n               looks off-screen. Something captures his attention, and he \n               calls out.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                         Hey!!\n\n               STREET OUTSIDE A DEPARTMENT STORE.\n\n               In front of Alexander's Department Store, the street is \n               crowded, and a bus queue waits for the downtown Concourse \n               bus. Marty and Clara are part of the queue.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                              (starting toward Marty \n                              and Clara, shouting)\n                         Hey!\n\n               Angie starts into the street without waiting for the lights \n               to change. Impatiently, he has to wait until traffic stops \n               for the light.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                              (shouting as he goes)\n                         Hey, Marty!

He has pushed himself \n               in between Marty and Clara, and addresses himself entirely \n               to Marty.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         What happened, Angie, was that we \n                         thought we were just gonna go for a \n                         short walk, and then we thought we \n                         were gonna come right back, but we \n                         got to talking. Listen, Angie, I \n                         want you to meet Clara...\n                              (he tries to turn the \n                              sullen Angie toward \n                              Clara)\n                         Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. \n                         I told you about him.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         How do you do?\n\n               Angie acknowledges the introduction with a surly nod.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                              (completely ignoring \n                              Clara now)\n                         Waddaya gonna do now?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I'm gonna take Clara home.

By \n                         the time I get home, it's gonna be \n                         two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten \n                         o'clock mass tomorrow.\n\n               Angie stares with thick, sullen jealousy at his best friend. \n               He turns sharply and starts away from Marty and Clara.\n\n                                     ANGIE\n                              (as he goes)\n                         All right, I'll see you!\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (calling after him)\n                         Where you going?\n\n               Angie, feeling rejected and jealous, moves swiftly out into \n               the other PEDESTRIANS on Fordham Road.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (calling more loudly \n                              after him)\n                         I'll see you tomorrow after mass!\n\n               He stares for a moment at the departing form of his friend, \n               then turns to Clara with a shrug and a smile, as if to say, \n               \"I don't know what's the matter with him.\" The long-awaited \n               downtown bus ROARS up to the corner, blocking our view of \n               Marty and Clara.\n\n               LOWER-MIDDLE-CLASS BRONX STREET. NIGHT.\n\n               Marty and Clara stroll along the walk toward the front doors \n               of an apartment house.\n\n               APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY. NIGHT.\n\n               Marty and Clara enter and cross the lobby toward the stairway. \n               They move slowly.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         You got an elevator in this house?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         We just live one flight up.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         So I'll call you tomorrow.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Okay.\n\n               Clara leans against the iron banister of the stairway.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Call me about two-thirty, because I \n                         won't be home from my aunt's till \n                         about then.\n\n               The doors of the ELEVATOR slide open, and a middle-aged COUPLE \n               comes out. They have obviously been having a heated exchange; \n               but at the sight of Marty and the girl at the stairway, they \n               become silent. They march across the lobby and out to the \n               street in repressed silence. The door CLANGS behind them.\n\n               Marty and Clara have waited stiffly through this interruption, \n               and now they look at each other and smile.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night \n                         then.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Okay.\n\n               Marty turns and moves across the lobby toward the street \n               door.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT HOUSE.\n\n               Marty stands a moment in the clear black night air, \n               expressionless, but within him, a strange exhilaration is \n               beginning to stir. He mosies away from the building along \n               the sidewalk, CAMERA panning with him.\n\n               He strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride, as if he \n               knew where he was going.\n\n               176TH STREET.\n\n               CLOSER SHOT of Marty marching along 176th Street. He quickly \n               reaches the Grand Concourse. Here he pauses a moment, a little \n               at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers he \n               needs the uptown bus.\n\n               He moves across the wide street to get to the other side of \n               the boulevard. Again, he seems to lose track of which \n               direction is homeward.\n\n               He walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride, pausing \n               every once in a while to see whether there's a bus coming.\n\n               Suddenly Marty breaks into a dog-trot, then drops back into \n               the stiff stride as he approaches...\n\n               THE INTERSECTION OF THE GRAND CONCOURSE.\n\n               The corner near the bus stop is deserted. Marty stops, leans \n               against the pole of the bus stop sign.\n\n               Abruptly, he turns and walks uptown a little further.\n\n               SERIES OF INTERCUTS: Marty strides, walks, stops short, goes \n               to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves \n               back. The traffic moves by him. He stands in the wide street, \n               then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises \n               his arm and calls out.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Taxi! Taxi! Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!\n\n               CLOSE-UP of Marty standing in the street, crying...\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Taxi!... Taxi!...\n\n               FADE OUT.\n\n               PILLETTI HOME, MARTY'S BEDROOM. DAY\n\n               Marty is in his trousers and T-shirt. He whistles as he \n               assembles his toilet articles for a shave. He starts out \n               toward the living room, still whistling. Bright sunlight \n               pours through the curtains on his window.\n\n               SECOND FLOOR.\n\n               Marty's whistling accompanies him to the second floor where \n               he turns into the bathroom. CAMERA ANGLES to include Mrs. \n               Pilletti's bedroom, disclosing her wearing an old faded \n               batiste kimona, puttering around her room and cleaning. As \n               Marty's toneless tune reaches her, Mrs. Pilletti turns her \n               head and stares off, listening.\n\n               THOMAS AND VIRGINIA'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n\n               Catherine, in the living room, is packing her meager but \n               neatly folded belongings into an old European carpet bag. \n               She has regained her stiff, mordant crustiness. The mild \n               WAIL of a baby can be heard.\n\n               BEDROOM.\n\n               The crowded bedroom is furnished in white modern. It is \n               cluttered by a baby's bassinet and other baby items. Virginia \n               sits on the edge of the bed, holding the baby, quieting it. \n               She is half-dressed, wearing her pajama top, a half-slip, no \n               stockings; her hair is still uncombed. Thomas slouches against \n               a chest of drawers, in morning semi-deshabille. He is \n               obviously sick with guilt. Virginia looks anxiously at her \n               husband then to the baby in her arms.\n\n                                     VIRGINIA\n                              (heavy whisper)\n                         Don't you think I feel lousy about \n                         this too?\n\n                                     THOMAS\n                         All right, Ginnie.

He sits down again and pulls the second sock on. \n               Virginia has had a hot reply in her mouth, but she forces it \n               back. She rocks the baby a little.\n\n                                     VIRGINIA\n                         Tommy, I love you, and I know you \n                         feel lousy right now, but we're never \n                         gonna be happy unless we have a chance \n                         to work out our own lives.

We...\n\n               Thomas has risen, a slim, dark, unsettled young man in \n               undershirt and trousers, holding his shoes in one hand. He \n               starts toward the...\n\n               FOYER.\n\n               Thomas strides down the little foyer. He turns and looks \n               into the living room. He watches his mother packing strange \n               brown parcels into her bag.\n\n                                     THOMAS\n                              (scowling)\n                         Can't you wait five minutes?

Then he returns to his bedroom \n               in his stocking-feet, carrying his shoes.\n\n               BEDROOM.\n\n               Thomas comes in just as Virginia bends over the bassinet, \n               having gotten the baby back to sleep. Thomas cries to her in \n               a furious whisper.\n\n                                     THOMAS\n                         All right, get dressed, because we're \n                         gonna drive my mother over. Why \n                         couldn't you get along with her?! \n                         Why couldn't you make just a little \n                         effort?! She's a little hard to get \n                         along with! All right! All I asked \n                         you was try a little.\n\n               He turns from her, sits down on the bed miserably angry with \n               the world, his wife, his mother, himself. The baby begins to \n               whimper again. Virginia turns wearily to her husband.\n\n                                     VIRGINIA\n                         Tommy...\n\n                                     THOMAS\n                              (roaring out)\n                         I don't wanna hear anymore about it, \n                         you hear me?\n\n               MARTY'S HOME, FRONT PORCH. DAY.\n\n               A small procession consisting of Thomas carrying his mother's \n               carpet bag, his mother carrying small paper-wrapped bundles, \n               and Virginia holding the baby comes across the front hedge. \n               Thomas leads the parade with a muffled sorrow. They turn up \n               the porch to the front door. Virginia remains in the small \n               front yard. She is miserable.\n\n               PILLETTI HOME, DINING ROOM. DAY.\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti is dressed in hat and coat and all set to go \n               to mass. She is bent over the dining room table piling the \n               breakfast dishes and crumbing the table. She looks up as \n               Thomas comes in carrying his mother's bag. Aunt Catherine is \n               right behind him. Beyond the porch, we can see Virginia \n               walking the baby around outside.\n\n                                     THOMAS\n                         Hello, Aunt Theresa.\n\n                                     MRS.

Mrs. Pilletti, \n               Aunt Catherine and even Thomas pause to look up in the \n               direction of the voice.\n\n               HALLWAY/STAIRWAY.\n\n               Marty descends the stairs whistling. He carries his jacket \n               over his arm. He makes some final adjustments to his tie.\n\n               DINING ROOM.\n\n               Alert to Marty's mood, Mrs. Pilletti, Aunt Catherine and \n               Thomas stand, waiting for him to join them downstairs.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (ebulliently)\n                         Hello, Aunt Catherine!

Marty stands in the \n               open doorway. He looks out into the warm sunshine in the \n               front yard.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Hi, Virginia.\n\n               He goes out into the yard to Virginia. He is as gay as a \n               bird. He takes the baby from Virginia's arms, holds it high \n               up above him.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (to baby)\n                         Hey, little boy, you sure getting \n                         fat.

PILLETTI\n                         Oh sure.\n                              (frowns at her sister)\n                         This girl is a college graduate.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         They're the worst. College girls are \n                         one step from the streets. They smoke \n                         like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, \n                         his wife, you know, she types onna \n                         typewriter. One step from the streets, \n                         I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders \n                         this philosophy for a moment.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         That's the first time Marty ever \n                         brought a girl to this house. She \n                         seems like a nice girl. I think he \n                         has a feeling for this girl. You \n                         heard him sing. He been singing like \n                         that all morning.\n\n               Catherine nods bleakly.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         Well, that's all. You will see. Today, \n                         tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say \n                         to you, \"Hey, Ma, it's no good being \n                         a single man. I'm tired-a running \n                         around.\" Then he's gonna say, \"Hey, \n                         Ma, wadda we need this old house? \n                         Why don't we sell this old house, \n                         move into a nicer parta town? A nice \n                         little apartment?\"\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I don't sell this house, I tell you \n                         that. This is my husband's house. I \n                         had six children in this house.\n\n                                     CATHERINE\n                         You will see. A coupla months, you \n                         gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna \n                         couch in her daughter-in-law's house.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. \n                         Wherever you are, the rain follows. \n                         Someday, you gonna smile, and we \n                         gonna declare a holiday.\n\n               Marty comes in from the living room, a little down after his \n               session with Thomas and Virginia.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting \n                         a little late.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Sure.\n\n               Marty goes to the sink to get himself a glass of water. He \n               examines a piece of plaster that has fallen from the ceiling.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Boy, this place is really coming to \n                         pieces.\n                              (turning to his mother)\n                         You know, Ma, I think we oughta sell \n                         this place. The whole joint's going \n                         to pieces. The plumbing is rusty. \n                         Everything. I'm gonna have to \n                         replaster the whole ceiling now. You \n                         know what we oughta do? We oughta \n                         get one of those new apartments \n                         they're building down on Southern \n                         Boulevard. A nicer parta town, you \n                         know?...You all set, Ma?\n\n               Mrs. Pilletti exchanges a brief frightened glance with her \n               sister.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I'm all set.\n\n               She sends another frightened look at her sister and follows \n               Marty out into the living room.\n\n               MARTY'S PORCH.\n\n               Marty, his mother, Thomas and Virginia with the baby file \n               down the porch to the street on their way to church. Marty \n               and his mother are both troubled. The anger has left both \n               Thomas and Virginia, but they are both silent. At the far \n               end of the alleyway, as they reach the street, Virginia puts \n               her free arm through her husband's elbow. Thomas looks briefly \n               at her and they exchange a look of commiseration. Everyone \n               turns and disappears off into the street.\n\n               CHURCH.\n\n               A HIGH, WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the church establishes that stage \n               of Sunday morning between the nine and ten o'clock masses. \n               People flock around the doors of the church.\n\n               INSIDE THE CHURCH.\n\n               The parishioners are making their ways to the door. A few \n               silent penitents still kneel here and there in the long empty \n               rows of pews. The large, almost empty church is filled now \n               with organ MUSIC.\n\n               Both Marty and his mother seem a little depressed as they \n               stand at the doorway just inside the church, as the nine \n               o'clock mass people flow out, and the first of the ten o'clock \n               mass people file in.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         That was a nice girl last night, \n                         Marty.\n                              (Marty nods)\n                         She wasn't a very good-looking girl, \n                         but she looks like a nice girl.\n                              (she pauses, Marty \n                              makes no reply)\n                         I said, she wasn't a very good-looking \n                         girl... not very pretty...\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (still amiable)\n                         I heard you, Ma.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         She looks a little old for you. About \n                         thirty-five, forty years old?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         She's twenty-nine, Ma.\n\n               A nearby kneeling penitent looks disapprovingly at Mrs. \n               Pilletti and shushes her. The mother nods briefly.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         She's more than twenty-nine years \n                         old, Marty. That's what she tells \n                         you.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         What, Ma?\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         She looks thirty-five, forty. She \n                         didn't look Italian to me.\n\n               Marty frowns but remains silent.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I said, is she Italian girl?\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         I don't know. I don't think so.\n\n               It's Mrs. Pilletti's turn to frown. A silence. She turns \n               back to Marty.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         She don't look Italian to me. What \n                         kinda family she come from? There \n                         was something about her I didn't \n                         like. It seems funny, the first time \n                         you meet her, she comes to your empty \n                         house alone. These college girls, \n                         they all one step fromma streets.\n\n               Marty turns, on the verge of anger with his mother.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         What are you talking about? She's a \n                         nice girl.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         She didn't look Italian to me.\n\n               A silence hangs between them.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I don't like her.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         You don't like her. You only met her \n                         for two minutes.\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         Don't bring her to the house no more.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         What didn't you like about her?\n\n                                     MRS. PILLETTI\n                         I don't know! She don't look like \n                         Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian \n                         girls around.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Well, let's not get inna fight about \n                         it, Ma.\n\n               The kneeling woman shushes them again. By now the nine o'clock \n               worshipers have filed out, and Marty joins the flow of ten \n               o'clock people moving in. His mother turns back to him again.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (stopping her before \n                              she gets started)\n                         What are you getting so worked up \n                         about? I just met the girl last night. \n                         I'm probably not gonna see her again.\n\n               They continue down the aisle of the church.\n\n               BAR. DAY.\n\n               An hour later, the after-mass CROWD is there. It's a little \n               more crowded than weekdays. A WOMAN with a glass of beer in \n               one hand, rocks a baby carriage with the other.\n\n               Marty enters the bar, moves along, ad-libbing \"Hello\" to \n               someone at the bar, gets the attention of Lou, the bartender.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         He was here last night till about \n                         two o'clock. I hear you really got \n                         stuck with a dog last night.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                              (glancing quickly at \n                              him)\n                         Who told you that?\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         Angie. He says she was a real scrawny-\n                         looking thing.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         She wasn't so bad.\n\n               He turns away from the bar annoyed, notes Ralph, sitting \n               alone in one of the booths, reading the Sunday comics. Marty \n               ambles over to him.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out \n                         with those nurses last night, Ralph?\n\n                                     RALPH\n                              (looking up)\n                         Oh man, you shoulda come with us \n                         last night, Marty. That one for you \n                         was a real lunatic. How'd you make \n                         out?\n\n               The abruptness of the question rather startles Marty. It is \n               not an expression he would normally associate with an evening \n               with Clara.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Oh, I hadda nice time...I didn't try \n                         nothing. She's a nice girl. I just \n                         met her last night, you know. I just \n                         talked with her. I didn't even try \n                         nothing...\n\n               He feels very ill at ease and a little guilty for defending \n               himself.\n\n                                     MARTY\n                         Listen, you see Angie, tell him I \n                         went home, I'll meet him after lunch.\n\n               He moves back down the bar and goes out into the street.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               MARTY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM. AFTERNOON\n\n               Marty is seated at the dining room table.
