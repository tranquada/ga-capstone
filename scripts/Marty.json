Fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias, \n               butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish. \n               It is Saturday morning around eleven o'clock -- a market \n               day.\n\n               WOMEN, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags, \n               baby carriages. MERCHANTS at their improvised street stands, \n               hawking their wares, disputing with their CUSTOMERS, roaring \n               salutations to PASSERSBY.\n\n               In the midst of all this, CAMERA HOMES IN on a typical \n               neighborhood...\n\n<b>               BUTCHER SHOP.\n</b>\n               Delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of \n               garlic.

There are three or four other WOMEN in the \n               shop, all talking to one another. A four-year-old BOY lazily \n               chases a cat.\n\n               The white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher, \n               MARTY PILLETTI, comes out carrying a large leg of lamb. Marty \n               is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty-four. \n               His charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor. He \n               drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up \n               for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the \n               block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb. He \n               sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts \n               as he chats with his customer, MRS. FUSARI.\n\n<b>                                     MRS.

CAMERA HOLDS as he finds \n               his old niche by the wall, leans there. A moment later, he \n               glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her friend \n               are.\n\n               MARTY'S P.O.V.: The Short Girl is approached by a dapper \n               young BOY who asks her to dance.

Marty \n               turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition. \n               The Doctor approaches THREE STAGS and obviously broaches the \n               subject with one of them. This STAG seems more receptive to \n               the idea. Dr. Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a \n               five dollar bill. The Stag detaches himself from the wall \n               and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor.\n\n               Marty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the \n               Stag, who come in and move past him. Concerned and curious, \n               Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning \n               position, following in their general direction.\n\n               Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the \n               area around the dance floor.\n\n<b>               ALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY.\n</b>\n               As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor \n               proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the \n               booths.\n\n<b>               LOUNGE.\n</b>\n               Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. Dr. \n               Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her. She is \n               looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola \n               glass. Dr. Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara \n               and is going through some story about being called away on \n               an emergency. The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who \n               will see to it that she gets home safely.\n\n               Clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying \n               hard not to seem affected. She politely rejects the Stag's \n               company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway. \n               Dr. Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and \n               the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway.\n\n<b>               ARCHWAY.\n</b>\n               From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr. \n               Keegan and the Stag. The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty, \n               and he catches their conversation.\n\n<b>                                     DR.

It's my five bucks...\n\n               They move past and away and Marty stares after them before \n               he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen.\n\n               Clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the \n               glass of Coca Cola in front of her. Her eyes are closed. \n               Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out \n               of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next \n               to do. As she glances around, CAMERA ANGLES to include a \n               sign over an exit that reads \"Fire Escape.\" Clara starts \n               moving toward that door.\n\n               Marty is staring off-screen toward Clara. He slowly works \n               his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction \n               of the fire escape.\n\n<b>               LOUNGE.\n</b>\n               Near the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view. \n               Background sounds continue steadily.\n\n               Marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops \n               and stares off-screen.\n\n               Clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape \n               outside.\n\n               Marty watches. Then he continues on, crossing the threshold \n               of the...\n\n<b>               FIRE ESCAPE.\n</b>\n               It is sizeable, almost a small balcony. It looks out onto \n               the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses. Clara \n               is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her \n               head sunk down. She is crying. Marty watches her for a moment \n               before moving a step or two forward.\n\n               Clara doesn't turn. Marty tries to think of something to \n               say.\n\n<b>                                     MARTY\n</b>                              (finally)\n                         Excuse me, Miss, would you care to \n                         dance?\n\n               Clara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, \n               her lips trembling. Then, in one of those moments of \n               simultaneous impulse, she lurches to Marty with a sob, and \n               Marty takes her to him.\n\n               They stand in an awkward embrace, Marty a little embarrassed, \n               looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge, \n               wondering if anybody is seeing them. He reaches back with \n               one hand, and contrives, with some effort, to push one of \n               the heavy iron doors shut.

One wall of the luncheonette in \n               front is covered with magazines from floor to ceiling. It is \n               a nice clean joint, brightly lit.

The hilarity has communicated itself to Clara. Her eyes \n               are burning with suppressed laughter.

He lets out a sudden guffaw and \n               instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders. Clara hides \n               her face in her hands and giggles desperately.

Then slowly, Marty begins to giggle \n               again. It communicates itself to Clara.

I handle his books for him, so \n                         I know he has a thirty-five percent \n                         markup which is not unreasonable, \n                         and he takes home net maybe a hundred, \n                         hundred and fifty bucks a week. The \n                         point is, of course, you gotta worry \n                         about the supermarkets.

They have obviously been having a heated exchange; \n               but at the sight of Marty and the girl at the stairway, they \n               become silent.

He mosies away from the building along \n               the sidewalk, CAMERA panning with him.\n\n               He strikes out suddenly with a spirited stride, as if he \n               knew where he was going.\n\n<b>               176TH STREET.\n</b>\n               CLOSER SHOT of Marty marching along 176th Street. He quickly \n               reaches the Grand Concourse. Here he pauses a moment, a little \n               at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers he \n               needs the uptown bus.\n\n               He moves across the wide street to get to the other side of \n               the boulevard. Again, he seems to lose track of which \n               direction is homeward.\n\n               He walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride, pausing \n               every once in a while to see whether there's a bus coming.\n\n               Suddenly Marty breaks into a dog-trot, then drops back into \n               the stiff stride as he approaches...\n\n<b>               THE INTERSECTION OF THE GRAND CONCOURSE.\n</b>\n               The corner near the bus stop is deserted. Marty stops, leans \n               against the pole of the bus stop sign.\n\n               Abruptly, he turns and walks uptown a little further.\n\n               SERIES OF INTERCUTS: Marty strides, walks, stops short, goes \n               to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves \n               back. The traffic moves by him. He stands in the wide street, \n               then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises \n               his arm and calls out.\n\n<b>                                     MARTY\n</b>                         Taxi!

He whistles as he \n               assembles his toilet articles for a shave. He starts out \n               toward the living room, still whistling.

CAMERA ANGLES to include Mrs. \n               Pilletti's bedroom, disclosing her wearing an old faded \n               batiste kimona, puttering around her room and cleaning. As \n               Marty's toneless tune reaches her, Mrs. Pilletti turns her \n               head and stares off, listening.\n\n<b>               THOMAS AND VIRGINIA'S APARTMENT.

It is \n               cluttered by a baby's bassinet and other baby items. Virginia \n               sits on the edge of the bed, holding the baby, quieting it. \n               She is half-dressed, wearing her pajama top, a half-slip, no \n               stockings; her hair is still uncombed.
