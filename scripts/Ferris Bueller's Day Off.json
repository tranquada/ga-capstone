What's the point? I'm not\n               European. I don't plan to be European.\n               So, who gives a shit if they're socialists?\n               They could be fascist anarchists and it\n               still wouldn't change the fact that I\n               don't own a car.\n\n     He turns the shower head around and uses it like a\n     microphone.\n\n                              FERRIS\n                          (sings)\n               WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY,\n               TWIST AND SHOUT...\n\n 13  INT.

John Lennon\n               said it on his first solo album.\n               \"I don't believe in Beatles, I\n               just believe in me.\" A good point\n               there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.\n\n     He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               I could be the Walrus and I'd still\n               have to bum rides off people.\n\n     He passes CAMERA and goes into his room.\n\n                              FERRIS (OC)\n               I'm not very political?

On the Fourth of\n               July he was down with my aunt and he\n               got drunk and told my Dad he felt\n               guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.\n               So I said, \"What's the deal, Uncle\n               Jeff? In wartime you want to be a\n               pacifist and in peacetime you want\n               to be a soldier. It took you twenty\n               years to find out you don't believe\n               in anything?\"\n                          (snaps his fingers)\n               Grounded. Just like that.

But she\n               lost it. She got old. If she listens\n               to the White Album now? She doesn't hear\n               music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is\n               her favorite drug. It'll probably be\n               mine, too. I hope not.\n\n     He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and\n     puts it on. He drops the towel.\n\n 16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16\n\n     He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his\n     underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the\n     top of the dresser. He picks it up.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               In eighth grade a friend of mine\n               made a bong out of one of these.\n               The smoke tasted like glue.\n\n     He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he\n     speaks.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a\n               serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I\n               like him. I'm probably his only friend.\n               I do what I can for him. I mean, if\n               I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,\n               right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.\n               His father's dead and his sister's rumored\n               to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.\n               She only puts out so people will hang out\n               with her. It's sad but I don't hold it\n               against her. Better to hold it against the\n               guys who use her and don't care about her.\n                          (pause)\n               My parents never allowed Garth over here.\n               It was because of his family. Mainly his\n               older brother. He's in jail. I could see them\n               not wanting his brother here because he is\n               a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.\n               I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of\n               artificial fruit just so he could see what\n               it was like to have his stomach pumped.\n               But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault\n               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights\n               with the parents on that point. I always felt\n               for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once\n               and I was laying on the dark worrying that\n               his brother was going to come in and hack me\n               to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.\n               I asked him what was wrong and he said, \"Nothing\".\n               ... Nothing was wrong. There was no\n               specific thing he was crying about.\n               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that\n               he was crying. He just cried himself to\n               sleep every night. It was a habit. The\n               guy's so conditioned to grief that if\n               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How\n               could you possibly dump on guy who has to\n               deal with that kinda shit? My parents\n               acknowledge the trudge of the situation\n               and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel\n               for him but still the guy's banned from\n               our house.\n\n     He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet\n     door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his\n     speech as he disrobes.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Unfortunately, now my parents have a\n               legit argument. Garth doesn't need his\n               brother to give him a rep anymore. He's\n               getting one on his own. He's lost. It's\n               over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from\n               school. Gone from life. His legacy is\n               a gas station.\n\n 17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17\n\n     Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely\n     different outfit.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               One very serious danger is playing\n               sick is that it's possible to believe\n               your own act.\n\n 18  INT.

Alot of people\n               ditch and feel great for about an\n               hour. Then they realize there's\n               nothing to do. TV and food. I myself\n               have ditched and gotten so bored I\n               did homework. Figure that shit out.\n\n     He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               You have to plan things out before\n               you take the day off. Otherwise\n               you get all nervous worrying about\n               what to do and all you get is grief\n               and the whole point is to take it\n               easy, cut loose and enjoy.\n\n     He crosses to the pantry.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               You blow your day and at about three\n               o'clock, when everybody's out of school,\n               you're going to wish you'd gone to\n               school so you could be out having\n               fun.\n\n     He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Avoid the misery.

Shades drawn, floor strewn\n     with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the\n     counter remedies. A high school boy, CAMERON FRYE, is laying\n     in bed. We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a\n     thermometer sticking out his mouth. U2's SUNDAY BLOODY\n     SUNDAY is playing.

He has alot of things to\n               sort out before he graduates. He\n               can't be wound this tight and go\n               to college. His roommate'll kill\n               him. I've come close myself. But I\n               like him. He's a little easier to\n               take when you know why he's like he\n               is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon\n               by French but Cameron is so tight\n               that if you stuck a lump of coal up\n               his ass, in two weeks you'd have a\n               diamond.\n                          (after-thought)\n               And Cameron would worry that he'd\n               owe taxes on it.\n\n 27  INT.

HALL CLOSET                                             39\n\n     The door opens and Ferris thrusts his hands into the pockets\n     of the coats. He comes up with a ball of Kleenex. A roll of\n     Tums. A squirt gun. Then a modest wad of bills. His face\n     lights up as he counts out the cash. He closes the door.\n\n 40  CU.

Her\n               body is a transport vehicle for her\n               anger. I don't know where she gets\n               this shit. Basically, the family's\n               pretty cool.\n\n     He looks down at the urinal.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               I wonder if everybody shoots at\n               cigarette butts in urinals?

It used to worry me. Then I\n               met Cameron and I saw how his\n               family functioned.\n\n     He zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Cameron's home life is really shit.\n               He wasn't lying.

I refuse to sleep over at\n               his house. His parents fight all the\n               time. Even when I'm there. Is there\n               anything worse than being at somebody's\n               house when their parents are fighting?\n               It's the absolute height of social\n               discomfort.\n\n     He checks his hair in the mirror.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               When they go after each other, Cameron\n               tightens up. It's scary. He gets so\n               wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns\n               apart with a crowbar. The thing with\n               taking his old man's car? It's good\n               for him. It teaches him to deal with\n               his fear. Plus, and I must\n               be honest here, I love driving it.\n               I highly recommend picking one up.\n\n     He exists the men's room. We hold a beat.

CALUMET CITY                                           138\n\n     The Port of Chicago. Grim, gritty waterfront. Suddenly,\n     Cameron's father's car flies OVER CAMERA. Like the opening\n     shot in Star Wars. The Starship Ferrari. SLO-MO.\n\n     CU. FERRARI UNDER-CARRIAGE\n\n     It travels past to reveal a beautiful blue sky. SLO-MO.\n\n     CU.

SLO-MO,\n\n     EXT. STREETS. KIDS\n\n     They're looking up in the air, following the car as it flies\n     over them. Broad, excited smiles. The car's shadow passes\n     over them.

FERRIS' HOUSE\n\n     Rooney gets out of his car. He looks at the house, looks up\n     and down the street, then crosses to Ferris' house.\n\n140  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           140\n\n     Rooney's at the front door. We see him peek in a window at\n     the top of the door. The doorbell rings.\n\n141  INT. HOUSE. FERRIS' ROOM. COMPUTER                          141\n\n     It acknowledges the doorbell.\n\n     CU. CASSETTE PLAYER\n\n     It clicks on.\n\n142  EXT. HOUSE.

We HEAR FERRIS' VOICE.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Who is it?\n\n     Rooney presses the intercom.\n\n                              ROONEY\n               This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd\n               like to have a word with you.\n\n                              FERRIS' VOICE\n               I'm sorry I can't come to the door\n               right now. I'm very ill and I'm\n               afraid that in my weakened condition,\n               I could take a nasty spill down the\n               stairs and subject myself to further\n               school absenses.\n\n     There's a pause. Rooney presses the intercom again.\n\n                              ROONEY\n               B.S. Come down here.\n\n                              FERRIS' VOICE\n               You can reach my parents at their\n               places of business. Thank you for\n               stopping by. I appreciate your concern\n               for my well-being. It will be remembered\n               long after this illness has past.\n\n     His voice clicks off. Rooney presses the intercom again.\n\n                              ROONEY\n               I'm not leaving until you come\n               down and talk to me.\n\n                              FERRIS' VOICE\n               Have a nice day.\n\n     Rooney presses the intercom.\n\n                              ROONEY\n               I'm not leaving, Ferris.\n\n     There's no response. Rooney rings the doorbell again. The\n     pre-recorded litany starts over.\n\n                              FERRIS' VOICE\n               Who is it?\n\n     Rooney doesn't realize that he's listening to a recording.\n\n                              ROONEY\n               Don't get smart with me Ferris!\n\n                              FERRIS' VOICE\n               I'm sorry I can't come to the door\n               right now. I'm very ill and I'm\n               afraid that in my weakened condition...\n\n     Rooney leans back from the door. He can't quite figure out\n     what's going on. But's it's highly suspicious.\n\n143  INT. HOUSE. LIVING ROOM                                     143\n\n     Rooney steps through the hedges and peeks in the windows. We\n     HEAR FERRIS' VOICE inside.\n\n                              FERRIS' VOICE\n               You may reach my parents at their\n               places of business.\n\n144  INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN                                         144\n\n     Rooney tries to peak in the kitchen window.\n\n                              FERRIS' VOICE\n               I appreciate your conern for my\n               well-being. It will be remembered\n               long after...\n\n145  EXT. HOUSE. BACKDOOR                                        145\n\n     A black rubber doggie door. The type that allows a dog to\n     come and go as it pleases. Rooney is crouched down. He lifts\n     the doggie door and peeks in the house.\n\n     HIS POV\n\n     Along the kitchen floor. Through the kitchen, into the\n     dining room. We hear a LARGE DOG GROWL.\n\n     CU. ROONEY\n\n     He's peaking through the door. He hears the dog. His face\n     freezes.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Have a nice day.\n\n     EXT. HOUSE. DOGGIE DOOR\n\n     A Rottweiler bursts through the doggie door in a fury of\n     gnashing teeth and foam.\n\n146  CU. LARGE BREASTS                                           146\n\n     Tassled pasties twirl like airplane propellers.\n\n     CU. CAMERON, FERRIS AND SLOANE\n\n     They're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted\n     strip joint. Cameron's mouth is open in amazement. Sloane is\n     embarrassed and revolted.\n\n                              CAMERON\n               How does she do that? One goes\n               one way, one goes the other.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               She's probably schizophrenic.\n\n                              SLOANE\n               Ferris, this is nauseating me.\n               Really. I'm losing respect for\n               you by the bucket.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               You don't think it's amazing that\n               we got in?\n\n                              SLOANE\n               Who wants to get in?\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Cameron looks like a toddler, for\n               Christ's sake. I'm talking about\n               a major achievement in false\n               identification.\n\n                              SLOANE\n               I'm not interested in watching\n               someone jiggle their mammary glands.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Point well taken. But consider why\n               she does it. Why she does it and\n               you don't.\n\n                              SLOANE\n               I'm not a tramp.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she\n               lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend.\n               A parent. A child...\n                          (to CAMERA)\n               This kind of thing makes me a little\n               depressed. You may think because I'm\n               the age I am that I'm a sex maniac.\n               That sex is all I think about.\n               But that's not true. I'm a romantic.\n               I think alot of people my age are.\n               We think about love and matters of\n               the heart. And SAT scores and acne\n               aside, we worry about lonliness. It's\n               a terrible thing. And we feel it. I\n               feel it.\n\n     He flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis\n     impression. A sappy, do-wop track FADES UP. The club lights\n     go down. Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness. Ferris\n     stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the\n     empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of\n     blue light.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               You know, someone said the world's a\n               stage and each must play a part.\n               Fate had me playing in love, with you\n               as my sweetheart. Act one was when we\n               met. I loved you at first glance. You\n               read your lines so cleverly and never\n               missed a cue. Then came act two. You\n               seemed to change. You acted strange.\n               And why, I've never known.\n\n     He climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears\n     in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight.\n\n                              FERRIS\n               Honey, you lies when you said you\n               loved me and I had no cause to\n               doubt you. But I'd rather go on\n               hearing your lies than to go on\n               living without you. Now, the stage\n               is bare and I'm standing there with\n               emptiness all around and if you won't\n               come back to me, then they can bring\n               the curtain down...\n\n     Elvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs\n     with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark\n     ballad sign-off.\n\n                              ELVIS\n               IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN?\n               SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN?\n               TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?\n\n     Ferris drops his head. Like the King would.\n\n147  EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET. CAMERON'S CAR                         147\n\n     Cameron's father is looking at the car. He's studying it. It\n     looks terribly familiar. He leans into the open car and\n     reaches for the glovebox to see if the contents will confirm\n     if it's his. He freezes. He looks up slowly.\n\n     HIS POV\n\n     The Attendant and the Rastaman are glowering at him. They're\n     holding bags of fried chicken.\n\n                              ATTENDANT\n               You looking for something in my\n               car?\n\n     CU.

JEANIE                                   148\n\n     Jeanie's standing at her car. She's staring incredulously\n     into the distance. Her mouth's open. She's shaking her head\n     slowly.\n\n     HER POV\n\n     Spray-painted on the town water tower in gigantic black\n     letters -- SAVE FERRIS BUELLER.\n\n     CU.

TAXI CAB                                               150\n\n     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron in the backseat of a checker.\n     Ferris is on one window, Cameron on the other. Sloane's in\n     the middle.
