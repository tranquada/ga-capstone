It isn't his fault\n               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights\n               with the parents on that point. I always felt\n               for Garth.

Nothing was wrong. There was no\n               specific thing he was crying about.\n               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that\n               he was crying. He just cried himself to\n               sleep every night. It was a habit. The\n               guy's so conditioned to grief that if\n               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How\n               could you possibly dump on guy who has to\n               deal with that kinda shit?
