I've been too close to see\nThe answer's right in front of me\nRight in front of me\n\nIt's simple really, very clear\nLike music drifting in the air\nInvisible, but everywhere\nJust because I cannot see it\nDoesn't mean I can't believe it\n \nYou know, I think this Christmas thing\nIt's not as tricky as it seems\nAnd why should they have all the fun?\nIt should belong to anyone\n\nNot anyone, in fact, but me\nWhy, I could make a Christmas tree\nAnd there's no reason I can find\nI couldn't handle Christmas time\n\nI bet I could improve it too\nAnd that's exactly what I'll do\nHee,hee,hee\n\nJACK\nEureka!!
