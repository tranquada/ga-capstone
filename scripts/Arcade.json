Goyer\n\n                       Last revised November 6, 1990\n\n\n<b>INT. ARCADE WORLD -- ELECTRONIC DARKNESS\n</b>\nWe don't know if it's night or day.  It's just black.\n\nAnd maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by.  So quick we barely\nperceive them.  Like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed.\n\n<b>BREATHING,\n</b>\nslow and hollow, filling up the entire world.  It's eerie as hell.  A\nfeeling of utter loneliness.\n\nAnd now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness.  Whatever it\nwas...it's gone now.\n\n<b>MAIN CREDITS ROLL.\n</b>\nWe hear CELLOS.  Four of them.  Weaving an intricate melody.\n\nAnd now the visuals.  BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in.  Equally\nintricate, matching the music.  They grow and flourish, like flowers\nopening up in time lapse photography.\n\n<b>FRACTALS...\n</b>\nis what they're called.  The visual manifestation of geometric formulas.\nThe Mandelbrot Set.  The Julia Set.  Each mathematic form made up of\nprogressively smaller forms and on into infinity.\n\nGlorious and beautiful.  Forms folding in upon themselves and\nregenerating.\n\nThis is creation we're witnessing.\n\nThis is life in the making.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY\n</b>\n<b>AN EYE\n</b>\nFor a brief moment we still hear the CELLOS.  And in the eye, the last of\nthe fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris.  A nice blue\none.  This is ALEX MANNING'S eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tTime.  That's all I ever think about\n\t\tanymore.  It's like there's never enough of\n\t\tit, you know?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY\n</b>\nThis is a flashback, in case you're wondering.  We'll continue to hear\nAlex's VOICE as we move through the house in slow motion.  Everything is\nvery bright and dreamlike.\n\nRight now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway.\nAt the end of the hallway is an open door.\n\nWe stop at the doorway.  We're afraid to go in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tIt's strange.  When the future's in front\n\t\tof you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean,\n\t\tyou never really get there.  It's always\n\t\tone step ahead of you.  It's like there's\n\t\tno present. There's no \"now\".  As soon as\n\t\tyou think, \"I'm here\", the moment's already\n\t\tgone.  Either everything's in the future,\n\t\tor it's in the past.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tThere's no \"now\".\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tSo where are you then?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX (V.O.)\n</b>\t\tI'm in the past.\n\nWe move through the doorway.\n\n<b>INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY\n</b>\nEverything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight\nstreaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.\nEverything looks perfect.\n\nThen we move further in, and over to the right.  There's something on the\nfloor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom.  Halfway in, halfway\nout.\n\nIt's a woman's body.  She's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent.  We\ncan't see her face from this angle. But in her limp hand is a gun.  And\nall around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom\nand the carpeting beyond, is BLOOD.\n\nA shrill BELL shatters the moment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY\n</b>\nThe bell continues.  It's a school bell signaling the end of the period.\n\n<b>ON ALEX\n</b>\nas we see her for the first time, startled.  She's seventeen and pretty,\nthough in a simple way.  Her eyes are the most striking.  Deep.  Intense.\nIf Alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's\nreflected in her eyes.\n\nAcross from her is MR. WEAVER, a high-school guidance counselor and that\nwas his voice we heard with Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged,\nincapable of really hearing what Alex has to say.  This is his office\nwe're in. Typical \"SAY NO TO DRUGS\" teen propaganda decorate the room.\nFun.\n\nAs the BELL dies we hear the army of FOOTSTEPS outside, students milling\nin the halls.\n\nAlex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. WEAVER\n</b>\t\tWe don't have to stop now...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(cutting him off)\n\t\tThat's okay.  I've got a test coming up\n\t\tanyway.  Gotta study.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. WEAVER\n</b>\t\t\t(sighs)\n\t\tI have to tell you, I'm a little concerned\n\t\tabout you, Alex.  It's been three months\n\t\tnow since your mother, uh...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(offering, fixing him with\n\t\t\ta stare)\n\t\tKilled herself?\n\nMr. Weaver stops, more than a little uncomfortable.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. WEAVER\n</b>\t\t\t(reluctant)\n\t\tYes.  Now your father...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tHe's a basket case.  You've talked to him.\n\t\tYou know that.  He might as well be dead\n\t\ttoo.\n\nAlex glances down at the floor, anything to avoid looking at the\ncounselor.  She heaves a backpack onto to shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLook Mr. Weaver, I don't even know why I\n\t\tcame here.  I fine.  Really.\n\t\t\t(looking up)\n\t\tIt's like I said.  It's just part of the\n\t\tpast now.  It doesn't matter anymore.\n\nShe turns, and before Mr. Weaver can respond, she's out the door.\n\n<b>INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\nAlex moves quickly through the mass of STUDENTS, wiping the remnants of\nhalf-tears on her coat sleeve.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY\n</b>\nFun-time.  Total chaos.  If you've been to high-school you know the riff.\nBad food, teen-age melodrama, and a squadron of SUPERVISORS trying to keep\na lid on things.\n\n<b>ALEX\n</b>\nmakes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kids\nlounge around a table.  These are Alex's FRIENDS.  And while none of them\nare your garden variety pocket-protector-type nerds, these kids aren't\nexactly part of the \"in-crowd\".  They're a little off.  Quirky.  All of\nthem come from screwed up families, and that's what bonds them.  They are:\n\nGREG HOLLISTON -- Alex's boyfriend.  Hopeful artist (not bad, either) and\nkind of punk looking.  Greg and the others are big fans of thrift-shop\nclothing.  Because they don't have the money, they improvise.\n\nNICK DRAKE -- Greg's best friend and future computer pioneer.  He's\nattractive and he's got an edge.  A bit of a hot-shot.  Genius in the\nmaking.\n\nBENZ AND STILTS -- Inseparable.  Benz is flunking out of school and would\nlike nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comic\nbooks.  He's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, and nervous.  Stilts,\ncontrary to his nickname, is quite short and never without his skateboard.\nStilts is constantly hitting on...\n\nLAURIE -- The sixth member of the group.  A teen Theda Bara and as cynical\nas you can get.  She's what's affectionately known as an \"art chick\".\n\nThe boys in the group, particularly Nick and Stilts, are avid\nskateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards.  Stilts is always\nleafing through an issue of THRASHER magazine.\n\nRight now the group is in the midst of an argument.  Nick has a pocket\nvideo game in his hands which he casually plays.  He can get through these\ngames in his sleep.  It BEEPS and WHIRS.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(to Benz)\n\t\tYou're an idiot, you know that? What're you\n\t\tgoing to do when you get out of here?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tI was thinking about writing for one of\n\t\tthose Filipino mail order brides...\n\nStilts and Greg burst into laughter.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tI think I saw that on the Home Shopping\n\t\tNetwork.  The Girlfriend Hour, right after\n\t\tAuto Accessories.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\t\t(giggling)\n\t\tExactly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n</b>\t\tYou guys are sick.\n\nAlex flops down in a chair and everyone turns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tSo how'd it go?\n\nAlex shrugs, trying to make light of it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tHe thinks I'm \"sublimating\".\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tWhat the hell does that mean?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n</b>\t\tIt means she's screwed up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tFucked up.  That's what they said I was.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tYou are fucked up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tYeah, but only because I want to be.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tWould you guys knock it off?\n\nGreg turns back to Alex and looks her in the eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tListen to me, Alex.  These counselor's\n\t\tdon't know anything.  They're full of shit.\n\t\tIf you don't fit the pattern of the perfect\n\t\tkid, they freak.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tI know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tSo tell me you're okay, then.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tI'm okay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\t\t(smiles)\n\t\tGood.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.\n\n\nGreg leans over and kisses Alex.  The rest of the group launches into\nexaggerated GROANS, with Benz and Stilts fluttering their eyes and making\n\"smooching faces\" at each other.  The kiss is over and everyone LAUGHS.\n\nThings are okay now.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\t\t(to Alex)\n\t\tHey...watch this...\n\nGreg pulls an old Polaroid camera from his backpack.  He leans in close to\nher and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them.  FLASH!\nAnd the moment's captured forever.\n\nGreg pulls the Polaroid out and peels off the backing. Before the picture\neven develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the\nemulsion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(engrossed in his game\n\t\t\tagain)\n\t\tYou making another one, Greg?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tSure.  Practice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tLemme see...\n\nGreg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to Benz.\nThe papers are color xeroxes of Polaroid blow-ups.  Greg has messed with\nthem, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images.  Stilts and\nLaurie lean in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tCool.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\t\t(still working)\n\t\tSee, when the emulsion's still warm you can\n\t\tmove it around...\n\t\t\t(stops)\n\t\tThere.\n\nGreg holds up the Polaroid for Alex to see.\n\n<b>POLAROID\n</b>\nGreg and Alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world has\nspun into strange colors.  It's an odd effect.\n\nGreg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tSafe keeping.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick's pocket video game emits an EXPLOSION NOISE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tShit.  I'm out.\n\nHe sets the game down, dejected.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tYou guys going to Dante's after school?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tI don't know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tCheck it out...\n\nBenz pulls a flyer from inside his coat.  It's an ad for a new game called\n\"ARCADE\", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a\ncircuit board.  The tag at the bottom reads, \"COMING THIS FALL.  REALITY\n<b>WILL NEVER BE THE SAME\".\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(excited)\n\t\tThat's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys\n\t\tare good.  It's supposed to be interactive.\n\t\tGraphics are unbelievable.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tYeah?  They were handing these out at\n\t\tDante's.  Test marketing it or something.\n\t\tGonna have a demonstration today.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tCool.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n</b>\t\tCan you say anything but \"cool\"?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tOf course I can.  I can say all sorts of\n\t\tthings...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\tGuys...\n\n\nBenz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tSo how 'bout it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tI'm game...\n\t\t\t(to Greg)\n\t\tGreg?\n\nGreg turns to Alex.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tCome on.  We'll hit Dante's after school,\n\t\ttry the game out, maybe get some dinner.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tAnd then keep on driving?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tSure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n</b>\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tI could go for that.\n\nAlex laughs.  Laurie took the words right out of her mouth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY\n</b>\nThe Inferno is a run-down video arcade near the beach, notable because the\ngames it sports are generally defective and out of date.  Nevertheless,\nit's become our group's hang-out.  It has its charms.\n\nA huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of the\narcade...something straight out of Hieronymus Bosch. Demons in day-glo.\nThe yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.\n\n<b>ALEX AND THE OTHERS\n</b>\npull up across the street, caravan style.  Greg and Alex are in one\ncar...an ancient Buick Skylark.  No Honda Accords or VW Rabbits for this\ngroup.\n\nAt the moment, there's quite a bit of activity at the Inferno's entrance.\nKIDS are clustered around and Slip-Stream employees are passing out Arcade\npromo sheets.\n\n<b>THE GROUP\n</b>\nheads for the entrance, plowing their way through the crowd.  Stilts and\nBenz have their skateboards, jumping up onto the curb with them, then\npopping them up into their arms.\n\n<b>INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY\n</b>\nInside, the Inferno is a mishmash of video games, ancient carnival props\nand old horror movie posters.  Dusty, creepy under the right circumstances\nand filled with leering faces...  in short, any kid's bedroom taken to a\nhorrific extreme.  At Dante's Inferno, they've got the latest games side\nby side with chestnuts like Pac-Man.\n\n<b>THE GROUP\n</b>\nmakes their way inside, joining a cluster of KIDS in the center of The\nInferno.  And there it is...\n\n<b>ARCADE\n</b>\nIt looks out of place in the midst of The Inferno.  Shiny black,\nhigh-tech, and almost self-contained, like some sort of space-age vertical\ncoffin.  Laser-etched graphics on the sides bear the ARCADE logo and the\nsame strange, frightening face.\n\nAlex and her friends are suitably impressed, most notably, Nick and Benz.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\tCheck it out...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tDefinitely cool.\n\nNick is silent, letting his eyes explore the machine.  He turns to Greg\nand grins.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tSuper computers, micro-processors... That's\n\t\tthe future we're looking at.\n\nAnother kid, DELOACH, pushes his way to the front of the group.  His\nfighting a losing battle against acne.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n</b>\t\t\t(looking around)\n\t\tSo how come they're previewing it in this\n\t\tshit-hole?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tIf you weren't such a dick, you'd know what\n\t\ta cool place this was.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n</b>\t\tGimme a break, they got fucking Space\n\t\tInvaders here.  That's shit's for retards.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n</b>\t\tSo...are you trying to say I'm retarded?\n\t\tIs that what you're implying?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n</b>\t\tNo, but since I'm standing here, I'm\n\t\tnoticing that you're an ugly little fuck\n\t\tand you're making me sick...\n\nThat's it for Stilts.  He launches himself at DeLoach, catching him off\nguard and KNOCKING him to the floor.\n\nNick, Alex, and Greg are on them in a minute, trying to extract the two\nfrom each other.\n\n<b>A LARGE MAN\n</b>\npushes his way towards them and effortlessly scoops both boys up, wrapping\na beefy hand around the scruffs of their necks.  This is FINSTER, the\nproprietor...enormous, bald, and always irritable.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFINSTER\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking them)\n\t\tCut it out!!!\n\nHis face contorts and he spits as he speaks.  Nice guy. Alex steps\nforward, always the voice of reason.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tIt's okay, Mr. Finster...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFINSTER\n</b>\t\tNo it's not.\n\t\t\t(to the boys)\n\t\tYou guys are shits and I'm throwing you out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n</b>\t\t\t(acting tough)\n\t\tYour place sucks.  Who gives a shit about\n\t\t\"ARCADE\" anyway?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\t\t(booming, metallic)\n<b>\t\tWHAT DID YOU SAY?\n</b>\nEveryone turns.  The voice came from...\n\n<b>ARCADE\n</b>\nIt's up and running now.  The inside panel emits an eerie green light.\nFrom speakers inside the compartment we can here BREATHING...the same\nbreathing we heard earlier. Coming from a machine like this, it's creepy\nas hell.\n\nEven Finster is impressed.  He releases the boys and stares at the\nmachine.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n</b>\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tJesus...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tNot bad, huh?\n\nA MAN steps out from behind the ARCADE machine.  He grins happily, dressed\nto kill, sporting a SLIP-STREAM ID tag. This is DIFFORD, P.R. man for\n<b>SLIP-STREAM.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\tHi, kids.\n\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tMr. Finster...\n\nThe ARCADE machine continues to breathe, inhale, exhale... The eyes in the\nface are glowing now, in unison with the breathing.\n\nDifford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\t\t(smooth as silk)\n\t\tWe're glad you people could make it, and\n\t\twe're anxious to have you try out our new\n\t\tproduct.  We think it's going to be a big\n\t\tseller.  But you're the people that make it\n\t\thappen.  You're the market share everyone's\n\t\ttearing each other apart to get at.  It's\n\t\tyour opinion that's going to make or break\n\t\tus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tSo what's so different about Arcade? You\n\t\tguys've been talking about it for months.\n\nDifford turns to Nick and salutes him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\tA man after my own heart.  Straight to the\n\t\tpoint.\n\t\t\t(to everyone)\n\t\tWhat's different about ARCADE is the way it\n\t\treacts.  It responds like a human does.  It\n\t\tlearns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it\n\t\tchanges its strategy.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tThat's impossible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\t\t(taking the bait)\n\t\tIs it?  Why don't you see for your self?\n\nDifford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter.  He tosses\nit at...\n\n<b>NICK\n</b>\nwho snags it out of mid-air and grins.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGREG\n</b>\t\tGo for it, Nick.\n\nDifford steps aside and waves Nick to the machine.  The rest of the kids\ncrowd around.\n\n<b>ARCADE\n</b>\nisn't just your typical video game.  First of all there are three\nscreens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view while\nplaying.  Second, the player wears \"data gloves\" (which provide an actual\nsensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired\ndirectly into the machine.  The results give the user the feeling that\nhe/she has actually entered the video game universe.\n\nDifford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\t\t(indicating equipment)\n\t\tThe CyberGloves are keyed into the game's\n\t\tresponse mechanism.  You'll be able to pick\n\t\tthings up inside the world...tools, weapons\n\t\t... it'll feel like they're really in your\n\t\thands...\n\nNick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThe goggles heighten the experience. When\n\t\twe said \"Reality will never be the same\",\n\t\twe weren't kidding.\n\nDifford places the goggles on Nick's face.  Then he points to the control\nboard, which features two joy-sticks and a large RED BUTTON labeled\n<b>\"ESCAPE\".\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(skeptical)\n\t\t\"Escape\"?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\tIn case things get too intense.  It\n\t\tautomatically freezes the game, gives you a\n\t\tbreather.  Things can get pretty wild...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBENZ\n</b>\t\t\t(scoffing)\n\t\tNick won't need it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n</b>\t\tYou're good, eh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(grins)\n\t\tThe best.\n\nNick winks at Alex and Greg.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(to Difford)\n\t\tSo what's the scenario?

As\n\t\tsoon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my\n\t\tname.  How could it know?  And then, I\n\t\tasked it where Greg was, and it said, \"In\n\t\there\".\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tAlex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's\n\t\tgone, I'll give you that.

Really.\n\nIt's at that moment that Nick and Alex hear the VOICES.\n\n<b>VIDEO SCREENS\n</b>\nall around them flicker on, static-laced IMAGES fading in. They are the\nfaces of their friends...Greg, Laurie, and many others.  All those that\nhave disappeared.  The VOICES fade in and out, merging with one another,\ntinged with the same mechanical edge of ARCADE's voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICES\n</b>\t\t\t(eerie)\n\t\tNick...Alex...save us...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(horrified)\n\t\tOh God...\n\nNick grabs Alex and pulls her into the canter of the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tPut it out of your head, Alex.  It's just\n\t\ttrying to psyche us out.\n\nDespite Nick's words, we can tell that the VOICES are having a\ndisheartening effect on him.\n\n<b>THE ARCADE\n</b>\nprototype stands in front of them now, and surprisingly, the machine is\nnot on.  The eyes in the leering black face are quite dead.\n\nAround Alex and Nick, the faces of their friends continue to fade in and\nout, casting the whole room in a strange shimmering blue light.\n\nNick moves to the back of the machine and opens the access panel,\nrevealing the internal circuitry.  He pulls a small penlight from his\npocket and flips it on.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tWhat are you looking for?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tA way to hook this helmet into the game.\n\t\tI'm sure there are interfaces...\n\n<b>NICK'S P.O.V.\n</b>\nAnd indeed there are.  Parallel interfaces, where you might hook a printer\ncable into a computer.  Nick takes the cable from the CyberHelmet and\nsecures it into one of the interfaces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tThere.  Now we're wired in.\n\nHe stands and moves around front, pressing the \"START\" button of the game.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nHe presses it again.  Nothing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tIs the game plugged in?\n\nNick checks.  It is.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(frustrated)\n\t\tI don't understand.  It wants us to play\n\t\tthe game.

He doesn't have a quarter.  Neither does\nAlex.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tChange machine.\n\nNick moves over to the change machine and picks up a nearby chair.  He\nSMASHES the chair into the face of the machine again and again,\nobliterating the lock.  Nick opens the front of the machine and tears out\nthe coin box, spilling quarters all over the floor.  He grabs a handful\nand returns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tThere.\n\nHe shoves one in ARCADE's coin-slot and pulls on the CyberGloves.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tTwo players, Nick.

Am I\n\t\tsuppose to go in after you alone?!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tNo.  If you're smart, you run like hell.\n\nAlex grabs a second quarter and shoves it in the coin slot.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tI'm going.\n\nNick stares at her a moment, then nods tiredly.  She reaches for the\nsecond pair of CyberGloves and pulls them on.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tYou don't get it, do you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(strapping on goggles)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tI don't want anything to happen to you.

After a\nmoment, Nick laughs tiredly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tWhat can I say?\n\t\t\t(pulls on the CyberHelmet)\n\t\tTough being a hero, isn't it?\n\nNick reaches out for the joy-stick and hits the \"START\" button.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t\t(grim)\n\t\tHere goes nothing.\n\nAs before, the screen comes to life.

Suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them!\n\n(Note:  As we move through each level, video legends will appear on the\nscreen as title cards, enhancing the effect that we are actually inside a\nvideo game.)\n\nThe words \"LEVEL ONE -- BLOOD RED SKY\" flash across the screen and we...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

When he speaks, his VOICE is filtered through a radio\nheadset.  Nick looks good in his armor, tough.  Hell, they both do.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\tI'll take the lead and handle the physical\n\t\tthreats.

Hold for a moment, and then...\n\nWe hear a distant, high-pitched RINGING.  It's grating, seeping inside our\nbrains and mucking around in there.  On the horizon there is a quick FLASH\n<b>OF LIGHT.\n</b>\nSomething is coming.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\nThe words \"LEVEL TWO -- DEADLANDS\"\n\n<b>EXT.

A small BALL OF LIGHT is streaking across the sky, just\nabove the watery plains.\n\nAlex and Nick swerve towards it, gaining ground.  As they near it, Nick\nswings out his hand, scooping the Firefly up.

That's it for Nick.  He\ndives, terrified.\n\n<b>UNDERWATER,\n</b>\nNick follows Alex into the shadowy depths.  He swims madly, but the GLOW\nseems impossibly far away.  Even under water, the Apocalyptic sound of the\nScreamer can be heard.\n\n<b>NICK\n</b>\npeddles his arms and legs furiously.

She digs and digs, but\nall she finds is more sand.  With each second she becomes more frantic.\n\nFinally Alex stops, noticing the key and idly picking it up.\n\n<b>THE SAND\n</b>\naround Alex ERUPTS and BONES come flying up into the air, Benz' bones!\n\nAlex SCREAMS.

Nick, literally,\nliquefies.  The human body is 95% water, and Nick EXPLODES like a water\nballoon on high impact, blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes,\nAlex, and everything for a good fifty yards.\n\nAlex is frozen with terror.  You remember your worst childhood nightmare\nmonster?  The one you'd see in your room at night as your brain cooked\nwith fever?  Too paralyzed to call out for Mom?  Well that's the Screamer.\n\n<b>THE SCREAMER\n</b>\nstands where Nick used to be (a red mess on the blue sand now).  Black as\nnight.  Like living, roiling lava. Smoking, charged RED EYES.

She's got seconds to make up her mind, the doorway/mouth or\nthe Screamer.  It's really no choice at all.

Immediately she starts to fall, realizes where she is, and hugs the\ncliff for dear life. Rock shards crumble away beneath her feet.  Alex\nlooks down ...\n\nBig mistake.\n\nShe hugs the cliff face tighter, tears and grime streaking her face. She's\nalone now and she knows it.

Suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor,\nturns the corner and heads down the hallway towards Alex.\n\nThe light hits her feet and SPARKS fly.  Alex SCREAMS and is thrown back\nagainst the wall, shocked.  The streak of light continues past her and\ndisappears into the mirror at the hall's end.

Both are shrinking away to nothing.\n\nAnd all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growing\nincreasingly more nightmarish in appearance.  As Alex tires, the\nreflection seems to gain more strength.\n\nBUZZZZZ!!!  BUZZZZZ!!!  The streaks are shooting towards her with more\nfrequency, and now they're racing along the walls too.  Alex is jumping\nleft and right, with SPARKS exploding around her.\n\n<b>THE REFLECTION\n</b>\nseems to be metamorphosizing.  Each time we see it/her, she looks a little\ndifferent.

The\ncorridors are filled with a constant BUZZING and flickering of light.\nSPARKS fly and Alex is shocked over and over.\n\nShe stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing a\nstreak.  It cuts past her face, centimeters away.\n\nBEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  Off goes her wrist display!

It's in front of her this time,\ninstead of behind her.\n\nRock and a fucking hard place.  Light streaks or Screamers?\n\nIt's really no choice at all.

No blue desert sand to cushion her\nhere.  It takes her a moment to rise...\n\nAlex is on a slat-board pier extending out into a sea of black water.  The\nshore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier.  Storms\nclouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on the\nopen sea, you know what it looks like...\n\n...the and of the world.  A strange and scary yellow/green sky presses\ndown on us.  It's a hurricane sky.  The calm before the storm.\n\n<b>ON THE HORIZON,\n</b>\nTWO CITIES can be seen.  Techno-cityscapes, angular and metallic-looking,\ntowers jutting up from the sea like knives.\n\n<b>AT THE END OF THE PIERS\n</b>\nare two boats.  Standing in them are two pale-faced, cloaked FIGURES.\nLike Charon, the boatman on the river Styx.\n\nSomewhere off in the distance, the RINGING can be distinctly heard now.\nBut Alex is preoccupied now.  As she moves down the pier, recognition\ndawns on her.\n\nIt's Laurie and Stilts.  They are dressed completely in black, hair\nslicked back and eyes empty.  White-faced Gothic harlequins.  Each is\nholding a wooden staff, staring into space.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\tGuys!  Oh my God...\n\nAlex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitement\nfades.

It\nshoots down the street like a guided missile.\n\nAlex stumbles.  The Boy drags at her arm, trying to pull her up...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE BOY\n</b>\t\tCome on!!!\n\nAlex is crying, hysterical.  She turns and sees the Screamer bearing down\non her, just like Nick did before her was ripped to shreds.\n\nThe boy is yelling something.  Alex focuses...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE BOY\n</b>\t\tThe doorway!  It's here!!!\n\n<b>THE BOY\n</b>\nis pulling back a manhole cover.  BLUE LIGHT  issues up from below.\nBefore Alex can stop him, the boy disappears down the hole.\n\nAlex has one last chance.  She throws herself at the hole even as the\nScreamer reaches her.  A clawed hand wraps around her leg.  Alex FIRES\ninto the hand.  The hand is severed!  She's falling!  Falling into\ndarkness...\n\n<b>\"LEVEL TEN -- BAD BRAINS\"\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

Alex rises, shaking badly.\nHer armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's\nimpossible to tell who's blood, though.  She looks like she's just walked\nout of a slaughter-house.\n\nA bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.  Alex turns...\n\n<b>ARCADE'S BRAIN\n</b>\nlooms over her, all glass and black steel.  It reaches into the sky and\nkeeps on going.  Massive.  Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and down\nit, BUZZING.  And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely\nappears to be alive.\n\n<b>TWO GLASS DOORS\n</b>\nswing open in invitation.  A red carpet rolls out from within the\nbuilding, rolling by itself.  Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls\ncompletely, ending just at Alex's feet.\n\nAbove the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time,\n\"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE\".  Fucking-A.\n\nAlex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.  It's all she can do anymore.\n\n<b>THE BOY\n</b>\nlooks up at Alex, frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOY\n</b>\t\tWe have to go in there, don't we?\n\nAlex nods.  She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet\ntowards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain.\n\n<b>INT.  LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHT\n</b>\nInside, the lobby is a cacophony of LIGHT and SOUND.  We hear HUNDREDS OF\nVOICES at once...whispering...fading in and out...  It's like channels\nbeing changed.  A snippet of an opera here, maybe Bugs Bunny's voice\nthere...RAP MUSIC, COUNTRY MUSIC, a woman in the throes of orgasm, Nazis\nscreaming \"HEIL HITLER!\", anything and everything.\n\n<b>SIGNS BLINK ON AND OFF...\n</b>\nCatchy phrases like, \"THIS IS MY BRAIN AND WELCOME TO IT\", and \"I THINK,\nTHEREFORE, I'M FUCKED\" flash before us.\n\n<b>T.V. MONITORS\n</b>\nare everywhere, displaying an endless array of STATIC.  And now the\nmonitors are displaying FRACTALS.  Every single one of them.  We hear the\nCELLOS, like an orchestra tuning up.\n\n<b>ALEX\n</b>\nthrows her hands over her ears as the SOUNDS become unbearable.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(top of her lungs)\n<b>\t\tSHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n</b>\nShe pulls out her gun at FIRES into the SOUNDS and IMAGES. Shooting the\nfuck out of everything.  Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and...\n\n...just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blink\noff, and it's dark once again.\n\n<b>INT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM --\n</b>\n<b>A SPOTLIGHT\n</b>\ncomes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything else\nis dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go on\nforever.\n\n<b>MORE LIGHTS\n</b>\ncome on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends.\nThey're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit in\nrows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell.\n\nAnd now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice.\nA frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is very\nunusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it had\njust pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'S\nheart.\n\nAlex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved\ninto the ice.\n\nAlex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine golden\nkeys are attached.  Removing the keys, Alex begins to fit them\ntogether...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a\nsingle, greater key.\n\n<b>THE KEY\n</b>\nAlex fits it into the keyhole and turns it.\n\n<b>THE CASE OF ICE\n</b>\nsplits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. Inside, Greg is\nfrozen still, clutching the sword.  Alex pulls the sword out of his stiff\ngrip, lifting it up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(looking around)\n\t\tOkay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you?\n\nNo answer.  Alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tWhere are you, damnit?!\n\nHer voice echoes in the cavernous room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tARCADE (O.S.)\n</b><b>\t\tRIGHT HERE, BITCH.\n</b>\nAlex spins around and...\n\n<b>THE BOY\n</b>\nstands before her.

It claws at its face, ripping\nthe flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath.\n\nNothing could have prepared Alex for this.  It/ARCADE rises above her and\nit takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming.  Somehow, Alex\nfinds a reserve of strength.\n\nAlex swings the sword and...\n\nARCADE SMASHES it aside.  It CLATTERS to the floor, useless.  But that's\nacademic now as a gnarled hand clamps around Alex's throat.\n\nARCADE lifts Alex into the air and SLAMS her against a wall, pinning her\nthere.  He thrusts his face into hers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tARCADE\n</b><b>\t\tYOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN\n</b><b>\t\tTOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.

THANK-YOU, ALEX.\n</b><b>\t\tTHANK-YOU SO MUCH.\n</b>\nARCADE slowly squeezes her throat and Alex chokes, gasping for air that\nisn't forthcoming.  Tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red.  She\ntries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't...\n\n<b>HER P.O.V.\n</b>\nas she sees the faces of her friends.  Frozen.  Unable to help.  Then the\nimages swirl and Alex begins to lose consciousness.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tARCADE\n</b><b>\t\tYOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T\n</b><b>\t\tBEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN.\n</b>\nARCADE drops Alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags\nher across the floor...\n\n<b>A DOORWAY\n</b>\nstands in the darkness.  ARCADE rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness\nbeyond.  It's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality.\nIt sucks the air into it, light...everything.  It touches some sort of\nprimal fear. Gut instinct.  You don't ever want to go to this place. Ever.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX\n</b>\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tNo! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nShe twists madly, trying to pull away, but ARCADE is too strong.  He\nshoves her through the doorway.  Her hands briefly latch onto the\ndoorjamb.  ARCADE violently kicks her and her hands slip away.  They slip\nand she tumbles through.\n\nARCADE slams the door shut.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tARCADE\n</b><b>\t\tGOODBYE, ALEX.

That's all I ever think about\n\t\tanymore.  It's like there's never enough of\n\t\tit, you know?\n\nThe other Alex vanishes.  Now the chair is empty.  Alex turns to look down\nthe long hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the open door.  A door\nwe've seen before.

A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.\nEverything looks perfect.\n\nWe turn with Alex.  Ever so slowly.  Over to the right and the entranceway\nof the bathroom.  Over to where her mother is...\n\n...seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOM\n</b>\t\tHi, honey.\n\n<b>HER MOTHER\n</b>\nlooks beautiful.  Eyes sparkling.

A still-born scream is frozen in her throat.\nA split-second of realization.  And then her mother FIRES the gun...\n\nCRACK!  The bullet hits Alex square in the forehead, snapping her head\nback as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward.  The world spins\nto a stop, like a record player running down.\n\nAlex is killed instantly.  Her body collapse, head thumping\nunceremoniously against the carpeted floor.\n\n<b>HER EYES\n</b>\nopen and fixed on infinity.  No life here.
