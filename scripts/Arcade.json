It's just black.\n\nAnd maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by.  So quick we barely\nperceive them.  Like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed.\n\nBREATHING,\n\nslow and hollow, filling up the entire world.  It's eerie as hell.  A\nfeeling of utter loneliness.\n\nAnd now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness.  Whatever it\nwas...it's gone now.\n\nMAIN CREDITS ROLL.\n\nWe hear CELLOS.  Four of them.  Weaving an intricate melody.\n\nAnd now the visuals.  BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in.  Equally\nintricate, matching the music.  They grow and flourish, like flowers\nopening up in time lapse photography.\n\nFRACTALS...\n\nis what they're called.  The visual manifestation of geometric formulas.\nThe Mandelbrot Set.  The Julia Set.  Each mathematic form made up of\nprogressively smaller forms and on into infinity.\n\nGlorious and beautiful.  Forms folding in upon themselves and\nregenerating.\n\nThis is creation we're witnessing.\n\nThis is life in the making.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\nAN EYE\n\nFor a brief moment we still hear the CELLOS.  And in the eye, the last of\nthe fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris.  A nice blue\none.  This is ALEX MANNING'S eye.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX (V.O.)\n\t\tTime.  That's all I ever think about\n\t\tanymore.  It's like there's never enough of\n\t\tit, you know?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY\n\nThis is a flashback, in case you're wondering.  We'll continue to hear\nAlex's VOICE as we move through the house in slow motion.  Everything is\nvery bright and dreamlike.\n\nRight now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway.\nAt the end of the hallway is an open door.\n\nWe stop at the doorway.  We're afraid to go in.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX (V.O.)\n\t\tIt's strange.  When the future's in front\n\t\tof you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean,\n\t\tyou never really get there.  It's always\n\t\tone step ahead of you.  It's like there's\n\t\tno present. There's no \"now\".  As soon as\n\t\tyou think, \"I'm here\", the moment's already\n\t\tgone.  Either everything's in the future,\n\t\tor it's in the past.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tThere's no \"now\".\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN (V.O.)\n\t\tSo where are you then?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX (V.O.)\n\t\tI'm in the past.\n\nWe move through the doorway.\n\nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY\n\nEverything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight\nstreaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.\nEverything looks perfect.\n\nThen we move further in, and over to the right.  There's something on the\nfloor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom.  Halfway in, halfway\nout.\n\nIt's a woman's body.  She's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent.  We\ncan't see her face from this angle. But in her limp hand is a gun.  And\nall around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom\nand the carpeting beyond, is BLOOD.\n\nA shrill BELL shatters the moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\nThe bell continues.  It's a school bell signaling the end of the period.\n\nON ALEX\n\nas we see her for the first time, startled.  She's seventeen and pretty,\nthough in a simple way.  Her eyes are the most striking.  Deep.  Intense.\nIf Alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's\nreflected in her eyes.\n\nAcross from her is MR. WEAVER, a high-school guidance counselor and that\nwas his voice we heard with Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged,\nincapable of really hearing what Alex has to say.  This is his office\nwe're in. Typical \"SAY NO TO DRUGS\" teen propaganda decorate the room.\nFun.\n\nAs the BELL dies we hear the army of FOOTSTEPS outside, students milling\nin the halls.\n\nAlex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. WEAVER\n\t\tWe don't have to stop now...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(cutting him off)\n\t\tThat's okay.  I've got a test coming up\n\t\tanyway.  Gotta study.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. WEAVER\n\t\t\t(sighs)\n\t\tI have to tell you, I'm a little concerned\n\t\tabout you, Alex.  It's been three months\n\t\tnow since your mother, uh...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(offering, fixing him with\n\t\t\ta stare)\n\t\tKilled herself?\n\nMr. Weaver stops, more than a little uncomfortable.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. WEAVER\n\t\t\t(reluctant)\n\t\tYes.  Now your father...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tHe's a basket case.  You've talked to him.\n\t\tYou know that.  He might as well be dead\n\t\ttoo.\n\nAlex glances down at the floor, anything to avoid looking at the\ncounselor.  She heaves a backpack onto to shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLook Mr. Weaver, I don't even know why I\n\t\tcame here.  I fine.  Really.\n\t\t\t(looking up)\n\t\tIt's like I said.  It's just part of the\n\t\tpast now.  It doesn't matter anymore.\n\nShe turns, and before Mr. Weaver can respond, she's out the door.\n\nINT.  HIGH-SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\n\nAlex moves quickly through the mass of STUDENTS, wiping the remnants of\nhalf-tears on her coat sleeve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY\n\nFun-time.  Total chaos.  If you've been to high-school you know the riff.\nBad food, teen-age melodrama, and a squadron of SUPERVISORS trying to keep\na lid on things.\n\nALEX\n\nmakes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kids\nlounge around a table.  These are Alex's FRIENDS.  And while none of them\nare your garden variety pocket-protector-type nerds, these kids aren't\nexactly part of the \"in-crowd\".  They're a little off.  Quirky.  All of\nthem come from screwed up families, and that's what bonds them.  They are:\n\nGREG HOLLISTON -- Alex's boyfriend.  Hopeful artist (not bad, either) and\nkind of punk looking.  Greg and the others are big fans of thrift-shop\nclothing.  Because they don't have the money, they improvise.\n\nNICK DRAKE -- Greg's best friend and future computer pioneer.  He's\nattractive and he's got an edge.  A bit of a hot-shot.  Genius in the\nmaking.\n\nBENZ AND STILTS -- Inseparable.  Benz is flunking out of school and would\nlike nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comic\nbooks.  He's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, and nervous.  Stilts,\ncontrary to his nickname, is quite short and never without his skateboard.\nStilts is constantly hitting on...\n\nLAURIE -- The sixth member of the group.  A teen Theda Bara and as cynical\nas you can get.  She's what's affectionately known as an \"art chick\".\n\nThe boys in the group, particularly Nick and Stilts, are avid\nskateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards.  Stilts is always\nleafing through an issue of THRASHER magazine.\n\nRight now the group is in the midst of an argument.  Nick has a pocket\nvideo game in his hands which he casually plays.  He can get through these\ngames in his sleep.  It BEEPS and WHIRS.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(to Benz)\n\t\tYou're an idiot, you know that? What're you\n\t\tgoing to do when you get out of here?\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tI was thinking about writing for one of\n\t\tthose Filipino mail order brides...\n\nStilts and Greg burst into laughter.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tI think I saw that on the Home Shopping\n\t\tNetwork.  The Girlfriend Hour, right after\n\t\tAuto Accessories.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\t\t(giggling)\n\t\tExactly.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tYou guys are sick.\n\nAlex flops down in a chair and everyone turns.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tSo how'd it go?\n\nAlex shrugs, trying to make light of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tHe thinks I'm \"sublimating\".\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tWhat the hell does that mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tIt means she's screwed up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tFucked up.  That's what they said I was.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tYou are fucked up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tYeah, but only because I want to be.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tWould you guys knock it off?\n\nGreg turns back to Alex and looks her in the eye.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tListen to me, Alex.  These counselor's\n\t\tdon't know anything.  They're full of shit.\n\t\tIf you don't fit the pattern of the perfect\n\t\tkid, they freak.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tI know.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tSo tell me you're okay, then.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tI'm okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(smiles)\n\t\tGood.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.\n\n\nGreg leans over and kisses Alex.  The rest of the group launches into\nexaggerated GROANS, with Benz and Stilts fluttering their eyes and making\n\"smooching faces\" at each other.  The kiss is over and everyone LAUGHS.\n\nThings are okay now.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(to Alex)\n\t\tHey...watch this...\n\nGreg pulls an old Polaroid camera from his backpack.  He leans in close to\nher and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them.  FLASH!\nAnd the moment's captured forever.\n\nGreg pulls the Polaroid out and peels off the backing. Before the picture\neven develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the\nemulsion.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(engrossed in his game\n\t\t\tagain)\n\t\tYou making another one, Greg?\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tSure.  Practice.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tLemme see...\n\nGreg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to Benz.\nThe papers are color xeroxes of Polaroid blow-ups.  Greg has messed with\nthem, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images.  Stilts and\nLaurie lean in.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tCool.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(still working)\n\t\tSee, when the emulsion's still warm you can\n\t\tmove it around...\n\t\t\t(stops)\n\t\tThere.\n\nGreg holds up the Polaroid for Alex to see.\n\nPOLAROID\n\nGreg and Alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world has\nspun into strange colors.  It's an odd effect.\n\nGreg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tSafe keeping.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick's pocket video game emits an EXPLOSION NOISE.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tShit.  I'm out.\n\nHe sets the game down, dejected.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tYou guys going to Dante's after school?\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tCheck it out...\n\nBenz pulls a flyer from inside his coat.  It's an ad for a new game called\n\"ARCADE\", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a\ncircuit board.  The tag at the bottom reads, \"COMING THIS FALL.  REALITY\nWILL NEVER BE THE SAME\".\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(excited)\n\t\tThat's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys\n\t\tare good.  It's supposed to be interactive.\n\t\tGraphics are unbelievable.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tYeah?  They were handing these out at\n\t\tDante's.  Test marketing it or something.\n\t\tGonna have a demonstration today.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tCool.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tCan you say anything but \"cool\"?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tOf course I can.  I can say all sorts of\n\t\tthings...\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\tGuys...\n\n\nBenz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tSo how 'bout it?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tI'm game...\n\t\t\t(to Greg)\n\t\tGreg?\n\nGreg turns to Alex.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tCome on.  We'll hit Dante's after school,\n\t\ttry the game out, maybe get some dinner.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tAnd then keep on driving?\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tSure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tI could go for that.\n\nAlex laughs.  Laurie took the words right out of her mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY\n\nThe Inferno is a run-down video arcade near the beach, notable because the\ngames it sports are generally defective and out of date.  Nevertheless,\nit's become our group's hang-out.  It has its charms.\n\nA huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of the\narcade...something straight out of Hieronymus Bosch. Demons in day-glo.\nThe yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.\n\nALEX AND THE OTHERS\n\npull up across the street, caravan style.  Greg and Alex are in one\ncar...an ancient Buick Skylark.  No Honda Accords or VW Rabbits for this\ngroup.\n\nAt the moment, there's quite a bit of activity at the Inferno's entrance.\nKIDS are clustered around and Slip-Stream employees are passing out Arcade\npromo sheets.\n\nTHE GROUP\n\nheads for the entrance, plowing their way through the crowd.  Stilts and\nBenz have their skateboards, jumping up onto the curb with them, then\npopping them up into their arms.\n\nINT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY\n\nInside, the Inferno is a mishmash of video games, ancient carnival props\nand old horror movie posters.  Dusty, creepy under the right circumstances\nand filled with leering faces...  in short, any kid's bedroom taken to a\nhorrific extreme.  At Dante's Inferno, they've got the latest games side\nby side with chestnuts like Pac-Man.\n\nTHE GROUP\n\nmakes their way inside, joining a cluster of KIDS in the center of The\nInferno.  And there it is...\n\nARCADE\n\nIt looks out of place in the midst of The Inferno.  Shiny black,\nhigh-tech, and almost self-contained, like some sort of space-age vertical\ncoffin.  Laser-etched graphics on the sides bear the ARCADE logo and the\nsame strange, frightening face.\n\nAlex and her friends are suitably impressed, most notably, Nick and Benz.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\tCheck it out...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tDefinitely cool.\n\nNick is silent, letting his eyes explore the machine.  He turns to Greg\nand grins.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tSuper computers, micro-processors... That's\n\t\tthe future we're looking at.\n\nAnother kid, DELOACH, pushes his way to the front of the group.  His\nfighting a losing battle against acne.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n\t\t\t(looking around)\n\t\tSo how come they're previewing it in this\n\t\tshit-hole?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tIf you weren't such a dick, you'd know what\n\t\ta cool place this was.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n\t\tGimme a break, they got fucking Space\n\t\tInvaders here.  That's shit's for retards.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tSo...are you trying to say I'm retarded?\n\t\tIs that what you're implying?\n\n\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n\t\tNo, but since I'm standing here, I'm\n\t\tnoticing that you're an ugly little fuck\n\t\tand you're making me sick...\n\nThat's it for Stilts.  He launches himself at DeLoach, catching him off\nguard and KNOCKING him to the floor.\n\nNick, Alex, and Greg are on them in a minute, trying to extract the two\nfrom each other.\n\nA LARGE MAN\n\npushes his way towards them and effortlessly scoops both boys up, wrapping\na beefy hand around the scruffs of their necks.  This is FINSTER, the\nproprietor...enormous, bald, and always irritable.\n\n\t\t\t\tFINSTER\n\t\t\t(shaking them)\n\t\tCut it out!!!\n\nHis face contorts and he spits as he speaks.  Nice guy. Alex steps\nforward, always the voice of reason.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tIt's okay, Mr. Finster...\n\n\t\t\t\tFINSTER\n\t\tNo it's not.\n\t\t\t(to the boys)\n\t\tYou guys are shits and I'm throwing you out.\n\n\t\t\t\tDELOACH\n\t\t\t(acting tough)\n\t\tYour place sucks.  Who gives a shit about\n\t\t\"ARCADE\" anyway?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(booming, metallic)\n\t\tWHAT DID YOU SAY?\n\nEveryone turns.  The voice came from...\n\nARCADE\n\nIt's up and running now.  The inside panel emits an eerie green light.\nFrom speakers inside the compartment we can here BREATHING...the same\nbreathing we heard earlier. Coming from a machine like this, it's creepy\nas hell.\n\nEven Finster is impressed.  He releases the boys and stares at the\nmachine.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tJesus...\n\n\t\t\t\tANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)\n\t\tNot bad, huh?\n\nA MAN steps out from behind the ARCADE machine.  He grins happily, dressed\nto kill, sporting a SLIP-STREAM ID tag. This is DIFFORD, P.R. man for\nSLIP-STREAM.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tHi, kids.\n\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tMr. Finster...\n\nThe ARCADE machine continues to breathe, inhale, exhale... The eyes in the\nface are glowing now, in unison with the breathing.\n\nDifford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(smooth as silk)\n\t\tWe're glad you people could make it, and\n\t\twe're anxious to have you try out our new\n\t\tproduct.  We think it's going to be a big\n\t\tseller.  But you're the people that make it\n\t\thappen.  You're the market share everyone's\n\t\ttearing each other apart to get at.  It's\n\t\tyour opinion that's going to make or break\n\t\tus.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tSo what's so different about Arcade? You\n\t\tguys've been talking about it for months.\n\nDifford turns to Nick and salutes him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tA man after my own heart.  Straight to the\n\t\tpoint.\n\t\t\t(to everyone)\n\t\tWhat's different about ARCADE is the way it\n\t\treacts.  It responds like a human does.  It\n\t\tlearns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it\n\t\tchanges its strategy.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tThat's impossible.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(taking the bait)\n\t\tIs it?  Why don't you see for your self?\n\nDifford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter.  He tosses\nit at...\n\nNICK\n\nwho snags it out of mid-air and grins.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tGo for it, Nick.\n\nDifford steps aside and waves Nick to the machine.  The rest of the kids\ncrowd around.\n\nARCADE\n\nisn't just your typical video game.  First of all there are three\nscreens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view while\nplaying.  Second, the player wears \"data gloves\" (which provide an actual\nsensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired\ndirectly into the machine.  The results give the user the feeling that\nhe/she has actually entered the video game universe.\n\nDifford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(indicating equipment)\n\t\tThe CyberGloves are keyed into the game's\n\t\tresponse mechanism.  You'll be able to pick\n\t\tthings up inside the world...tools, weapons\n\t\t... it'll feel like they're really in your\n\t\thands...\n\nNick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThe goggles heighten the experience. When\n\t\twe said \"Reality will never be the same\",\n\t\twe weren't kidding.\n\nDifford places the goggles on Nick's face.  Then he points to the control\nboard, which features two joy-sticks and a large RED BUTTON labeled\n\"ESCAPE\".\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(skeptical)\n\t\t\"Escape\"?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tIn case things get too intense.  It\n\t\tautomatically freezes the game, gives you a\n\t\tbreather.  Things can get pretty wild...\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\t\t(scoffing)\n\t\tNick won't need it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tYou're good, eh?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(grins)\n\t\tThe best.\n\nNick winks at Alex and Greg.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(to Difford)\n\t\tSo what's the scenario?  Am I saving a\n\t\tprincess?  Fighting Zombies?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tIt changes.  There are eleven levels. Each\n\t\tone is a different layer of the ARCADE\n\t\tuniverse.  The concept is, you're entering\n\t\tthe video game itself, making your way\n\t\tacross the circuit board to the logic core\n\t\t... ARCADE's brain.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tSo how do I start?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tThe game will guide you.\n\nNick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot.\nHe punches the \"START\" button on the top of one of the joy-sticks.\n\nImmediately the screens come to life.  Darkness with shooting stars of\nlight racing back and forth.\n\nON SCREEN\n\nA three-dimensional computer-generated FACE appears out of the darkness,\nspinning in from far away and coming to rest.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tI AM ARCADE.\n\t\t\t(breathing)\n\t\tYOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES?  YOU PICKED THE\n\t\tWRONG MACHINE.\n\nThe crowd of kids is suitably impressed.  Even Alex is amused.\nSo far, so good.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tWHAT'S YOUR NAME?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tNick.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\t\t(almost contemptuous)\n\t\tNICK.  KISS REALITY GOODBYE.\n\nSUDDENLY,\n\nA LIGHTBEAM above the video screen illuminates Nick's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\t\t(concerned)\n\t\tWhat's it doing?!\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tMemorizing Nick's features.  Watch.\n\nON SCREEN\n\nthe face of ARCADE spins away and a computer-generated figure appears,\ncomplete with a pixel-rendered version of Nick's face!\n\nVIDEO NICK\n\nis dressed in futuristic armor with exaggerated CyberGloves and a full\nhelmet on instead of goggles.  He also wears elbow and knee pads and\ncarries a thrasher in his hands, sort of a cross between a souped-up\nskateboard and the Silver Surfer's board.  It's his means of\ntransportation.\n\nThe screen prints out:  \"NICK.  ENTER THE VORTEX\".\n\nVIDEO NICK\n\nhops onto the thrasher.

It looks like\nEarth, and yet...it doesn't.\n\nVIDEO NICK\n\nhops onto the thrasher and begins to move.  And move it does.  With a\nWHOOP! the ARCADE world is rushing past us. The game has begun.\n\nON NICK'S FACE\n\nAs a smile gradually creeps across it.  He's having the time of his life,\ngloved hands manipulating the joy-sticks like mad.

The\nvideo image freezes.\n\nNICK\n\nHe's practically hyperventilating, sweat pouring down his face.  He leans\nover, resting a hand on the control board. And for a moment, everyone is\nsilent.  Then...\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tNick...you okay?\n\nSlowly, Nick lifts his head.  He's now sporting a devilish grin.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tYou gotta try this thing.\n\nNick pulls off his CyberGloves and holds them out for Greg. Greg turns to\nAlex.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tGo for it.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tHold my keys, then.\n\nHe hands her his keychain and takes the CyberGloves from Nick.

She's staring at the floor of the ARCADE\nmachine.\n\nGREG'S POLAROID\n\nis on the floor...the photo of Greg and Alex which he manipulated.\n\nAlex picks it up, glancing around.  She scans the faces of the crowd and\nshe doesn't see Greg anywhere.  She turns away.\n\nON SCREEN\n\nA video figure is lying on the computer-generated ground.

Small things, like the color of light, a sluggish\nsmoke-filled RED, or the occasional FLICKER OF LIGHTNING which races\nbeneath the cloud cover above.\n\nALEX\n\npulls herself up from the muck, brushing dirt and water from her face.\nShe coughs, totally disoriented.  Looks around.\n\nLooks at herself.  She's wearing...\n\nBATTLE GEAR\n\nThis is the real thing, as opposed to the cartoon version we saw Nick\nwearing when he played the game before.  It's a cross between a\nskateboarder's protective guardpads and full-blown armor.  A helmet rests\non her head, with a visor raised up.\n\nAlex glances down and sees a thrasher board resting next to her.  (Note:\nDepending on the terrain of each level, the thrasher board will adjust\nitself...working as a skateboard, snowboard, or hover board).\n\nON ALEX'S RIGHT CYBERGLOVE\n\nis an LED display.

He stops on one display in particular, a triptych of\nsorts featuring the haunting face of ARCADE.\n\nBING!\n\nAlex and Nick turn at the sound, just in time to see Difford exiting an\nelevator and briskly making his way towards them.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tNick, Alex, how are we today?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tHow'd you know it was us?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tSecurity camera.\n\t\t\t(points to one)\n\t\tPulled your files before I came down. Be\n\t\tcareful what you say, kids ... I know where\n\t\tyou live.\n\nDifford laughs and claps Nick on the back.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tNow what seems to be the problem?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tIt's the game, ARCADE.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tYou don't like it?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tThat's gotta be the understatement of the\n\t\tcentury.  It's killing people.\n\nBeat.  Difford looks from Alex to Nick, and back again. His smile fades\nfrom his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tIf this is a joke, I'm not laughing.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tNeither are we.  Something's wrong with the\n\t\tgame, Mr. Difford.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(clearing his throat)\n\t\tWhy don't we take this into my office.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  DIFFORD'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\nDifford closes the doors behind him.  He stares and Alex and Nick for a\nmoment, assessing, calculating risks...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tTalk to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThere's something wrong with ARCADE. The\n\t\tgame's alive somehow...\n\nAt this Difford breaks into a smile.  Nick sees this and acts quickly to\nsave the situation.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhat Alex is trying to say is that it\n\t\t\"seems\" like it's alive.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tNo I'm not...\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(freezing her with a\n\t\t\tstare)\n\t\tWe're not getting very far into the levels\n\t\tand we kind of thought maybe we could talk\n\t\tto a programmer, learn some tricks and\n\t\tstuff...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI mean, you don't want us kids running\n\t\taround school saying your game's too hard,\n\t\tright?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(relieved)\n\t\tThat's what this is all about? Tricks?\n\t\tSure, I'd be happy to introduce you to\n\t\tARCADE's programmer.\n\nAlex has caught on.  She shuts up for the moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tTell you what, I'll take you down to our\n\t\tR&D labs right now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY\n\nHardly what you'd expect.  The lab is hopelessly cluttered, as if a\nwhirlwind had swept inside and thrown everything helter-skelter.  Difford\nleads Nick and Alex inside.\n\nA MAN sets in front of a stack on monitors.  One his head is a helmet-like\ninstrument...sort of an extension of the stereoscopic goggles.  He wears a\nlab-coat and a SLIP-STREAM I.D. badge, but aside from that, his appearance\nis unkempt.  Kind of your 60s drop-out look.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\tThis is one of our newest projects. We're\n\t\ttrying to get rid of joy-sticks\n\t\taltogether ...\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tThe Air-Force is working on the same thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t\t(to screen)\n\t\tCome on, come on...\n\nHe moves his head this way and that...\n\nTHE MONITORS\n\nA computer-animated TURTLE is crawling across the screen. Then the words\n\"TIME'S UP\" flash over.  The turtle flips onto it's back and dies, tongue\nhanging out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tShit.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(clearing his throat)\n\t\tAlbert...\n\nALBERT turns around in his seat and pulls off the helmet.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThis is Nick and Alex.  They'd like to talk\n\t\tto you about ARCADE.  Maybe you can give\n\t\tthem a few programmer's secrets.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tYeah, sure.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIFFORD\n\t\t\t(to Nick and Alex)\n\t\tThen I leave you in capable hands.\n\nDifford exits.  Nick points to the helmet in Albert's hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tDoes that thing work?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tGetting there.  It's more sensitive than a\n\t\tjoy-stick.  Your video-character can respond\n\t\tas fast as you can.\n\t\t\t(standing)\n\t\tBut what can I do for you?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWe're having some problems with ARCADE...\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tYeah, who isn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tIt's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard\n\t\tdown.  Keeps on changing the rules.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWe vere thinking there might be tricks.\n\t\tYou know, surprises that you'd worked into\n\t\tthe game...\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tSure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start\n\t\twith the schematics.  I can print these up\n\t\tif you want.\n\nAlbert moves back to the wall of monitors, then reaches for a computer\ndisk and inserts it into a nearby drive.  He taps a few buttons and\nBINGO...\n\nSCHEMATICS\n\nof each world/level within the ARCADE game appear on the monitors.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tYou've got your ten levels, right? Here\n\t\tthey are...  Each level has an exit, only\n\t\tremember, the exits aren't always what they\n\t\tseem.\n\t\t\t(points to each one)\n\t\tFirst one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've\n\t\tgot The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts,\n\t\tKingdom of the Blind...  On each world you\n\t\thave to find a golden key and you've only\n\t\tgot so much time to do it in.  If you're\n\t\ttoo late, The Screamer comes.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tHow do you stop The Screamer?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tYou can't.  He gets you and you're dead.\n\t\tIt's like time catching up with you, you\n\t\tknow?  Like Fate.  Each level you get\n\t\tprogressively less time to complete.  First\n\t\thalf of the game takes place in the Wild\n\t\tLands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's\n\t\tthe Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed\n\t\tBoatman that'll take you across if you\n\t\tanswer his riddle right.  If you don't...\n\nHe motions cutting a knife across his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhat's the riddle?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tIf I tell you, then it's no fun.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(harder)\n\t\tJust tell me the fucking riddle.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tWell...it involves a paradox.  You have to\n\t\ttrick The Boatman.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tNow all the while, you also have to watch\n\t\tyour strength.  You can build that back up\n\t\tby catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing\n\t\tguys...\n\nAlbert hits some keys again and Levels One through Six disappear.  Now\nthey're replaced by Seven through Ten. Only instead of a schematic for\nLevel Eleven, there's only a question matc.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThe next half of the game takes place in\n\t\tARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's\n\t\turban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete.\n\t\tScreamer comes faster here.  On Level Four\n\t\tyou can get a free life if you wait until\n\t\tthe last possible second before exiting that\n\t\tworld.  Gotta time it right though.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWhat's the question mark?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tLevel Ten.  That's where you've got to\n\t\tunlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've\n\t\tfound.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tHow do you do that?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tGood question.  See, that's where the fun\n\t\tcomes in.  ARCADE changes it every time.\n\t\tHe's a machine without a soul. Once you give\n\t\thim a soul, he stops being a threat.\n\nAlex looks dejected.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tBut how can it change every time?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tIt's the game's logic core.  We actually\n\t\tpatterned it after human brainwaves.  I\n\t\tmean, there's a personality in there.\n\t\tThat's what makes it so incredible.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tHow the hell did you do that?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tWell, we're veering into classified info\n\t\there, but I'll tell you that it involved a\n\t\tdonor.  He was dead of course, so it's not\n\t\tlike anything unethical was happening.\n\nAt this, a chill runs down Alex's spine.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tDead?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tWell, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient.\n\t\tIt's really not all that important.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tMaybe he's not dead.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tHe?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThe donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the\n\t\tgame.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tAnd maybe you've been taking too many drugs.\n\nNick glances at the helmet again.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tCould you play ARCADE with that?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tWell, technically \"yes\", but this is only\n\t\tthe prototype.\n\nNick nods and smiles, offering his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tThanks, Albert.  Think you could print up\n\t\tthose schematics?\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tSure.\n\nAlbert moves back to the computer console.  Meanwhile, Nick pulls Alex\naside.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tGo outside, get your car, and meet me out\n\t\tfront with the engine running. And make it\n\t\tquick, okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWhat are you going to do?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tGet that helmet.  If we're going to play\n\t\tARCADE, I want every advantage possible.\n\nACROSS THE LAB,\n\nAlbert is oblivious to their conversation.\n\nAlex backs towards the lab doors, turns, and opens them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY\n\nAlex makes her way quickly down the hall, turning a corner and passing a\nSECURITY GUARD.  She waves at him, her smile fading as soon as she's\npassed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT. R&D LAB - DAY\n\nAlbert is just pulling the last printed copy of the schematics from a\nlaser printer.  He turns and hands them to Nick.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\tHere you go.  Happy hunting.\n\nNick takes the schematics and tucks them inside his jacket.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tThanks again.\n\nAnd with that, Nick pulls back his fist and punches Albert square in the\nface.\n\nAlbert goes down, more stunned than hurt, and Nick springs into action.\nHe scoops up the CyberHelmet in his free hand, kicks open the doors, and\ntosses his skateboard into the hallway...\n\nINT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY\n\nNick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit, picking\nup speed like mad...\n\nHe's racing down the hallway, maneuvering between startled EMPLOYEES.  And\nhere comes a MAN with a mail cart...\n\nWHOOSH!  Nick zips by him.  And now an ALARM is ringing.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tShit...\n\nINT. ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY\n\nNick comes SCREECHING around the corner, narrowly missing a collision with\ntwo SECURITY GUARDS.\n\n\t\t\t\tGUARD #1\n\t\tThat's him!\n\nBut Nick's already past them.  He puts his foot down again, pushing for\nmore momentum...\n\nTHE GUARDS\n\nare after him now, CHARGING down the hallway.\n\nUP AHEAD,\n\nA set of double doors labeled \"EMERGENCY EXIT\" blocks his way.\n\nNick spins out, sweeping the back of the board forward and SCREAMS to a\nstop just before the doors.  He kicks the board up into his free hand\nand...\n\nWHAM!  He hits the doors running.  Now the FIRE ALARM is blaring in\naddition to the other alarm.  A VOICE is squawking over the P.A. and it's\na hell of a racket.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t(on P.A.)\n\t\tSECURITY BREACH IN R&D.  SUBJECT HEADING\n\t\tTOWARDS EASTERN EXIT...\n\nINT.

Nick tumbles out of the stairwell only to see a trio of GUARDS\nheading straight for him.\n\nNick drops his board to the ground and heads right, pumping his foot...\n\nOne of the GUARDS leaps at him and...\n\n...misses by a foot or so, CRASHING to the tile floor.\n\nNICK\n\nSCREECHES to another stop, TWISTS, and starts pumping down another\nhallway...\n\nINT. LOADING AREA -- DAY\n\nNick plows into the loading area like a bullet, whipping around stacks of\nboxes and lumbering forklifts.  A few WORKERS attempt to stop him, but\nhe's moving too fast.\n\nAHEAD,\n\nis a loading dock, raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis.\nNick's heading for it.  The loading door is open, and outside is freedom.\n\nJUST THEN,\n\nthe steel loading door begins to GRIND and lower.  Some genius has hit the\ncontrols.\n\nNICK\n\npumps like mad, and he's really moving now.  Either he'll make it, or he's\ngoing to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour...\n\nTHE DOOR\n\nis quickly closing off Nick's escape route.  He's only got about four feet\nto negotiate...\n\nNick ducks low and clears it!\n\nEXT. LOADING DOCK -- DAY\n\nNick ROCKETS off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting the\nconcrete driveway.  The driveway peels off to the left and slopes\ndownward.\n\nNick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed.\n\nBELOW,\n\nthe driveway splits off.  To the left, SLIP-STREAM's main building, and to\nthe right, the parking lot.\n\nGUARDS\n\nare piled into an electric cart, SPEEDING up from the left to cut Nick\noff.  It's going to be close...\n\nNick forks off to the right dust before they reach him.\n\nIt's clear sailing now, and up ahead, Nick can see Alex pulling up to the\nend of the driveway...\n\nWHOOSH!  Nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways in\norder to slow his speed...\n\nHe leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack-dab in\nthe back seat of the Skylark.\n\nALEX\n\nguns the engine and tears away in a cloud of exhaust.\n\nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY\n\nNick is in the back seat, LAUGHING.  The sun is beginning its descent and\nthe sky is taking on a reddish tint.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tJesus Christ!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tI can't believe you made it!\n\nNick climbs into the front seat next to Alex, and for a second, he's\npretty close to her.  He kisses her on the cheek...caught up in the\nmoment.  Then he sinks back, catching his breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tYou got the schematics?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tEverything.\n\nNeither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again.  Driving.\nWind whipping Alex's hair around.  She stares at the road ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tSo where do we play the game, Nick?\n\nNick doesn't answer at first.  For a second there, he'd managed to forget\neverything.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tI've been thinking about that.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the\n\t\tplace to hit him would be where the virus\n\t\tstarted.

DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT\n\nSweeping down from the sky, we follow The Skylark.  As Alex and Nick near\nThe Inferno, streetlights blink off in succession... progressive darkness\nworking its way towards their destination.\n\nDANTE'S INFERNO\n\nWe move past the painted walls, the various demons illuminated by\nmoonlight.\n\nAlex and Nick rush to the front door.  It's gated.  Inside, The Inferno is\ntotally dark.  Shadows.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThe windows are barred...\n\t\t\t(thinking)\n\t\tThere's a skylight.

DANTE'S INFERNO ROOF - NIGHT\n\nAlex and Nick creep over the roof, and sure enough, there's a skylight in\nthe center, caked with grime.\n\nNick stands and plants his foot through the skylight.  It SHATTERS,\nraining down glass into the darkness below.\n\nNick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars.\nGripping the belt, he lowers himself down. After a moment, he disappears\nfrom view.\n\nAlex leans over the skylight.  She can't see a thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tNick...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tNick!\n\nFor the longest moment there's no response.  Then...\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(from below)\n\t\tOkay, your turn.\n\nAlex climbs over and grasps the belt tightly, lowering herself down into\nThe Inferno.\n\nINT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT\n\nAlex dangles from the skylight, a good eight feet from the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(warily)\n\t\tAre you there?\n\nHER P.O.V.\n\nThe Inferno is a world of threatening shapes and shadows. And Nick is\nnowhere to be seen.\n\nAlex steels herself and drops to the floor.\n\nShe stands, a bit shaky, and cautiously moves around a cluster of video\ngames.\n\nNICK\n\nis standing on the other side, staring at a game screen which pulses with\na DIM LIGHT.\n\nAlex approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.  He turns.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tAlex...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tYou didn't hear me?\n\nNick shakes his head.  Alex leans forward to see what he's looking at.\n\nON THE SCREEN\n\nfractals are unfolding.  It's mesmerizing.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tStop looking at it.\n\nNick shuts his eyes, pulling away from the screen.  He shakes his head,\ntrying to clear his thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tShit...it's like a trance or something...\n\t\t\t(breathes)\n\t\tOkay.  I'm fine.  Really.\n\nIt's at that moment that Nick and Alex hear the VOICES.\n\nVIDEO SCREENS\n\nall around them flicker on, static-laced IMAGES fading in. They are the\nfaces of their friends...Greg, Laurie, and many others.  All those that\nhave disappeared.  The VOICES fade in and out, merging with one another,\ntinged with the same mechanical edge of ARCADE's voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICES\n\t\t\t(eerie)\n\t\tNick...Alex...save us...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(horrified)\n\t\tOh God...\n\nNick grabs Alex and pulls her into the canter of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tPut it out of your head, Alex.  It's just\n\t\ttrying to psyche us out.\n\nDespite Nick's words, we can tell that the VOICES are having a\ndisheartening effect on him.\n\nTHE ARCADE\n\nprototype stands in front of them now, and surprisingly, the machine is\nnot on.  The eyes in the leering black face are quite dead.\n\nAround Alex and Nick, the faces of their friends continue to fade in and\nout, casting the whole room in a strange shimmering blue light.\n\nNick moves to the back of the machine and opens the access panel,\nrevealing the internal circuitry.  He pulls a small penlight from his\npocket and flips it on.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWhat are you looking for?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tA way to hook this helmet into the game.\n\t\tI'm sure there are interfaces...\n\nNICK'S P.O.V.\n\nAnd indeed there are.  Parallel interfaces, where you might hook a printer\ncable into a computer.  Nick takes the cable from the CyberHelmet and\nsecures it into one of the interfaces.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tThere.  Now we're wired in.\n\nHe stands and moves around front, pressing the \"START\" button of the game.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nHe presses it again.  Nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tIs the game plugged in?\n\nNick checks.  It is.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(frustrated)\n\t\tI don't understand.  It wants us to play\n\t\tthe game.

We have to\n\t\tplay by the rules.  That's what it wants.\n\nNick rifles through his pockets.  He doesn't have a quarter.  Neither does\nAlex.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tChange machine.\n\nNick moves over to the change machine and picks up a nearby chair.  He\nSMASHES the chair into the face of the machine again and again,\nobliterating the lock.  Nick opens the front of the machine and tears out\nthe coin box, spilling quarters all over the floor.  He grabs a handful\nand returns.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tThere.\n\nHe shoves one in ARCADE's coin-slot and pulls on the CyberGloves.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tTwo players, Nick.

She reaches for the\nsecond pair of CyberGloves and pulls them on.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tYou don't get it, do you?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(strapping on goggles)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tI don't want anything to happen to you.  I\n\t\tcare about you.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tI already have a boyfriend, Nick.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tI know.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tIt sucks.\n\nThe two of them stand there a moment, looking at one another.  After a\nmoment, Nick laughs tiredly.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhat can I say?\n\t\t\t(pulls on the CyberHelmet)\n\t\tTough being a hero, isn't it?\n\nNick reaches out for the joy-stick and hits the \"START\" button.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(grim)\n\t\tHere goes nothing.\n\nAs before, the screen comes to life.  Darkness and sparks. Then we hear\nthe BREATHING.\n\nARCADE'S FACE\n\nspins into view, grinning at Alex and Nick.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tNICK.  ALEX.  I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. ALL\n\t\tYOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tFuck-you.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tANY TIME.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWe know what you are.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tA HEARTLESS MONSTER, OF COURSE.\n\t\t\t(incredibly evil)\n\t\tOH SAVE ME, ALEX, SAVE ME FROM MYSELF.\n\nARCADE laughs and it's not a sound you'd want to hear twice.\n\nTHE LIGHTBEAM\n\nclicks on, playing over their faces and analyzing their features.\n\nON SCREEN\n\nARCADE'S face spins away and computer-generated versions of Alex and Nick\nappear.  As before, they are suited up in video game armor, each carrying\na thrasher board.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tKISS REALITY GOODBYE.\n\nThe video versions of Nick and Alex hop onto their thrasher boards and the\nworld around them curls in upon itself.\n\nThe process is similar to what we've seen before, but even more extreme.\nLIGHTS and SOUNDS are pouring out of the ARCADE machine in almost\nunbearable intensities.  It seems as if the \"real\" world is going to be\nshaken apart.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(over noise)\n\t\tHold on!\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tSEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.\n\nANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT AND...\n\nAlex and Nick disappear from the real world completely. Their equipment,\ngloves and goggles, fall to the floor, empty.  They've been physically\nsucked inside the game!\n\nThe light from the screen dies down now and everything is oddly quiet.\n\nON SCREEN\n\nBOOM!  Suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them!\n\n(Note:  As we move through each level, video legends will appear on the\nscreen as title cards, enhancing the effect that we are actually inside a\nvideo game.)\n\nThe words \"LEVEL ONE -- BLOOD RED SKY\" flash across the screen and we...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAY\n\nAlex and Nick slam into the ground like twin meteors, splashing up water\nand muck.\n\nTHE RED SKY\n\ncrackles with LIGHTNING.  Smoke obscures everything. Alex and Nick pull\nthemselves up, a bit dazed.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(looking around)\n\t\tYou feel it?  It's different this time.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWe're actually inside, aren't we?\n\nAlex nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tOkay.\n\t\t\t(deep breath)\n\t\tGive us a kiss?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(after a moment)\n\t\tOne.  In case...\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tDon't even say it.\n\nNick leans over and gently kisses Alex on the lips.  It's over in a\nmoment, but he'll savor it the rest of his life.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tThanks.  Always wanted to do that.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tYeah, well I figure these are unusual\n\t\tcircumstances.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(grins)\n\t\tThat's what I was hoping you'd say.\n\nNick flips the visor on his helmet down and checks the digital read-out on\nhis CyberGlove.  When he speaks, his VOICE is filtered through a radio\nheadset.  Nick looks good in his armor, tough.  Hell, they both do.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tI'll take the lead and handle the physical\n\t\tthreats.  You watch the elapsed time and\n\t\tlook for exits.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tGot it.\n\nNick tosses his thrasher board down and it hovers above the water.  He\nsteps onto it, comfortable.  Alex does the same. She's a little shaky, but\nshe maintains her balance.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tYou steer by pivoting your back foot...\n\t\t\t(he demonstrates)\n\t\tOkay?\n\nNick turns, looking around.  The land seems identical in every direction.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhich way do you think Level Two is?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tYou've got the schematics, check.\n\nNick panics for a moment, patting his uniform, checking pockets.  He can't\nfind them.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tOh shit!  What if they didn't come with us?!\n\nHe stops.  Reaches into a pocket, and pulls out the schematics.  Breathes\na sigh of relief.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(looking at them)\n\t\tOkay.  It's West.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThe keys are supposed to be at the end of\n\t\teach level.  Once we get all the keys, we\n\t\tcan unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...\n\nShe looks at Nick, uncertain.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t...and then we go to the Final Level.\n\t\t\t(off her look)\n\t\tHey, don't worry about it.  It's a game.\n\t\tHow bad could it be?\n\nAlex glances at her wrist display.  The \"ELAPSED TIME\" bar is made up of\nten blocks of light stacked upon each other. The top block has\ndisappeared.  One tenth of their time is gone.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThe clock's already ticking.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tRight, then...\n\nNick leans forward and the board starts to float.  Alex does the same, and\nin seconds, they're gliding over the plains.\n\nFROM ABOVE,\n\nas we see their forms disappear in the smoke.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. LEVEL ONE, PLAINS -- LATER\n\nNick and Alex pull to a stop.\n\nA DOORWAY\n\nstands in the plains, seemingly leading to nowhere.  Nick reaches out and\nopens it.  It's just plains and empty space beyond...\n\n...but hanging from the top of the doorway is a golden key.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThere...\n\nShe reaches up and pulls it down.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tI don't get it.  This is supposed to be the\n\t\tend of the level, but it doesn't go anywhere.\n\nAlex puts her hand through the doorway and her hand disappears.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tIt only looks like it leads to nowhere.\n\nNick glances at his wrist display.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tAnd we've still got time left.  This was a\n\t\tpiece of cake.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tYeah, that's what worries me.\n\nShe steps through the doorway and disappears.  Nick follows.\n\nWe hold on the empty doorway.  Hold for a moment, and then...\n\nWe hear a distant, high-pitched RINGING.  It's grating, seeping inside our\nbrains and mucking around in there.  On the horizon there is a quick FLASH\nOF LIGHT.\n\nSomething is coming.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nThe words \"LEVEL TWO -- DEADLANDS\"\n\nEXT.  LEVEL TWO, SALT FLATS -- DAY\n\nAlex and Nick are cruising along salt flats.  Sporadic pools of water and\nstrange ROARING sounds in the mist.  So far so good. Nick glances at his\nwrist display.  His \"STRENGTH\" only has a few blocks left.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tHey, my strength's low.  Look out for\n\t\tFireflies.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThere...\n\nShe points North.  A small BALL OF LIGHT is streaking across the sky, just\nabove the watery plains.\n\nAlex and Nick swerve towards it, gaining ground.  As they near it, Nick\nswings out his hand, scooping the Firefly up. As soon as he touches it, it\nbursts like a bubble.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tShit...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tCheck your read-out.\n\nNick does.  His \"STRENGTH\" is back to normal again.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tYou're right.  It worked.\n\nNick and Alex slow their boards to a stop, stepping off them.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tThere's another...\n\nShe sweeps left and scoops the second Firefly out of the sky.  Off in the\ndistance we can hear that RINGING again, just at the edge of our vision.\nAlex and Nick don't hear it yet.\n\nNick is glancing down at his schematic of Level Two.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tAccording to this, the doorway should be\n\t\tsomewhere around here...\n\nTHEIR P.O.V.\n\nThe salt flats have gradually diminished, replaced by more and more water.\nAhead of them, there's no longer anything solid to stand on...just water,\nmuck, and strange reeds poking through the mist.\n\nAlex's wrist display begins to BEEP.  She glances down.\n\nWRIST DISPLAY\n\nOnly one block of time remains and it's pulsing on and off. The RINGING is\na little louder now.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(worried)\n\t\tOur time's up.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhat?!  There's nothing here!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tLook around...\n\nThe two of them stumble through the water, not even sure of what they're\nlooking for.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(starting to panic)\n\t\tI don't see the doorway!\n\nAlex and Nick's wrist displays are BEEPING like crazy now. The beeps come\ncloser and closer until they meld into one piercing high-pitched TONE.\n\nJUST THEN,\n\nthe RINGING turns into the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer.  A burst of\nlight on the horizon shatters the sky.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhat the fuck is that?!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tScreamer.\n\nALEX\n\nplunges into the marsh-like water, waist-high, and it's then that she sees\na glow emanating from beneath the water. She dives forward...\n\nBENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE BRACKISH WATER\n\nAlex swims towards the GLOW.  Ahead of her, the depths drop off sharply,\nperhaps some hundred feet or so.\n\nHER P.O.V.\n\nShe can just make out a doorway...down, down, down...\n\nTHE SURFACE\n\nAlex bursts up from the water, gulping in breaths of air. Nick is nearby.\n\nTHE WORLD\n\nis beginning is vibrate now, heralding the Screamer.  The SHRIEK is\nunbearable.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tNick!  It's beneath the water!  We have to\n\t\tswim!\n\nNick stumbles in up to his neck.  He can see the GLOW now too.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(incredulous)\n\t\tWe can't reach that!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(over the noise)\n\t\tWe don't have a choice!\n\nAlex dives beneath the surface again.\n\nNick glances back towards the horizon and gets one fleeting glimpse of...\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nA nightmare creation rocketing in from the East... That's it for Nick.  He\ndives, terrified.\n\nUNDERWATER,\n\nNick follows Alex into the shadowy depths.  He swims madly, but the GLOW\nseems impossibly far away.  Even under water, the Apocalyptic sound of the\nScreamer can be heard.\n\nNICK\n\npeddles his arms and legs furiously.  Down, down, down...\n\nHe knows that they'll never have enough air to make it back to the\nsurface.\n\nTHE GLOW\n\nis more clearly distinguished now.  It's a DOORWAY.  And set in its side\nis a golden key.  Alex reaches it.  She grabs the key and turns to see how\nfar behind Nick is...\n\nNICK\n\ndoubles his efforts, but his lungs are straining...\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nhas plunged into the water above, shooting towards Nick like a torpedo, a\nswirling jet-stream of bubbles trailing around it.\n\nNick panics, and what little air he has left escapes him.\n\nAlex is reaching for Nick...\n\nNick is blacking out, one last lunge at the doorway...\n\nThe Screamer is there now.  No time.\n\nThe words \"LEVEL THREE -- THE BLUE DESERT\" flash across the screen and\nwe...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- DAY\n\nAlex and Nick fall from the sky onto the dunes.  They lie there a moment,\ngasping for breath.  They're an odd sight, two people soaked from head to\ntoe, dropped in the middle of a bone-dry desert...\n\n...and a blue one at that.  There's an eerie stillness about this Level,\neven the clouds above are frozen. Nothing lives here now, and nothing ever\nwill.\n\nNick coughs, sucking in air.\n\nAlex rises halfway, pulling up her visor.  She stares at the golden key\nwhich she clutches in her hand.  Her wet hair hangs about her face in\nstrings and she shivers.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(looking at the key)\n\t\tSo that's what we almost died for?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tOne of them, anyway...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tDid you see it?  The Screamer?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(looking away)\n\t\tI don't want to talk about it.\n\nNick glances at his wrist display.\n\nDISPLAY\n\nEven as he watches, the first of the ten \"TIME ELAPSED\" blocks blinks\naway.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t\t(exhausted)\n\t\tChrist...no time...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(rising)\n\t\tThere never is.\n\nNick heaves himself up into a standing position and looks around.  They\nare on the top of a massive dune.\n\nTHEIR THRASHER BOARDS\n\nnow looks like snowboards.  It doesn't take Nick long to figure out what\nto do.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWe can take the dunes down like a ski slope.\n\t\tPretend you're on a snowboard.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(snapping down her visor)\n\t\tNever been on a snowboard.\n\nNick steps on the board and edges it over the crest of the dune.  He\nbegins to slide down, slowly picking up speed.\n\nA SERIES OF SHOTS...\n\n...as Alex and Nick negotiate the dunes.  They glide over the sand\ngracefully, cutting back left and right to keep their speed down, sweeping\nin wide arcs...\n\nUnder any other circumstances, they'd be having the time of their lives.\nAlex has adjusted to the environment quickly, at ease of the\nThrasherboard.\n\nLATER --\n\nThe dunes gradually level out.  Alex and Nick slow to a stop.\nAlex flips up her visor.  Her face is covered with grime now, hardened.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tI guess we're walking from here on out.\n\nThey pick up their boards and walk.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- LATER\n\nAlex and Nick have been walking for a long time.  Nick is silent, just\nstaring straight ahead at the endless sand. He looks wasted.  Zoned out.\nHis face is beaded with sweat.\n\nOnce again, their wrist displays begin to BEEP.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(almost a whisper)\n\t\tTime's up.\n\nNick starts to LAUGH, sinking to his knees.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWe're fucked.  That's it.\n\nAlex pulls on Nick's arm, forcing him to his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tGet up, Nick...\n\nNick isn't going anywhere fast.  Alex tries to drag him forward, but she\nslips in the sand.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tGET UP!!!\n\nAnd then, from off in the distance...\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(far away)\n\t\tAlex...help me...\n\nAlex turns.  She focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck.  She taps a\ncontrol on her helmet and her view is magnified.\n\nALEX'S P.O.V.\n\nBenz is up ahead. buried up to his waist in the blue sand and sinking\nquickly.  He waves his hands for help. and clutched in one of them is the\nsecond key.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tIt's Benz!!!\n\nAlex breaks into a run, and after a moment, Nick follows. He's walking,\nthough...in no hurry to reach Benz.\n\nON BENZ\n\nThe desert is swallowing him up.  Only his head and arms remain.  He's in\na state of total panic.\n\n\t\t\t\tBENZ\n\t\t\t(terrified)\n\t\tGet me out of here!  Oh God!!!\n\nALEX\n\nis running at top speed, half-stumbling across the dunes. Her\nwrist-display is BEEPING furiously.\n\nBENZ\n\nHis head starts to disappear beneath the sand and his cries are choked\noff.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tBenz!\n\nAlex reaches the spot and now, only Benz' clutched fist remains.  The hand\nopens and the gold key falls onto the sand.\n\nAlex DIVES for Benz' hand, but it sinks just before she can reach it.  She\nSCREAMS and claws at the sand, trying to find him.  She digs and digs, but\nall she finds is more sand.  With each second she becomes more frantic.\n\nFinally Alex stops, noticing the key and idly picking it up.\n\nTHE SAND\n\naround Alex ERUPTS and BONES come flying up into the air, Benz' bones!\n\nAlex SCREAMS.  The bones rain down around her in bloody fragments.  It's\nas if the Earth has chewed Benz up and spit out the nasty bits.\n\nAt that very moment, the BEEPS on her wrist-display meld into the single\ntone heralding...\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nAs if on cue, it enters Level Two, breaking the Sound Barrier.\n\nON NICK\n\nAs he stands some hundred feet away, oblivious to everything.  We can hear\nAlex SCREAMING, but the sound is muffled, distant.  Nick is staring down\nat his feet at an area where the sand has hardened like glass.  Inside the\nsand/glass, Nick can make out fractals.  He smiles.\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nstreaks across the sky towards them, blowing up a maelstrom of sand as it\ncrosses the dunes...\n\nON ALEX\n\nas she sees that a rabbit hole of sorts has been created where the bones\nwere ejected.  Actually, not a rabbit hole, but a circular, pulsing mouth\nwith razor sharp teeth.  Alex realizes, much to her horror, that this is\nthe doorway to Level Three!\n\nAlex shouts at Nick, trying to break the spell over him.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tRun!  RUN!!!\n\nBut the Screamer is bearing down on him, like a heat-seeking missile...\n\nON NICK\n\nas he watches the fractals.  ARCADE'S face appears in the mirrored sand,\nsmiling back at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tGOODBYE, NICK.\n\nAt the last possible moment, Nick seems to wake from his trance.  He sees\nAlex, hears her, then turns.  He has about one fear-wrought second to\nrealize that the Screamer has reached him when...\n\nWHAM!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe Screamer SLAMS into Nick at about 200 miles per hour. Nick, literally,\nliquefies.  The human body is 95% water, and Nick EXPLODES like a water\nballoon on high impact, blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes,\nAlex, and everything for a good fifty yards.\n\nAlex is frozen with terror.  You remember your worst childhood nightmare\nmonster?  The one you'd see in your room at night as your brain cooked\nwith fever?  Too paralyzed to call out for Mom?  Well that's the Screamer.\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nstands where Nick used to be (a red mess on the blue sand now).  Black as\nnight.  Like living, roiling lava. Smoking, charged RED EYES.  One third\ndemon, one third Balrog, and one third rotting corpse.  Clad in chains and\nsamurai armor, CLINKING as it moves.  It rear back its head, opens a\nfanged mouth, and lets loose a ROAR designed to shake the stars from the\nsky.\n\nThen it focuses it's eyes on Alex.  And it charges.\n\nALEX\n\nunfreezes.  She's got seconds to make up her mind, the doorway/mouth or\nthe Screamer.  It's really no choice at all.  Alex turns and dives\nstraight down into the pulsing mouth.\n\nThe jaws of the rabbit hole SNAP shut around her.  Darkness consumes\neverything.\n\nThese words appear on screen, \"LEVEL THREE -- TOWER OF GHOSTS\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

The rocks looks sharp as\nrazors.\n\nAs we will discover, the cliff face is also composed of skulls, old and\nblackened, set inside the rock.\n\nWe hear a HUMMING and Alex \"fades in\", appearing on the side of the cliff\nface.  Immediately she starts to fall, realizes where she is, and hugs the\ncliff for dear life. Rock shards crumble away beneath her feet.  Alex\nlooks down ...\n\nBig mistake.\n\nShe hugs the cliff face tighter, tears and grime streaking her face. She's\nalone now and she knows it.  She looks up ...\n\nIt's a long way to go.\n\nAlex reaches a hand upward.  Ouch!  The rock's hot.  She jerks her hand\nback and almost loses her perch.\n\nHER HAND\n\nHer gloves are smoking and singed.\n\nAlex starts to cry freely now.

This time\na wooden doorway is standing directly in front of her, the golden key\nsticking out of the lock.\n\nAs Alex reaches for it, the Screamer enters Level Four. Alex slowly opens\nthe door.\n\n\t\t\t\tALBERT'S VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\tYou can get a free life on Level Four, but\n\t\tyou have to wait for the last possible\n\t\tinstant...\n\nAlex turns and waits calmly for the Screamer.\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nis a black speck on the horizon, then a bullet, then a nightmarish face\nbearing down on her...\n\nIT'S JAWS\n\nflare open to engulf her.\n\nAlex doesn't flinch at all.  And at the last possible second before\nimpact...\n\nBLINK!  A stylized figure appears on her wrist-display next to the \"TIME\nELAPSED\" meter.  Beneath the figure it says \"FREE LIFE\".\n\nAlex feels the breath of the Screamer on her face and falls back through\nthe doorway...\n\n\"LEVEL SIX -- SHOCK CORRIDOR\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.

It has no doors or windows, and up ahead, it\nbranches off to the right and the left.\n\nAlex turns and looks behind her.  The doorway she came through is gone\nnow.  A mirrored wall stands in its place, with her own reflection staring\nback at her.\n\nTHE REFLECTION\n\nThere are subtle changes.  They shouldn't be noticeable at first, but the\nreflection seems somehow more threatening.\n\nAlex starts down the hall, her reflection keeping pace with her.  Up\nahead, she hears a BUZZING noise, drawing closer.\n\nLIGHT flickers in the hallway to the left, presumably whatever it is\nthat's BUZZING.  Suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor,\nturns the corner and heads down the hallway towards Alex.\n\nThe light hits her feet and SPARKS fly.  Alex SCREAMS and is thrown back\nagainst the wall, shocked.  The streak of light continues past her and\ndisappears into the mirror at the hall's end.  It's like a moving\nelectrical pulse.\n\nALEX\n\nShe's been given a pretty good jolt.  Her hands shake for a moment, an\nafter-seizure of sorts, and she stands...\n\nHER MIRRORED REFLECTION\n\nis watching her, arms crossed.  This wouldn't be a problem were it not for\nthe fact that Alex currently doesn't have her arms crossed!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(to her reflection)\n\t\tFuck you.\n\nThe reflection grins and its/her eyes GLOW with fractals.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX REFLECTION\n\t\t\t(in ARCADE'S voice)\n\t\tANY TIME, BITCH.\n\nSpooked, Alex continues down the hallway, reaching the end and turning\nleft...\n\nNEW CORRIDOR\n\nAlex moves quicker now, glancing left as her reflection follows.\n\nBUZZZZZ!!!  Here comes another streak of light, rushing in along the floor\nfrom a side corridor...\n\nAlex LEAPS over it, and it passes harmlessly under her. Now she's getting\nthe hang of it.  She starts forward again.\n\nBUZZZZZ!!!  Here come two at a time from opposite directions...\n\nAlex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in the\npath of the second.  Then she jumps back to the right again...\n\nTHE TWO STREAKS\n\npass by, zipping away from each other.\n\nANOTHER CORRIDOR\n\nThe pace quickens, with Alex racing down the corridors. She turns corner\nafter corner.  It's become a virtual maze.\n\nWe cut back to Alex's \"STRENGTH\" and \"TIME ELAPSED\" meters again and\nagain.  Both are shrinking away to nothing.\n\nAnd all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growing\nincreasingly more nightmarish in appearance.  As Alex tires, the\nreflection seems to gain more strength.\n\nBUZZZZZ!!!  BUZZZZZ!!!  The streaks are shooting towards her with more\nfrequency, and now they're racing along the walls too.  Alex is jumping\nleft and right, with SPARKS exploding around her.\n\nTHE REFLECTION\n\nseems to be metamorphosizing.  Each time we see it/her, she looks a little\ndifferent.  What's gradually happening (as time elapses) is that Alex's\nreflection is turning into The Screamer.\n\nAlex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her.  The\ncorridors are filled with a constant BUZZING and flickering of light.\nSPARKS fly and Alex is shocked over and over.\n\nShe stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing a\nstreak.  It cuts past her face, centimeters away.\n\nBEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  Off goes her wrist display!  Alex is up and running\nnow, desperate.\n\nWe cut faster and faster  Alex running, the streaks of light, the\nreflection until...\n\nEND CORRIDOR\n\nShe's back where she started.  And the corridor dead-ends in a mirrored\nwall...\n\nBEHIND ALEX,\n\nDozens of light streaks are dogging her heels, literally just behind her.\nThey're so thick that she couldn't possibly leap over all of them.\nSeconds before they reach her.\n\nAHEAD OF ALEX,\n\nthe mirror shows her own reflection, rushing closer.  Her wrist display\nindicates that time is up with a prolonged BEEP and her own reflection\nvanishes.  It's the Screamer in her reflection's place.  Only it's\nrocketing towards her in the mirror.  It's in front of her this time,\ninstead of behind her.\n\nRock and a fucking hard place.  Light streaks or Screamers?\n\nIt's really no choice at all.  Her guts says \"Screamer\".\n\nAlex leaps and SMASHES into the mirror at full speed.  The world is filled\nwith SHATTERING GLASS and a shower of infinite reflections and then we...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  LEVEL SEVEN, PIER -- DAY\n\nThe sound of SHATTERING GLASS carried through as Alex EXPLODES out of the\nsky.  And it's the sky itself that seems to be shattering...\n\nTitle reads \"LEVEL SEVEN -- SEA OF DARKNESS\"\n\nALEX\n\ncontinues her fall.  She lands hard.  No blue desert sand to cushion her\nhere.  It takes her a moment to rise...\n\nAlex is on a slat-board pier extending out into a sea of black water.  The\nshore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier.  Storms\nclouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on the\nopen sea, you know what it looks like...\n\n...the and of the world.  A strange and scary yellow/green sky presses\ndown on us.  It's a hurricane sky.  The calm before the storm.\n\nON THE HORIZON,\n\nTWO CITIES can be seen.  Techno-cityscapes, angular and metallic-looking,\ntowers jutting up from the sea like knives.\n\nAT THE END OF THE PIERS\n\nare two boats.  Standing in them are two pale-faced, cloaked FIGURES.\nLike Charon, the boatman on the river Styx.\n\nSomewhere off in the distance, the RINGING can be distinctly heard now.\nBut Alex is preoccupied now.  As she moves down the pier, recognition\ndawns on her.\n\nIt's Laurie and Stilts.  They are dressed completely in black, hair\nslicked back and eyes empty.  White-faced Gothic harlequins.  Each is\nholding a wooden staff, staring into space.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tGuys!  Oh my God...\n\nAlex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitement\nfades.  A chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like a\nmetronome, lulling the world into stillness.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(unsure)\n\t\tLaurie?  Stilts?\n\nNeither of them acknowledges Alex with their eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\t\t(like ARCADE)\n\t\tYou may ask one of us a question.\n\t\tOne tells the truth, and the other lies.\n\t\tWho you ask, remains your discretion.\n\t\tBut if the answer is wrong,\n\t\tthe questioner dies.\n\nLaurie motions to the techno-cities behind her.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\t\t(like ARCADE)\n\t\tOne of these cities, is the place you seek.\n\t\tThe Teller of Truths will take you there.\n\t\tBut the City of Lies, is dark and bleak.\n\t\tAnd death is certain if you enter, beware.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tI am The Liar.  Where should I take you?\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tI am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take\n\t\tyou?\n\nAlex stares at them a moment, utterly confused.  The sky above darkens,\nand the wind picks up.  She looks to the horizon, from one city to\nanother, then back at her friends.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(horrified)\n\t\tWhat did he do to you?\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tIs that your question?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(realizing)\n\t\tWait!  No!  That's not it!\n\nBEEP! BEEP! BEEP!  Alex doesn't even need to look at her wrist display\nanymore.  She begins to pace on the end of the pier, nervously glancing at\nthe horizon.  And yes, there's the FLASH followed by the SHRIEK/SONIC\nBOOM.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(to herself)\n\t\tThink!  I want to go to the City of Truth,\n\t\tand the Truth Teller is from there...but\n\t\twhich one is which?  The liar...think!\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tYou have no time.  What is your question?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(snapping back)\n\t\tI'm thinking!\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tYou have no time.\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nis visible now, arms opening to engulf Alex.  Talk about pressure.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(she stops pacing)\n\t\tThe liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar...\n\nAlex rushes over to Stilts.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tLiar.  Did you come from the city on the\n\t\tleft, or the city on the right?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tI came from the city on the left.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(grins)\n\t\tBut you always lie, so you didn't come from\n\t\tthere.  That means the city on the left must\n\t\tbe the City of Truth.\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nhas reached the pier now, rocketing over the wooden slats and shaking the\nentire structure...\n\nAlex turns to Laurie.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(quickly)\n\t\tTake me to the city on the left!\n\nLaurie nods and steps aside, making room for Alex to climb into the boat.\nShe does and...\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\ndissipates just before it reaches Alex.  It turns into mist and vanishes,\nthe HOWL lingering as an echo long after the Screamer itself has gone.\n\nAt once, the boat begins to glide through the water, away from the pier.\nAlex gets a last glimpse of Stilts standing in his boat, diminishing as\nAlex and Laurie move away from him.  He looks like the loneliest person in\nthe world.\n\n\"LEVEL EIGHT -- CITY OF TRUTH\"\n\nEXT. LEVEL SEVEN, OPEN SEA -- LATER\n\nAs Alex and Laurie near the city, its features become more apparent.  It\nis truly a Necropolis, black and angular. It's a shadow on the sunset\nhorizon, empty of all life and looming above them.\n\nJust then, Alex hears a tiny VOICE.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t(weak)\n\t\tHelp...help me...\n\nA SMALL FIGURE\n\nbobs in the water about fifty yards in front of them.  It waves it's hands\nfrantically, sinking below the water's surface, then rising once again.\nIt's a little BOY.\n\nAlex's boat is going to pass right by the boy.  She grabs hold of the\ngunwale and reaches out for him...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tGrab my hand!\n\nTheir hands lock and Alex YANKS the boy out of the water as the boat\ncruises by.\n\nTHE BOY\n\ncan't be more than seven or eight.  Small and frail-looking, he shivers in\nher arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\t\t(terrified)\n\t\tWhere are we?\n\nJust then the boat comes to a CRASHING stop, slamming into the black rocks\nwhich the city rests on.  Alex and the boy are violently pitched forward\nand out of the boat.\n\nThey land roughly on a beach of black gravel.  Alex turns.\n\nLAURIE\n\nstands in the boat.  In an instant, night has fallen.  She is a silhouette\nin the moonlight.\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\t\t(in a voice like Death)\n\t\tThe City of Truth.\n\nAnd Laurie literally fades before their eyes.  In her place, is a small\ngolden key.\n\nAlex snatches up the key.  Alex turns back to the boy and...\n\nINT. LEVEL EIGHT, CONCRETE WASTELAND -- NIGHT\n\n...Alex and the boy are now standing on the top of a concrete incline.  It\nextends downward into a system of tunnels and viaducts.  The RINGING\nstarts immediately, followed by the FLASH on the horizon.  Time's already\nup. The little boy reaches for Alex's hand, frightened.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tHow did you get here?  Did you play the\n\t\tgame?!\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\tYes...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThought so.\n\nAlex removes pulls her Thrasher board from her back and drops it on the\nlip of the incline.  There's a FLASH and the board has changes into a\nmotorcycle.  A sleek black one.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tCan you hang onto my back?\n\nThe little boy nods.  He knows that Alex is his only chance of getting out\nof here.  Nevertheless, we can tell that he's terrified.  Alex kneels down\nnext to him.  The wind around them has picked up and the RINGING\nincreases.  High-pitched, stabbing into our brains.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(over noise)\n\t\tThere's a monster here.  We have to kill it\n\t\tbefore we can leave.  That's what we have\n\t\tto do.  I know it's scary, but I won't let\n\t\tanything happen to you.  Okay?\n\nThe boy nods again.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\tThen we'll go home?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tThen we'll go home.\n\nAlex's wrist display starts BEEPING and...BOOM!  The RINGING is replaced\nby the Screamer's shriek.  In the distance, the Screamer is a fireball\nspiraling towards the city.\n\nAlex jumps on the motorcycle and pulls the boy up.  He crawls behind her\nand hugs her back tightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(pulling down her visor)\n\t\tHere goes everything.\n\nShe fingers the throttle and the cycle ROARS to life.  It rockets off the\nincline and down into the tunnels.\n\nA SERIES OF SHOTS\n\nas Alex maneuvers the cycle through a forest of concrete. It's a harrowing\nride, as her headlight reveals little of what's up ahead.  Somewhere above\nthe tunnels, the Screamer has arrived.  In the course of the chase, it's\nSHRIEK will become louder and louder as it draws closer, locating Alex.\n\nANOTHER CYCLE\n\nappears out of side tunnels and a chase is on.  The RIDER is dressed in\nblack with glowing death's head masks.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\t\t(to Alex)\n\t\tDark Riders!  If they touch us, we're dead!\n\nThe tunnels get narrower and narrower, as Alex keeps pushing the limit off\nthe bike.\n\nRider #1 tries to cut Alex off, charging forward and ramming her bike...\n\nAlex almost loses it, but finds balance once again, sweeping left and up\nthe side of a circular tunnel...\n\nRIDER #1\n\nbites it.  His cycle careens into the wall and EXPLODES in a shower of\nGREEN LIGHT.  The death's head tumbles away, spinning end over end.  The\nScreamer BLASTS over the remains of the Rider, having entered the tunnels.\n\nTWO MORE RIDERS APPEARS\n\ngaining on Alex.  Rider #2 pulls a staff from his back and thrusts it\nforward like a lance.  CHINK!  The staff hits Alex's rear wheel, nearly\nthrowing her.  The rider pulls off a gloved and reaches a glowing,\nskeletal hand towards them.  Death touch.  The boy SCREAMS in terror.\n\nUP AHEAD,\n\na wall is rushing to meet them.  Alex jams the breaks and slides/skids\nsideways, cutting right at the last possible moment...\n\nWHAM!!!  Rider #2 slams into the end wall, not able to negotiate the turn.\nAnother EXPLOSION of green and the second death's head comes tumbling\naway.\n\nAlex looks back.  There should be one Rider left, only now their are\nthree!  Alex guns the bike and cuts sharply to the right...\n\nNEW TUNNEL --\n\nAlex SCREECHES to a stop, having found yet another fork. The tunnel\nbranches off into two directions.  Two neon signs with arrows point in\nopposite directions.\n\nNEON SIGNS\n\nThey read, \"THIS WAY\" and \"THAT WAY\". Alex checks her wrist display.  Not\nmuch time left.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWhich way?\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tThat way.\n\nAlex backs up the cycle and heads down the tunnel marked \"THIS WAY\"\ninstead.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tSorry.\n\nTHE TUNNEL\n\nIt narrows almost immediately.  Alex hears a ROAR, glances behind her, and\nsees four death's head RIDERS on her tail. She makes another turn...\n\nAHEAD,\n\nis a crumbling brick wall with the words \"WRONG WAY\" painted in blood-red.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tIt's the wrong way!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(over the noise)\n\t\tIn this world, wrong is right!\n\nSUDDENLY,\n\nthe tunnel behind them flares with light, shaking like an earthquake.  The\nScreamer has found them.\n\nA KEY\n\nhangs out from the wall, sort of like the brass ring on a merry-go-round.\nAlex snags it as she sweeps by.\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nrockets around the corner, twisting down the narrow tunnel.\n\nAlex grinds the motorcycle forward for all it's worth, and the Screamer is\nliterally breathing down her neck.  She turns corner after corner, faster\nand faster, scraping the bike into the scum-covered walls and shooting out\nshowers of SPARKS.  If she takes one second too long to negotiate a turn,\npauses for even an instant, the Screamer will be on them...\n\nA CLAWED HAND\n\nlashes out and tears away the cycle's tail-pipe.  Another hand takes out a\nchunk of the seat...\n\nTHE BOY\n\nis WAILING, curling low to avoid the Screamer's claws...\n\nAHEAD,\n\nthe tunnel narrows to a dead-end.  Alex and the Screamer are on a\ncollision course.  A hundred miles an hour and gaining...\n\nThe Screamer LASHES out again, gouging a bloody gash in Alex's shoulder\nand cutting clear through her armor.  It's claws sink into her flesh,\nlatching on.  Alex CRIES OUT in pain, her face contorted into a mask of\nagony and fear. She pulls out a knife with her left hand a stabs blindly\ninto the monster...\n\nTHE SCREAMER\n\nLURCHES forward onto the motorcycle and opens its jaws wide.  Black saliva\nand ooze flow from it's mouth splashing over Alex's shoulder's and neck.\nIt's going to bite her head off.  It's going to...\n\nAlex and the Screamer SLAM into the dead-end and a spectacular fireball of\nGREEN LIGHT consumes the screen.\n\n\"LEVEL NINE -- THE GHETTO OF GREED\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT. LEVEL NINE, CRUMBLING HONG KONG GHETTO -- NIGHT\n\nWe're on a dark, crowded street lined by decrepit tenements which are\ncaving in upon themselves.\n\nThere is a flash of GREEN LIGHT.  Alex and the boy suddenly appear on the\nstreet in a whirlwind of papers, sans motorcycle, but still sliding\nforward at a good thirty miles an hour.  Were it not for their armor,\nthey'd be torn to shreds.  They skid to a stop under a sputtering\nstreetlight.\n\nAlex and the boy are still SCREAMING.  Anguish is the word for Alex.  She\nclutches her shoulder which is gushing blood and stumbles to her feet.\n\nBEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!!!!!!\n\nIt's her fucking wrist display again and TIME-IS-FUCKING-UP!\n\nAlex SCREAMS, pushed to the absolute breaking point.\n\nBOOM!  Once again the streets begin to vibrate as the Screamer enters the\nlevel.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\tIt's here!!!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(manic)\n\t\tOh God...oh god...\n\nTHE STREETS --\n\nImpoverished PEOPLE bustle back and forth everywhere. Alex grabs the boy's\nhand and all but drags him down the darkened streets.  It becomes a mad,\nblind dash through Hell.  She SMASHES into peddlers, stalls, tripping over\nor knocking down everything in her path...\n\nThe SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer overwhelms everything else.  With\neach level, it's gotten louder and louder. Wind is tearing down the\nstreets...\n\nA BLACK-CLAD FIGURE\n\nspins out of the shadows, landing in front of them.  It's a Ninja, two\nswords spinning in its hands.\n\nInstinctively, Alex reaches to her side, and sure enough, there's a gun\nthere now.  She unholsters it and FIRES in a blind panic.\n\nBLAM!  Down goes the Ninja #1, spouting blood from its chest.\n\nTHWUNK!  THWUNK!!!  Two throwing stars imbed themselves into Alex's\nchest-plate...\n\n...and Jesus-fucking-Christ, Ninjas are crawling out of the wood-work!\nThey dive out of the shadows, weapons spinning and glistening in the\nmoonlight.  Throwing stars are flying like hail now, CLINKING! into the\nconcrete walls behind Alex and the boy...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tShit!!!\n\nALEX\n\nspins around, shooting indiscriminately into the crowd of bodies.  BLAM!\nBLAM!  BLAM!  Ninjas fall right and left, but in no time, twice as many\nmove in to take their place. They're like the hornet's nest of Alien\nmonsters, black-clad shadows creeping towards them.\n\nA shot hits the streetlight above, casting a sputtering, strobing light\nover the whole scene and adding to the chaos.\n\nThe world is shaking apart.  It's the end of everything. It's flashes of\nlight and noise, nightmares and blood, chaos heaped on chaos...\n\nAlex FIRES her gun again and again and again...\n\n...and in the midst of this mess, here comes the Screamer again.  It\nshoots down the street like a guided missile.\n\nAlex stumbles.  The Boy drags at her arm, trying to pull her up...\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE BOY\n\t\tCome on!!!\n\nAlex is crying, hysterical.  She turns and sees the Screamer bearing down\non her, just like Nick did before her was ripped to shreds.\n\nThe boy is yelling something.  Alex focuses...\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE BOY\n\t\tThe doorway!  It's here!!!\n\nTHE BOY\n\nis pulling back a manhole cover.  BLUE LIGHT  issues up from below.\nBefore Alex can stop him, the boy disappears down the hole.\n\nAlex has one last chance.  She throws herself at the hole even as the\nScreamer reaches her.  A clawed hand wraps around her leg.  Alex FIRES\ninto the hand.  The hand is severed!  She's falling!  Falling into\ndarkness...\n\n\"LEVEL TEN -- BAD BRAINS\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  LEVEL TEN, TECHNO-SKYSCRAPER -- NIGHT\n\nON ALEX AND THE BOY\n\nas they blink into existence on this level.  Alex rises, shaking badly.\nHer armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's\nimpossible to tell who's blood, though.  She looks like she's just walked\nout of a slaughter-house.\n\nA bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.  Alex turns...\n\nARCADE'S BRAIN\n\nlooms over her, all glass and black steel.  It reaches into the sky and\nkeeps on going.  Massive.  Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and down\nit, BUZZING.  And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely\nappears to be alive.\n\nTWO GLASS DOORS\n\nswing open in invitation.  A red carpet rolls out from within the\nbuilding, rolling by itself.  Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls\ncompletely, ending just at Alex's feet.\n\nAbove the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time,\n\"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE\".  Fucking-A.\n\nAlex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.  It's all she can do anymore.\n\nTHE BOY\n\nlooks up at Alex, frightened.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\tWe have to go in there, don't we?\n\nAlex nods.  She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet\ntowards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain.\n\nINT.  LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHT\n\nInside, the lobby is a cacophony of LIGHT and SOUND.  We hear HUNDREDS OF\nVOICES at once...whispering...fading in and out...  It's like channels\nbeing changed.  A snippet of an opera here, maybe Bugs Bunny's voice\nthere...RAP MUSIC, COUNTRY MUSIC, a woman in the throes of orgasm, Nazis\nscreaming \"HEIL HITLER!\", anything and everything.\n\nSIGNS BLINK ON AND OFF...\n\nCatchy phrases like, \"THIS IS MY BRAIN AND WELCOME TO IT\", and \"I THINK,\nTHEREFORE, I'M FUCKED\" flash before us.\n\nT.V. MONITORS\n\nare everywhere, displaying an endless array of STATIC.  And now the\nmonitors are displaying FRACTALS.  Every single one of them.  We hear the\nCELLOS, like an orchestra tuning up.\n\nALEX\n\nthrows her hands over her ears as the SOUNDS become unbearable.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(top of her lungs)\n\t\tSHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nShe pulls out her gun at FIRES into the SOUNDS and IMAGES. Shooting the\nfuck out of everything.  Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and...\n\n...just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blink\noff, and it's dark once again.\n\nINT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM --\n\nA SPOTLIGHT\n\ncomes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything else\nis dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go on\nforever.\n\nMORE LIGHTS\n\ncome on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends.\nThey're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit in\nrows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell.\n\nAnd now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice.\nA frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is very\nunusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it had\njust pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'S\nheart.\n\nAlex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved\ninto the ice.\n\nAlex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine golden\nkeys are attached.  Removing the keys, Alex begins to fit them\ntogether...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a\nsingle, greater key.\n\nTHE KEY\n\nAlex fits it into the keyhole and turns it.\n\nTHE CASE OF ICE\n\nsplits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. Inside, Greg is\nfrozen still, clutching the sword.  Alex pulls the sword out of his stiff\ngrip, lifting it up.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(looking around)\n\t\tOkay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you?\n\nNo answer.  Alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tWhere are you, damnit?!\n\nHer voice echoes in the cavernous room.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE (O.S.)\n\t\tRIGHT HERE, BITCH.\n\nAlex spins around and...\n\nTHE BOY\n\nstands before her.  He grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light.\nWe can hear him BREATHING now, just like before.  Just like the game.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(stunned)\n\t\tYou...you're ARCADE?  But the donor...\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE/BOY\n\t\t...WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR OLD BOY.  YOU SEE,\n\t\tMOMMY USED TO BEAT ME.  MOMMY THREW ME DOWN\n\t\tA FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEN I WENT TO SLEEP\n\t\tFOR A LONG, LONG TIME, AND WHEN I WOKE UP,\n\t\tI WAS HERE, AND I WASN'T ME ANYMORE...\n\t\t\t(shivers)\n\t\t...AND I FUCKED MOMMY UP GOOD...\n\nARCADE begins to change, shaking and ROARING as something black and\ninsect-like bursts out of the boy's skin.  It claws at its face, ripping\nthe flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath.\n\nNothing could have prepared Alex for this.  It/ARCADE rises above her and\nit takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming.  Somehow, Alex\nfinds a reserve of strength.\n\nAlex swings the sword and...\n\nARCADE SMASHES it aside.  It CLATTERS to the floor, useless.  But that's\nacademic now as a gnarled hand clamps around Alex's throat.\n\nARCADE lifts Alex into the air and SLAMS her against a wall, pinning her\nthere.  He thrusts his face into hers.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tYOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN\n\t\tTOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.  YOU\n\t\tSEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART\n\t\tFOR ME.  I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.  THOSE\n\t\tARE THE RULES.  BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT,\n\t\tI'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY\n\t\tPROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD.  THANK-YOU, ALEX.\n\t\tTHANK-YOU SO MUCH.\n\nARCADE slowly squeezes her throat and Alex chokes, gasping for air that\nisn't forthcoming.  Tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red.  She\ntries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't...\n\nHER P.O.V.\n\nas she sees the faces of her friends.  Frozen.  Unable to help.  Then the\nimages swirl and Alex begins to lose consciousness.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tYOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T\n\t\tBEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN.\n\nARCADE drops Alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags\nher across the floor...\n\nA DOORWAY\n\nstands in the darkness.  ARCADE rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness\nbeyond.  It's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality.\nIt sucks the air into it, light...everything.  It touches some sort of\nprimal fear. Gut instinct.  You don't ever want to go to this place. Ever.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tNo! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nShe twists madly, trying to pull away, but ARCADE is too strong.  He\nshoves her through the doorway.  Her hands briefly latch onto the\ndoorjamb.  ARCADE violently kicks her and her hands slip away.  They slip\nand she tumbles through.\n\nARCADE slams the door shut.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tGOODBYE, ALEX.  IT'S BEEN REAL.\n\nThese words appear on the screen, \"FINAL LEVEL -- THE REAL WORLD\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY\n\nAlex lands on the hallway floor, disoriented.  Somewhere, we can hear a\nclock TICKING.  But other than that the house is silent, in stark contrast\nto the storm of sounds a moment ago.\n\nTHE HOUSE\n\nlooks just like the dream/flashback we saw earlier. Everything is white.\nBright and dreamlike.  Hyper reality. Alex looks up and...\n\nANOTHER ALEX\n\nis sitting in a chair nearby, back straight, hands clasped in her lap.\nReserved.\n\n\t\t\t\tOTHER ALEX\n\t\tTime.  That's all I ever think about\n\t\tanymore.  It's like there's never enough of\n\t\tit, you know?\n\nThe other Alex vanishes.  Now the chair is empty.  Alex turns to look down\nthe long hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the open door.  A door\nwe've seen before.  The words fade in like phantoms...\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN (V.O.)\n\t\tSo where are you then?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX (V.O.)\n\t\tI'm in the past.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tNo ... oh no ...\n\nWith a building sense of dread, Alex moves towards that doorway.  She\nstops at the threshold, terrified.\n\nINT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY\n\nEverything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight\nstreaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.\nEverything looks perfect.\n\nWe turn with Alex.  Ever so slowly.  Over to the right and the entranceway\nof the bathroom.  Over to where her mother is...\n\n...seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOM\n\t\tHi, honey.\n\nHER MOTHER\n\nlooks beautiful.  Eyes sparkling.  Alive and vital.\n\nAlex can't believe what she's seeing.  Immediately, tears come to her eyes\nand her voice falters...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tMom?\n\t\t\t(uncomprehending)\n\t\tYou're alive...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOTHER\n\t\tOf course I am.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tBut I don't understand...\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOTHER\n\t\tI miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much\n\t\tto be with you...\n\nTears are running freely down Alex's face now.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOTHER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave.\n\t\tYou know that, don't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\tYes...but...how did you...\n\nHer mother looks ecstatic.  And now there are tears in her eyes.  Joy,\nreunion...it's unclear which.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOTHER\n\t\tMagic.  We'll be together again.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI know you don't believe in an afterlife,\n\t\tbut there is one.  Heaven is real.\n\nAlex looks around her.  It's all too much to take in.  Her mother.  Back\nin her own home.  Sunlight is streaming in, bathing everything around her\nin gold and the moment is crystallized.  A still-life.  Forever.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tIs...is that where we are?  Did I die?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOTHER\n\t\tNot yet, honey...\n\nHer mother stands and Alex sees that she is holding a gun...no, the gun,\nin her hands.  She raises at Alex.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX'S MOTHER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t...but I can fix that.\n\nAlex has no time to respond.  A still-born scream is frozen in her throat.\nA split-second of realization.  And then her mother FIRES the gun...\n\nCRACK!  The bullet hits Alex square in the forehead, snapping her head\nback as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward.  The world spins\nto a stop, like a record player running down.\n\nAlex is killed instantly.  Her body collapse, head thumping\nunceremoniously against the carpeted floor.\n\nHER EYES\n\nopen and fixed on infinity.  No life here.  Seems hard to believe that\nthere ever was.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT. LEVEL NINE, THE NIGHT ROOM --\n\nON ALEX'S FACE\n\nThere is no bullet-hole in her forehead, but her eyes are just as\nlifeless.\n\nTHE PEANUT GALLERY\n\nRow after row of frozen faces.  Are they aware that Alex has died?  Is\nthere consciousness inside those skulls?\n\nON ARCADE\n\nas he crouches over Alex's body.  A smile creeps across his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE\n\t\tOH ALEX.  SO SORRY.  BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,\n\t\tI'LL BRING YOU BACK IN THE GAME.  MAYBE\n\t\tI'LL EVEN GIVE YOU HEAVEN.\n\nHe laughs.\n\nALEX'S BODY\n\nbegins to decompose in front of us, skin sinking in and shriveling up.  In\nmoments, she's just a husk.\n\nARCADE rears back, and is about to turn away, when something catches his\neye.  He hears a tiny BEEPING.\n\nALEX'S WRIST MONITOR\n\nRemember the stylized symbol of a woman?  The one that said \"FREE LIFE\"\nbeneath it?  Well it disappears now.\n\nThere's a sudden FLASH behind ARCADE and he spins around..\n\nANOTHER ALEX\n\nis standing behind him. and she's got the heart/sword in her hands!\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tGuess what, ass-hole?  You forgot about my\n\t\tfree life!!!\n\nShe DIVES forward, thrusting the sword with all her might. It sinks into\nARCADE'S chest and she pushes further, burying it up to the hilt.\n\nARCADE lets loose the most terribly SCREAM we've ever heard.  It literally\nshakes world.\n\nTHE SWORD\n\nis glowing like molten lava.  The heart-shaped hilt burns into the\nmonster's chest, spreading crackling fire over his entire body.  His body\nis immersed fire now, vibrating like mad and suddenly...\n\n...ARCADE EXPLODES IN A FIREBALL OF GREEN LIGHT AND...\n\n...he's gone.  Like he never existed.  The sword drops to the floor, a\ngun-metal gray now.\n\nAlex stands there a moment, stunned, not quite willing to believe that\nshe's won.\n\nA NEON SIGN\n\nabove her drops down.  It flashes \"CONGRATULATIONS\" over and over again.\n\"CONGRATULATIONS\".\n\nALEX\n\nlooks down at herself.  She feels odd.  Something is happening.  She's\nfading out, as if she were a signal being lost.  Her image stutters,\nflickers and...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT\n\nAlex FLASHES back into the real world. And then one by one, so do the\nothers.\n\nIt's a glorious sight.  Each one is heralded by BUZZING STATIC, and then a\nrippling in space, an image stuttering in and...\n\nPOP!  POP!  POP!  One after another come FLASHING back in bursts of light!\nThere are dozens.  The Inferno is filled with them, like a flurry of\nflashbulbs going off.  Familiar faces and people we've never seen.  Benz,\nLaurie, Stilts, DeLoach...\n\nPOP!  And there's Nick!  And more, and still more!  Forty, fifty...  Just\nhow many people did ARCADE take?\n\nEveryone is grinning, crying, hugging one another.\n\nSPACE SHIMMERS\n\njust before Alex.  SOMEONE else is trying to fight their way back.  It's\nGreg.  He's blinking back into reality.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\t\t(crying)\n\t\tGreg!!!\n\nHe flickers for a moment, tentative...\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(fading in and out)\n\t\tAlex!  You did it!\n\n...and then he's back for good.  He wraps his arms around Alex, grabbing\nher so tight that it's almost painful.  Both of them are sobbing.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(in between kisses)\n\t\tYou did it...\n\nTogether, the two of them start towards the door, eager to leave this\nplace.\n\nIn groups of twos and threes, the others follow.\n\nEXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAWN\n\nOutside, light is just beginning to creep its way back into the world.\nAlex glances up and can't help but notice the streetlight fading out as\nthe sun returns.  She points and laughs.\n\nWE BEGIN TO RISE UP,\n\nas Nick and the others join them.  Everyone is laughing now.  It's\nuncontrollable.  This is positive.  Life affirming.  And hell, we should\nprobably wrap this thing up on that note.\n\nWe should...\n\n...but we won't.\n\nWE WATCH\n\nas a series of dissolves portray the crowd of people leaving, bit by bit,\nuntil only our original group is left.\n\nTHE GROUP\n\nas they make their way down the street and away from The Inferno.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tSo how did you do it, Alex?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tWell, it's a long story...\n\nAlex catches Nick's eye briefly, and he smiles.  Whatever happened between\nthem is over now.  Friends again.\n\nSuddenly Alex stops in her tracks, a look of concern washing over her\nface.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICK\n\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tI just thought of something.  If we came\n\t\tback from the game...\n\t\t\t(turning to Nick)\n\t\t...what if ARCADE did too?\n\nA beat as the group mulls it over.  Then Greg shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\tNah.  You won, right?  You played by the\n\t\trules.\n\nGreg's right.  Alex grins and dismisses the thought.\n\n\t\t\t\tALEX\n\t\tOkay.  Forget I ever said it.\n\nThe group moves away from us once more.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tSo start at the beginning...\n\n\t\t\t\tLAURIE\n\t\tGive her a chance, will you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTILTS\n\t\tI am giving her a chance.  Why don't you\n\t\tget off my back?\n\n\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\tGuys...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY\n\nWe are moving slowly through the empty arcade, ducking around and between\nvideo machines until we reach the silent ARCADE prototype.\n\nSUDDENLY,\n\nSPARKS appear on the ground nearby, chasing each other around and\ncoalescing into a ball.  ENERGY crackling. SOMETHING is flickering in and\nout at an incredible rate. BUZZING.  STATIC.  And...\n\nWHAM!!!  A FLASH OF LIGHT EXPLODES OUTWARD.\n\nA FORM\n\nrises up from the floor, still trailing tendrils of smoke. It lifts its\nhead.\n\nTHE BOY\n\nstares directly at us, eyes glowing like nuclear reactors. And inside\nthose eyes we see the swirling fractals.  He grins, flashing a mouthful of\nperfectly white teeth.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCADE/BOY\n\t\tKISS REALITY GOODBYE, SUCKERS.\n\nAnd we...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nDarkness.\n\n\t\t\t\t   THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--Ad Banner\nfunction popupPage() {\n var windowopts = \"location=no,scrollbars=no,menubars=no,toolbars=no,resizable=yes,left= 50,top=50,width=490,height=130\";\n\n popup61602 = open('/prohost/banner.html',\"MenuPopup\",windowopts);\n popup61602.focus();\n<b>}\n</b>\npopupPage();\n\n//  Ad Banner-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArcade\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David S.
