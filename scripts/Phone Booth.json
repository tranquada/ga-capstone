A sea of humanity.  People\n\tcome and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another.\n\n\tA TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction\n\tworkers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS\n\tPEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a\n\tpasserby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking.\n\n\tWe're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've\n\tcome to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound.\n\n\tMULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East\n\tSide and West Side -- uptown and down.\n\n\tOne frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he\n\ttakes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver\n\tviolently against the coin box until the instrument splinters\n\tinto a dozen pieces.\n\n\t\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\t\tThere are 237,911 pay telephones in\n\t\tthe five burroughs of the city of\n\t\tNew York.  Many of them are still\n\t\tin working order.\n\n\tDOZENS OF QUICK CUTS --\n\n\tNEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up.  We don't hear\n\tthe words.  Only the facial expressions inform us that these\n\tare human beings under tremendous pressure.  Life in the city\n\tis wearing them down.\n\n\tMULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS\n\n\tLips jabbering into receivers.  Cross-cut against one\n\tanother.\n\n\t\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\t\tDespite increased usage of cellular\n\t\tdevices, an estimated four and a\n\t\thalf million New Yorkers and two\n\t\tmillion visitors still utilize pay\n\t\ttelephones on a regular basis.  At\n\t\tthirty-five cents a pop... for the\n\t\tfirst three minutes.\n\n\tANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY\n\n\tThere's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the\n\tstreet.\n\n\t\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\t\tYou're looking at the telephone\n\t\tbooth at the corner of 45th Street\n\t\tand 8th Avenue in the heart of the\n\t\tManhattan theatrical district.  It\n\t\thas been scheduled to be removed\n\t\tand replaced by a kiosk.  It's one\n\t\tof the few remaining phone booths\n\t\tleft in the city.\n\n\tCAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very\n\twell-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in\n\tappearance.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN IN BOOTH\n\t\t\t(into receiver)\n\t\tYou have lied to me for the last\n\t\ttime, you lowlife prick bastard!  I\n\t\tdon't ever want to hear the sound\n\t\tof your fucking voice again.\n\t\t\t(listens)\n\t\tYes, well fuck you, too!\n\n\tShe slams down the receiver and exits.  The booth remains\n\tvacant for a brief interval.\n\n\t\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\t\tAt least three hundred calls daily\n\t\toriginate from this booth.  The\n\t\tcoins are collected twice a day. \n\t\tThis booth has been burglarized\n\t\tforty-one times in the last six\n\t\tmonths.\n\n\tSomeone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for\n\tcoins.  This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair\n\tstyled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly\n\ttakes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen\n\tsuit and silk Armani tie.\n\n\tHe's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a\n\tmiddle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby\n\trestaurant and has finally caught up with him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tStu, we got to talk.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWish I could accommodate you,\n\t\tMario, but this is my busy time of\n\t\tday.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tHow come you cross the street every\n\t\ttime you go past the restaurant?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy don't I stop in later for some\n\t\tlunch?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tThere's no more drinks or free\n\t\tmeals until the restaurant starts\n\t\tshowing up in the columns like you\n\t\tsaid.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm doing my level best for you\n\t\tpeople.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tOne lousy mention in the Post and\n\t\tyou expect to eat for six months!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI got the food critic from the\n\t\tVillage Voice all lined up to give\n\t\tyou a review.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tThat's what you tell me last July. \n\t\tAnd he never shows.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI was allowing you time to expand\n\t\tthe menu.  Wallpaper the bathrooms,\n\t\tfor God sakes.  You get only one\n\t\tshot with these fucking critics and\n\t\tI don't want you to blow a rare\n\t\topportunity.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tYou the one blowing it.  How long\n\t\tyou think you can fuck everybody?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHold on right there.  I've got a\n\t\tvery excellent reputation around\n\t\tthis town.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tSo how come you take two nice suits\n\t\tof clothes from Harry and never get\n\t\this daughter on David Letterman?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHell, I'm not an agent.  I'm a\n\t\tpublicist.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tMister, you're nothing!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tBelieve me, Valerie's on the\n\t\twaiting list to audition.  Harry's\n\t\tgot no complaints.  He just let me\n\t\tpick out this tie the other day.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tThat Harry's a damn fool!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tMario, please let me make this up\n\t\tto you.  How about I arrange for\n\t\tthe opening night party for this\n\t\tnew off-Broadway show I'm handling \n\t\t-- to be held at your place with\n\t\tlocal TV coverage on nine and\n\t\televen?  I mean I had it promised\n\t\tto another client -- who actually\n\t\tpays me money.  But it isn't firmed\n\t\tup yet.  And I could throw it your\n\t\tway.  Maybe.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tWhat is involved?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou'd toss in the buffet for say\n\t\tseventy or eighty.  The producers\n\t\twould supply their own vino, of\n\t\tcourse.  I'd deliver you a\n\t\ttruckload of celebrities.  And if\n\t\tthey like the food, they'll all\n\t\tcome back, naturally.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tWhat celebrities?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou want Liza Minelli?  An Oscar\n\t\twinner.  Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tIs he still alive?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI saw him last night going into the\n\t\tFour Seasons.  I'll bring you over\n\t\ta whole VIP list when we come by\n\t\tfor dinner.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tHow come everybody wants to eat but\n\t\tnobody wants to pay?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou can't think small like that. \n\t\tHey, you still feature musicians\n\t\tFridays and Saturdays?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tAt least they work for their meals.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat about Harry's daughter as an\n\t\textra added attraction?  She'll\n\t\tbelt out five or six showtunes --\n\t\ttwo sets a night -- and it won't\n\t\tcost you a fucking nickel.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tHow come?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tStar Showcase!  Let me handle\n\t\tsetting that up.  And when she\n\t\teventually goes on Letterman,\n\t\tshe'll announce I'm currently\n\t\tappearing over at Mario's fine\n\t\tsupper club.  Right over CBS she'll\n\t\tsay that, Mario.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tYou're full of shit.  You know\n\t\tthat?  All bullshit!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThat's just a vulgar word for PR.\n\t\t\t(placing an arm around\n\t\t\thim)\n\t\tMario, you can't hurt my feelings. \n\t\tEven when I was a kid and they\n\t\thurled certain invectives my way,\n\t\tit never bothered me.  Other kids\n\t\twould fall apart if anybody called\n\t\tthem a fucking name.  Me, I just\n\t\tloved the attention!  'Shit-for-\n\t\tbrains' -- that's what the bigger\n\t\tkids named me.  And I answered to\n\t\tit.  Hey, 'shit-for brains'\n\t\treporting for duty.  Everybody\n\t\tloved me for that.  I could take\n\t\tabuse.  After a while, I kind of\n\t\twore them down.  There was nothing\n\t\tmore they could say to me.  So they\n\t\tstopped.  I kind of missed it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARIO\n\t\tI'm sorry I even talked to you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'll bet your loving wife put you\n\t\tup to this.  She saw me pass by and\n\t\tshe sent you out in the street. \n\t\tBut I don't hold it against you\n\t\tpersonally -- you still serve up\n\t\tsuperior veal chop.\n\t\t\t(entering phone booth)\n\t\tNow I got urgent business to\n\t\tconduct, Mario.\n\n\tHe slides the booth closed in Mario's face.\n\n\tThe frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass\n\tbefore giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he\n\tgoes up the block.\n\n\tINSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and\n\tdials.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHello, Mavis, sweet creature.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tWhere have you been?  Do you think\n\t\tI have nothing to do but wait\n\t\taround for you to call?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm only a few minutes late,\n\t\tloveliest individual on earth.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tStu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see\n\t\tyou?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tGood news in that arena.  Kelly\n\t\tgoes into rehearsal as of Monday. \n\t\tYou know how dedicated she is.  By\n\t\tthe time she gets back from dancing\n\t\ther ass off, she goes right to\n\t\tsleep.  We'll have both our days\n\t\tand certain nights.  Not to mention\n\t\twhen they take the show on the\n\t\troad.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tHow long is that for?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tFour to five weeks -- minimum.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tMaybe I should quit my job so we\n\t\tcan be together full time.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI wouldn't do that.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tSometimes I think if I have to give\n\t\tone more fucking manicure...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThat's how you met me.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tI never saw a worse set of nails. \n\t\tBit right down to the quick.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm much better groomed since\n\t\tyou've been looking after me.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tI'm glad you admit it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tEven Kelly remarked on it when I\n\t\tfirst met her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tShe could care less how you look. \n\t\tShe's only interested in pushing\n\t\ther own career.  Some wife you're\n\t\tstuck with!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThe marriage is not without its\n\t\tcompensations.  Do you imagine I\n\t\tcould afford that apartment on what\n\t\tI'm earning?  Not with everybody\n\t\tcutting back on the publicity.  Not\n\t\tto mention a million college\n\t\tgraduates coming into the\n\t\tprofession trying to cut me out. \n\t\tAnd one thing you can't expect from\n\t\tyour clients is loyalty.  They get\n\t\ta couple of bad notices, they dump\n\t\tyou.  Goodbye.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tDon't go.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I\n\t\twas saying how the clients try to\n\t\tgive you the wave off without even\n\t\ta month's notice.\n\n\tA conservative businessman now stands outside the booth\n\twaiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a\n\tfew times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu\n\twho slides the booth open a crack.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tWhat?  Is your watch busted?  It's\n\t\ttwenty after eleven and I'm gonna\n\t\tbe occupied indefinitely with my\n\t\ttransaction.  So get out of my\n\t\tface!\n\n\tHe closes the booth up again and turns his back to the\n\tgentleman who gives up and departs.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tSorry, honey.  There will be no\n\t\tfurther interruption.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tWhy must you always be calling me\n\t\tfrom some booth?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tOn account of that phone records\n\t\tare regularly subpoenaed in divorce\n\t\tproceedings.  And I don't want some\n\t\tentry showing up on my cellular\n\t\tbill either.  She gets the mail. \n\t\tShe looks these items over. \n\t\tSometimes she even dials up a\n\t\tstrange number to see who it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tThen she suspects something.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt's only because her last husband,\n\t\tthe choreographer, ran around on\n\t\ther.  She can't get that out of her\n\t\thead.  That's how she caught onto\n\t\thim.  The phone bills.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tShe hasn't developed much skill at\n\t\tholding a man.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou know what a self-fulfilling\n\t\tprophecy is?  She was so sure I was\n\t\tgoing to find me a woman that she\n\t\tfinally drove me back to you.  I\n\t\tthought I'd feel all guilty about\n\t\tit -- but I guess it hasn't kicked\n\t\tin yet.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tStill, I wouldn't do anything to\n\t\thurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a\n\t\tdecent individual.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tWhat about hurting me?  Like last\n\t\ttime?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHurt?  You were glad to be rid of\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tFor a while I was, 'til I took\n\t\tstock of what was around.  You're\n\t\tthe lesser of many evils.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThat's about the nicest thing you\n\t\tever said.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tI'll have it engraved.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWe've been up front with each other\n\t\tfrom the beginning.  Let's keep it\n\t\tthat way.  How about a drink?  Say\n\t\tseven o'clock?  The Monkey Bar?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tMeet me in front.  I don't like\n\t\twalking in there unescorted.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYeah, you're great enough looking\n\t\tto be mistaken for one of those\n\t\tthousand dollar a night girls.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tIt happens all the time lately.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAnd wear that short black number I\n\t\tbought you from Bendel's.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tAgain?  I don't know if it's me or\n\t\tthat dress you like.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHave a good day.  Make plenty of\n\t\ttips.  And leave the whole evening\n\t\topen.  She thinks I've got Knicks\n\t\ttickets.\n\n\tHe hangs up.  Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his\n\tjacket pocket, flips it open and dials.  Someone answers on\n\tthe first ring.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLUMNIST (V.O.)\n\t\tSpeak!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into cellular)\n\t\tIt's your boy Stuart.  When was the\n\t\tlast time I called you for a favor?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLUMNIST (V.O.)\n\t\tThe column is already full.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI just need one line.  Anybody you\n\t\twanna say was seen dining out at\n\t\tMario's Stromboli restaurant.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLUMNIST (V.O.)\n\t\tMaybe you don't hear so good?  I\n\t\tgot no space for you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWho's asking any favors?  I'm\n\t\toffering reciprocal information.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLUMNIST (V.O.)\n\t\tSince when were you ever a reliable\n\t\tsource?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tCheck it out.  Tony award-winning\n\t\tproducer Willie Beagle tossed his\n\t\twife back into rehab again\n\t\tfollowing her third attempt at\n\t\tdiving off the terrace at their\n\t\tplush eighteen room residence at\n\t\tthe San Remo.  I got it from the\n\t\tdoorman.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLUMNIST (V.O.)\n\t\tI got it from their maid yesterday. \n\t\tIt's in the paper today.  Or don't\n\t\tyou bother to read my shit?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLouis, my intentions were entirely\n\t\thonorable.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLUMNIST (V.O.)\n\t\tI'll drop your item in sometime\n\t\tnext week.  If you promise not to\n\t\tcall me for a month.\n\n\tHe hangs up.  Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone\n\tand tucks it away.\n\n\tThen he starts to vacate the booth.  The phone rings.  And\n\trings.  Curious, he picks up the receiver.  There's a voice\n\ton the other end of the line.  A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't even think about leaving that\n\t\tbooth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tStay exactly where you are and\n\t\tlisten carefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI've got a heavy day, mister.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou know better than to disobey me.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI don't know you at all.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAre you absolutely sure?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWho is this?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tSomeone who's watching you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tGet lost!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tLove the gray suit.  That red and\n\t\tblack tie makes a nice combination.\n\n\tStu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel. \n\tHe looks around nervously.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhere?  Where are you?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCloser than you think.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI don't see you.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThere are any number of windows. \n\t\tCheck them out.\n\n\tIndeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise\n\tbuildings and hotels.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tOkay, you had your little joke.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'm not sufficiently amused.  Not\n\t\tyet.  We have more to talk about.\n\n\tStu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him\n\tnot to.  Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDo me a favor.  Call up somebody\n\t\telse.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBut it's you I'm interested in. \n\t\tYou know how many people use that\n\t\tbooth every day?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy don't you tell me?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBetter than two-hundred people on\n\t\taverage.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIs that what you do?  Count them?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat else do I have to do?  It's\n\t\tinteresting watching people. \n\t\tTrying to guess who they are.  And\n\t\twhat they're up to.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat are you -- a shut-in of some\n\t\tkind?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou might say that.  I can't go\n\t\tout.  I might be seen.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tSomebody's looking for you?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDesperately.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThe cops?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tNot yet.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThe ex-wife.  What'd you do -- run\n\t\tout on child support?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat kind of man do you think I am?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tFrankly, I could care less.  You\n\t\thad your fun.  Now goodbye.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIt's not in your best interests to\n\t\thang up on me.  That would make me\n\t\tangry.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIsn't that just too bad?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tFor you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThere's ten million names in the\n\t\tphonebook.

Not mine, you\n\t\tlowlife fuck.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tStu, you'll be made to suffer for\n\t\tyour attitude, so let's dispense\n\t\twith the vulgarities.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNow you're threatening me!

I have another extension\n\t\there by the window.  Shall I dial\n\t\tthat same number back for you? \n\t\tWould that convince you?\n\n\tStu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall\n\tbuildings that surround the street corner.\n\n\tSTU'S POV\n\n\tPANNING up at thousands of windows.  The Voice could be\n\tcoming from anywhere.\n\n\tBACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tLet's see who's on the other end of\n\t\tthe line.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDon't.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tToo late.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tIt's already ringing.

All you can do\n\t\tis listen.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tMavis -- the guy is a fucking\n\t\tnutcase!  Hang the fuck up.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tShe doesn't want to.  She wants to\n\t\tknow all about us.  Don't you,\n\t\tMavis?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tDid his wife put you up to this? \n\t\tThat bitch, Kelly?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly.

Don't\n\t\ttell him anything else.\n\n\tOutside the booth, a huge, heavy-set black woman in a too\n\ttight dress, now appears with the clear desire to use the\n\tphone.  Her name is FELICIA.  She taps on the glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tCould you hurry it along?\n\n\tStu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass\n\twith hostility.\n\n\tStu has no inclination to deal with anybody else.  He's too\n\tdistracted by the madness happening over the telephone.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tCan you hear me, Mavis?  Keep your\n\t\tbig mouth shut.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIs that any way to talk to a woman\n\t\tyou love?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tMavis, is he always that abusive to\n\t\tyou?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tYou're getting me all upset.  I\n\t\tdon't know who you are or how you\n\t\tknow all this --\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI find out things -- from watching\n\t\tpeople and listening to them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tJust what is your relationship to\n\t\tStu?

Stu and I are --\n\t\tlongtime companions.  A pair.  Two\n\t\tof a kind.  Closer than close. \n\t\tPeas in a pod.  Spoons in a drawer.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAVIS' VOICE\n\t\tYou pervert!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDon't believe a word of it.

Goodbye now, Mavis. \n\t\tThanks for your time.\n\t\t\t(the phone clicks off; we\n\t\t\thear only a dial tone)\n\t\tBack to you again, Stu.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou total asshole!  How could you\n\t\tdo that?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tSpeaking of females, that woman\n\t\thovering outside the booth -- may\n\t\tas well tell her that you'll be on\n\t\tthe line forever.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLike hell I will.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'm ready for you to take out your\n\t\tcellular and phone home.  And this\n\t\ttime, I'll listen in.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThere's no chance of that.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOr should I call Kelly and make up\n\t\tsomething totally outrageous?  You\n\t\tmust realize by now I have a vivid\n\t\timagination.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou don't know our phone number!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAre you absolutely sure?

Now do you\n\t\twant to dial 832-7165 -- or should\n\t\tI?\n\n\tThe sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even\n\tmore than the earlier mention of his name.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat are you going to tell her?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou'll do the talking.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat am I supposed to say?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTry telling her the truth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLook, I don't want to hurt Kelly. \n\t\tShe's always there for me.  It's\n\t\tjust my nature to have a little\n\t\t'strange' on the side.  It doesn't\n\t\tmean shit.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBut you still find it necessary?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tKind of like having a beautiful\n\t\thome.  With everything you ever\n\t\tdreamed of.  But you still need\n\t\tthat vacation now and then.  Some\n\t\tnice hotel room with a great view. \n\t\tMaybe a pool.  Only you wouldn't\n\t\twant to spend more than a few days\n\t\tin any hotel.  Eventually, you want\n\t\tto go back to your home and all\n\t\tyour stuff.  You're real glad to\n\t\tcheck out.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tKelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? \n\t\tI'm sure they'll both appreciate\n\t\tthat explanation.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou're ruining my fucking life, you\n\t\tsonofabitch.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDidn't I warn you about calling me\n\t\tnames?

One day soon\n\t\tyou'll come home and find her gone\n\t\talong with the CD player and the\n\t\tVCR.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm not gonna let you mind-fuck me\n\t\tall day!  That's it.  This call is\n\t\tended.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tNot until I say it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat happens if I hang up?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou don't really want to find out.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm dying to hear this!!!  What the\n\t\tfuck can you do about it -- up in\n\t\tyour fucking high window with your\n\t\tgoddam binoculars?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI never indicated I had binoculars. \n\t\tI said I had a highly magnified\n\t\ttelescopic image of you that\n\t\tbrought you up so close I could see\n\t\twhere you nicked yourself under the\n\t\tchin shaving this morning.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tOh -- while you're at it, have a\n\t\tlook up my ass.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI may very well do that, Stu.  In\n\t\tthe meantime, think about what kind\n\t\tof device has a telescopic sight\n\t\tmounted on it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat?  You mean... like a rifle?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tA high-powered .30 calibre bolt\n\t\taction Remington 700 with a carbon\n\t\tone modification and a state of the\n\t\tart Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. \n\t\tAnd you're in the cross hairs, Stu.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm supposed to believe that?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThere's only one way I can prove it\n\t\tto you.  Hang up the receiver and\n\t\tfind out.  At this range, the exit\n\t\twound ought to be about the size of\n\t\ta small tangerine.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAnd you're just going to kill me\n\t\tfor no reason?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tFor plenty of reasons!  Because you\n\t\thung up.  For years I hated people\n\t\thanging up on me.  Ex-girlfriends. \n\t\tWomen I didn't even know. \n\t\tProspective employers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI get hung up on all the time.  You\n\t\tget used to it.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOr else you don't.  I worked for\n\t\tmonths getting people to switch to\n\t\tMCI -- being insulted at and being\n\t\thung up on hundreds of times a day. \n\t\tThe ones that cursed me out for\n\t\tinvading their privacy never\n\t\tbothered me as much as those that\n\t\tclicked off without even bothering\n\t\tto reply.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThen why didn't you go after one of\n\t\tthem?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tMaybe you are one of them.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHey, I have worked in a boiler room\n\t\tmyself peddling \"Term Life.\"  I\n\t\tWould never be rude to a fellow\n\t\tsalesperson.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCan you feel it on you now?  The\n\t\theat of it.  I'm moving the strike\n\t\tzone down to your stomach area. \n\t\tNow I'm raising it up again. \n\t\tDirectly above the chest cavity --\n\t\tsliding up to the forehead just\n\t\tabove the left ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tShit -- I do feel it.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTell me where I'm going with it\n\t\tnow.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAcross my forehead -- now back\n\t\twhere it was before.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'm amazed how you can do that. \n\t\tYou're amazingly accurate.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tNow I know what you're thinking. \n\t\tIf I drop down on the floor of the\n\t\tbooth and flatten myself out...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo, I'm not thinking that.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOh yes you are.  Can I crawl out\n\t\tusing the booth as a shield?  Can I\n\t\tcrawl to that Chrysler illegally\n\t\tparked only three or four feet\n\t\taway?  The shattering glass may cut\n\t\tme, but it'll only be superficial. \n\t\tOtherwise, this lunatic will never\n\t\tlet me out alive.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.  You will.  I know you will. \n\t\tIf I just cooperate.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhere is it now?  Think and feel\n\t\tfor the warm spot.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tBelow the shoulder?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhich one?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThe right shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tRemarkable how we're in tune. \n\t\tYou're doing far better than the\n\t\tothers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat others?  What do you mean?\n\t\t\t(no reply)\n\t\tYou said 'others!'\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t(finally)\n\t\tI'm sure you read about the Italian\n\t\ttourist shot dead ten days ago at\n\t\tthe corner of Forty-fifth and\n\t\tEighth?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI saw it on the news.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAnd where are we now?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tOh, God.  Forty-fifth and Eighth.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat else do you remember about\n\t\tthat killing?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTry.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHe was gunned down.  And nobody was\n\t\tcaught.  And they didn't even\n\t\tbother to take his wallet or his\n\t\twatch... or anything.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tNow you know why.  It wasn't a\n\t\trobbery.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat did he do?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHe hung up -- so I disconnected him\n\t\tpermanently.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tPlease -- don't do it to me.  You\n\t\tgot no reason to do it to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't give me reason.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm not looking to.  Tell me what\n\t\tyou want!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTell me about your job.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat's to tell?  I'm in Public\n\t\tRelations.  They used to call us\n\t\t\"flacks.\"  Now we're media\n\t\tconsultants.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat do you do, exactly?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tPlant items in the paper and on the\n\t\ttube.  More important sometimes,\n\t\tkeep stuff out.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat've you kept out?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tOne of my people got nailed for\n\t\tindecent exposure.  I managed for\n\t\tthe cops to use his real name\n\t\tinstead of his stage name so nobody\n\t\tpicked up on it.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou saved the little deviate's ass,\n\t\tdidn't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHe's in major therapy now.  I swear\n\t\the is.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou must hang with some major\n\t\tcelebrities.  Journalists,\n\t\tnewscasters -- those types.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm real close with Larry King. \n\t\tAnd the \"Hard Copy\" people.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCould you get him down here?  Larry\n\t\tKing?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy would he want to come here?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBecause you asked him to.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHe comes from Atlanta.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWell, who could you get?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWolf Blitzer?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tProbably not.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tRegis?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDefinitely no chance.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou'd be offering them an exclusive\n\t\tnewsbreak.

They might\n\t\tnot believe me.  My record isn't\n\t\ttoo good when it comes to hard\n\t\tnews.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou're not considered a reliable\n\t\tsource?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tOn a divorce or separation, maybe. \n\t\tOr who's gay, or who isn't gay any\n\t\tmore.  I kind of specialize in that\n\t\tkind of material.  I mean I could\n\t\tprobably get you Joe Franklin.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHow about Cindy Adams?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI might have a shot.  Are you\n\t\tfamiliar with Liz Smith?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDo you know her number?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWant I should call her?

If you had an\n\t\tactor or a sports figure held\n\t\tprisoner instead of me, there'd be\n\t\tbetter odds she's come.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThen lie.  Pick a celebrity and put\n\t\tthem in the booth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLet's see.  Who does she like?  Who\n\t\tcouldn't be reached to deny it?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'm anxious to see you in action. \n\t\tDon't keep me waiting.\n\n\tStu uses his cellular again.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(dialing)\n\t\tSometimes you only get her service.\n\t\t\t(into cellular)\n\t\tHi -- Stu Shepard.

Killing two weeks ago in\n\t\tthe theatre district?  Turn out a\n\t\tsniper did the job.  Yeah, a sniper\n\t\twith a rifle.  Now he's got another\n\t\tvictim lined up.  Not just your\n\t\tanonymous New Yorker, but Liza. \n\t\tNow you can't call anybody or Ms. \n\t\tMinelli's dead meat and so am I. \n\t\tShe's hostage in a phone booth\n\t\tright in the sniper's sights.  But\n\t\the says he'll talk to you and let\n\t\ther walk.  I know it'll take balls\n\t\tto do this, but you're a fine and\n\t\tcourageous newspaper woman...\n\n\tThere's a click.  Silence.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHello?  Hello?\n\t\t\t(to pay phone)\n\t\tEither she's on her way over or she\n\t\tdoesn't believe me.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou weren't particularly\n\t\tconvincing.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI didn't really believe in what I\n\t\twas saying.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBecause you don't really believe my\n\t\tRemington is pointed at you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI do.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou're ninety percent sure.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAt least ninety-five percent, easy.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tLet me erase all doubt.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.  Don't shoot.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tControl yourself, Stu.

You know exactly where to\n\t\texpect it before I even tighten my\n\t\tfinger on the trigger.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDon't tighten.

Look, I can try and reach\n\t\tcable NBC.  They're hungry.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'm disappointed.  I wanted to go\n\t\tfirst class.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThey do a great job.

We done touched\n\t\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWell go wash your hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEON\n\t\tCome on now.  Own up to what you're\n\t\tcarrying.  Is it some of that\n\t\tsexually transmitted shit?  Cause\n\t\tin that case, we can relax.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm sick of you.  Now get out of my\n\t\tface.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEON\n\t\tHere we's being solicitous as to\n\t\tyour health and you respond by\n\t\theaping abuse!\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tWhip his arrogant ass.\n\n\tLeon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu's jacket.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tTouch me and I'll throw up on you.\n\n\tAt the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly.\n\n\tIt looks like a stalemate.  Stu isn't vacating the booth and\n\tLeon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further.  He\n\tdoes indeed look sick.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tYou can see what I'm up against\n\t\there.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWant me to get rid of him for you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat do you have in mind?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'll think of something.\n\n\tSuddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp.\n\n\tLeon doesn't realize it's there.  The hooker behind him has\n\tno way of seeing it.  But to Stu, there's no way to miss it. \n\tHe reacts.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tGod -- no.\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tDon't.  It's not necessary.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou asked for my help.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'll handle it myself.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou're not doing too well.  I can\n\t\tsettle it in a fraction of a\n\t\tsecond.  Shall I demonstrate?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.\n\t\t\t(to Leon)\n\t\tFor your own safety, mister, just\n\t\twalk away.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEON\n\t\tNow the man is turning\n\t\taggressive... issuing threats upon\n\t\tmy person.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou're making this happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEON\n\t\tIf you don't hang up and step out,\n\t\tI'm about to topple this booth into\n\t\tthe gutter with you inside it.\n\n\tReluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself. \n\tHe begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its\n\tfoundation.  And the rickety booth is not too sturdy.  It\n\tstarts rocking back and forth.\n\n\tStu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tThis isn't my fault.\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tStop that!\n\n\tBut Leon continues rocking the booth.  It won't come loose --\n\tso in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass.\n\n\tThe glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to\n\tshield himself from the slivers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tThe guy's insane!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOnly one way to stop a mad dog. \n\t\tGive me permission.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIf he forces you out of that booth,\n\t\tI've told you what to expect.  You\n\t\tor him, Stu.\n\n\tLeon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after\n\tanother -- as Stu cowers inside.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tDon't cut yourself, honey.\n\n\tA crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to\n\twatch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth\n\tand its occupant.\n\n\t\t\t\tDERELICT\n\t\tLooks like the fucker is comin'\n\t\tloose.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTREET PERSON\n\t\tShove it out into the oncoming\n\t\ttraffic.\n\n\t\t\t\tDERELICT\n\t\tWhat'll you bet the bus could knock\n\t\tthat fifty feet?\n\n\tThe booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tHello?  Hello?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t(with heavy static)\n\t\tYou're breaking up.  We're about to\n\t\tbe cut off.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI can't help it!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat counts as a hang-up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.  It can't.  That's not fair.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI can still make him stop.  Say the\n\t\tword.  Can you hear me?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tStu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues\n\tto barrage the booth with punches and kicks.\n\n\tThen Leon recoils, staggers a step backward.  He doesn't\n\trealize he's been shot.\n\n\tThere's been no sound of gunfire.  Perhaps a silencer was\n\tused -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary\n\tdischarge.\n\n\tLeon looks confused at first.  His ladyfriend has no idea\n\the's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people\n\twho've assembled on the corner.\n\n\tEven Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the\n\twound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest.\n\n\tHe isn't assaulting the booth anymore.  He's trying to keep\n\this balance.  He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for\n\tsupport -- only a few inches from Stu's face.  The blood runs\n\tdown the side of the booth.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tYou did it!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou said 'yes.'\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI said 'Yes, I can hear you.'  Not\n\t\t'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!'\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't try to renege on it.  I was\n\t\tfollowing orders.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou're twisting it all around.  I\n\t\tdidn't do this!\n\n\tMeanwhile, Leon leans upright against the booth.  Then his\n\tlegs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees.\n\n\tFelicia runs up beside him.  She sees the blood.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tI warned you not to cut yourself.\n\t\t\t(to crowd)\n\t\tLook at all that blood.  He must've\n\t\thit an artery.\n\n\tShe screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement.  Now\n\this chest wound is evident.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tOh, Jesus.  What is that?  Talk to\n\t\tme!  What happened?\n\n\tThe crowd tightens around the fallen body.  Street people who\n\tare fascinated but not shocked.\n\n\t\t\t\tDERELICT\n\t\tGunshot!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTREET PERSON\n\t\tYeah.  Sucking chest wound right\n\t\tover the heart.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tSomebody call an ambulance.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTREET PERSON\n\t\tCall the meatwagon.  He's fucked\n\t\tup.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tYou shut the fuck up!\n\n\tHer focus turns to Stu in the battered phone booth.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tWhy did you do that to him?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI didn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\t\t(to crowd)\n\t\tYou all saw it!  He shot my man\n\t\twithout no provocation!\n\n\t\t\t\tDERELICT\n\t\tYeah.  Pumped one right into him at\n\t\tclose range.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHow could I?  I don't even have a\n\t\tgun.  Look!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTREET PERSON\n\t\tEverybody get the fuck back!  They\n\t\tshoot one -- then they shoot\n\t\teverybody in sight!  Kill all the\n\t\tfucking witnesses!\n\n\tThe crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner -- out\n\tof immediate range.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tCome back.  You've got to see --\n\t\tI'm not armed.\n\n\tOnly Felicia remains, leaning over the pimp's body, staring\n\thelplessly.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tHang up and dial 911.  Get a\n\t\tdoctor!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI can't hang up.  That's what this\n\t\tis all about.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tYou're gonna stand there and let\n\t\thim die?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(takes out cellular)\n\t\tI can use this.\n\t\t\t(he dials)\n\t\tEmergency.  Yes.  There's been a\n\t\tshooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth \n\t\t-- on the corner.  A man is down. \n\t\tWhat's the difference who I am?  I\n\t\tdon't want to be involved.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tThat's bullshit.  He's the shooter. \n\t\tYou're talking to the shooter.\n\n\tStu quickly disconnects the cellular.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThat wasn't nice.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tGo ahead -- make a fucking run for\n\t\tit.  I hope they gun you down --\n\t\tlike you did him!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm not going anyplace.  I'm\n\t\tstaying right here in this booth.\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tUnless you give me permission.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou're attracting a lot of\n\t\tattention.  I suppose when the\n\t\tpolice get there, you'll accuse me.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat do you expect me to say?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat's up to you.  But any mention\n\t\tof me will not be appreciated.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou mean...?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou won't even get to finish your\n\t\tsentence.  Oh look, that little red\n\t\tdot is dancing around all over you\n\t\tagain.  You saw how quickly it can\n\t\thappen.  And how accurate I can be.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThey can't blame me -- I'm not\n\t\tarmed.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWho's going to believe that?  With\n\t\tall those witnesses to the\n\t\tcontrary.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThey can see with their own eyes.\n\n\tNot far away, we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing\n\tcloser.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tRemember to leave me out of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHow can I?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou'll put the proper spin on it. \n\t\tIsn't that your specialty?  Feeding\n\t\tthe public a story that may not\n\t\thave a shred of truth -- and making\n\t\tit totally believable?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThis isn't a story.  This is real. \n\t\tThis is murder.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIf you'd only dealt with the man\n\t\treasonably, shown him some respect,\n\t\tthis might not have been necessary.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI gave him my money, my watch...\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBut not your respect.  Which is\n\t\twhat he required of you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHe was a fucking thief.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAnd now he's a fucking dead thief. \n\t\tDo you feel better about that?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI don't feel a bit guilty.  This is\n\t\tall your doing!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tNow you're being disrespectful of\n\t\tme.  You never learn.  Your job is\n\t\tto deal with people -- but you're\n\t\tnot good at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHey, I'm not taking any more\n\t\tcriticism from some lunatic sniper\n\t\twho gets his kicks killing\n\t\tstrangers.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou keep insisting I'm a stranger. \n\t\tProbably because you don't\n\t\trecognize the voice.  But there are\n\t\tcheap electronic devices available\n\t\tthat disguise the voice.  I might\n\t\tnot even be a man.  I might be one\n\t\tof those many women you've almost\n\t\ttotally forgotten.  One who doesn't\n\t\tforgive easily.  One who wants to\n\t\twatch you squirm.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou're a man.  I know you're a man. \n\t\tWomen don't kill with telescopic\n\t\trifles.  They stab you.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou sound so sure of that.  But\n\t\tyou've never provoked any man as\n\t\tmuch as have the women in your\n\t\tlife.  And so many of them, Stu.\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tDo you even remember their names?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI've got no time to rehash my whole\n\t\tlife.  Oh my God!  The cops are\n\t\there.\n\n\tPolice cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue.\n\n\tTraffic has suddenly been shut down.  Prowl cars have now\n\tblocked the streets.\n\n\tPRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective\n\twithout intercuts.\n\n\tHalf a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns.\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tThat's him -- in the booth.  He's\n\t\tgot a gun!\n\n\tAs she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body\n\tout into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue.\n\n\tIt's a bright afternoon.  In the distance, we hear the\n\tmaddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being\n\trerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of\n\tirate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their\n\tsimplest form of protest.  It's a discordant concert that\n\techoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels...\n\n\tAs the cops surround the booth -- at a distance.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\t\t(into bullhorn)\n\t\tThrow down your weapon and come out\n\t\twith your hands raised.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tThey're ordering me to come out.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI can see that.  Ignore them.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat if they open fire?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThey probably won't.  Look across\n\t\ton the east side of the street.  Do\n\t\tyou see the tourist with the home\n\t\tvideo camera?\n\n\tSTU'S POV\n\n\tA distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner\n\tbehind the police cars.  Some tourist is capturing the event\n\ton video.\n\n\tBACK TO STU\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat about him?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHe's going to keep the police on\n\t\ttheir best behavior.  So long as\n\t\tyou don't take what could be\n\t\tinterpreted as hostile action,\n\t\tyou'll be safe.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou call this safe?  Six cops with\n\t\tguns pointed my way?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou want me to reduce them to three\n\t\t-- or two?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAbsolutely no more shooting.  Now\n\t\tis that clear?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou can always change your mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\t\t(with bullhorn)\n\t\tYou know the drill.  Hands clasped\n\t\tbehind the back of your neck --\n\t\tmoving slowly -- step out of the\n\t\tbooth.  If we see any sign of a\n\t\tweapon, we will respond.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tYou won't, because there isn't any.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\t\t(bullhorn)\n\t\tI repeat.  Raise your hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI can't.  I'm on a phone call.\n\n\tNow a black POLICE CAPTAIN arrives and takes full command of\n\tthe situation.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN RAMEY\n\t\tYou have thirty seconds to comply.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI told you.  I'm busy.  Come back\n\t\tlater.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tVery good, Stu.\n\n\tThe cops take cover behind parked cars, keeping Stu clearly\n\tin their sights.  He has no place to hide.  He's in the\n\tbattered phone booth in plain view from all sides.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tYou've been given an order.\n\n\tThe Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer.\n\n\tPRODUCTION NOTE: We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops -- always\n\tfrom Stu's POV.  But we can hear their voices and all that is\n\tsaid as if they were in close up.  It has an odd, unreal and\n\tdistancing effect.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tWe're dealing with a mental case. \n\t\tHe's looking for us to kill him.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWell he's not getting his wish.\n\n\tIn the center of the street, an ambulance pulls up and a team\n\tof medics jump out.  They rush to Leon's body.  (Again we\n\thear their voices close, even though visually they are far\n\toff.)\n\n\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\tTell me he's gonna be alright.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\tStep aside.  Let us look at him.\n\n\tThe medics push her aside -- then examine the victim.  He's\n\tDOA.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\tNothing we can do.  Don't touch the\n\t\tbody.  They'll need it to mark the\n\t\tcrime scene.\n\n\tFar across the street, the Captain confers with his\n\tsubordinates.  They are small figures on the screen but we\n\thear them sharply.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tSame corner as two weeks ago.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tMaybe it's more than a coincidence. \n\t\tCover me.  I need to talk to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tYou've got your vest on?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\tThe Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the\n\tphone booth.  He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tI'm not armed.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNeither am I.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tYeah, sure.  I need to know what\n\t\thappened.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tCan't talk about it.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tSure you can.  My name's Ramey. \n\t\tCaptain Ed Ramey.  What's yours?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLook, I don't want to be friends.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tYou look like you need a friend.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTell him you've already got a\n\t\tfriend.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(yells)\n\t\tI've got a friend, okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tIs that who you're talking to on\n\t\tthe phone?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNone of your business.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWhen somebody gets shot, it becomes\n\t\tmy business.  Let's not have\n\t\tanybody else killed.  I want to\n\t\thear your side of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI've got no side of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't worry, Stu.  I've got him\n\t\tfixed right in my sights.  I won't\n\t\tlet him hurt you.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHas this happened to you before? \n\t\tThe need to hurt someone?  To put a\n\t\tbullet in them?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou won't believe anything I say.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tTry me.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI couldn't shoot anybody.  I'm not\n\t\tarmed.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tYou're right.  I don't believe you. \n\t\tWhat's that bulge in your pants\n\t\tpocket?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThat?  That's my cellular.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tA cellular?  Then what are you\n\t\tdoing in a phone booth making\n\t\tcalls?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDo you want to see it?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tDon't reach for it, mister.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThen how can I show it to you?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tI don't need to see it.  I know\n\t\twhat's there.  All these witnesses\n\t\tsaw you use it on him.\n\n\tFrom behind a parked car, a HOMELESS PERSON calls out.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTREET PERSON\n\t\t\t(hollers)\n\t\tDamn straight!\n\n\tAnother DERELICT, crouched in a doorway, joins in.\n\n\t\t\t\tDERELICT\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tYeah!  Shot him down like a dog!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThey're all lying.  Nobody saw it\n\t\tbecause it didn't happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tA man is dead but it didn't happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNot on account of me!  This is like\n\t\tsome bad dream.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tYou're walking through a bad dream\n\t\tand you can't wake up.  Do you want\n\t\tto wake up?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm trying.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tAnd in this dream, you killed that\n\t\tman.  He was bothering you so you\n\t\ticed him.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tThen who did?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't tell him, Stu.  Or it'll be\n\t\tthe last thing he ever hears.  His\n\t\tblood will be on your hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(to Ramey)\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tBut you saw it happen?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tYou were the closest one to him. \n\t\tYou must've seen who did it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWe're trying to be honest with each\n\t\tother, aren't we?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNot necessarily.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'm losing patience with this cop.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tI'm handling this.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWho do you keep talking to on the\n\t\tphone?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNobody.  My psychiatrist.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tExcellent, Stu.  You're getting\n\t\tgood at this.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWhat's this doctor's name?  It's\n\t\timportant we know.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHe says not to tell you.  It's\n\t\tprivileged information.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDamn good reply.  Now you're having\n\t\tfun.  Admit it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhatever you say.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tPlaying it so close to the edge. \n\t\tI'll bet you've never felt so\n\t\talive.  That's how I feel when I\n\t\tlook through the sight and select\n\t\tsomebody.\n\n\tThe Captain begins advancing a few steps closer.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tI respect your right to privacy. \n\t\tI've been to therapy myself.  The\n\t\tdepartment provides it.  I know\n\t\tit's not good form for a cop to be\n\t\tadmitting that, but...\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTell him not to come any closer.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tStop right there.  Back up a few\n\t\tsteps.  Back where you were.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tIf it makes you more comfortable.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTell him to read you your rights.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI want you to read me my rights and\n\t\tstop asking questions.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tAl least tell me your first name.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt's my right not to have any name.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tNo gun and no name.  You're a\n\t\thighly underprivileged person.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDemand a lawyer.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAnd get me a lawyer, too.  I want a\n\t\tlawyer brought down here to\n\t\tnegotiate my surrender.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBrilliant, Stu.  Keep winging it.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tIt'll be hard to find a lawyer\n\t\twilling to risk his life.  But if\n\t\tyou hand over the gun...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHow can I when you won't let me\n\t\ttake it out?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWe'll take it out for you -- as\n\t\tsoon as you exit the booth with\n\t\tyour hands raised and...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(interrupts)\n\t\tNow we're back to that again.  It's\n\t\talways \"Get out of the booth.' \n\t\t'You can't stay in the booth.' \n\t\tWell, I like it in the fucking\n\t\tbooth.  It's my whole world now. \n\t\tIt's my booth and I'm never coming\n\t\tout.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWe're not about to force you\n\t\tbecause there could be a\n\t\tmiscalculation and then we'd never\n\t\tfind out why this happened.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy is it so important to know? \n\t\tThe guy is dead.  Isn't that\n\t\tenough?  Knowing isn't going to\n\t\tmake him alive again.  So who gives\n\t\ta fuck!\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tIt's what makes the job\n\t\tinteresting.  Finding out why. \n\t\tSomething drove you to do this. \n\t\tYou didn't go out today expecting\n\t\tthis to happen.  It was a nice day. \n\t\tYou were out for a walk.  And then\n\t\tsuddenly it all changed.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAll I wanted was to make a phone\n\t\tcall.  One lousy phone call for\n\t\tthirty-five fucking cents.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCareful, Stu.  Don't volunteer too\n\t\tmuch.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tYou got some bad news on that call.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThe worst.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tSomething that pushed you over the\n\t\tedge?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAnd I've been falling ever since.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tTime to land.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhen you hit bottom, you die.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tI'm your safety net.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIf I tell you what you want to know\n\t\t-- you'll die, too.\n\n\tSomething about the implied threat sends a chill through\n\tCaptain Ramey.\n\n\tINSERT SHOT\n\n\tThe Captain's head as seen through a telescopic sight.\n\n\tRamey could be dead in an instant.\n\n\tPRODUCTION NOTE: The only time we deviate from Stu's\n\tperspective is when we see the sniper's POV through his\n\tscope.\n\n\tANGLE BACK ON STU IN THE BOOTH,\n\n\tthe detective fifteen feet away.\n\n\tRamey decides to back off momentarily.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tI'll go see about that lawyer.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNow that's a good idea.\n\n\tThe Captain withdraws back across the street.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHe's lucky.  I had him centered in\n\t\tmy cross hairs.  I really had to\n\t\trestrain myself.\n\n\tWe hear the approach of a helicopter.\n\n\tStu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above\n\tthe tall buildings.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIt's not the police.  It's the\n\t\tmedia.  You're news, Stuart.\n\n\tThe helicopters circle above.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou've never gotten this much press\n\t\tfor any of your clients.  I'm\n\t\tmaking you a famous person.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThey're just hoping for coverage of\n\t\tme dying in the gutter.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTheir presence is putting the\n\t\tpolice on their continued best\n\t\tbehavior.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThose cops are just looking for any\n\t\texcuse.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThen don't give them one.\n\n\tThen, as if on cue, Stu's cellular phone in his pocket starts\n\tringing.\n\n\tBut he can't allows himself to reach for it.  To do so might\n\tcause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun.\n\n\tIt rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth. \n\tDrowned out by the traffic horns, the static from the police\n\tradios and the newly introduced sound of television\n\thelicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage\n\tof the event below.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWho could it be?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tKelly.  She was worried about me.\n\n\tStu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think he's\n\tgoing for a gun.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tMaybe she's seen this on\n\t\ttelevision.  It must be on every\n\t\tchannel by now.  Breaking news.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tShe doesn't watch daytime TV.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOne of the neighbors could've\n\t\talerted her.\n\n\tThe cell phone keeps ringing, almost drowned out by the sound\n\tof helicopters circling overhead.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy are you saying this?  You want\n\t\tme to reach in my pocket so you can\n\t\tsee them open fire?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat's an unwarranted accusation\n\t\tand very unbecoming in light of the\n\t\tgood advice I've given in the past. \n\t\tHave I ever steered you wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tGod -- how I'd love to hear her\n\t\tvoice.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIt might even be worth it.  She's\n\t\tinsistent, isn't she?\n\n\tThe cellular won't stop ringing.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIf she knows I'm in trouble, she\n\t\twon't give up.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tProbably glued to the TV by now. \n\t\tI'm watching coverage on two\n\t\tstations now.  Channel surfing.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tWell, there you are on two and four\n\t\tand five.  Not any decent angles on\n\t\tyou, though, stuck inside there.\n\n\tThe cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is\n\tmaddening.  Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide\n\tthe cops with an excuse to open fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBut if you'd take one or two steps\n\t\toutside and look up, I think they\n\t\tcould get a clear picture of you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou said I'm not allowed to leave\n\t\tthe booth.\n\n\tFinally the cell phone stops ringing.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI might be willing to bend the\n\t\trules and let you enjoy your moment\n\t\tof fame.  Set the phone down\n\t\twithout hanging up... and take a\n\t\tstep or two outside.  Just for a\n\t\tminute.  Then come straight back in\n\t\tor I'll be forced to provide 'live'\n\t\tcoverage that should rival the\n\t\thistoric Zapruder footage.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tNothing like an exploding head to\n\t\texcite viewer interest.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo, thanks.  I'll stay where I am.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIt was only a suggestion.  Since\n\t\tyou're convinced I'm going to plug\n\t\tyou anyway, it can't matter much.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIf you shoot me, you give yourself\n\t\taway.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tEven without a muffler, they'd\n\t\tnever hear the report with all this\n\t\tnoise.  Afterwards, it'd take them\n\t\ta good ten minutes to realize you\n\t\tweren't plugged by some overzealous\n\t\tofficer.  Then they'll blame the\n\t\tmedia for inciting a crackpot\n\t\tvigilante to come down here and do\n\t\tthe SWAT team's job for them.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou expected them to come.  You had\n\t\tthis all worked out.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI write the scenario and you all\n\t\tplay your parts -- as directed.\n\n\tThe damned cell phone starts beeping again.  Stu fights the\n\ttemptation to grab for it and hear Kelly's voice for one last\n\ttime.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tPoor Kelly.  What she must be going\n\t\tthrough.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhy don't you tell her how you feel\n\t\tabout her?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'd never get the words out.  Not\n\t\twith fifteen or twenty rounds in\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou can't be certain they'd fire. \n\t\tThey'd see it was only a phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThey wouldn't wait to see.\n\n\tThe cellular ringing continues jangling Stu's nerves.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy doesn't she hang up?\n\n\tThen Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across\n\tthe street behind the police barricades.  Countless faces\n\trubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of\n\tviolence that would end with him face down dead on the\n\tpavement.\n\n\tAnd in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him.  A\n\tfemale, quite pretty... even in tears.  It's Kelly.  (We see\n\ther only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green\n\tjacket that makes her stand out from the crowd.)\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt's her!  She's not calling me. \n\t\tShe's over there.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIs she?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThe blonde girl in the green\n\t\tjacket.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCan't miss her.  Very attractive,\n\t\tisn't she?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tShe must've heard all the commotion\n\t\tand come downstairs.\n\n\tThe cellular is still ringing.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt's somebody else who knows my\n\t\tcell number.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tIt's you!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou continue to impress.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy is it so important that they\n\t\tkill me?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBecause that's how I win.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThis time you won't.  If you want\n\t\tme dead, you'll have to do it\n\t\tyourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tEither way I can't lose.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt's all a game to you -- because\n\t\tyou're incapable of feelings. \n\t\tYou're not even human.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI pride myself on that.  What's so\n\t\tgreat about being human?  It's the\n\t\tlowest form of life on this planet\n\t\tand I've taken it upon myself to\n\t\tthin the herd.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI quit.  I'm not answering back any\n\t\tmore.  I won't hang up but I'm not\n\t\tplaying.\n\n\tThere's silence now between them.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tStu?  Stu, don't be that way. \n\t\tYou're taking the pleasure out of\n\t\tit.\n\n\tStu doesn't take the bait.  He remains absolutely silent.\n\n\tA stalemate has been reached.\n\n\tWE RACK FOCUS ACROSS THE STREET TO THE POLICE\n\n\tclustered behind an emergency vehicle.  The Sergeant brings a\n\tcivilian to meet Captain Ramey of the SWAT unit.  The\n\tnewcomer wears coveralls stenciled \"AT&T.\"  (Although they\n\tare very far away, we hear their voices close up as they come\n\tinto sharper focus.)\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tThis here's Helfand, of New York\n\t\tTelephone.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELFAND\n\t\tGlad to help out.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHave you got the number of that\n\t\tbooth?\n\n\t\t\t\tHELFAND\n\t\tSure do.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tCan you tap into that call?\n\n\t\t\t\tHELFAND\n\t\tIt can be done.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tBut not without a warrant.  You\n\t\tcould be violating this psycho's\n\t\tcivil rights.  Especially if he's\n\t\ton the line with his fucking\n\t\tpsychiatrist.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tShit.  I don't want to blow this on\n\t\ta technicality.  Tracing the call\n\t\tisn't any violation, is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tAs long as we don't listen in.\n\n\tWe remain in LONG SHOT of the POLICE as they continue in\n\theated conversation.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\t\t(to Helfand)\n\t\tOkay, we've got to know who he's\n\t\ttalking to and their current\n\t\tlocation.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELFAND\n\t\tThat I can handle.  As long as they\n\t\tkeep the circuit open.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tI need the number and an address to\n\t\tgo with it.\n\n\tHelfand rushes off.  At the corner, we can glimpse him\n\tentering a phone company utility truck parked on Forty-Fifth\n\tStreet.\n\n\tRACK FOCUS BACK TO PHONE BOOTH\n\n\tStu remains tight lipped and silent, refusing to give his\n\ttormentor the conversation he so craves.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tStuart, my friend.  Do you want to\n\t\tsee how close I can come without\n\t\tactually hitting you?\n\n\tStu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more\n\tpowerful.\n\n\tThere's no glass in the left side of the booth since the late\n\tLeon smashed it all out.\n\n\tNothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tMay I call attention to the yellow\n\t\tpages?\n\n\tThe frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the\n\ttelephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit.\n\n\tThere's been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there\n\tto behold.\n\n\tStu reaches for the phonebook.\n\n\tThere's a bullet hole straight through it.  Pieces of the .30\n\tcalibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are\n\timbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick\n\tvolume.\n\n\tStu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory.  He looks\n\tat them in the palm of his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHollow points are designed to break\n\t\tup on impact.  It would've behaved\n\t\tdifferently if it had pierced your\n\t\tsoft flesh.  The pieces would've\n\t\tbounced around looking for a way\n\t\tout.  That's where the real damage\n\t\toccurs -- finding an exit --\n\t\tdeflecting off all that bone...\n\n\tStu wants to shout \"STOP,\" but restrains himself.  Not\n\ttalking gives him some degree of power.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tStill the silent treatment?  My\n\t\tfather used to dish that out when\n\t\the chose to punish me.  Not a word\n\t\tspoken -- one time for over a\n\t\tmonth.  I'd try and goad him to\n\t\tacknowledge I existed, but he\n\t\tstared right through me.  You're\n\t\tbringing back unhappy childhood,\n\t\tStu.  That's not wise.\n\n\tStu still declines to answer.  His silence seems his only\n\tweapon.  He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto\n\tthe pavement.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tSince you're ignoring me, I'll\n\t\tfocus on someone else.\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tThere she is -- nice and sharp.  I\n\t\tcan see the two little punctures in\n\t\teach earlobe and my God, what kind\n\t\tof a girl would have her nostril\n\t\tpierced?\n\n\tStu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat was that?  Louder, Stu.  We\n\t\tmust have a bad connection.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLeave her out of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI didn't expect her to show up\n\t\there.  But since she has -- I'll\n\t\timprovise.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDon't.  Please don't.  I'm sorry. \n\t\tI'm talking to you again.  I'll\n\t\ttalk all you want!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIt's a bad dye job.  The black\n\t\troots are growing in and it makes\n\t\ther look cheap.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI've screwed up her life enough\n\t\talready.  Please don't hurt her.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI don't necessarily have to kill\n\t\ther.  I could be persuaded to\n\t\tsettle for a reasonable mutilation.\n\t\tWhich part of her displeases you\n\t\tmost?  If she turns a bit more in\n\t\tprofile, I'm accurate enough to\n\t\tremove the tip of her unpleasantly\n\t\tprotruding nose.  It's just\n\t\tcartilage.  Any decent cosmetic\n\t\tsurgeon will have her looking\n\t\tbetter than ever.\n\n\tSTU'S POV - FOCUS SHIFTS TO KELLY\n\n\tin the crowd.

She's identifying\n\t\therself as your wife.  They're very\n\t\tinterested in who you are.  They're\n\t\ttaking her over to see the officer\n\t\tin charge.  What was his name?\n\n\tSNIPER'S POV\n\n\tThrough the cross hairs of the sniperscope, we can see Kelly\n\tconversing with Captain Ramey.

He disconnects.\n\n\tRACK FOCUS TO LONG SHOT --\n\n\tThe police as they react.  We see a flurry of activity across\n\tthe street.  Voices become clear as focus shifts.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tShit.  He hung up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tMaybe they already traced it. \n\t\tAnyhow, it doesn't matter.  Looks\n\t\tlike he's coming out.\n\n\tRACK FOCUS BACK TO STU --\n\n\tslowly stepping out of the booth.  His hands are raised.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tI've giving myself up.  Take me!\n\n\t\t\t\tSWAT OFFICER\n\t\t\t(distant)\n\t\tFirst the gun.  We want to see you\n\t\ttoss away your weapon!\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tShit.  I can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWAT OFFICER\n\t\t\t(distant)\n\t\tFreeze where you are!  Turn around\n\t\tand keep those hands clasped.\n\t\t\t(signals the others)\n\t\tTake him.\n\n\tThe SWAT OFFICERS in protective gear now step out of cover\n\tand fan out as they approach the booth.\n\n\tTIGHTER ON STU\n\n\tHe's just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the sniper's\n\tbullet go through him at any moment.\n\n\tThen the pay phone starts ringing.\n\n\tThe sniper is calling back.\n\n\tRACK FOCUS AGAIN\n\n\tto the police.\n\n\tAll the cops react.  Particularly the Captain and the\n\tSergeant.  Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in\n\tfocus.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tWhat is going on with these fucking\n\t\tphone calls?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tHold your fire.  Let him answer it.\n\n\tThe SWAT team backs up but maintain their aim.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tAre you nuts?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tLet them talk.  He's not going\n\t\tanywhere.\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tHe's going back inside the booth.\n\n\tIndeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick\n\tup the receiver.\n\n\tFOCUS RETURNS TO STU\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tYeah?\n\n\tA strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish.  Totally\n\tunintelligible to Stu.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tYou got the wrong number.  Hang up.\n\n\tThe voice, probably a Puerto Rican gentleman, rattles on in\n\tSpanish.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWrong number.  Wrong number.\n\n\tThen the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic\n\taccent.  It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAw, relax, Stu.  Only yanking your\n\t\tchain.  Now can we start over?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThose cops won't wait much longer.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat else can they do?  They can't\n\t\tafford to just shoot you like I\n\t\tcan.  Not with so much media\n\t\tcoverage.  Not unless you make some\n\t\tstupid aggressive move.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tThe ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up.\n\n\tAcross the street, Stu can see various TV units from local\n\tstations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWill you look at that?  I must be\n\t\tgoing out over the network.  Bet\n\t\tthey're pre-empting usual\n\t\tprogramming.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAnd just think -- if you survive\n\t\tthis, your trial will be televised. \n\t\tAnd you can try and make the world\n\t\tbelieve I ever existed.  I'd be\n\t\tyour only defense.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHow are they gonna prove that I\n\t\tkilled anybody when there's no gun?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThey'll plant one.  The police\n\t\taren't above that -- when they're\n\t\tdesperate to convict.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo, sir.  No gun and I walk.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't you think I took that into\n\t\taccount?  Am I a fool?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHaven't I considered every\n\t\teventuality?  I knew they'd come\n\t\tand cordon off the block.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd that there'd have to be a gun\n\t\tsomeplace.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhere?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIt's a small booth, Stu.  Have you\n\t\tchecked every inch of it?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(looking up and down)\n\t\tIt's not on the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThen what's left?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tUp above.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCould be.  Why don't you reach up\n\t\tthere and lift the plastic sheet --\n\t\tand feel around.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIf they see me reach for something,\n\t\tthey could open fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThey could.  But you have to know\n\t\tif it's there.  Don't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI totally don't give a shit.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIn a narrow space, tucked just to\n\t\tthe left of the fluorescent bulb. \n\t\tYou can almost see it outlined if\n\t\tyou look closely.\n\n\tStu peers upward at the clouded plastic, now stained and\n\tdirty.  There are shadows of objects above in the shallows\n\tarea around the light fixture that automatically goes on when\n\tthe door to the phone booth is tightly closed.\n\n\tStu opens and closes the door a few times, watching the light\n\tclick on -- watching the shadows around the light.\n\n\tCould that be an accumulation of dirt, dust, or dead insects? \n\tOr could something be stashed up there?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt doesn't matter.  I know about\n\t\tballistics.  The slug in that dead\n\t\tguy came from your rifle, not any\n\t\thandgun.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou saw how hollow points splinter\n\t\ton impact.  There's nothing much\n\t\tfor ballistics to match to.  The\n\t\tsame make .30 calibre bullets are\n\t\tin that handgun.  The prosecution\n\t\trests.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThere's no gun up there.  I don't\n\t\tsee a damn thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tSlide your finger up under the\n\t\tplastic and you'll feel the cold\n\t\tmetal surface.  There are four\n\t\trounds left in it.  Should you\n\t\tdecide to shoot your way out.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI could never shoot anybody.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou could shoot me, Stu.  You'd do\n\t\tthat in a minute if you could.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAnd I'd fucking love it!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tNow you're speaking from the heart. \n\t\tCome on, just lift the partition a\n\t\tfew inches and feel what's there\n\t\tfor you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm not getting my fingerprints on\n\t\tyour fucking weapon.  What about\n\t\tpowder residue?  How are they going\n\t\tto explain that to a jury?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDo you think that'll matter with so\n\t\tmany eye witnesses?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tDo it... or should I re-focus my\n\t\tattention on Kelly?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou carefully distracted me from\n\t\ther before and I let you get away\n\t\twith it.  But if you're not going\n\t\tto play fairly --\n\t\t\t(a pause)\n\t\tThere she is again.  So close I\n\t\tfeel like I could touch her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tGet off her!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThen mind me when I speak.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLook!  I'm reaching up with my left\n\t\thand.  I'm pushing against the\n\t\tpartition.  It's giving.  I'm\n\t\tfeeling around with my fingertips. \n\t\tIt's filthy up there.\n\n\tTIGHT SHOT - STU'S FINGERS\n\n\tfeel about inside the shallow space.  The shriveled remains\n\tof dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a .30 handgun.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm -- touching something.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOne of the finest handguns\n\t\tRemington makes.  Lightweight,\n\t\tefficient and highly accurate.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm not picking it up.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tNot right now.  But eventually...\n\n\tStu lowers his hand, still empty.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI wouldn't have a chance.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI never said you would.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm not insane.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBut you're getting there.  It\n\t\twouldn't take much.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThat won't happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou could pull the gun down, shove\n\t\tit in your own mouth and jerk the\n\t\ttrigger.  That's another option.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhy would I do that?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tTo please me.  And ensure that\n\t\tnothing happens to Kelly.  I don't\n\t\tnecessarily have to deal with her\n\t\ttoday in the midst of a crowd of\n\t\tcops.  I can take her out any time\n\t\tI like.  When she goes to pull down\n\t\ther blinds at night or when she\n\t\twalks the dog first thing in the\n\t\tmorning.  What is it -- a Jack\n\t\tRussell?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tOkay.  I know you can do it.  But\n\t\tdon't talk about that.  Please.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'd rather see you remembered as\n\t\tthe gallant gunman who tried to\n\t\tshoot his way past an army of\n\t\tpolice -- than as a coward who\n\t\tsucked the barrel.  I'm doing your\n\t\tPR for you.  Creating a final image\n\t\tthat'll endure.  The outraged New\n\t\tYorker who was pushed too far. \n\t\tWhen some lowlife street person\n\t\ttries to invade his territory, he\n\t\tretaliated.  And when the forces of\n\t\tthe law closed in, he was\n\t\tdefiant... to the end.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tLike that nerdy sonofabitch who\n\t\tblew those three wiseass kids away\n\t\ton the subway?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tExactly.  Nobody minded that he was\n\t\ta sicko.  He was living out a New\n\t\tYorker's pet fantasy.  Can you\n\t\tremember that movie where Peter\n\t\tFinch started screaming 'I'm not\n\t\ttaking it anymore!'  And everybody\n\t\tpicked up on it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t'I'm mad as hell and I'm not taking\n\t\tit anymore.'\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat was it.  Poor Finch got\n\t\thimself an Oscar for that.  But he\n\t\twas dead by then.  I mean he really\n\t\tdied.  Maybe playing that part took\n\t\ttoo much out of him.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(softly to himself)\n\t\t'I'm not taking it anymore.'  'I'm\n\t\tnot taking it anymore.'\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat's the way!  Psyche yourself\n\t\tup.  Everybody respects a man who\n\t\tfights back, even if he goes a\n\t\tlittle berserk in the process.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tFighting back.  That's what it's\n\t\tabout.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tExactly!  We all understand the\n\t\tpoor schmuck that gets laid off and\n\t\tcomes back and shoots all his\n\t\tbosses.  We all thought of doing\n\t\tthat.  But only he had the balls. \n\t\tThe terminally ill husband who gets\n\t\this policy canceled and machine\n\t\tguns the insurance company offices. \n\t\tMaybe somebody will finally get the\n\t\tmessage.  You can fuck human beings\n\t\tover only for so long before they\n\t\tcome back at you.  I'm still\n\t\tholding on Kelly and she looks very\n\t\tconcerned.  I could relieve all\n\t\tthat anguish in a fraction of a\n\t\tsecond.  Shall I?\n\n\tStu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man\n\ton the line has done to him.  His turn has come to fight\n\tback.  He has an idea.\n\n\tIf the sniper is focused on Kelly, he can't be watching Stu.\n\n\tTurning his back to the police, Stu slowly sinks to his\n\tknees.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm on my knees begging you.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tStand up, Stu.  You're embarrassing\n\t\tyourself.\n\n\tTIGHT ANGLE --\n\n\tStu now down on his knees in the booth.  He's curled up\n\talmost into a fetal position.\n\n\tBy doing so, he hopes to hide the fact that he's reaching\n\tinto his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone.\n\n\tHe half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the\n\tsniper or the cops.  But nothing happens.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tStu -- I want you back on your feet\n\t\tfacing me.  So you can see what I'm\n\t\tgoing to do to her.\n\n\tStu ignores the command.  He's quickly dialing.\n\n\t911.\n\n\tHe's calling police emergency.\n\n\tSNIPER'S POV\n\n\tStu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope,\n\tcrouched, doubled up at the foot of the booth.  But the cell\n\tphone is hidden in front of him.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBe a man, Stuart.  Don't let them\n\t\tsee you like this.  You're an\n\t\tembarrassment to me.\n\n\tWIDER SHOT - THE BOOTH\n\n\twith Stu still kneeling.\n\n\tRACK FOCUS\n\n\tto police across the street as their voices become clear --\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\t\t(listening to\n\t\t\ttransmission)\n\t\tOfficer on east side of the street\n\t\treports subject removed a dark\n\t\tmetallic object from his pocket. \n\t\tWe better move.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHold all fire until you actually\n\t\tidentify a weapon.  We're doing\n\t\tthis on fucking TV!\n\n\tRACK FOCUS BACK TO -- STU IN THE BOOTH\n\n\tcrouched forward.  The pay phone receiver dangles just above\n\this head.  The cellular remains cupped in his hand.\n\n\tStu never lifts the cell phone.  He keeps the palm of his\n\thand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from\n\tthe other end.\n\n\tIt rings and finally someone answers.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMERGENCY OPERATOR\n\t\t\t(faint)\n\t\tPolice.  Is this an emergency? \n\t\tHello?  Is someone on the line?\n\n\tBut Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he\n\tnow grips in his other hand.  Hoping that his words will be\n\tpicked up by the emergency operator listening via the\n\tcellular.  To help in this regard, he reaches back and slides\n\tthe door to the booth tightly closed.\n\n\tHe pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are\n\tmeant for the 911 operator to hear.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(loud)\n\t\tYou've made your point.  Who's\n\t\tgoing to believe I've got a sniper\n\t\twith a telescopic sight holding me\n\t\tin a fucking phone booth at 45th\n\t\tand 8th?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tIt took you a while to believe it\n\t\tyourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIf you'd put a bullet in that\n\t\tCaptain Ramey, it would've been a\n\t\tdifferent story -- but you were too\n\t\twise to do that.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhy don't you do it for me?  Wave\n\t\tthe old captain back over and get\n\t\thim nice and close and then use the\n\t\thandgun on him.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(talking loud)\n\t\tWhy me?  You could pick off any of\n\t\tthose cops from your window up\n\t\tthere.  Like you did that pimp. \n\t\tAnd that tourist last week.  But\n\t\tthis time you want me to do your\n\t\tkilling for you.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAnd you will!  To save Kelly.\n\n\tEXTREME TIGHT SHOT - CELL PHONE\n\n\tcupped in Stu's hand and held low.  Can they hear him on the\n\tother end?\n\n\t\t\t\tEMERGENCY OPERATOR\n\t\t\t(muffled, almost\n\t\t\tinaudible)\n\t\tCan you speak up, sir?  What is\n\t\tyour name?\n\n\tStu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the\n\temergency operator.  He sets the cell phone down flat on the\n\tfloor of the booth facing upward.  He puts his foot over the\n\treceiving end to muffle the incoming voice.  Then he stands\n\tup.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThat's better, Stu.  Now turn\n\t\taround so I can see you.\n\n\tStu talks close into the pay phone receiver now.  But keeps\n\this voice raised.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThis booth.  It's my whole world --\n\t\tshrunk down to four feet by three\n\t\tfeet.  Not much bigger than the\n\t\tsize of a coffin.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThey can put handles on the booth\n\t\tand bury you in it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(loudly into pay phone)\n\t\tWhen I saw you put that bullet into\n\t\tthat black dude, I knew you'd never\n\t\tlet me out of this phone booth\n\t\talive.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou're wasting my time.  Reach up\n\t\tand take the gun.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(peering upward,\n\t\t\tsquinting)\n\t\tLet me see you first.  What harm\n\t\tcan that do you?  You're in one of\n\t\tthose windows.  I've got to know\n\t\twhich one.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tNo need for that.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tBeing so far, I could never\n\t\tidentify you.  I don't even want\n\t\tto.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhat is it then?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDon't worry that I'd try to point\n\t\tyou out.  You'd shut me up with one\n\t\tof your .30 calibre hollow points\n\t\tbefore I could even raise a finger.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhy does it matter so much?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI want to see that you exist.  Like\n\t\tGod exists.  It's not enough to\n\t\tbelieve.  You want to see him --\n\t\tjust once -- even at a distance.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAnd then you'd take the gun down. \n\t\tAnd use it.  We have a deal on\n\t\tthat?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tShow yourself to me and I'll take\n\t\tthe gun down.  I swear.\n\n\tThere's a pause as the sniper mulls it over.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI don't have to make deals.  And\n\t\tyou're irritating me by trying to\n\t\tnegotiate.  God doesn't have to\n\t\tprove anything.  He just strikes\n\t\tyou down when he gets in the mood.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tStop!  I won't ask to see you\n\t\tanymore.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'm glad that's settled.  But look\n\t\twho else has showed up?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWho?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI guess she saw the coverage on TV\n\t\tand just couldn't keep away.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat are you talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThe 'hotel' just arrived.  And a\n\t\tvery beautiful little hotel she is. \n\t\tActually, I'd classify her as more\n\t\tof a motel.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tMavis?  I don't see her.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tShe's too far back behind the\n\t\tpolice line.  But I've got a fine\n\t\tshot at her from up here.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou don't even know what she looks\n\t\tlike.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou're in an enviable position now,\n\t\tStu.  You get to choose between\n\t\tthem.  Tell me which one.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhich will it be?  Kelly or Mavis? \n\t\tOr should I simply select one?\n\n\tINSERT SHOT - THE CELL PHONE\n\n\tlying face up on the floor of the booth.  Is anybody\n\tlistening?\n\n\tBACK TO STU\n\n\tStu looks down at the cellular.  He has no way of knowing if\n\tthe police operator can hear any of his words.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI need time to think...\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tYou've got to be more in touch with\n\t\tyour feelings.  You said you love\n\t\tKelly.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI do.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThen I'm doing you a favor putting\n\t\tyou out of the way of temptation.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt wasn't Mavis' fault.  It was all\n\t\tmy fault.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThen take the third option.  Reach\n\t\tabove you and pick up the gun.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tYou'll leave them both alone?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThere won't be much point in\n\t\tharming them without you around to\n\t\timpress.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'll do it.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tLet me see you do it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI need one minute.  One last\n\t\tminute, please.  Can you give me\n\t\tthat?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't tell me you're going to say\n\t\tyour prayers?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tSomething like that.\n\n\tWE RACK FOCUS AWAY TO LONG SHOT - THE POLICE\n\n\tassembled on the opposite side of the street.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tThey should've traced the fucking\n\t\tcall by now.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\t\t(listening on transmitter)\n\t\tThere's something else coming in. \n\t\tA 911 operator says your name was\n\t\tmentioned by somebody that's still\n\t\ton the line.  Somebody talking\n\t\tabout a phone booth.  And a sniper.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tPatch me through.  Hello, this is\n\t\tCaptain Edward Ramey.  What about\n\t\tthat call?\n\n\t\t\t\tEMERGENCY OPERATOR\n\t\tThe line is still open.  It's\n\t\toriginating from a booth at 45th\n\t\tand 8th.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWe're there!  Can you play me back\n\t\tyour recording of the entire call?\n\n\t\t\t\tEMERGENCY OPERATOR\n\t\tI can't replay the tape while it's\n\t\tstill running.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tThen switch to another machine and\n\t\tplay back what you've got.\n\n\t\t\t\tEMERGENCY OPERATOR\n\t\tIt's awful faint.  He's not talking\n\t\tdirectly into the receiver.\n\n\tRamey begins to listen.  We hear snatches of Stu's call\n\tpicking up words which are at times incomprehensible.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU'S VOICE\n\t\t\t(faint)\n\t\t'Who's going to believe I've got a\n\t\tsniper with a telescopic sight\n\t\tholding me in some fucking phone\n\t\tbooth...'\n\n\tThe uniformed TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN now joins Ramey and the\n\tSergeant.\n\n\t\t\t\tTELEPHONE TECHNICIAN\n\t\tGot what you wanted.  The call's\n\t\tcoming from up the street.  The\n\t\tHotel Broadway.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHave you got the room?\n\n\t\t\t\tTELEPHONE TECHNICIAN\n\t\tIt's not that easy.  Electronic\n\t\tswitchboard.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\t\t(to Sergeant)\n\t\tMove your SWAT units to the hotel. \n\t\tNo... wait.  Any movement will\n\t\talert the sniper.  If he sees any\n\t\tof us withdraw, he may panic.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tThere's another SWAT unit on the\n\t\tway.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tIntercept them.  Divert them to the\n\t\thotel.\n\n\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n\t\tIt's done.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tSend them in from the Forty-third\n\t\tStreet side.  I don't want any\n\t\tactivity the sniper might catch\n\t\tsight of.  He's probably high up\n\t\tand facing that booth.  He's got to\n\t\tcontinue to believe our full\n\t\tattention is focused on the man\n\t\tinside -- whoever the hell that\n\t\tpoor bastard is.\n\t\t\t(to emergency operator)\n\t\tHello 911 operator, I missed some\n\t\tof that.  Run it halfway back and\n\t\trepeat it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU'S VOICE (REPLAY)\n\t\t\t(faint)\n\t\t'... Like you did that pimp.  And\n\t\tthat tourist last week.  But this\n\t\ttime you want me to do the killing\n\t\tfor you...'\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\t\t(listening)\n\t\tJesus... he's a dead man.\n\n\tBACK INSIDE PHONE BOOTH\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThe police seem all excited about\n\t\tsomething, Stu.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAre they?  I wasn't looking.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI can't wait any longer.  Say amen,\n\t\tthen reach up for the gun.  When\n\t\tyour hand comes down, I want to see\n\t\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm too afraid.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tFor once, be brave.  Surprise\n\t\tyourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'm shaking all over.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tGuys in combat situations even shit\n\t\ttheir pants.  But they follow\n\t\torders.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tAs soon as the cops see a gun,\n\t\tthey'll open fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThen I'd advise you to fire first.\n\n\tStu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower.\n\n\tHis fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that\n\tcover the roof of the booth.  It raises up easily at the\n\tmiddle where two sheets join.\n\n\tTIGHT INSERT SHOT\n\n\tThe space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of\n\tclouded plastic.  We see the fluorescent lighting fixture\n\tcovered with dust.  The solitary object -- a cruel-looking\n\tweapon.\n\n\tNow Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space.  He\n\ttouches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the\n\troughness of the grip.\n\n\tTIGHT SHOT - STU'S FACE\n\n\tas below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony --\n\n\tThe sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed\n\ttightly shut.  He can already imagine the police bullets\n\ttearing into him.\n\n\tA POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICE SNIPER\n\t\t\t(into transmitter)\n\t\tGive me the word.\n\n\tRACK BACK TO STU - IN THE BOOTH\n\n\tHis arm still raised.  He hasn't brought it down with the gun\n\tin it.  Not yet.  He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up\n\tagainst his mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHard part's over.  Drop your arm\n\t\tand point it like you'd point your\n\t\tfinger and squeeze.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.  You do it.  If you want me\n\t\tdead, then fucking murder me!\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhy must I keep invoking some poor\n\t\tgirl's name every time we come to\n\t\tan impasse?  I'm focused back on\n\t\tKelly again.  You're obviously not\n\t\twilling to trade your life for\n\t\thers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI am!  I'm doing it!\n\n\tHe pulls the handgun down into full view.  Curiously, the\n\tpolice do not open fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThere!  You see it?  They all see\n\t\tit.\n\n\tHe waves the gun so nobody can miss it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhere are you?  Damn you!!\n\n\tHe drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth.\n\n\tStill the cops do not open fire.\n\n\tThen Stu starts shooting.\n\n\tNot at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the\n\tstreet.\n\n\tAt the thousands of windows that look down upon him.\n\n\tHe gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out\n\tin response.\n\n\tRACK FOCUS TO THE POLICE SNIPER\n\n\tHe has fired.\n\n\tANGLE ON STU\n\n\tThe remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters. \n\tStu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the\n\tpavement.\n\n\tRACK FOCUS TO KELLY\n\n\tShe screams, tries to break through but cops restrain her.\n\n\tINT.  PHONE BOOTH\n\n\tANGLE ON DANGLING RECEIVER\n\n\tas it sways back and forth.  From it, we hear the voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tThanks for such an interesting\n\t\tafternoon.\n\n\tTHEN THERE ARE OTHER SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE DANGLING\n\tSWAYING PHONE.\n\n\tA wooden door being battered open.  A few incomprehensible\n\tshouts as a SWAT TEAM dashes in.  Stu's stalling for time has\n\tpaid off.\n\n\tTHE SOUND OF A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE.\n\n\tTHE SOUND OF A MUFFLED SCREAM.\n\n\tThe police have broken in on Stu's tormentor and there has\n\tbeen a rapid exchange of shots.\n\n\tA HAND reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver.\n\n\tANGLE WIDENS as Ramey places it to his ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHello?  This is Captain Ramey. \n\t\tSomebody talk to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tSWAT OFFICER'S VOICE\n\t\tYeah.  We took him out, Captain. \n\t\tNobody else got hurt.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWhat's his condition?\n\n\t\t\t\tSWAT OFFICER'S VOICE\n\t\tCritical.  The sonofabitch took\n\t\ttwo.  Probably won't survive the\n\t\tride.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tGet a statement from him.  I'll be\n\t\tright over.\n\n\tHe drops the receiver so that it dangles again.\n\n\tCAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and\n\tmedics.  He's stunned, but very much alive.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\tDon't try to sit up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat was that?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\t\t(kneeling)\n\t\tRubber bullet.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\tYou'll have one hell of a nasty\n\t\twelt.  Busted rib.  Maybe a\n\t\tpermanent scar there.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt couldn't hurt much more if you\n\t\treally shot me.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tSomebody was going to and we\n\t\tthought it may as well be us.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tDid you get him?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tSure as hell did.  Thanks to you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tStill alive?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tBarely.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\tWe'll be giving him a hypo for the\n\t\tpain.  It'll put him out for a\n\t\twhile.\n\n\tKelly is now brought over by a female cop.  She drops to her\n\tknees beside Stu and tries to embrace him.  The medics\n\trestrain her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tIt's okay.  I'm not really shot.\n\n\t\t\t\tKELLY\n\t\tI was so afraid.  I thought...\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI thought so, too.  But we're going\n\t\tto be alright.  Both of us.\n\n\t\t\t\tKELLY\n\t\tRemember how you swore up and down\n\t\tyou'd get me on TV?  Well, you did. \n\t\tI already got interviewed on Fox\n\t\tand Channel Eleven and they even\n\t\twant me on A.M. America tomorrow\n\t\tmorning.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tBet you didn't think I could\n\t\tdeliver on that.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\tWill you please let go of him,\n\t\tMiss?\n\n\tA gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance.  The medic\n\tis about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.  No hypo.  I want to see him\n\t\tfirst.\n\n\tThe medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart\n\thim off.  But Stu struggles against them.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tRelax.  The guy's dying.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tThat's why I've gotta talk to him. \n\t\tPlease!\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tWe'll see.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEDIC\n\t\t\t(to Kelly)\n\t\tYou can ride with him in the\n\t\tambulance.\n\n\tThe woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance.\n\n\tRamey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team\n\tinside the hotel.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tThis is Ramey.  Over.  This is\n\t\tRamey.  Ten-Four.\n\n\tThere's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple\n\tgarbled voices on the other end of the line.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tShit.  Get everybody off this\n\t\twavelength.\n\n\tHe crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling\n\treceiver.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHello.  Hello!  Pick up!  Yeah,\n\t\tit's Ramey again.  Can you hold the\n\t\tphone close enough so the perp can\n\t\tlisten?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP'S VOICE\n\t\tHe's not saying a word, Captain.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHe's not about to talk to us. \n\t\tMaybe to him.\n\n\tRamey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift\n\tStu onto the gurney.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tForget that.  Stand him up.\n\t\t\t(to Stu)\n\t\tCan you stand?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI can try.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHelp him over here.\n\n\tThe medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth.  It's\n\tpainful, but Stu ignores it.\n\n\tRamey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tHere.  Speak up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tIt's me.  Do you hear me?  Answer\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t(wheezing)\n\t\tHad to have the last word, Stu.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI finally beat your ass.  Admit it,\n\t\tyou fuck.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tBut you'll never forget me.  I gave\n\t\tyou the most thrilling day of your\n\t\tlife.  Say thanks.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNow you're gonna die, you bastard.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI lost a lot of blood.  Don't you\n\t\twant to donate some for me?  Then\n\t\twe'd really be part of each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tHang on.  I can't wait to see you\n\t\tat the hospital.  So I can yank\n\t\tyour fucking air tube out.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWish I could give you that\n\t\tpleasure.  You deserve it.\n\t\t\t(coughing)\n\t\t... Only I'm out of time.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tWhat's your name?  At least tell me\n\t\twho you are.\n\n\tThere's more violent coughing, then silence.  Then a cop's\n\tvoice is heard.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP'S VOICE\n\t\tHe's gone.\n\n\tStu stares at the receiver.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAMEY\n\t\tDon't worry.  We'll find out who he\n\t\tis.  And why he picked you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tNo.  You won't.\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tWhat do you want to bet you won't?\n\n\tStu reaches over and hangs up the receiver.  CLICK.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\tI'll spend my whole life trying to\n\t\tfigure that out.\n\n\tThen he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto\n\tthe waiting gurney.\n\n\tThe hypo is finally administered.  It kicks in immediately,\n\trelieving the pain.\n\n\tHe's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance. \n\tKelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the\n\thospital.\n\n\tSTU'S POV - BEING WHEELED AWAY FROM THE EMPTY BOOTH\n\n\tpulling away in LOW ANGLE.\n\n\tCAMERA SLIDES BACK inside the ambulance with Stu.  The doors\n\tshut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his\n\tentire world until moments ago.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTU\n\t\t\t(groggy)\n\t\tGotta sleep now.  No phone calls...\n\n\tKelly smiles down at him as the image blurs.  Stu passes out \n\t-- into a deep sleep he much deserves.\n\n\tA SIREN BLARES.\n\n\tCUT TO BLACK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone Booth\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Larry Cohen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:32:56.758841"}
