A sea of humanity.  People\n\tcome and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another.\n\n\tA TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction\n\tworkers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS\n\tPEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a\n\tpasserby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking.\n\n\tWe're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've\n\tcome to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound.\n\n\tMULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East\n\tSide and West Side -- uptown and down.\n\n\tOne frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he\n\ttakes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver\n\tviolently against the coin box until the instrument splinters\n\tinto a dozen pieces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNARRATOR\n</b>\t\tThere are 237,911 pay telephones in\n\t\tthe five burroughs of the city of\n\t\tNew York.

At\n\t\tthirty-five cents a pop... for the\n\t\tfirst three minutes.\n\n<b>\tANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY\n</b>\n\tThere's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the\n\tstreet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNARRATOR\n</b>\t\tYou're looking at the telephone\n\t\tbooth at the corner of 45th Street\n\t\tand 8th Avenue in the heart of the\n\t\tManhattan theatrical district.

This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair\n\tstyled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly\n\ttakes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen\n\tsuit and silk Armani tie.\n\n\tHe's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a\n\tmiddle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby\n\trestaurant and has finally caught up with him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARIO\n</b>\t\tStu, we got to talk.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tWish I could accommodate you,\n\t\tMario, but this is my busy time of\n\t\tday.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARIO\n</b>\t\tHow come you cross the street every\n\t\ttime you go past the restaurant?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tWhy don't I stop in later for some\n\t\tlunch?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARIO\n</b>\t\tThere's no more drinks or free\n\t\tmeals until the restaurant starts\n\t\tshowing up in the columns like you\n\t\tsaid.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tI'm doing my level best for you\n\t\tpeople.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARIO\n</b>\t\tOne lousy mention in the Post and\n\t\tyou expect to eat for six months!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tI got the food critic from the\n\t\tVillage Voice all lined up to give\n\t\tyou a review.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARIO\n</b>\t\tThat's what you tell me last July. \n\t\tAnd he never shows.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tI was allowing you time to expand\n\t\tthe menu.

Other kids\n\t\twould fall apart if anybody called\n\t\tthem a fucking name.  Me, I just\n\t\tloved the attention!  'Shit-for-\n\t\tbrains' -- that's what the bigger\n\t\tkids named me.  And I answered to\n\t\tit.  Hey, 'shit-for brains'\n\t\treporting for duty.  Everybody\n\t\tloved me for that.  I could take\n\t\tabuse.  After a while, I kind of\n\t\twore them down.  There was nothing\n\t\tmore they could say to me.  So they\n\t\tstopped.  I kind of missed it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARIO\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry I even talked to you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tI'll bet your loving wife put you\n\t\tup to this.

Not\n\t\tto mention a million college\n\t\tgraduates coming into the\n\t\tprofession trying to cut me out. \n\t\tAnd one thing you can't expect from\n\t\tyour clients is loyalty.

And the rickety booth is not too sturdy.  It\n\tstarts rocking back and forth.\n\n\tStu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tThis isn't my fault.\n\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\tStop that!\n\n\tBut Leon continues rocking the booth.

He doesn't\n\trealize he's been shot.\n\n\tThere's been no sound of gunfire.  Perhaps a silencer was\n\tused -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary\n\tdischarge.\n\n\tLeon looks confused at first.  His ladyfriend has no idea\n\the's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people\n\twho've assembled on the corner.\n\n\tEven Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the\n\twound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest.\n\n\tHe isn't assaulting the booth anymore.  He's trying to keep\n\this balance.  He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for\n\tsupport -- only a few inches from Stu's face.  The blood runs\n\tdown the side of the booth.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\t\t(into pay phone)\n\t\tYou did it!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tYou said 'yes.'\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tI said 'Yes, I can hear you.'

She sees the blood.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n</b>\t\tI warned you not to cut yourself.\n\t\t\t(to crowd)\n\t\tLook at all that blood.  He must've\n\t\thit an artery.\n\n\tShe screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement.  Now\n\this chest wound is evident.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n</b>\t\tOh, Jesus.  What is that?  Talk to\n\t\tme!  What happened?\n\n\tThe crowd tightens around the fallen body.

Yes.  There's been a\n\t\tshooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth \n\t\t-- on the corner.  A man is down. \n\t\tWhat's the difference who I am?

The cops are\n\t\there.\n\n\tPolice cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue.\n\n\tTraffic has suddenly been shut down.  Prowl cars have now\n\tblocked the streets.\n\n\tPRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective\n\twithout intercuts.\n\n\tHalf a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n</b>\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tThat's him -- in the booth.  He's\n\t\tgot a gun!\n\n\tAs she hurls accusations, she's lugging Leon's lifeless body\n\tout into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue.\n\n\tIt's a bright afternoon.  In the distance, we hear the\n\tmaddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being\n\trerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of\n\tirate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their\n\tsimplest form of protest.  It's a discordant concert that\n\techoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels...\n\n\tAs the cops surround the booth -- at a distance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSERGEANT\n</b>\t\t\t(into bullhorn)\n\t\tThrow down your weapon and come out\n\t\twith your hands raised.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tThey're ordering me to come out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tI can see that.

What is\n\t\tyour name?\n\n\tStu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the\n\temergency operator.  He sets the cell phone down flat on the\n\tfloor of the booth facing upward.  He puts his foot over the\n\treceiving end to muffle the incoming voice.  Then he stands\n\tup.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tThat's better, Stu.  Now turn\n\t\taround so I can see you.\n\n\tStu talks close into the pay phone receiver now.  But keeps\n\this voice raised.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\tThis booth.  It's my whole world --\n\t\tshrunk down to four feet by three\n\t\tfeet.  Not much bigger than the\n\t\tsize of a coffin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tThey can put handles on the booth\n\t\tand bury you in it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSTU\n</b>\t\t\t(loudly into pay phone)\n\t\tWhen I saw you put that bullet into\n\t\tthat black dude, I knew you'd never\n\t\tlet me out of this phone booth\n\t\talive.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\t\tYou're wasting my time.

It raises up easily at the\n\tmiddle where two sheets join.\n\n<b>\tTIGHT INSERT SHOT\n</b>\n\tThe space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of\n\tclouded plastic.  We see the fluorescent lighting fixture\n\tcovered with dust.  The solitary object -- a cruel-looking\n\tweapon.\n\n\tNow Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space.  He\n\ttouches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the\n\troughness of the grip.\n\n<b>\tTIGHT SHOT - STU'S FACE\n</b>\n\tas below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony --\n\n\tThe sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed\n\ttightly shut.
