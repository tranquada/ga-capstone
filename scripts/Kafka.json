It's very early in the twisted\n        streets of this ancient ghetto.  Dark corners casting a\n        medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their\n        romance and mystery.\n\n        The River is the dividing line.  Elegant gardens on the\n        opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New\n        Town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky.\n\n        An empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street.\n\n        A Gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city.\n        Its half-moon arches becoming circles as they meet their\n        reflections in the water.  Thin mist swirls over the\n        cobblestones above.\n\n        A few boats in the water.  Fishermen casting their lines in\n        silence.  One or two lights now burning in buildings beyond.\n\n        In the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral\n        strikes six.\n\n                                                       CUT:\n\n        A MAN'S FACE\n\n        His eyes filled with terror, beads of sweat crawling on his\n        brow.\n\n        He stands in the middle of a murky courtyard, perfectly\n        still.  Waiting.  Watching.\n\n        The balconies overlooking on successive floors, looming all\n        around him, are empty.  All is quiet.\n\n        The man's name is EDUARD.  He dares not move for fear of\n        missing a single sound.  And then he hears it.  A small noise\n        of movement nearby.  He runs.\n\n        TINY ALLEYWAY\n\n        He runs alone in the dim light of the deserted morning.\n\n        CROOKED PASSAGEWAY\n\n        Running for his life.\n\n        NARROW LANE\n\n        Running on sheer pumping fear, long after the verge of\n        collapse.\n\n        BLACK TUNNEL\n\n        Coming out into the light, but by no means out of danger, he\n        allows himself a brief pause, gasping for air, just for a\n        moment looking back into the gloom, starting to retreat again\n        even as he does, then turning running ...\n\n        WINDING STREET\n\n        He runs on, past boarded-up houses and shuttered inns,\n        strange relics of the Middle Ages casting frightening\n        shadows.\n\n        AROUND A CORNER\n\n        Eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back\n        against the large notice board that covers the wall here,\n        layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on\n        it.\n\n        He breathes painfully in short bursts, as silently as he\n        can.  He watches the corner he's just come from, the ornate\n        archway through which any pursuer must emerge.\n\n        Nothing there.  But then a shadow moves.\n\n        Eduard's shoulders tense.  His eyes widen.  He holds his\n        breath.\n\n        The shadow ... spreading ...\n\n        Eduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze\n        on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice\n        board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the\n        posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments\n        behind, Eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all\n        and --\n\n        A HAND!  clamps over his face from behind.  All of a sudden\n        and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about\n        it.\n\n        But he tries, his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps\n        him, an arm of iron.\n\n        The hand is huge.  It covers Eduard's face almost entirely,\n        only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers, ghastly\n        fingers that, just for a second, seem almost inhuman, perhaps\n        even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand, a hand\n        covered in scar tissue, starting to squeeze as it pulls\n        Eduard swiftly away.\n\n                                                       CUT:\n\n        A ROW OF TYPEWRITERS - DAY\n\n        Clacketing incessantly under slightly more agile and refined\n        fingers.  Beyond these, another row of desks.  And beyond\n        that another, the office workers in their neat suits tapping\n        away.\n\n        And beyond that another, at which one worker scribbles\n        furiously at his figures, the next rolls a new sheet into his\n        typewriter, the next answers his clanging telephone, the next\n        rifles through the pages of a massive record book, the next\n        sits erect in his chair playing his machine like a piano, and\n        the last, by the window, dusty light streaming across him,\n        contemplatively taps the end of a pencil onto his desk.  This\n        is KAFKA.\n\n        A rather tall young man with a kind, sensitive face.\n        sensitive perhaps because his eyes, ears, and nose seem\n        slightly bigger and more inquiring than most, and his gaze\n        one of almost unrelenting intensity.\n\n        He's looking off at something now.\n\n        A desk, not very far from his own.  But empty.  The chair\n        pushed squarely under it.  The typewriter covered.\n\n        Kafka is wondering why -- when his concentration is\n        interrupted.\n\n                                  BURGEL\n                      Kafka.\n\n        Kafka turns to see BURGEL, a creep.\n\n                                  BURGEL\n                      The keeper of the files is still\n                      waiting for your final summation\n                      of the Erlanger claim.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I gave it to him yesterday.\n\n                                  BURGEL\n                            (doesn't understand)\n                      You didn't give it to me.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      No, I left it in his office.\n\n                                  BURGEL\n                      Did you see him?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I've never seen him.

He knocks on a\n        door.  Waits.  Knocks again.  Leans a little closer to listen\n        for a moment, then goes away back down the stairs.\n\n        GROUND FLOOR\n\n        Kafka comes through the door that divides the stairs from the\n        hall, goes to knock on the door of the first apartment down\n        here.\n\n                                  BIZARRE VOICE\n                      Yes?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I'm sorry to disturb you -- I\n                      wonder if you know where my\n                      friend Eduard is?\n\n                                  BIZARRE VOICE\n                      I can't hear you! -- You'd better\n                      come in.\n\n        APARTMENT\n\n        Kafka comes in tentatively, seeing the CONCIERGE in a far\n        corner of the cluttered room, in bed, covers tucked right up\n        to her chin.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      -- I didn't want to bother you.\n\n                                  CONCIERGE\n                      Well, you have.

But perhaps not.\n        Bizzlebek steps out, buttoning his coat.\n\n                                  BIZZLEBEK\n                      If I could sculpt as well as that,\n                      I'd be quite proud of myself.\n\n        He's already quite proud of himself -- tossing his scarf over\n        his shoulder with a flourish -- and striding off into the\n        night.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n        Seen from just below, from the ancient cemetery that borders\n        its high, impregnable, imperial walls.  The all-seeing-eye of\n        the city.  An awesome edifice.\n\n        THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER\n\n        Kafka walking across from the Old Quarter toward the New\n        Town.\n\n        He passes some working-class types who seem vaguely\n        threatening.  Do they mutter some remark behind his back?\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        ALCHEMISTS' ROW - NIGHT\n\n        A bizarre street.  Tiny little houses that look fashioned by\n        a toymaker, all bunched tightly next to each other, forming a\n        continuous rooftop of odd configurations and angles and\n        pointed chimneys.  The street named after practitioners of\n        the black arts and dark sciences who inhabited it in the\n        Sixteenth Century.\n\n        Kafka's house is toward the back, a light shining from the\n        single upper window.  Through it, Kafka is seen sitting at\n        the only desk that really matters to him -- his writing one.\n\n        KAFKA'S ROOM\n\n        He's struggling to get a sentence right -- rereading it to\n        himself.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      \"As Gregor Samsa awoke one\n                      morning from disturbing dreams\n                      he ... from unsettling dreams ...\n                      uneasy dreams ...

Rudolf ...\n\n        Suddenly there's a loud KNOCK on the front door below.\n\n        DOWNSTAIRS\n\n        Kafka opens the tiny front door of this almost-miniature\n        little house.  Two intimidating MEN stand outside, one tall,\n        one short, wearing similar black suits and grim expressions.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        ANOTHER DOOR - NIGHT\n\n        Kafka tries to match the exacting pace of his two warders,\n        flanking him as they walk him along a corridor, through\n        another doorway.\n\n        MORGUE\n\n        Kafka tugs his collar up a bit, his breath visible in the\n        air.  He has a feeling what's going to be under the sheet on\n        the lonely trolley in the middle of the room before the first\n        man summons him over to it.\n\n        Kafka goes.  The first man yanks the sheet off the face in\n        one quick movement.  The face of Eduard.  White and bloated,\n        the tongue jutting, the eyes bulging.\n\n        Kafka recoils, stepping back instinctively.\n\n                                  SECOND MAN\n                            (still behind Kafka\n                             at the door)\n                      You know him?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      ...

Yes.\n\n        And now he hears a stirring in a dark corner.  He looks up\n        again.\n\n        A third man steps out of the shadows where he's been quietly\n        standing and walks over to Kafka.  He is a severe man,\n        stolid, dedicated, and never smiles.  He reminds Kafka of his\n        father.\n\n                                  MAN\n                            (with an introductory\n                             nod)\n                      Inspector Grubach.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n        The Inspector behind his big desk.

At a high desk a POLICEMAN is reading a\n        newspaper.  Without even looking up from it he extends his\n        arm and pushes Kafka slightly to one side so he's no longer\n        blocking the light.\n\n        Two other MEN are here waiting, sitting on a bench, sharing a\n        private joke.  Kafka glances down at himself, wondering if\n        his appearance could in any way inspire ridicule.\n\n        The door opens again and the Inspector is back.\n\n                                  INSPECTOR\n                      I don't usually involve myself\n                      with you people in the Old Quarter\n                      -- but the River runs its own course.\n                      It won't be the last time it\n                      deposits its unwanted debris on my\n                      doorstep.\n\n        Pause.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Probably not.\n\n                                  INSPECTOR\n                      Anyway, I'd like you to reflect\n                      that in me you have -- I won't say\n                      a friend, because we're complete\n                      fencers, of course -- from\n                      distinctly incompatible social\n                      classes -- but to some extent, shall\n                      we say, an interested third party.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I'll bear that in mind.\n\n                                  INSPECTOR\n                         (hands Kafka his card)\n                      -- Should you happen upon anything\n                      that might be relevant.\n\n        He nods curtly at Kafka, and shuts his door.\n\n        THE TROLLEY\n\n        With Eduard's sheet-covered form on it, coming down the hall,\n        the SQUEAKING WHEELS of the thing loud on the wooden floor.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        The noise causes him to turn around.

Kafka stands\n        by a railing -- and the huge, distorted shadow of SOMEONE\n        looms suddenly on the high wall under him.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      You know as well as I do that he\n                      didn't commit suicide.\n\n        Kafka looks at her.\n\n                                 KAFKA\n                      No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone\n                      is able to bear life with any\n                      assurance at all.\n\n                                 GABRIELA\n                      Eduard didn't see it as something\n                      that needed bearing.\n\n                                 KAFKA\n                      The police would know the\n                      difference, wouldn't they?\n\n                                 GABRIELA\n                      Do you think people in the New\n                      Town care what happens over here?\n                            (nodding across the\n                             water)\n                      This will always be the ghetto.\n\n                                 KAFKA\n                      He wasn't robbed.  He was\n                      identified by his wallet.\n\n                                 GABRIELA\n                      And you believe everything the\n                      authorities tell you.\n\n                                 KAFKA\n                      When I have no reason to doubt.\n\n                                 GABRIELA\n                      The very fact that they're\n                      authorities should give you reason.\n                      People will do anything to protect\n                      their own interests.  For all you\n                      know he was killed at the hands of\n                      the police.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      -- What could he have done to\n                      warrant that?\n\n        For a moment she seems about to tell him, but then looks\n        away.  Kafka follows her gaze.\n\n        IN THE DISTANCE\n\n        Someone else has paused at the embankment wall further away\n        to stare at the roiling water.  He's too far away to see\n        clearly.  Probably nothing sinister about him at all.\n        Still ...\n\n        GABRIELA\n\n        Turns back to Kafka.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Are you free tonight?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Tonight?\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      There are some people I'd like you\n                      to meet.  Can you come to the\n                      Musil district at eight o'clock?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      ... All right.\n\n        Her eyes lock on his for a moment.  She's beautiful.  He's\n        fearful.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      You almost married recently,\n                      didn't you?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Last year.  I -- it was broken\n                      off.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Eduard wanted to marry me.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      And you ...?\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I'm suspicious of men who want\n                      to marry.  I believe they think\n                      it's the only thing that will\n                      make them equal to their fathers.\n\n        THE SHADOW ON THE WALL BENEATH\n\n        Disappears, the ominous black mass flowing off the large flat\n        surface as abruptly as it arrived.  While up there on the\n        terrace we see Gabriela walk away from Kafka.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Stays where he is a moment, watching her.  He may have found\n        his ideal woman.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (then follows\n                             behind her)\n                      -- I don't know the Musil\n                      district.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                            (without turning)\n                      You won't have any trouble finding\n                      it.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        FAT MEN - NIGHT\n\n        Sit laughing, jowls gyrating, around a table filled with an\n        abnormal amount of food.  One of them stops laughing then,\n        and the others follow suit, one after the other in turn,\n        until they're all silent, looking at the same thing.\n\n        We're in a fancy restaurant, and the other customers have\n        also turned away from their dinners for the moment to stare\n        at the Man in Black who stands before the Fat Men.\n\n        The man wears a black mask as well.  He presents the Fat Men\n        with a covered tray.  They look at it, then back at him --\n        but he's walked away.  They look at the tray again -- and one\n        of them lifts the cover.  Underneath lies the classic black\n        bowling ball -- with a fuse burning at the top.  The Fat Men\n        all try to stand up at once but --\n\n        BOOM!  Their booth explodes with them in it.\n\n        At the doorway, holding a revolver loosely in one hand to\n        discourage heroes, the Man in Black turns calmly to face the\n        stunned restaurant.\n\n                                  MAN IN BLACK\n                            (hoarse voice)\n                      Long live anarchy!\n\n        He leaves.  Fire in his wake.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE OLD TOWN - NIGHT\n\n        Kafka walks the crooked streets -- in the direction of the\n        plume of smoke and illumination coming from the burning\n        restaurant.\n\n        In the dark distance behind him there seems to be a person\n        following him.\n\n        NOISY BEER SHOP\n\n        Neighborhood denizens have come out, hearing all the\n        excitement not far away.  Kafka walks past.  He looks behind\n        him, but the following figure has gone.\n\n        TWISTED LITTLE STREET\n\n        Kafka comes around a curve -- and sees ahead a dark figure\n        a black cape standing waiting under a lone lamppost.  When\n        Kafka gets a bit nearer, the figure starts to walk slowly\n        away, as if expecting Kafka to follow.\n\n        DIRTY YARD\n\n        The dark figure walks alongside a row of black window panes,\n        turning around the corner where they end.  Kafka follows\n        around the corner -- and through a dingy doorway.\n\n        A LOPSIDED STAIRWAY\n\n        Leads him up to a large attic.  Warning shadows.\n\n        ATTIC\n\n        Gloomy except for the light around a table at a far end.\n        Kafka advances, seeing Gabriela sitting there with her same\n        companions from the coffee house.  Kafka stops in front of\n        the table.\n\n                                  VOICE FROM BEHIND\n                      Please sit down.\n\n        Kafka turns to see the last of the group come in, having\n        obviously tailed him all along.  A burly man with a BEARD.\n        The leader of this anarchist cell.\n\n        Kafka sits down, in between a SOLEMN man with a moustache and\n        a woman with a POCKMARKED face.  The seedy YOUTH who led him\n        in completes the circle.\n\n                                  BEARDED ANARCHIST\n                      We'll save the introductions.\n                            (takes his seat)\n                      We don't know yet if you're friend\n                      or foe.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Strangers make better foes than\n                      friends.  Will you tell me who you\n                      are altogether, if not individually?\n\n                                  POCKMARKED ANARCHIST\n                      Heralds of a new age -- does that\n                      sound immodest?\n\n                                  BEARDED ANARCHIST\n                      You could say we represent the\n                      unofficial view of a well-ordered\n                      society.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (to Gabriela)\n                      Ah -- we're back to the \"authorities\"\n                      you spoke of.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      They're ubiquitous.  What we try to\n                      do ... is make them a little less so.\n\n                                  BEARDED ANARCHIST\n                      Quite a disturbance tonight, yes?\n                      And perhaps you recall last month --\n                      the explosion at the Municipal\n                      Courthouse that sent one of the\n                      examining magistrates to join the\n                      heavenly choir.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (disbelieving)\n                      ...

And Kafka is sad about his dead friend for a\n        different reason.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      ... Why take me into your confidence?\n\n                                  POCKMARKED ANARCHIST\n                      That's obvious, isn't it?  We\n                      have an opening for a new member.\n\n        After a moment's pause, Kafka stands up.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I nominated you as a possible\n                      candidate.  You were Eduard's good\n                      friend.  He read me some of your\n                      work.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I've hardly published enough for\n                      anyone to draw conclusions from.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      You strike me as a man with a\n                      defined notion of injustice -- a\n                      high concern for the lot of your\n                      fellow men.  And yet you're able to\n                      remain an outsider.  With the\n                      concomitant air of ... superiority?\n\n                                  BEARDED ANARCHIST\n                      In short, a higher man.  It's what\n                      we want.  It's what we need.\n\n        Kafka notices that the Bearded Anarchist has a tattoo on the\n        back of his hand.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      The distance to my fellow man is\n                      for me quite a journey.  As for\n                      being an outsider, it's never been\n                      a matter of choice.\n\n                                  YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST\n                            (as Kafka starts to\n                             leave)\n                      -- They may have instituted proceedings\n                      against you.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (turns)\n                      What proceedings?\n\n                                  POCKMARKED ANARCHIST\n                      Preliminary investigations may already\n                      be underway.\n\n                                  BEARDED ANARCHIST\n                      You were his friend.

A horrific human hyena, far further gone\n        than the sad wretches he's cornered here on this foul,\n        moss-covered ledge in the cold wind.\n\n        Seeing him, the vagrants freeze in their various positions --\n        then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them,\n        moving like an animal, a killer predator, laughing horribly\n        as he goes.\n\n        The First Vagrant, propelled by fright, manages to make a\n        stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains\n        and pull himself up.  The Second Vagrant finds himself\n        trapped at the edge of the ledge -- with the Laughing Man\n        choosing him as the one to go after first.  He turns and\n        jumps into the river.  The Laughing Man, face still unseen,\n        turns toward the climbing vagrant instead -- who clambers\n        over the top just in time as the Laughing Man's fingernails\n        claw the moldy wall beneath him.\n\n        The Third Vagrant has made it to some steps, and down them --\n        glancing back to see the Laughing Man coming after him -- to\n        the small patch of muddy beach at the bottom, grey river\n        water lapping at his ragged shoes.  He doesn't know what to\n        do -- he doesn't know how to swim!  The Laughing Man is\n        running down the steps now.  The Vagrant starts wading out\n        into the water, crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him\n        come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward,\n        splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his\n        ankles, pulling him back.\n\n        The Vagrant's screams join the Laughing Man's insane giggles\n        as they thrash around violently in the water.  The Laughing\n        Man drags the Vagrant back to the beach, then back up the\n        Steps, the Vagrant struggling helplessly, his head banging\n        from step to step, his hands flailing around but finding\n        nothing to clutch onto, his screaming going unheeded in this\n        lonely part of the sleeping city.\n\n        The Laughing Man drags him on, back to the slippery ledge and\n        along it, dragging the Vagrant on his back through a filthy\n        sewer alongside the wall, the Vagrant's cries choked by the\n        stagnant water, but continuing as the Laughing Man drags him\n        back into the dark tunnel, under the bridge, the two of them\n        disappearing into the blackness again, their combined\n        SHRIEKING louder than ever as it ECHOES horribly around the\n        damp stone, then dimming as they go deeper and further away,\n        unseen, until the screaming and the laughter can no longer be\n        distinguished.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        KAFKA'S OFFICE - MORNING\n\n        Kafka walks toward his desk.

The typewriter\n        covered.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Stares at it -- then at the ermine Mr. Burgel who has once\n        again popped up out of nowhere.\n\n                                  BURGEL\n                      Are you looking for Gabriela\n                      Rossmann?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Yes.\n\n        Burgel bows sarcastically to hand Kafka an envelope.  Then\n        chuckles spitefully, obviously knowing something Kafka does\n        not.  He walks off, leaving Kafka uneasy.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        EDUARD'S LODGING HOUSE - DAY\n\n        Kafka bounds up the stairs.\n\n        EDUARD'S LANDING\n\n        The door to his room is open.  Kafka goes in.\n\n        EDUARD'S ROOM\n\n        Kafka comes in.  Gabriela is here, gathering up Eduard's\n        belongings from drawers.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                            (hardly glancing at\n                             him)\n                      I'm collecting Eduard's things.\n                      If there's anything you want, take\n                      it or I'll give it to charity.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (taking her note\n                             from his pocket)\n                      Burgel gave me this -- what does\n                      it mean?\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                            (now looks up)\n                      Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with\n                      him.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (going closer)\n                      Why were you given notice?\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      They're not obliged to tell.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      It couldn't be for that incident\n                      with Burgel the other day.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Of course it could -- Burgel's\n                      been trying to get me thrown out\n                      as long as I can remember.  He\n                      could've killed Eduard.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      You don't believe that.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I wouldn't put it past him.\n\n        She's stuffed the last of the clothes into a small bag,\n        goes to take the few other possessions from shelves and\n        elsewhere.\n\n        Kafka notices that he's standing by a dumbwaiter.   For lack\n        of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up.\n        It's filled with more clothes.  Gabriela comes over with her\n        bag, holding it out for him as Kafka puts the clothes in --\n        but not as many clothes as they thought.  Behind the bundle,\n        hidden at the back, is a briefcase.\n\n        Gabriela recognizes it.  Kafka sees her surprised reaction.\n        He removes the case and carefully flips the latches.  Inside,\n        a complex mechanism, wires connected to a clock -- and a\n        clump of dynamite.\n\n        Kafka just looks at it sadly.  He closes the case.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      It seems I knew Eduard a little\n                      bit, after all.\n\n        GROUND FLOOR OF BUILDING\n\n        The ratty old concierge peeks up the stairs inquisitively.\n        In the doorway of his room, a LODGER clips his fingernails at\n        a little folding table, neatly lining them up.  The concierge\n        turns and notices.\n\n                                  CONCIERGE\n                      Lodgers!  Not one of them thinks\n                      to spare me such spectacles!\n\n        She slams the door on him then returns to her own apartment,\n        slamming that door too.  The hallway is empty now.\n\n        EDUARD'S ROOM\n\n        Gabriela turns to Kafka.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      You might think -- I thought so\n                      myself at first -- that Burgel's\n                      too insignificant to be dangerous.\n                      But that's the very reason to beware!\n                      It's the small men to watch out for\n                      -- the ones who substitute method\n                      for character.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (sighs at her\n                             relentlessness)\n                      Now you've fallen into his trap.\n                      When he goes to bed at night\n                      Burgel dreams of inspiring as much\n                      fear in others as they inspire in\n                      him.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      It's still easier for you to\n                      understand suicide, isn't it.\n\n        She's got his number.  He's so in awe of her he has to turn\n        away -- looking out the room's small window.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      That street down there -- I\n                      always used to call it the approach\n                      road for suicides.  It leads\n                      straight down to the bridge and\n                      the River.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm\n                      sure he knew about us -- and I'm\n                      sure it drove him mad.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Burgel doesn't like anybody!\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      He used to like me -- very much\n                      more than I liked him.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      He's jealous, yes, but that\n                      jealous?  He's too cautious.\n\n        Gabriela clears some more items off a mantelpiece with a\n        sweeping gesture.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Of course he is -- the Castle\n                      precincts are not the safest part\n                      of the city after dark.  People\n                      disappear up there regularly.   If\n                      you want to lie in wait for someone,\n                      that's the place to do it.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Now you're saying Eduard was lured\n                      there?\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                            (puts away the last\n                             few books)\n                      How often does one of our clerks\n                      have business in the house of records?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I've heard of it happening.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      And Burgel is the bringer of\n                      messages, isn't he?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Usually.\n\n        Putting the bag down, Gabriela goes closer to Kafka, so close\n        he almost cowers.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Or what if there really was an\n                      error? -- I don't know what kind --\n                      any kind that needed correcting --\n                      and what if Burgel was responsible\n                      for it?  One mistake -- even a small\n                      one in a firm like ours -- it could\n                      cost him a promotion.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      First these nameless authorities\n                      were the root of all evil, now it's\n                      insignificant Burgel.  If indeed\n                      there was a mistake -- and a minor\n                      one at that -- you're suggesting\n                      someone went to a lot of trouble\n                      over something so trivial as to\n                      not matter at all.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      What seems important to these\n                      people is not determined by the\n                      amount of work it entails -- you're\n                      far from understanding the\n                      authorities if you believe that.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Now Burgel's one of the authorities?\n\n        She turns away from him, reddening.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      For all his big talk he is.  Does\n                      he really have access to the Directors\n                      of the firm as he always claims?  --\n                      or only the Deputy Managers -- people\n                      of no importance whatsoever.  Someone\n                      ought to follow him for a change.\n\n        Kafka sees an opportunity to go to her, to try to calm her,\n        to make a timid approach to this woman.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      You won't make any sense of it\n                      while you're upset.\n\n        -- But she breaks away.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Burgel is only there for one\n                      purpose -- to spy on the employees\n                      and report any and all indiscretions,\n                      real or imagined.  If he didn't\n                      send Eduard to the Castle, you can\n                      be damn sure he's in league with\n                      whoever greeted him there.\n                            (very upset now)\n                      All those bastards are in league\n                      with each other -- why can't you\n                      see that!\n\n        She takes hold of him as if to shake some sense into him --\n        but really because she needs someone to hold.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      ...

Only it\n                      never arrives -- it's always just\n                      on its way.\n\n        Gabriela doesn't seem to be listening.

He's too late.  The hallway is empty.  The front\n        door at the end of it is shut.  He makes a face and a moment\n        later starts to go back up.  Then stops again.  Turns.  Looks\n        back at the front door.  ... The one he didn't hear slam.\n\n        OUTSIDE\n\n        The front door opens and Kafka steps out.  He stands on  the\n        stoop.  He looks up the street one way.  Deserted.  He looks\n        down the street the other way.  Deserted.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        INSIDE - DAY\n\n        Kafka leads the police Inspector back along the lodging house\n        hallway.

The other is scribbling at their\n        desk.  His pen blotches his paper.  He has a fit and crumples\n        it up and throws it down.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Looks over at the Chief Clerk's office -- sees him writing\n        intently at his desk, pausing to turn on a lamp.\n\n        THE ASSISTANTS\n\n        The sweeping one bangs his knee against a desk and starts\n        hopping about.  The pen of the other one leaks again.  He\n        crumples up his new sheet and flings it away even more\n        angrily than before.  Then he examines his pen, determines\n        that the cap at the back is loose, and starts banging it on\n        his desk in an attempt to tighten it -- while the other\n        assistant keeps jumping around holding his hurt kneecap.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Glances over his shoulder at them, starts to say something --\n        but then notices Burgel, not far away, sometimes blocked by\n        other employees, walking in the direction of the Chief\n        Clerk's office.\n\n        THE ASSISTANTS\n\n        The one assistant has just fixed his pen when the other one,\n        still hopping around, bumps into him, causing him to knock\n        over a bottle of ink.  The two of them start shoving each\n        other about.\n\n        Kafka whirls around, can't ignore them any longer.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Do you mind!\n\n        The Assistants look at him, surprised at this outburst.\n\n                                  OSKAR\n                      -- I was just trying to finish\n                      some work!\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      You mean you've actually begun\n                      some?\n\n                                  LUDWIG\n                            (pointing at Oskar)\n                      -- Just because he's done nothing\n                      today, he doesn't want me to show\n                      him up!\n\n        Oskar tries to lunge at Ludwig, but Kafka holds him back.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      My assistants!  You might as well\n                      have fallen from the sky for all\n                      the thought that was spent in\n                      choosing you!\n\n        The Assistants look at each other sheepishly.  Then smile at\n        Kafka, submissively or mockingly, it's hard to tell.\n\n                                  OSKAR\n                      It's not our fault.  We're\n                      naturally nervous.\n\n                                  LUDWIG\n                      And we're upset too.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      What's the matter with you?\n                      \n                                  OSKAR\n                      I can't make a simple statement\n                      without him taking issue with it\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      -- You should meet my father.\n\n                                  LUDWIG\n                      We've been together too long.  His\n                      personality is overflowing into\n                      mine and vice versa.\n\n                                  OSKAR\n                      -- How would you like to be in a\n                      horrible situation like that?\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        He wouldn't.  It's the nightmare of his life.\n        But now he's distracted again -- noticing Burgel walking away\n        from the Chief Clerk's office (without ever having seem him\n        actually enter it).  And Burgel is carrying a parcel under\n        his arm.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (to Assistants again)\n                      All right, you might as well go\n                      home -- go on.\n\n        The Assistants do as they're told, Oskar returning to his\n        desk to clear up, turning his back on Ludwig -- at which\n        Ludwig  immediately rushes up very close behind him and shakes\n        his fist strenuously at him, turning away quickly when Oskar\n        turns around again to try and catch Ludwig at it.\n\n        Kafka isn't paying them any attention anymore.  He\n        efficiently cleans up his own space, keeping an eye on the\n        Chief Clerk's office.\n\n        When the office bell RINGS the Chief Clerk immediately turns\n        off his desk lamp, puts on his overcoat, and shuts his office\n        light on his way out.\n\n        Kafka doesn't think twice.  He forces himself to start\n        walking to the Chief Clerk's office.  Other departing office\n        employees crisscross past him, but he walks in a straight\n        line, businesslike, toward the Chief Clerk's office.  He has\n        a piece of paper in his hand.  He enters the Chief Clerk's\n        office, holds the paper out to drop on the Chief Clerk's desk\n        -- but lets it slip off onto the floor.  When he bends to\n        retrieve it he quickly opens that bottom drawer where\n        Eduard's file was -- but it's now empty.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        DARK STREET - EVENING\n\n        Burgel walks along, adjusting the parcel under his arm.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Following him.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        ACROSS THE RIVER\n\n        Burgel heads into the Old Town.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Pauses in some shadows.  He glances up at the distance, the\n        way Burgel is going, up at --\n\n        THE CASTLE\n\n        Almost glowing as it's outlined against the blue of the\n        darkening night.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        WHORES\n\n        Giving Kafka the eye as he goes past doorway after doorway\n        filled with their frightening/tempting forms.  But he tries\n        never to lose focus on the small form of Burgel further up\n        the street.\n\n        Men milling about, up and down the street, prostitutes\n        roaming amongst them, Kafka negotiating his way through.  An\n        urgent moment when he almost loses Burgel -- then sees him\n        turning down an alley.  Kafka hurries after him, avoiding a\n        pair of drunken louts in the way.\n\n        FURTHER ON\n\n        The Castle visible, but still a little in the distance.\n        Kafka comes into view.  He sees Burgel entering a building.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n\n        Very dingy.  Burgel leaves the top of the stairs and walks\n        down to a room at the end.\n\n        DOWNSTAIRS\n\n        Kafka waits momentarily at the bottom, then goes up.\n\n        HALLWAY\n\n        Peeking around the corner, he sees a YOUNG GIRL embracing\n        Burgel in her doorway before letting him in.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        OUTSIDE\n\n        Kafka comes out of the building.  He hears a noise, turns\n        around, sees Burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony\n        outside her room.  Kafka retreats into the shadows.  He\n        watches the girl unwrap the parcel Burgel's given her.  She\n        smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Watches -- with an expression of guilt, sadness?\n        Until a door suddenly opens at his back.  A MAN shuffles out\n        past him.  A rather ugly WOMAN in a dressing gown holds the\n        door open, giving Kafka a cursory look.  Beyond her inside, a\n        quick glimpse of MASOCHIST yelping as he's whipped.\n\n                                  WOMAN\n                      Well, what're you waiting for?\n\n        She's nodding him inside.  Kafka backs away from her and her\n        invitation.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        DIRTY YARD - NIGHT\n\n        Kafka heads for the dilapidated building or the anarchists.\n\n        DINGY DOORWAY\n\n        He goes through.  A MOUSE scurries past him across the\n        threshold.\n\n        THE LOPSIDED STAIRWAY\n\n        Leads him up to the attic.\n\n        THE BEARDED ANARCHIST\n\n        Watches Kafka's approach.  But sees nothing.  His eyes are\n        wide open, but lifeless.\n\n        Kafka stops at the anarchists' table.  They're all lying\n        around it on the floor except for the Pockmarked Anarchist\n        who's slumped over it, her face sunk in a pool of her own\n        blood.\n\n        The Youthful Anarchist lies on his back, mouth open, still\n        dribbling red.  The Solemn Anarchist seems less than solemn\n        due to the almost comic, convoluted, broken-backed position\n        he's in.  And the neck of the Bearded Anarchist is all\n        twisted.\n\n        Kafka just stares in disbelief -- then SCRATCH! -- a noise\n        from a spiral staircase close by, leading to the roof.  Kafka\n        looks around in panic -- the attic entrance is too far to run\n        to and there's nowhere else to hide.\n\n        THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE\n\n        A man appears from above (MR. PICK).  Legs draped in\n        expensive trousers, the skirt of his high-buttoned coat\n        flowing around them due to the breeze from the roof.\n\n                                  MR. PICK'S VOICE\n                      -- Come on -- there's no one up\n                      there.  We're going now.\n\n        He raises his arm up to help down whoever it is he's talking\n        to.  We hear a strange GROAN.  Followed by the appearance --\n        unclear, from the back, face hidden, or otherwise blocked by\n        Mr. Pick -- of A STRANGE hunched figure.  He moves in a\n        halting, cowering way.  Mr. Pick helps him down the steps.\n\n                                  MR. PICK\n                      That's it -- it's all right --\n                      you've done very well.\n\n        Mr. Pick's voice is reassuring, though he has a dark,\n        diabolic face.  They're at the bottom of the staircase now,\n        Mr. Pick leading his odd companion toward the exit.  The odd\n        companion lurches towards the dead anarchists, but Mr. Pick\n        restrains him.\n\n                                  MR. PICK\n                      Never mind them -- they'll be\n                      attended to.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Pretending to be one of the dead anarchists.  Hiding under\n        the large body of the Bearded Anarchist.  Trying hard to\n        emulate his lack of movement.  Blood from the Bearded\n        Anarchist's ear drips onto Kafka's face.  He tries to blink\n        it away while his other eye remains fixed on the two figures\n        walking away to the doorway until they're through it and\n        gone.\n\n        After a moment, he unloads the Bearded Anarchist and softly\n        hurries over to the attic doorway.\n\n        STAIRS\n\n        The Strange Man utters another low moan as Mr. Pick leads him\n        like a dog down the creaking old steps.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Comes cautiously out onto the landing.  He leans over the\n        bannister, watching the two figures slowly going down the\n        long stairs, vanishing from sight at a certain turn of the\n        staircase on every floor and coming into view after a moment\n        or so.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        STREET OUTSIDE\n\n        Mr. Pick and the Strange One walk away.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Follows at a respectable distance.  He pauses when he hears a\n        WAGON -- looking back at the anarchists' building to see it\n        pulling up outside.  The DRIVER jumps to the ground.\n\n        Kafka looks from the wagon to the two men walking away in the\n        distance and makes his choice -- continuing after the two\n        men.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE QUARRIES - NIGHT\n\n        On the outskirts of the city, beyond the Castle.\n\n        Mr. Pick and the Strange Man approach.  Some distance behind\n        them, Kafka takes cover behind a tree, watching.\n\n        Mr. Pick leads the Strange Man down the central quarry to\n        where a third man, a LABORER by the look of him, is waiting.\n\n        Kafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central\n        quarry.  He flattens himself on the ground and peers over the\n        edge.\n\n        In the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange\n        Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the\n        Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest\n        or the Laborer to stab a dagger into!\n\n        Kafka is shocked by the abruptness of this.  He sees the\n        Strange Man slump to the ground.  He crawls a little closer.\n        He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his\n        belt, then help Mr. Pick drag the Strange Man off to some\n        side shadows where they dump him.\n\n        Kafka strains forward a little, trying to make out their\n        faces -- and the ground gives way!\n\n        MR. PICK AND THE LABORER\n\n        Spin around at the noise.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Lands at the bottom of the incline, dazed.  He's still quite\n        far away from the other end of the quarry where they are.\n\n        MR. PICK AND THE LABORER\n\n        Look at each other once -- then go after the intruder.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Sees them coming.  Scrambles to his feet.  It takes him a\n        split second to establish his options.  Namely, the best\n        route is back up the way he came.  If only he can get up it\n        again as fast.\n\n        Mr. Pick and the Laborer start to run.\n\n        Kafka starts to climb.  The incline is steep.  The gravel is\n        loose.  He slips back down.\n\n        Mr. Pick and the Laborer are gaining speed.\n\n        Kafka digs his fingers into the dirt, pulling himself up with\n        all his might, even though his shoes don't sustain holds.\n\n        Mr. Pick is a better runner than the burly Laborer.  He's\n        almost there.\n\n        Kafka slips back down again.  Mr. Pick could almost grab him\n        -- but Kafka literally throws himself up the slope again,\n        gasping -- and Mr. Pick stretches but can't reach that far\n        and Kafka's nearly at the top again -- Mr. Pick climbing\n        after him now -- and Kafka's arm comes over the edge, he\n        struggles over, kicking gravel back down in Mr. Pick's face.\n        Mr. Pick slides back down to the bottom -- and Kafka's gone.\n\n        The Laborer fell over Mr. Pick as he came crashing back down,\n        now Mr. Pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes\n        another.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        SLOPING STREET\n\n        Escaping back into the Old Quarter, Kafka runs downhill.  But\n        even the momentum doesn't carry him as fast as he'd like.\n\n        SMALL SQUARE\n\n        A number of streets branching off.  Kafka sees Mr. Pick\n        coming down one of them -- and the Laborer coming down\n        another.  Kafka runs off along a third.\n\n        CIRCUITOUS PASSAGE\n\n        Kafka runs.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick is coming.  He runs\n        faster, under a weird archway.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick\n        and the Laborer are coming.  Kafka darts down a side street.\n\n        SIDE STREET\n\n        Another twisting little road.  He winds around one corner\n        only to be met by another, the end of this street impossible\n        to determine.\n\n        BEHIND HIM\n\n        Mr. Pick and the Laborer are catching up.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Turns another corner and finds himself at the bottom of an\n        incredibly long flight of steps.  A staired street.  On and\n        on and on.  He doesn't know if he can make it.\n\n        MR. PICK AND THE LABORER\n\n        Come around -- look at the steps -- look at each other.  They\n        take deep breaths and start up.\n\n        THE TOP\n\n        Here they come, huffing and puffing.\n\n        THE BOTTOM\n\n        Kafka comes out from behind an extravagantly designed iron\n        gate grillwork.  He sneaks away, back the way he came.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE CENTRAL QUARRY\n\n        The body of the Strange Man lies face down where it was\n        dropped.\n\n        Kafka walks toward it, looking around nervously in case\n        anyone's coming.  Someone is.  When he gets to the corpse he\n        hears the sound of an approaching WAGON.  He crouches quickly\n        by the body to do what he's come here to do -- turn it over\n        to look at --\n\n        THE FACE\n\n        Of a monster.  Horribly disfigured, scarred and stitched.\n        And it isn't the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or\n        accident.  There seems to be design behind it.  Human\n        design.  And beneath all this warped, mutilated flesh, almost\n        unrecognizable ... the features of the vagrant snatched from\n        the River.\n\n        KAFKA'S FACE\n\n        Revulsion.  He goes.\n\n        THE WAGON\n\n        Parks above the quarry.  The evil-looking Driver jumps down\n        and pulls a large sack off the back.  He starts down into the\n        quarry.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Appears over another edge.  He looks over at the wagon.  He\n        sees that now the back is loaded up, and covered by a sheet\n        of tarpaulin.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE ANARCHISTS' ATTIC - NIGHT\n\n        All the bodies are gone.  Even the floorboards and pieces of\n        furniture that might have had blood stains on them have been\n        torn away and removed.  Kafka stands alone.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE CITY - NIGHT\n\n        An eerie moon shines over the Castle.\n\n        KAFKA'S HOUSE\n\n        He comes in.  Before taking off his coat, he finds in a\n        pocket Inspector Grubach's card.  But what can he do again\n        without evidence?  He puts the card back in the pocket.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        KAFKA'S DESK - BEFORE DAWN\n\n        He sits writing into the night in his little room under a low\n        ceiling.\n\n                                  KAFKA'S VOICE\n                      \"-- oh, and thank you for the suit\n                      from Father, although I don't know\n                      why he didn't simply return it.  If\n                      it's too small for him why do you\n                      immediately suppose it will fit me?\n                      ... Your son ...

He stands up to\n        stretch by his open window -- and we SEE that he's wearing a\n        suit that's far too big for him, sleeves overhanging his\n        skinny arms and  ands, trouser bottoms drowning his shoes.\n        He looks out at the sky which is turning blue.\n\n        THE BRIDGE\n\n        Two men walk across the river.\n\n        A WAGON\n\n        Rolls along one of the moribund streets of the Old Town.  The\n        Driver swivels in his seat, looking over his wide shoulder,\n        as if to see if he's being followed.  The glint in his eye\n        suggests Evil.\n\n        KAFKA'S ROOM\n\n        Kafka puts a stamp on his letter, then adds it to the stack\n        of obsessive correspondence already piled on one corner of\n        his desk.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE OFFICE - EVENING\n\n        With an ink-pad stamp, Kafka POUNDS the date onto a\n        succession of documents.\n\n        THE OFFICE CLOCK\n\n        Strikes six.\n\n        THE ASSISTANTS\n\n        Jump in unison when the BELL goes off.  Then in their hurry\n        to leave start shoving all their papers and whatnots\n        haphazardly into various drawers, opening and slamming them\n        regardless of whether or not the contents are fully inside,\n        resulting in a lot of crumpled documents and snapped pencils.\n\n        BURGEL\n\n        Suddenly hovering by Kafka's side, handing him something.\n\n                                  BURGEL\n                      The Chief Clerk would like this\n                      ready for tomorrow morning.\n                            (oily)\n                      He says it should only take you\n                      an extra hour or two.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n        Dead silence after the daily racket of typewriters and\n        telephones and adding machines.  Kafka works alone in the\n        utterly deserted office building.\n\n        He looks out the window and sees a POLICEMAN walking by on\n        the street below.  He thinks again about going to the law --\n        but goes back to work.\n\n        He hears a SOUND.  He looks around.  A sort of a SCRATCHING\n        sound.  It's coming from the other end of the office\n        somewhere.  Maybe the bathroom.\n\n        Kafka walks slowly back there.  At the bathroom door he\n        pauses momentarily, then turns the handle to go inside.\n\n        BATHROOM\n\n        SCRATCH, SCRATCH.  Kafka looks for the source of the sound --\n        and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it -- where a\n        huge arm has just been thrust through a small, high window --\n        and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for\n        the window-latch.\n\n        Kafka starts backing away -- as the hand flips open the latch\n        -- and now the window, swinging open with a bang, and the\n        rest of the intruder starts coming into view -- out before\n        all of him appears Kafka has run out and slammed the door\n        behind him.\n         \n        OFFICE\n\n        Kafka pulls a desk across the bathroom doorway.\n\n        BATHROOM\n\n        The MANIAC -- because that's what his posture and breathing,\n        seen from the back, suggest -- lurches into the bathroom from\n        the window.\n\n        OFFICE\n\n        Kafka grabs his coat -- and an umbrella off a rack.  He looks\n        back at the bathroom -- the desk rocking back and forth as\n        the intruder behind the door pushes.  Kafka runs away.\n\n        HALLWAY\n\n        He runs to the elevator, sliding open the gate.\n\n        OFFICE\n\n        CRASH!  The desk tips over as the bathroom door is forced\n        open.\n\n        ELEVATOR\n\n        Kafka descending.  The elevator cranking slowly downwards.\n        Then, nearing the ground floor, it slows down even further.\n        Then it suddenly stops dead.  Kafka reaches for the walls to\n        steady himself.  He looks through the gate, assessing the\n        distance to the ground floor below.  He tries the gate but it\n        won't open.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (calls down there)\n                      -- Help!  HELP!\n\n        He looks around the tiny space of the elevator.  The roof\n        hatch.  He reaches up, pushes it open, starts to climb up --\n        and YAAHH! -- the Maniac's face appears in the opening!  It's\n        another monster face -- this one even worse than the one\n        Kafka uncovered at the quarries.  A groaning, drooling,\n        misshapen lump of wrinkled tissue.  And its owner's arms now\n        come through to stretch after Kafka.\n\n        Kafka beats them back with the umbrella while still trying to\n        pull the unyielding gate open.  The Maniac yelps as Kafka\n        bashes the umbrella up at him, dodging his head out of the\n        way each time the umbrella sweeps back at him, swinging his\n        thick arms wildly to ward off blows and try and snatch the\n        umbrella for himself.  He finally retreats under the barrage\n        of blows and Kafka quickly takes the opportunity to lever\n        open the gate with the umbrella.\n\n        The Maniac's face reappears overhead.  Kafka stabs the\n        umbrella up at him some more -- and the Maniac manages to\n        grab it.  Kafka sits down on the elevator edge to jump down\n        to the ground floor and --\n\n        THE MANIAC\n\n        Lunges forward from above, scooping both arms down in a vain\n        attempt to catch Kafka just as he drops out of sight --\n        landing on the ground floor with a roll.\n\n        The Maniac HOWLS at his failure, his features even more\n        horribly contorted, Practically filling the small opening of\n        the roof hatch as he SHRIEKS.  And as his atrocious face\n        comes CLOSER and CLOSER and CLOSER -- one of his eyeballs\n        falls out! -- POP! -- out of the socket suddenly -- dangling\n        into the elevator, hanging by a single sinewy bloody thread.\n        The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball, bringing it\n        back up to try and stuff back in place ...\n\n        STREET OUTSIDE\n\n        Kafka runs away from the office building, in horror, off into\n        the night.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        KAFKA'S STREET - NIGHT\n\n        He stands at a corner, looking at his own house, scared even\n        to go home.  But everything seems normal.  He starts walking\n        there.  But when he reaches his front door:\n\n                                  VOICE\n                      Did you think you'd be safe back\n                      in your little burrow?\n\n        Kafka turns.  One of the Assistants stands next to him.\n\n                                  OTHER VOICE\n                      No matter how deep a hole you dig\n                      for yourself, the beast will always\n                      find you.\n\n        Kafka turns the other way.  The other Assistant is on his\n        other side.  Kafka looks between the two of them.\n\n                                  OSKAR\n                      We're to take you to the Castle.\n\n        Kafka might have expected this.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      So.

Kafka more fearful.  Wind\n        WHISTLES.  Leaves RUSTLE.  CREAKING trees cast ghastly\n        shadows.  Scary tombs, all shapes and sizes, strange symbolic\n        symbols on them, mystical figures and designs.\n\n        Trying to keep up with Bizzlebek, Kafka spots a horrendous\n        shape looming ahead of him.  He starts to bypass it -- and\n        jumps when a tall plant brushes against him.\n\n                                  BIZZLEBEK\n                            (waits for Kafka)\n                      Are you sure you wouldn't prefer\n                      going through official channels?\n\n        The awful dark shape turns out to be no more than a\n        particularly large tombstone, crumbled in places to give it\n        an animal-like suggestion.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Official channels -- a lot of good\n                      they've done me.

Shadows dance.  Bizzlebek pauses\n        at a particular grave, apart from the others, more hidden by\n        overgrowth.  He runs his fingertips over the old, strangely\n        lettered inscription.  He looks around the graveyard, making\n        sure they're alone, then he moves to one side of the stone\n        and leans his weight against it, pushing.  It shifts and\n        slides open, uncovering the hole that lies beneath.\n\n                                  BIZZLEBEK\n                      I was restoring some stones here\n                      in the upper section one day --\n                      and I found this.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (unclear)\n                      An empty tomb?\n\n                                  BIZZLEBEK\n                      A cenotaph -- a monument to someone\n                      whose remains ended up elsewhere.\n                      But look --\n\n        Having lit the lantern he's brought with him, he holds it\n        over the dark hole -- revealing a shaft and the rungs of a\n        ladder.\n\n                                  BIZZLEBEK\n                      The Castle gates were blockaded\n                      in the time of the great plague --\n                      it's an escape route.\n                            (offers Kafka the\n                             lantern)\n                      Don't get stuck.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                            (accepts it)\n                      Not a chance.

He bends low to listen at it -- then unlocks the\n        latch.  He pushes -- and the door moves forward.\n\n        OTHER SIDE\n\n        Kafka stands up -- and he's inside a big filing cabinet\n        drawer.\n\n        He steps out of it and looks around.  He's in an entire room\n        full of file cabinet drawers.  A morgue of file cabinet\n        drawers.  He shuts the one he came out of before walking\n        away.  \"D-7\" says the label on the outside of it.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        VAULTS AND CRYPTS\n\n        Kafka makes his way through the shadows down here in the\n        underground depths of the Castle.  A fiery glow and noise\n        comes from an archway ahead of him.  When he gets to it and\n        looks through he sees a sweating STOKER shoveling coal into a\n        giant furnace.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        NEAR THE END OF A THIN PASSAGEWAY\n\n        A sudden door SLAM.  Kafka dodges back around a corner.  He\n        HEARS:  the quick cry of a man's agony, a scuffle of shoes on\n        hard stone floor, a dull thud, a wave of peculiar shouts,\n        running footsteps, more mumbled mingled voices -- which soon\n        die out, leaving silence.\n\n        AROUND THE CORNER\n\n        Kafka walks slowly, straining his neck a bit in expectation\n        of whatever lies ahead.\n\n        The passage brings him to a row of dungeon cells.  A line of\n        doors with a barred window in each.  One of them isn't closed\n        -- and lying across the threshold is the Laborer who chased\n        Kafka from the quarries the other night.  The knife is gone\n        from his sheath and his scull is caved in, a wooden stool\n        lying on the floor beside him.  At the other end of the row\n        of cells another door swings open at the top of a few steps.\n\n        SUDDENLY fingers spear through the bars of another cell to\n        touch Kafka!  A GAUNT MAN inside.\n\n                                  GAUNT MAN\n                      You've killed him!  Like a dog!\n\n        Kafka dropped his lantern in surprise, and shrinks back,\n        CRUNCHING glass.\n\n                                  GAUNT MAN\n                      -- They won't like that.

He looks around, bewildered and\n        horrified.  Hideous faces looking back at him.\n\n                                  GAUNT MAN\n                      You'll incriminate the rest of us!\n                      Let me out too!\n\n        Shuddering, Kafka is moving away, making it through the\n        shocking gauntlet, toward the door at the other end.\n\n                                  HORRIBLE VOICES\n                      Help us! -- release us!\n\n                                  GAUNT MAN\n                            (yelling above the din)\n                      You're in the bowels now, my friend!\n                      You've thrown yourself in it now!\n\n        A HAGGARD MAN who may have had his tongue cut out gestures\n        desperately at a lever on the wall to unlock the cells.\n        Kafka starts to tentatively reach for it -- when there's a\n        sudden SHRIEK beside him.  He whirls to see, behind more\n        bars, the raving, convoluted face of the creature that\n        stalked him at his office (whose loose eye has now gone\n        completely) -- BANGING violently against his door.\n\n                                  GAUNT MAN\n                      Let me out -- I'm all right -- they\n                      haven't treated me yet!  We can go\n                      together!\n\n        But now the evil Mr. Pick appears at the end of the passage\n        from which Kafka came -- a gun in his hand.\n\n                                  MR. PICK\n                      You!\n\n        Kafka yanks the lever and runs away.  Mr. Pick FIRES after\n        him, starting to chase -- but the prisoners are coming out of\n        their cells -- coming for him.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        SPIRAL STONE STAIRWELL\n\n        Kafka runs upwards, around and around and around.\n\n        ANOTHER FLOOR\n\n        Here is a part of the Castle Kafka can understand -- office\n        workers toiling away.  Kafka walks past one long row of them,\n        SCRIBES sitting at a single endless desk.  They look like\n        students under examination, hunched over their writing, a\n        virtual conveyor belt of paperwork.\n\n        In the center of this floor is an actual conveyor -- a chain\n        pulley running slowly up and down, presumably throughout the\n        entire Castle, through small holes in the floor and ceiling.\n        There are little pockets on the chain which the clerks\n        continually pluck papers out of and slip papers into.\n\n        The ink bottle of one of the scribes runs dry.  He takes it\n        over to a sink with three taps -- Hot, Cold -- and the third\n        one he turns -- Ink.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        CORRIDOR\n\n        Kafka passes a FRIENDLY CLERK.\n\n                                  FRIENDLY CLERK\n                      Are you lost?\n\n        Kafka nearly laughs at the enormity of the question.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I'm, uh, looking for the\n                      Medical Records Section.\n\n        Pause.\n\n                                  FRIENDLY CLERK\n                      Oh, you're miles away.

Then a SECOND JAILER too.  A bestial hand\n        reaches through and Mr. Pick presses his pistol muzzle into\n        the outstretched palm --\n\n        BANG!\n\n        -- A book falls to the floor like a pistol-shot -- and\n        Kafka hides back in shadows hoping no one heard.  He's in a\n        round --\n\n        LIBRARY\n\n        -- Surrounded by books from floor to ceiling, even on the\n        tall door through which he entered.  A sliver of light gives\n        it away -- and on the other side of it he hears FOOTSTEPS.\n        But they pass by.\n\n        There's another sliver of light indicating another door in\n        the books opposite him.  He walks over and pulls on the\n        shelves.  Here the dark wood is merely a disguising cover for\n        the shiny modern steel he discovers on the other side of it\n        And he finds more than that as he enters --\n\n        THE LABORATORY\n\n        A real mad scientist's workshop.  Chemicals of bizarre colors\n        rush and FIZZ through mazes of glass pipes and beakers, in\n        some places boiling and steaming, in others frosting or\n        freezing.  Circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks\n        and filamentary arcs CRACKLE with electric incandescence.\n        insane instruments and devices, interconnected with complex\n        wires, perform strange and villainous functions.  It's the\n        most modern setting we've yet seen -- but at the same time\n        all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic, as if\n        put together from old, familiar materials and elements, both\n        eccentric and eclectic.\n\n        The chain that runs through the floors of the Castle carrying\n        documents runs up and down through the laboratory too.\n\n        Amidst this feast for the eyes, what Kafka now focuses in on\n        a simple cigarette -- left smoking in an ashtray.  And by\n        the look of the ash, not very long ago.  Kafka looks around\n        anxiously -- notices an archway leading to another room.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        UNDERGROUND CRYPT\n\n        Mr  Pick and the two Jailers can't hold back the dreadful\n        prisoners any longer.  Mr. Pick runs, letting the Jailers\n        fend for themselves.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        LABORATORY - SMALLER ROOM\n\n        Kafka comes into what looks like a small museum -- vertical\n        glass cases in which naked BODIES float suspended in\n        preserving gelatin solution.\n\n        Kafka seems deadened himself by all that he's seeing -- until\n        he sees someone he recognizes.  The Bearded Anarchist.  Kafka\n        goes closer.  Looking down, he sees that the Bearded\n        Anarchist has a hand missing.  The other anarchists are here\n        in glass cases too.  Now with a gasp Kafka turns around --\n        looking for Gabriela -- but she's not here.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        MAIN LAB\n\n        Holding himself together, and with new determination etched\n        on his face, Kafka walks to the center of the lab -- and an\n        operating table.  Ignoring the implications of the table, he\n        sets down the bomb-briefcase -- flicking the latches to open\n        it.\n\n        The sight of the explosive mechanism inside causes him a\n        moment's hesitation, but a look round at various animal parts\n        hanging from hooks above the table or bobbing in jars\n        alongside sinister implements laid out in preparation for an\n        operation renews his anger -- and he decisively turns the\n        dial on the bomb's timer-clock, setting it to the maximum\n        allowance of one hour.\n\n        He closes the case and locks its latches.  The case begins to\n        TICK.\n\n        Kafka takes it to a dark spot beneath the mass of elaborate\n        laboratory equipment, hides it under there, and leaves.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        CORRIDOR\n\n        Kafka tries finding his way back the way he came.\n\n        END OF CORRIDOR\n\n        Kafka looks down a long dark staircase -- a hint of light\n        glowing at the bottom.\n\n        BOTTOM OF STAIRCASE\n\n        Just as he reaches the light something lunges at him from one\n        side!  It's the Laughing Man, hysterical as ever, face now\n        SEEN for the first time, SCREECHING, salivating, eyes\n        watering.  The human hyena.  His grin contorts his face from\n        ear to ear, his CACKLING is truly terrifying, and the hand he\n        stretches forward has a tattoo on it (Bearded Anarchist's\n        hand) -- a hand too big for his wrist -- reaching, reaching,\n        reaching for Kafka.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        DARK OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n        The Laughing Man pushes Kafka down into a chair and shakes\n        with uncontrollable sobbing shrieks.\n\n        Someone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk\n        (MURNAU).  His hand holds out a small vial.  The Laughing Man\n        grabs it and leaves, gulping down its contents voraciously.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      I assume you're wondering ... what\n                      all this has been about.\n\n        Kafka tries to see into the shadows.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Are you the Head of Medical\n                      Records?\n\n        The door behind Kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat\n        (EKMAN) comes in.  He sits in a chair and looks at Kafka.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                            (to Ekman)\n                      He's come on his own initiative.\n                            (to Kafka)\n                      -- Not something we encourage, mind\n                      you, but we like to know it exists.\n\n        And he's stood up.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      What it amounts to is simply this ...\n\n        He's coming around the desk.  He's drying his hands on a\n        towel.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      A piece of paper was delivered to\n                      the wrong clerk.  It was essential\n                      he bring it back to us.

Ekman looks irritated by\n        this.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      ...

You'd probably trust him.  You'd certainly respect\n        him.  But if you look into his eyes, he's frightening.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        UNDERGROUND CRYPTS\n\n        Mr. Pick runs from the crazed prisoners chasing him.  Fires\n        his gun back at them, dropping one or two -- but then runs\n        out of bullets.\n\n        The prisoners slowly surround him.  He backs away.  One of\n        those chains that run throughout the Castle has its base\n        here.  Mr. Pick keeps backing up, unavoidably, the deranged\n        prisoners closing in -- until he falls backwards with a cry\n        into the grinding wheels of the chain-system.\n\n        Caught up in the chain, he's carried aloft with it, up to the\n        ceiling.  The chain is the lifeline of the Castle and does\n        not, could not, ever stop.  Instead it forces Mr. Pick to go\n        along with it, his head CRACKING through the glass or wood\n        \"manhole\" cover through which the chain passes.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        MURNAU'S OFFICE\n\n        Kafka tries not to flinch in the presence of this deadly\n        figure.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      -- You seem amused.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      It only amuses me in that\n                      it gives me an insight into\n                      the ludicrous bungling that\n                      in some circumstances may\n                      decide the life of a human being.\n\n        Ekman sighs -- as if at a difficult child.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      It's merely a matter of\n                      expediency.

You killed\n                      him to free the Position of\n                      Orlac Medical Officer for your\n                      own ends.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      Yes, well -- we're looking for\n                      a new village now.  If we stay\n                      too long at one source ... people\n                      become suspicious.\n\n        They pass another of those grinding chains carrying memos and\n        inter-office directives up and down.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      But you're quite right that\n                      he didn't die in that cave-in.\n                      In fact, he didn't die at all.\n                      He was simply recalled -- by\n                      himself.  As well as being Head\n                      of Medical Records here and a\n                      Director of your firm -- I'm\n                      Dr. Murnau, of course.\n\n        The Laughing Man giggles crazily.\n\n        LIBRARY\n\n        The Laughing Man, subdued for a moment, merely smiles a\n        little, opening the door to let Kafka in first, guarding him\n        close.  Dr. Murnau then leads the way across to his\n        laboratory door.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      May I ask where your two\n                      warders are?\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Lying in the gutter where\n                      they belong.\n\n        Murnau laughs, but then has to stop as it encourages the\n        Laughing Man, bringing forth a mad chuckle or two from him.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      Pity.  They're an amusing pair,\n                      didn't you find?  Absolute\n                      innocents.\n\n        He pushes the tall door open into his lab.\n\n        LABORATORY\n\n        Murnau spreads his hands proudly as they enter, displaying\n        his amazing factory.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      I so rarely get the chance of\n                      showing my work to anybody --\n                      anybody capable of appreciating\n                      it, that is.  You might say I'm\n                      a student of human reaction.\n\n        Ekman, who's seen it all before, goes to lean somewhere,\n        bored.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      The fact that it's live bodies\n                      you practice your trade on\n                      doesn't seem to matter to you.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      On the contrary, it matters a\n                      great deal.  We're engaged in\n                      immensely important research\n                      here.  I'm a revolutionary\n                      too, you know -- but a much\n                      more pragmatic one.\n\n        As if in response to that the Laughing Man convulses anew.\n        Ekman immediately turns to a shelf for another vial and goes\n        to give it to the Laughing Man.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      -- I can't very well administer\n                      experimental treatments to\n                      corpses -- and if they become\n                      corpses, why, they have their\n                      uses too -- that's why speed is\n                      essential.  Living tissue, even\n                      if its owner has passed on, is\n                      our most valuable acquisition.\n\n        The Laughing Man gulps down the potion and starts to calm\n        down a little.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      We've tried transfusions on\n                      our ... volunteers.  Unfortunately,\n                      far from infusing superior\n                      characteristics it's tended to\n                      make them insane -- murderous\n                      even -- a condition we've had\n                      occasion to make use of.\n\n        THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE\n\n        TICKING lightly away.  The clock inside the bomb-case,\n        becoming visible as if by X-Ray, is SEEN to be a matter of\n        minutes away from blast-off.\n\n        THE LAB\n\n        Murnau walks to where the elaborate distillation processes\n        are going on.  The very section where Kafka hid the bomb.\n        Kafka wipes his brow, quickly, conscious of Ekman staring at\n        him.  Murnau gazes obsessively at his contraptions, his\n        piercing eyes following the routes of the flowing chemicals.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      -- And the new patients they\n                      bring me aren't usually as\n                      dexterous as you've been in\n                      evading us.  Not perfect\n                      specimens by any means, but\n                      not the type of person who'll\n                      be missed either.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      What have you done with\n                      Gabriela Rossmann?\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      As a matter of fact you've\n                      caught us in a state of\n                      considerable excitement.  Our\n                      latest preparation we believe\n                      -- we pray -- is perfected.\n                      It should take years off her.\n\n        He's concocting another potion now, pouring an acidic-looking\n        liquid from one container to another.  Kafka is looking\n        increasingly worried.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      And if not -- well, there are\n                      always what I call my caprices\n                      of vivisection.\n\n        He glances at the dangling animal parts.  And now, finished\n        mixing his cocktail, he picks up some sort of suturing tool,\n        pressing the trigger on it to start the end burning and\n        SIZZLING.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      Actually, if it weren't for\n                      the aberrant dilemma posed by\n                      someone like yourself --\n                      continually asking for out-of-date\n                      files -- I'd probably give up my\n                      revisionist policies altogether.\n                      I'm sure what we have to do is\n                      start instead at the very\n                      inception -- with the embryo --\n                      from a single cell even.\n                            (leers at Kafka)\n                      The lure of the Golem -- the\n                      man-made man.  You appreciate\n                      that, I know.\n\n        Ekman takes Kafka by the arm to lead him toward the operating\n        table.  The Laughing Man moves in closer too, emitting a\n        psychotic chortle.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      To corrupt the image of man\n                      and then offer redemption ... This\n                      is the dawn, Kafka.  A new man is\n                      being born here.  A more resilient\n                      man ... A superman.\n\n        Kafka attempts an escape around the operating table, but the\n        Laughing Man blocks his way and corrals him back to where he\n        was before.  Dr. Murnau holds out the sinister aperitif for\n        Kafka to take and drink in toast.\n\n                                  MURNAU\n                      To a new world -- of Gods\n                      and monsters.\n\n        The glass comes closer and closer to Kafka's lips -- if he\n        leans away from it any further he'll be lying on the\n        operating table -- but now a WRENCHING noise makes everybody\n        turn.\n\n        The body of Mr. Pick, bloody and ragged, is dragged up with a\n        SMASH through a breaking floor-panel by the great chain.\n\n        Kafka has his chance.  The next time anyone looks at him he's\n        holding the nozzle of the burning device under Ekman's\n        throat, finger on the trigger.\n\n        -- And on the other side of the laboratory a wide elevator\n        platform rises into view -- carrying the prisoners from the\n        dungeons!\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Throws Ekman aside and runs away.\n\n        EKMAN\n\n        Falls to the floor, holding his hands up over his head with a\n        SCREAM as the ghastly creatures from the depths converge on\n        him -- but they pass him by -- intent on getting Murnau.\n\n        The last out of the elevator is the most horrible BEAST-MAN\n        yet -- and we finally see the use to which various\n        animal-parts have been put.\n\n        MURNAU\n\n        Just stands by the operating table, waiting for them.  He\n        knows there's no way out and he's far too practical a man to\n        waste energy running or screaming.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        DOORWAYS\n\n        Kafka running through the Castle, through door after door\n        after door after door, leaving them all banging behind him,\n        back and forth.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        THE LABORATORY\n\n        Ekman stumbles to his feet, watching in horror as the\n        prisoners of the Castle strap Murnau to his own operating\n        table.\n\n        One by one, the prisoners file past the intricate surgical\n        tools neatly laid out on white cloth.  Each prisoner selects\n        the implement of his choice.\n\n        Ekman, too, runs away out of the laboratory.\n\n        The Laughing Man, snickering, isn't sure whose side he's on.\n        But then, LAUGHTER BUILDING, he goes to join the others in\n        line.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        DOORWAYS\n\n        Kafka still running in the maze -- through a final door.  And\n        he finds himself right back in --\n\n        THE LIBRARY\n\n        With the brightness of the laboratory facing him through its\n        open door.  Horrible SOUNDS coming from in there.\n\n        THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE\n\n        Almost time.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Running again, through the maze of corridors.  He HEARS\n        running footsteps behind him -- looks back to see Ekman\n        running after him.  Ekman catches up -- but runs past Kafka\n        in his panic to escape -- out onto a metal walkway around a\n        central area of offices.\n\n        THE LABORATORY\n\n        Murnau can't be seen, only the deranged men huddled closely\n        around the operating table.\n\n        THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE\n\n        Abruptly stops ticking.\n\n        THE CENTRAL OFFICES\n\n        The floors SHUDDER as the BOOM in the laboratory is heard and\n        felt.  The metal walkway breaks and Ekman goes sliding off it\n        -- while Kafka manages to hang on.  He ducks his face down as\n        glass from all the surrounding office windows SHATTERS and\n        SHOWERS -- and then paper starts sailing down all around.\n        Literally a hailstorm of documents.\n\n        On the floor below where he fell, Ekman tries to stand, but\n        the falling flurry of paper keeps him at bay.  He waves his\n        hands wildly trying to see his way through it all, but it's\n        too much.  Now his feet are trapped in it.  It's starting to\n        rise around his legs.  Papers are fluttering down from floors\n        and floors of surrounding offices above, filling the air.\n\n        Ekman suffocates and drowns and disappears in the paper\n        piling up around him -- one lone arm and hand the last we see\n        of him.\n\n        THE LABORATORY\n\n        Totally wrecked -- and jutting out of the broken walls are\n        burst pipes -- spurting red, blue, and black INK everywhere.\n\n        THE CENTRAL OFFICES\n\n        Kafka is managing to climb back onto the unsafe metal walkway\n        -- when ZING! -- a bullet ricochets near him.\n\n        The Assistants!  They've nearly fallen through another\n        doorway where the walkway on that side broke, but got each\n        other stuck in the door just in time.  One of them is wildly\n        FIRING a revolver in Kafka's direction.  The other tries to\n        grab it and both FIRE it together in all directions.\n\n        Kafka runs away, avoiding a snake of broken wire, flipping\n        about, SPARKING off the metal.\n\n        The Assistants, shoving each other, extricate themselves back\n        through their doorway to find another way to chase Kafka.\n\n        THE LABORATORY\n\n        The burst ink pipes drip empty.  The sound of maniacal\n        LAUGHTER abruptly stops.  The ink has filled the lab halfway\n        to the ceiling.  It's covered everything and every ... body.\n        A last bubble pops, leaving a lake of ink with a surface\n        smooth as glass.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        UNDERGROUND FILE VAULT\n\n        Kafka has found his way back here -- rushing in.  But wait:\n        Which file cabinet did he come out of?  He's surrounded by\n        file cabinet drawers all alike.  He starts running around,\n        pulling open drawers, trying to find the secret doorway\n        through one of them.\n\n        SPIRAL STONE STAIRCASE\n\n        Here come the Assistants, running round and round.\n\n        UNDERGROUND FILE VAULT\n\n        Kafka runs round and round, opening drawer after drawer.  He\n        finds the one!  Jumps in!  Pulling it closed after him just\n        as --\n\n        -- the Assistants stumble in.  They look at each other, then\n        immediately start rushing around opening drawers.  They run\n        back and forth and all around, bumping into each other,\n        making themselves dizzy.\n\n                                  LUDWIG\n                            (pulls open a drawer)\n                      Oskar!\n\n                                  OSKAR\n                            (turning from another)\n                      Ludwig?\n\n        -- But Ludwig just pulls out a file folder.\n\n                                  LUDWIG\n                      This is filed incorrectly!\n\n                                  OSKAR\n                      Here too!  They're all in a\n                      dreadful muddle!\n\n        They start trading files back and forth, trying to put the\n        system back in order.  The attention span of squirrels,\n        they've forgotten all about looking for Kafka.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        CASTLE GATES - DAWN\n\n        Opening.

Foggy.\n\n        KAFKA\n\n        Walks slowly, tiredly.  He looks up at the sky, but the sky\n        is a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it.\n\n        FURTHER ON\n\n        Kafka stops.  Turns.  Did he hear something other than the\n        wind and the water?\n\n        FURTHER ON\n\n        He passes through a small park, approaching a gate on the\n        other side of it.  Leaves RUSTLING.  Mist swirling around\n        him.  He opens the gate and -- BOO!\n\n        GABRIELA\n\n        Standing there, half in shadow, in profile.  Her glorious\n        profile.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Gabriela! -- you did get away.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I knew you walked this way to\n                      work.

It's only over when\n                      you can crawl to a clean little\n                      spot on earth where the sun\n                      sometimes shines and you can warm\n                      yourself a bit.\n\n        Kafka is beginning to sense something quite wrong with her.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      Gabriela ...?\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Should I tell you why I joined\n                      our late lamented nihilists?\n                      Why I became a murderer?\n                      Because murder ... is bliss.\n                            (looks at him)\n                      It's easier than you might\n                      think to absorb and assimilate\n                      Evil -- once you've adopted its\n                      procedure.\n\n        Kafka just watches her ... The breeze sings in\n        the air.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Have you ever watched a person\n                      deteriorate?  Day by day.  I\n                      don't mean in a spiritual sense.\n\n        Kafka doesn't answer.  She turns fully to him.  The other\n        side of her beautiful face is ... fungus.  Alive.  Seething.\n        Frothing.  Bubbling.  Kafka backs away a couple of steps.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Only two steps back?  Even the\n                      man they left to guard me\n                      retreated further than that.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I -- I found your jailer.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      This is the result of their\n                      elixir of youth.  They were\n                      to come and check on it during\n                      the night.  I contrived to\n                      miss the appointment.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      They're dead now.  We can\n                      get help.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I know how they reward failure.\n                      If they saw this I'd be rotting\n                      in the quarries by the afternoon\n                      -- with all the others.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      There's a new potion -- he\n                      said it was perfected.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I know there is.  And you're\n                      what I have to bargain with.\n                      For now you're the last one\n                      in their way.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      I told you, they're dead.  It's\n                      finished.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      Why should I believe a man who\n                      never believed me?  They're\n                      absolutely right, you know --\n                      guilt should never be doubted.\n                      It's easier that way.\n\n        Kafka starts to back away some more.  Gabriela starts to\n        follow him.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I think you've just escaped for\n                      the moment.  Just as I did.  As\n                      Eduard did.  As they let us do.\n                      But only for the moment.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      No -- not this time.\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I know better than you what\n                      people will say when they have\n                      to.  When they brought me in\n                      for questioning I informed on my\n                      friends the very first day.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      -- Listen to me --\n\n                                  GABRIELA\n                      I do.  Always.  You understand\n                      the world better than any of\n                      us, Kafka.  And what it's\n                      becoming.\n                            (pause)\n                      I've always held you in the\n                      highest regard.\n\n        And suddenly she's slashed a knife across Kafka's chest.  He\n        shouts in pain, staggering backwards.  She comes after him.\n\n                                  KAFKA\n                      -- Gabriela!\n\n        She comes after him, blade glistening.  Kafka does his best\n        to run.\n\n        THE BRIDGE\n\n        Kafka giddily staggers forward, one arm wrapped around his\n        bleeding chest, Gabriela close behind him.  Too close for him\n        to get away.  He turns to face her as he reaches the bridge\n        and as she comes upon him again with the knife, raising his\n        arm to block the thrust and hold her wrist back.  She's\n        strong, though, made more so by her madness.  She forces him\n        down to the ground, straddling him, the knife pushing\n        closer.  Kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer\n        able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes\n        with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab.\n\n        It doesn't come.  Almost.  But not quite.  Gabriela's arm\n        pauses, shaking in the cool, cloudy air, her sleeve trembling\n        in the breeze off the River, the sharp blade, inches from\n        Kafka's throat, flashing in the new day's light.\n\n        Gabriela stares away over the River, the destroyed half of\n        her face in shadow again, the other more strikingly beautiful\n        than ever.  As Kafka watches, passive, she gets off him and\n        slowly walks to the wall of the bridge, letting the knife\n        drop from her hand along the way.  Kafka manages to lift\n        himself to his knees, clutching his wound.  He looks up.\n        Gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and\n        throws herself into the River.\n\n        Kafka lowers his head.\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        CONTINENTAL COFFEE SHOP - MORNING\n\n        Quiet in here.  Breakfast business not as crowded as\n        evening.  Kafka sits alone at  his usual table.  Looking\n        dazed, almost in shock.  Mostly just tired.  Waiting.  He\n        sips from his coffee cup.  He COUGHS a little into his napkin\n        -- and notices blood on it.\n\n        He has a pen in his hand.  Tapping it slowly on a newspaper\n        on the table ...\n\n        Bizzlebek comes into the coffee house.  He sees Kafka sitting\n        in the far corner and gives a grand smile and wave.  But then\n        he notices Kafka's other friends entering and he'd rather not\n        have to deal with them -- so he gives Kafka a \"catch you\n        later\" gesture and turns onto his own usual stool at the bar.\n\n        Kafka stares at his friends over there.  They're taking off\n        their coats and  greeting other people.  The girl, Anna, is\n        the first to start walking to join him.\n\n        He starts to write, a first line that has occurred to him,\n        the pen moving as if he can't help himself ...\n\n                                  KAFKA'S VOICE\n                      Dearest Father ...\n\n        Anna's approaching.  Kafka just watches her coming.  He\n        knows he'll end up going out with her, sleeping with her,\n        getting engaged to her ... We see the future on Kafka's\n        face\n\n                                  KAFKA'S VOICE\n                      You asked me recently why I\n                      maintain that I am afraid\n                      of you ...\n\n                                                        CUT:\n\n        KAFKA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n        Alone again in his little room, Kafka writes on into the\n        night.  The famous \"Letter To His Father\" is pages and pages\n        long.  We notice too that his chest has been bandaged.  He\n        COUGHS a little as he forces himself to keep writing.\n\n                                  KAFKA'S VOICE\n                      Naturally things cannot in\n                      reality fit together the way\n                      the evidence does in my letter\n                      -- life is more than a Chinese\n                      puzzle.  But in my opinion\n                      something has been achieved\n                      which so closely approximates\n                      the truth that it might reassure\n                      us both a little and make our\n                      living and our dying easier.\n\n                                                        FADE OUT\n\n        FADE IN\n\n        WATERFRONT WHARVES - MORNING\n\n        The Assistants sit on a big packing crate, brushing soot from\n        their suits, shaking dust out of their hair, fiddling with\n        the rips in their jackets and trousers.\n\n                                  LUDWIG\n                      We could go back to the office.\n                      Explain ourselves to the Chief\n                      Clerk.\n\n                                  OSKAR\n                      They'd drive us away.
