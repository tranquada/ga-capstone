One of those \"his\n          Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull\n          Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was\n          gonna take away his scatter gun\" .\n          He idolized West.\nMuller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.\nNext to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.\n<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n</b>          And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big\n          fella from New Mexico. After he got\n          Sectioned he just followed Mueller\n          around like a lap dog. He wasn't\n          mean like Mueller, though, didn't\n          have it in him.\nNext to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.\n<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n</b>          But Childs did. Didn't talk to\n          anyone, but you got this feeling\n          something was wrong with him, like\n          real wrong. Type of guy you felt\n          uncomfortable going to sleep near.\nBehind Childs runs Pike.\n<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n</b>          Pike I told you about. He took the\n          brunt of it from Mueller and West.\n          Once they found it out he was a\n          convict they were merciless.\n<b>                      (MORE)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                           22.\n</b><b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)

Wheezing.\n<b>                      DUNBAR\n</b>          Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was\n          a smart guy, we got along okay.\n          Pike and I tried to help him, but...\nKendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West\nsmacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.\n<b>                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n</b>          He was sickly.
