One of those \"his\n          Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull\n          Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was\n          gonna take away his scatter gun\" .\n          He idolized West.\nMuller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.\nNext to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big\n          fella from New Mexico. After he got\n          Sectioned he just followed Mueller\n          around like a lap dog. He wasn't\n          mean like Mueller, though, didn't\n          have it in him.\nNext to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          But Childs did. Didn't talk to\n          anyone, but you got this feeling\n          something was wrong with him, like\n          real wrong. Type of guy you felt\n          uncomfortable going to sleep near.\nBehind Childs runs Pike.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          Pike I told you about. He took the\n          brunt of it from Mueller and West.\n          Once they found it out he was a\n          convict they were merciless.\n                      (MORE)\n\n                                                           22.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)

He made the wrong choice.\nNext to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall\nis short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.\n                      DUNBAR\n          Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was\n          a smart guy, we got along okay.\n          Pike and I tried to help him, but...\nKendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West\nsmacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          He was sickly. Had that shaking\n          thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?\n                       OSBORNE (V.O.)\n          Epilepsy.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          Yeah. Spent half his time in the\n          infirmary. Only reason he enlisted\n          was his father. West didn't section\n          him till last week.\nINT.

Punching,\nkicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.\n\n                                                                 92.\nNunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...\n                          MUELLER\n            Roberto...\nWith a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            He took his gun. Used it on Childs.\nNunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs\nfires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's\nrifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            I can't imagine what it was like.\n            Having your friends try to kill you...\nNunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In\nagony over what he's just had to do.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            But you do what you have to survive.\nClosing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood\nfrom his hands and climbs out of the gully.\nELSEWHERE\nPIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for\nsounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he\nhears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...\nThe bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples.\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.\nLowering his rifle.      He climbs down.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple\n            minutes later.\nTIME CUT TO:\nDunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze\ndown at the uniform emblazoned with the name \"DUNBAR\".\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            It came to me in a split second.\n            Change clothes, change identities.\n            If James Pike gets discharged he\n            goes right back to jail. But if I\n            was Dunbar, I could walk away from\n            all this with a new life. But then...\nAs he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.\n\n                                                           93.\nKENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle\nto find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.\nYELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:\n                          NUNEZ\n           Put it down!\nA Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall.\n                       DUNBAR\n           I just want to go!\nNunez shakes his head.\n                       NUNEZ\n           You were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought\n           you were my friend!\nDunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't\nsurrender either.\n                       DUNBAR\n           I have to get Kendall to a hospital!\n                       NUNEZ\n           He was gonna kill me too!\nSilence.   The two men still facing each other.\n                       NUNEZ {CONT'D)\n           I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my\n           best friend and I had to snap his\n           neck because he was gonna shoot me\n           for drugs! For West!\n                       DUNBAR\n           We don't have to do this! You go\n           that way, I'll go this way!\nNunez laughs.\n                       NUNEZ\n           You'll shoot me in the back!\n                       DUNBAR\n           You killed three people!    Isn't that\n           enough for one night?\nMore silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom.\n                       DUNBAR\n           I don't want to die out here, Roberto!\n           Do you?\nNunez, staring at him.     Deciding.\n\n                                                              94.\n                      NUNEZ\n          If you even twitch...\nDunbar nods.\nNunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.\nAnd then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of\nNunez...\nWest.\nStaring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching.\nNunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches\non a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second\nto step over it...\nWest nods to Dunbar as if to say \"Go on. . . \"\n                      DUNBAR\n          Forgive me. ..\nAnd Dunbar FIRES.\nNunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the\ngunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in\nagony. West walks down.\n                      WEST\n          Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You\n          get the gold star.\nDunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.\n                        DUN BAR\n          Fuck you.\nWest smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall.\n                      WEST\n          You'd best get him out of here.\n          Don't worry about the bodies, they'll\n          be taken care of.\nDunbar doesn't move.\n                      WEST\n          This is where we part ways, Cadet.\n          You tell them I died out here, or\n          I'll come back for you. Tell them\n          one of the others did me. Mueller,\n          Childs, I don't care who. You and\n          Kendall, you tell them a story.\n              (smiling)\n          You can tell a story, can't you?\nDunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute.\n\n                                                         95.\n                       WEST\n          Dismissed.\n\nAnd West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving\nDunbar a clear shot at his back.\n\nDunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot\nthe old man...\n\nBut he can't.   West disappears into the bayou.\n\nA GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,\nhe leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...\n\nINT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING\n\nDunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne,\nStyles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.\n          He came after us with a vengeance.\n              (to Styles)\n          You know the rest.\n\n                      HARDY\n          And the bodies?\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          You won't find them. Won't find\n          West, either. He's too good.\n\n                      OSBORNE\n          No bodies, no West...\n\n                      HARDY\n          No death certificates.    No crime.\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          Just four people MIA.    Silence.\n\nThe JAG Lawyer steps forward.\n\n                      JAG LAWYER\n          You'll testify to this, the\n          corruption, the drug scam?\n\nDunbar says nothing.\n\n                      JAG LAWYER\n          We can cut a deal for you on the\n          Nunez killing.\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          I don't want any deals.\n\n                                                            96.\n                       JAG LAWYER\n           If you're telling the truth, the PX\n           requisition records will prove it-\n                       DUNBAR\n           All the proof you need will be when\n           West comes back and puts a bullet in\n           my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a\n           dead man, anyway. Like Kendall.\n               (looking at Hardy)\n           We both should have died out there\n           with our brothers. I know that now.\nSilence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.\n                       JAG LAWYER\n           I'll take him now if you don't mind.\nHardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door.\nTurning back to Hardy.\n                       DUNBAR\n           Tell me, detective.   Did you get\n           what you wanted?\nHardy shakes his head, sadly.\n                       HARDY\n           Not even close.\nThey leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy.\n                       STYLES\n           Tom-\nHardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods,\nunderstanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him.\nHardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done.\nINT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT\nSeveral hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar,\ndrunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform.\nOsborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the\nbar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.\n                       OSBORNE\n           We need to talk-\n                       HARDY\n           Seven.\nHe takes a slug of his drink.\n                       OSBORNE\n           What?\n\n                                                       97.\n                      HARDY\n          Seven guys. What was it you said?\n          You were \"just starting to believe I\n          wasn't the guy people said\".\nHe chuckles.\n                     HARDY {CONT'D)\n          Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's\n          question. How many? Seven.\nOsborne looks at him.    Realizing what he's saying.\n                      OSBORNE\n          This isn't the time-\n                      HARDY\n          This is the perfect time. You know\n          what makes a good detective? The\n          number of confessions they get.\n          You're a good detective, Osborne.\n          So now you get mine.\n                      OSBORNE\n          What if I don't want it?\n                         HARDY\n          Tough.\nHe pours himself another drink.\n                         HARDY\n          Thing about    taking money is, you\n          don't have    to do anything.  You just\n          sit there.     Maybe you don't return a\n          phone call.     Maybe you don't follow\n          up a lead.     But that's it.  Keep the\n          money, your    work's done.\nOsborne stares at him.\n                      HARDY\n          Seven unsolved murders. And you\n          know what? It didn't weigh on my\n          conscience. Not one goddamn bit.\nHe takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.\n                      OSBORNE\n          That's not true.\n                      HARDY\n          There are degrees of truth, officer.\n          Always degrees.\n\n                                                          98.\n                      OSBORNE\n          You're a good man, Hardy.\n                        HARDY\n          Really.\n                      OSBORNE\n          Far as I'm concerned, whatever you\n          did in the past can stay in the past.\nHardy stares at her.\n                      HARDY\n          I may not be growing on you, but\n          you're sure as hell growing on me.\nHe motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne\ntakes his hand, stopping him.\n                      OSBORNE\n          And because you're a good man, I\n          know you'll do the right thing.\nHardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath.\n                      OSBORNE\n          Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody\n          took him off the plane before it\n          left. My guess is he's already dead.\nHardy stares at her.\n                        HARDY\n          West?\n                        OSBORNE\n          Nobody saw.    But I don't think so.\nShe puts the papers on the bar.\n                      OSBORNE\n          These are the requisitions from the\n          PX, the ones used to release the\n          drugs to Mueller. West signed half\n          of them - Pike was telling the truth.\n          Look who signed the other half.\nShe taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to\nbelieve it. He looks up at her, pained.\n                      HARDY\n          Do I have a choice in this?\n                      OSBORNE\n          Yeah. I can wait till you're off\n          the base and do it myself.\n\n                                                       99.\nHardy stares at his glass.   Deciding.\n                       HARDY\n          Fuck it.   Let's go finish this.\nINT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT\nStyles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his\ndesk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to\nleave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.\n                      HARDY\n          \"You have to get out of the way of\n          the bigger dogs\". That was good.\nStyles squints at the figure.\n                      STYLES\n          Tom, is that you?\nHardy steps forward, into the office.\n                      HARDY\n          It was so good, I actually forgot\n          you're one of the bigger dogs now.\n          The Base Commander. The one in\n          control.\nYou couldn't let him testify, could you?\n                      STYLES\n          What are you talking about?\n                      HARDY\n          If you let him testify then it would\n          have all come out. West was supposed\n          to take care of it out there, shut\n          Nunez up and then disappear. But it\n          got messy and people got killed. So\n          you called your old pal Tom Hardy,\n          figuring if worse came to worse,\n          he'd cover for you.\n                      STYLES\n          You're drunk-\n                      HARDY\n          I'm not going to cover for you, Bill.\n          Not for this.\nStyles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.\n                       STYLES\n          Look-\nHe begins to move from behind his desk.\n\n                                                   100.\n                      HARDY\n          Stay where you are.\n\n                       STYLES\n          Or what?   You've gone round the bend-\n\n                      HARDY\n          West had a partner. Someone who\n          knew how to get things done.\n\nHardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.\n\n                      HARDY\n          What I can't understand is why you\n          signed these. If you'd just let\n          West take care of the paperwork, no\n          one would have known, but you got\n          careless. So when Pike finally told\n          the truth you had to get rid of him,\n          too.\n\n                      STYLES\n          That's preposterous-\n\n                      HARDY\n          Toxicology report came back.\n          Kendall's attack was caused by a\n          drug known as anephadrine, maybe\n          you've heard of it. It's for\n          asthmatics. If an epileptic takes\n          enough, it kills them.

You heard\n          our interrogation, you knew he was\n          ready to crack, so you killed him,\n          just like Pike.\n\n                      STYLES\n          I'm not even going to dignify that-\n\n                      HARDY\n          No!  You will stand there and you\n          will listen! What happened to you,\n          Bill?  You were the one who joined\n          up to do good in the world.
