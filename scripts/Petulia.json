Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to\n          see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors\n          of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six\n          perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile\n          accidents are lifted into wheelchairs.\n          The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos,\n          the women in splendid evening dresses.

ARCHIE\n          really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it\n          too obvious.

David has drunk too much\n          wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun\n          have made him violently ill. Though there are still two\n          bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving. As she\n          moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of\n          Oliver. He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher\n          shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market.\n          They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be\n          sold as \"the real thing\" .\n\n<b>          49 EXT.

THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA\n</b>\n          During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia\n          into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is\n          so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate,\n          Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod,\n          passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over\n          the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful\n          face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery\n          red from the sun.\n          Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate,\n          dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh,\n          dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is\n          just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently\n          hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown\n          out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain.\n          But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than\n          he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is\n          it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the\n          driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it\n          that \"useless\" that goads her?\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          53\n</b>\n<b>          55 CONTINUED\n</b>          Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no\n          importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the\n          moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two\n          kooks having a few seconds of horsing around.\n          The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by\n          the honking of thousands of cars and having fully\n          inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the\n          convertible on through.\n          Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the\n          border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there.\n          Petulia thinks, \"okay, you little bastard . \" and\n          zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first\n          moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's\n          tough little face.\n          During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele-\n          phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before.\n          ARCHIE: Hi, there.\n          PETULIA: Hello.\n          ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys.\n          PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie,\n          ARCHIE: I will, I will.\n           PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast.\n          ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia.\n          PETULIA: Like what?\n          ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different\n           things on the menu.\n          PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french\n          fries or baked beans.\n          ARCHIE: Okay.\n          PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you.\n          ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans.\n          PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food?\n          ARCHIE: Yes.\n          PETULIA: Sea bass is nice.\n          ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great.\n          PETULIA: If they grill it,\n          ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass.\n          PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet.\n          ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.\n          PETULIA: It's such a problem.\n          ARCHIE: Yes, I know.

ARCHIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY DAY\n</b>\n          Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty\n          damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of\n          his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers\n\n<b>          60 INT. APARTMENT\n</b>\n          It is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone.\n          All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess.\n          The television set is on: a program without sound of\n          soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that\n          Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting\n          the same type of program.\n\n<b>          ARCHIE\n</b>          A nice, neat kid.\n          After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere\n          things are scattered about.\n\n<b>          61 INT. BEDROOM\n</b>\n          The bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket\n          have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall\n          mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed.\n          Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets\n          and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes.\n          Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets.\n          Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          57\n</b>\n<b>          61 CONTINUED\n</b>          Th\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to\n          turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't\n          sure she has one,\n          Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23.\n          Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up\n          from the broken rib that this is impossible.\n          Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get\n          her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant\n          then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an\n          emergency number.\n          Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse\n          in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling.\n          As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy\n          as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't\n          open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection\n          with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making\n          than a life-saving procedure.\n\n<b>          62 INT./EXT. HALLWAY &amp; STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE' S APARTMENT\n</b>\n           Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on\n\n<b>          0\n</b>          a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber\n          oxygen mask over her mouth.\n          We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-\n          ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,\n          facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;\n          boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.\n          Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come\n          out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with\n          enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples\n          Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his\n          shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the\n          dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should\n          seem like a nightmare.\n          The dog's owner goes berserk.\n\n<b>          DOG'S OWNER\n</b>          Don't you hit Lennie!\n          Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.\n          At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all\n          spoken together.\n\n<b>          1ST TENANT\n</b>          0 That's sex for you.\n\n<b>          2ND TENANT\n</b>          It could be a gas leak.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          58\n</b>\n<b>          62 CONTINUED\n</b>\n<b>          0 3RD TENANT\n</b>          She's dead.\n\n<b>          4TH TENANT\n</b>          Those rescue cops never give up.\n\n<b>          5TH TENANT\n</b>          Yes'. but they're all racists.\n          Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other\n          a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many\n          T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.\n          One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and\n          we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the\n          Jungle by helicopters.\n          Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead\n          the way down the steps. Half a dozen \"hippies\"' loaded\n          down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up\n          the steps. Everything is chaos.\n          The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the\n          narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every\n          which way - all in the name of saving her life.\n\n<b>          7TH TENANT\n</b>\n<b>          \u00c2\u0080\u00a2\n</b>          (a rich old queen in\n          purple Bermuda shorts)\n          I had trouble like that with my piano. Two\n          hundred dollars to bring it through the window.\n          And its never been the same.\n          A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and\n          the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.\n\n<b>          63 EXT. A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHT\n</b>\n           This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from.Mexico.\n          The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the\n          hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a\n          break on their way north.\n          Among the cars many are filled with bull fight\n          afficianados.\n          It's about ten p.m. There is a general feeling of\n          exhaustion and spent passions. People are bleary-eyed,\n          recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects\n          of sunburns. All this we see later. First we see Oliver.\n          Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who\n          0 has just awakened. David is probably just about to say\n          \"Who the hell are you\" when Petulia appears carrying a\n          cardboard carton of coffee and orange juice.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          59\n</b>\n<b>          63 CONTINUED\n</b>          David takes a sip of coffee. Oliver grabs at the orange\n          juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat but\n          saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to\n          make bubbles. David looks at Oliver and then at\n          Petulia, all through the bubbles.\n\n<b>          PETULIA\n</b>          Say hello to \"Petulia\"s Folly.\"\n          David says nothing.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          Oh?\n\n<b>          PET ULIA\n</b>          (with careful wit)\n          If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd,\n          feast your eyes on this little goodie.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          What\u00c2\u00b0s the problem?\n\n<b>          PETULIA\n</b>          (to Oliver)\n          Why can't you speak English?\n          (to David)\n          Why the hell don't they teach them English?\n          This little hustler picked me up in Tijuana --\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          (to Oliver, very gently)\n          What's your name?\n\n<b>          PETULIA\n</b>          I've got a name for him!\n          Oliver doesn't understand what is being said, but he is\n          getting uneasy.\n\n<b>          O LIVER\n</b>          Lady say \"hey come on us go San Francisco\n          ten bucks.\"\n\n<b>          PET UL IA\n</b>          You bleeding little liar!\n          Oliver looks at Petulia innocently.\n\n<b>          PETULIA\n</b>\n<b>          (CONTINUING)\n</b>          I never did!\n          She's worried about David.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          60\n</b>\n<b>          0 63 CONTINUED\n</b>\n<b>          PETULIA\n</b>          What I said to this malicious little fink was\n          that maybe one day if we went back to Tijuana --\n\n<b>          DAVIT?\n</b>          (to Oliver)\n          San Francisco?\n\n<b>          OLIVER\n</b>          San Francisco.\n          Each says it in his own accent, and so begins a word game.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>\n<b>          (GIGGLING)\n</b>          San Francisco.\n\n<b>          OLIVER\n</b>\n<b>          { GIGGLING)\n</b>          San Francisco.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          Okay. \"San Francisco.\"\n          0 He pronounces it like Oliver.\n\n<b>           PET ULIA\n</b>\n<b>           DAVID\n</b>          David doesn't answer her.\n\n<b>          DAVID\n</b>          (to Oliver)\n          What's your name?\n          (in bad Spanish)\n          What are you called?\n\n<b>          OLIVER\n</b>           (pronouncing it Spanish)\n          Oliver.\n\n<b>           DAVID\n</b>           (pronouncing it English)\n          Oliver.\n\n<b>           OLIVER\n</b>           (pronouncing it Spanish)\n          Oliver.\n          They begin laughing again.
