Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to\n          see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors\n          of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six\n          perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile\n          accidents are lifted into wheelchairs.\n          The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos,\n          the women in splendid evening dresses. One of the women\n          wears a neck brace which forces her always to look\n          skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage\n          pinned to her bosom.\n          Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the\n          stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform,\n          past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one\n          finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel. Watch-\n          men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the\n          wheelchairs without much interest.\n          Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the\n          grand ballroom.\n\n          2 INTO GRAND BALLROOM\n          It is a charity ball. The sign says \"Shake for Highway\n          Safety.\"' The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer\n          interest us. They are the guests of honor, and people\n          gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we\n          rush past the go-go band, the shakers, and the door\n          prize, which is a little convertible, spinning endlessly\n          on a pedestal.\n          CAMERA reaches PETULIA, who is dancing with her husband,\n          DAVID, but trying not to lose sight of ARCHIE. ARCHIE\n          really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it\n          too obvious. As he bends over to put his punch cup on\n          a table, he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the\n          guests of honor. He is not at all comfortable.\n\n          0\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2 CONTINUED\n\n          E\n          It's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie;\n          gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies\n          get in the way, and the dance won't end. The music\n          stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, \"Thank\n          God it's over,\" but instantly the music begins again\n          and everyone good naturedly swears, \"Those crazy kids\n          are trying to kill us,\" and meanwhile Petulia sees\n          that Archie has reached the place where you get your\n          coat.\n\n          MED.

Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny\n          light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off\n          furiously. Just ahead of him is the door of their motel\n          room. Archie is aghast at the pulsating key.\n\n          ARCHIE\n\n          (PLAINTIVELY)\n          My apartment's only four blocks from\n\n          HERE\n\n          7 INT. DREAM MOTEL ROOM\n\n          Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do. A\n          control panel takes care of the drapes, T.V., stereo,\n          announcements from the office, etc., etc., etc. There\n          are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia\n          does is establish contact between the vanity mirror,\n          the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet\n          mirror so that she is reflected endlessly.\n\n          PETULIA\n          You have 624 women in this room and\n          I'm still counting.\n          Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top\n          buttons on the back of her dress.\n\n          PETULIA\n\n          (HARSHLY)\n          Just wait a minute, okay?\n          Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile\n          on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not\n          going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia\n          faces in the mirrors.\n\n          PETULIA\n          My great-grandmother is ninety-one and\n          still has a granite chin.\n          Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to\n          vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on\n          endless beds.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          12\n\n          7 CONTINUED\n\n          PETULIA\n          What a lecherous lot\n\n          ARCHIE\n          She's ninety-ones eh?\n\n          PETULIA\n          But no fun.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Not at ninety-one, hell\n\n          PETULIA\n          She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her\n          husband was killed in the first war, in a\n          trench looking just like Cary Grant with a\n          waxed moustache. She can't remember him but\n          she does remember Cary Grant because he is\n          from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If\n          his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed\n          moustache whether he likes it or not.\n          She turns to face Archie.

Petulia starts toward him angrily.\n\n          PETULIA\n          Where do you have to rush? If we were making\n          love you would be exploring my navel about now.\n          Time would be the last thing on your mind.\n          An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with\n          the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of\n          his car. The elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie\n          enter,\n\n          9 INT. ELEVATOR\n\n          The elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a\n          loud speaker begins playing a medley of San Francisco\n          songs.\n\n          PETULIA\n          You. look like a gargoyle.

He moves behind her and\n          begins rebuttoning her. At the touch of his hand,\n          something happens to Petulia.\n\n          10 INT. FIRST AID ROOM\n\n          Archie's hands are holding a little boy under the bright\n          lights of a first aid table. The boy is a bloody mess but\n          Archie's hands are soothing him even as they so gently\n          prod, examining his injuries. Nurses are cutting the boy's\n          bloody jeans off him, an expensive watch falls to the\n          floor, they retrieve it.\n\n          11 INT. ELEVATOR\n\n          Petulia's head presses against Archie's hand. She\n          kisses it, she rubs her cheek against it.\n          The elevator has come to a stop and the doors have opened.\n          Archie sees Petulia's tears on his hand.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Real honest-to-God tears, Petulia?\n\n          PETULIA\n          Tears, Archie.\n\n          0\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Petulia, you're a kook.\n          He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab.\n\n          12 EXT. DREAM MOTEL\n\n          Archie crosses to the cab and opens the door. He hustles\n          Petulia inside the cab.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          If he gets you there in time, you can still\n          pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy.\n\n          PETULIA\n          (very quietly)\n          Archie, I'm going to marry you.\n          The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him\n          through the rear window. Archie allows himself the\n          drollest of smiles.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          It's the Pepsi generation\n          0 He walks into the night alone.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          15\n          E 12 Continued\n          A jalopy full of dizzy dames with \"LOVE\" painted in\n          huge awkward letters on its side almost runs him\n          down. Archie continues in the night.\n          Now, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n          13 EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAWN\n\n          The house is on the edge of the sea and a cliff rises\n          behind it. Petulia is going up the open lift which\n          climbs the cliff. It is a very different Petulia.\n          She hurts.\n\n          INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM MORNING\n\n          Archie is sleeping. There is the SOUND of a bell\n          ringing. After awhile Archie's hand reaches out for\n          the phone.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          (into phone)\n          I'm up, thanks.\n          Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing\n          and is constant. He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He\n          stumbles and staggers to the front door.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Yeah... yeah 000 yeah 000\n          He opens the door to come face to face with the large\n          and twirly front end of a tuba. The tuba is stark\n          white for no particular reason.\n\n          14A EXT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT\n\n          We see some of the hall, a yawning milkman, etc., but\n          mostly Petulia and the tuba.\n\n          14B INT.

PAWN SHOP\n\n          A brick smashes the glass, scattering cameras, mandolins,\n          etc. in the midst of which is the white tuba.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          Archie, how come the burglar alarm didn't\n          go off?\n\n           14D INT.

HALLWAY OF DANNER HOUSE NIGHT\n\n          But we don't know it's the Danner house. All we see is\n          Petulia crumpling as she is struck. She hits the floor\n          and just lies there, not making a sound.\n          (Also SHOOT in slow motion.)\n\n          16 INT. ARCHIE' S APARTMENT\n\n          Archie breaks an ammonia ampule under Petulia's nose.\n          Her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes. Archie\n          has begun to prod her side; she is in pain.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          17\n\n          16 CONTINUED\n\n          PETULIA\n          I've got a broken rib, I think, I can\n          feel it broken, Archie.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Don't you know you can puncture a lunge\n\n          PETULIA\n          Hopping around with tubas and stuff --\n          isntt it kooky, though?\n          Archie has begun to remove her dress.\n\n          PETULIA\n          When are we going to stop trying to\n          undress me?\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Shut up.\n\n          PETULIA\n          Leave me alone, Archie.\n          Archie sees she really means it,\n\n          ARCHIE\n\n          0\n          It's just a rib to me,\n\n          PETULIA\n          That's why.

The phone begins ringing. He grabs\n          it angrily.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          (into phone)\n          I'm awake! I'm awake; How many times\n          are you gonna call?I\n          He hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up call.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          18\n\n          16 CONTINUED\n\n          E ARCHIE\n          (to Petulia)\n          You know what a- you'll drive me cuckoo.\n          He sighs. and begins dialing a number. Petulia is in real\n          pain. Like a,little child she crawls under the covers of\n          his bed, pulling the quilt up around her as though Archie's\n          left over warmth will make the pain go away.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          (into phone)\n          Barney?

Barney, shut up. I have to get\n          to the hospital.\n\n          16A BARNEY'S BEDROOM MORNING\n          During the above we catch a glimpse of sleepy Barney\n          sleepily asking stupid questions.\n\n          16B INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT\n\n          Archie hangs up, goes to a medicine case which he had\n          hastily opened for the ammonia ampule and now he takes out\n          a couple of pills, which he gives to Petulia,. She takes\n          them obediently,\n\n          PETULIA\n          You've got a super build for a man your age.\n          Archie says nothing. He crosses to the bathroom and\n          hastily begins dressing.\n\n          PETULIA\n          Where are all the family pictures?\n          Archie is busy brushing his teeth,\n\n          PETULIA\n\n          (LOUDLY)\n          The family pictures!\n          He looks out from the bathroom blankly,\n\n          PETULIA\n          Polo and the boys.\n\n          \u00c2\u0080\u00a2\n          Archie goes back to brushing his teeth electrically, with\n          salt.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          19\n          16B Continued\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 PETULIA\n          I'll bet you named her Polo. Don't ever\n          start mucking about with \"Petulia\".\n          Archie exits from the bathroom, all the time continuing\n          to dress,\n\n          PETULIA\n          What\u00c2\u00b0s her real name?\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Prudence.\n\n          PETULIA\n          And you named her Polo. That's kind\n          of sickening, Archie.\n          Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl\n          in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba. Archie\n          sighs somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as\n          you'd think.\n\n          17 INT. HOSPITAL\n\n          We are in the examining room of the orthopedic ward.\n          Archie is working on Oliver, the little Mexican boy of\n\n          \u00c2\u0080\u00a2\n          seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the\n          flashback. Now, Oliver is healing nicely, but it's still\n          not pleasant to be examined. A woman hovers in the back-\n          ground. A nurse assists Archie. Oliver is a brave, solemn\n          little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes. He\n          is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you. He is\n          now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his\n          skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot,\n\n          ARCHIE\n          I want him here every day. For therapy.\n\n          WOMAN\n          Si, Yes, doctor.

Sinai Hospital in New York.) The doctors\n          and nurses communicate with each other through throat\n          mikes and seem like other world automatons.

This is a moment to glimpse Archie as a\n          thoughtful man. There are a couple of beer bottles\n          nearby. The bed is still unmade.

HOSPITAL NIGHT\n\n           It's after 3 a.m. and Archie is hollow-eyed and drenched\n          0 with sweat from an emergency operation.

He crosses to a sink, bathes his\n          face and hands with cold water. He is exhausted. As we\n          sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking\n          and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see\n          beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see\n          the fearful uncertainty. He now moves into the corridor,\n          with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected\n          of him.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          Hi.\n          Archie turns.

Then, without a word, they fall into\n          step beside each other, leaving the hospital.\n\n          37 EXT. PARKING LOT NIGHT\n\n          At this time of night hardly a car remains.

It is a facet of Petulia he has never\n          seen before.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Where to?

Heads bump against windows, elbows\n          jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be\n          stopped.

SUPERMARKET PRE-DAWN\n\n          Though the streets outside are deserted, the supermarket\n          is jammed with people. Archie is pushing a market\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 basket already piled high with groceries while Petulia\n          keeps finding things to buy. Archie knows that Petulia\n          is going through this massive shopping spree simply to\n          get even for his rejection of the moment she chose to\n          make love.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          45\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 39 Continued\n\n          ARCHIE\n          It m not really hungry.\n\n          PETULIA\n          I'm starving.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Am I being punished?\n\n          PETULIA\n          Loganberry jam ... we'll have a case.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          I'd rather have a new plastic raincoat.\n\n          PETULIA\n          You don't save anything on plastic raincoats.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Shall I get another cart? Polo can fill\n          three or four when she really puts her\n          mind to it.\n          Petulia gets the point and instantly takes her place\n\n          0\n          in the long line before the cashier.\n\n          WOMAN SHOPPER\n          (as if it's Petulia's fault)\n          You know what time it is?

SUPERMARKET\n\n          Petulia and Archie leave the supermarket with their rolling\n          basket of groceries. There is no one else on the street.\n          In front of the market is a clown on a pedestal gesticu-\n          lating with arms and mouth at people who are not there,\n          but making no sound. Petulia quizzically looks up at the\n          silent violent clown, while Archie waits for her at the\n          car. Finally he taps the horn and she turns and looks at\n          him. She starts running toward the car, suddenly wanting\n          0 very much to be with him. They kiss lightly.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          46\n\n          9 41 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGH'\n\n          Archie is sound asleep, breathing heavily.

ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT\n          Petulia is sound asleep. Through the open bedroom door\n          we see Archie drinking a lonesome Coke.\n\n          43 INT. ARCHIES BEDROOM NIGHT\n\n          Petulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and\n          somehow as far apart as two human beings can be.\n\n          44 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT\n\n          In the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in\n          some language all her own. Archie Is eyes open and he\n          looks at her and he smiles. Still sound asleep,\n          Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it\n          was and settles down on the pillow. Archie looks at her.\n          She wakes up. They look at each other so gravely that\n          they both begin to smile. Neither one is having the\n          best night of their life but both are aware of a sense\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly.\n          45 INT. ARCHIEtS BEDROOM MORNING\n          Petulia wakes up suddenly. Though she is nude under the\n          sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the\n          boys.

Archie is in a phone booth\n          next to the ramp that leads to the boat. The boys are\n          yelling to Dad to come ono\n\n          ARCHIE\n          (into phone)\n          Hi,\n          (to boys)\n          Shut up, you guys,\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          Hi.

BULL RING TIJUANA\n\n          It's a hot summer afternoon. Petulia and David have\n          driven down from San Francisco. They are members of the\n          \"San Francisco Matador Club\". David has drunk too much\n          wine from his bota bag and the sour wine and the hot sun\n          have made him violently ill. Though there are still two\n          bulls left to kill, David and Petulia are leaving. As she\n          moves down the spindly stairway, Petulia becomes aware of\n          Oliver. He is with a gang of other kids at the butcher\n          shed where the previous bulls are being dressed for market.\n          They are all soaking banderillos in blood so they can be\n          sold as \"the real thing\" .\n\n          49 EXT. A STREET IN TIJUANA\n\n          Petulia and David in their convertible. David has passed\n          out in the back seat and Petulia is having a hell of a\n          time trying to move the car out of the parking space.\n          Again kids swarm about her like wild animals, trying to\n          sell hats, cushions, gum, pottery, etc. Again she sees\n          Oliver among them (or is it another kid who looks like\n          0 Oliver?) ,\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          50\n\n          40 50 EXT. BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA LATE AFTERNOON\n\n          Thousands of cars are waiting to get through. Hot, noisy,\n          dusty, unbearable. Kids storm every car, hustling their\n          captured audience. Among them is Oliver. Have the others\n          been Oliver? In Petulia's exhaustion and discomfort, the\n          heat, the flies, the blaring horny she can't be sure.\n          (NOTE, All through the Tijuana scenes, we HEAR Archie\n          and Petulia's telephone conversation. It is utterly banal\n          and they know it and are amused by its banality.)\n          PETULIA: I was dozing.\n          ARCHIE: That's good.\n          PETULIA: You left without having breakfast.\n          ARCHIE: I had a cup of coffee on the way.\n          PETULIA: A cup of coffee. You should have had\n          eggs or waffles.\n          ARCHIE: I'm fine.\n          PETULIA: Me too.\n\n          PAUSE\n          PETULIA: I had a tall glass of pineapple juice.\n          ARCHIE: Make some toast, too. And milk.\n          Breakfast is a very important meal.\n          PETULIA: I wish you'd remember that.\n          ARCHIE: Well, goodbye.\n          0 PETULIA: Archie?\n          ARCHIE: Yes?\n          PETULIA: You won't forget to phone.\n\n          51 EXT. WHARF\n\n          Archie hangs up the phone and starts running with his sons\n          toward the boat. He is very pleased with his absolutely\n          nothing phone conversation.\n\n          52 EXT. BOAT DECK\n\n          Children run scurrying around the mildly crowded deck.\n          The boat is passing Alcatraz Island. Archie and the boys\n          are standing at the rail,\n\n          ARCHIE\n          They used to think that escape from that\n          prison was impossible.\n\n          52A EXT.

Warren and the boys are\n          standing at the rail.\n\n          WARREN\n          They used to think that escape from that\n          prison was impossible.\n\n          52B BACK TO SCENE 52\n          We resume with Archie and the boys.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          SI\n          52B Continued\n\n          MIKE\n          Yes, Dad.

He is trying to keep\n          a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia,\n          it is difficult.\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 MIKE :\n          (to another kid)\n          Doctors can do things like that.

A FISH PLACE ON THE WHARF\n\n          While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie\n          is at the wall telephone.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Hello there.\n\n          LATE AFTERNOON\n\n          55 EXT. THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA\n\n          During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia\n          into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is\n          so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate,\n          Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod,\n          passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over\n          the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful\n          face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery\n          red from the sun.\n          Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate,\n          dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh,\n          dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is\n          just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently\n          hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown\n          out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain.\n          But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than\n          he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is\n          it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the\n          driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it\n          that \"useless\" that goads her?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          53\n\n          55 CONTINUED\n          Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no\n          importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the\n          moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two\n          kooks having a few seconds of horsing around.\n          The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by\n          the honking of thousands of cars and having fully\n          inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the\n          convertible on through.\n          Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the\n          border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there.\n          Petulia thinks, \"okay, you little bastard . \" and\n          zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first\n          moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's\n          tough little face.\n          During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele-\n          phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before.\n          ARCHIE: Hi, there.\n          PETULIA: Hello.\n          ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys.\n          PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie,\n          ARCHIE: I will, I will.\n           PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast.\n          ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia.\n          PETULIA: Like what?\n          ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different\n           things on the menu.\n          PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french\n          fries or baked beans.\n          ARCHIE: Okay.\n          PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you.\n          ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans.\n          PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food?\n          ARCHIE: Yes.\n          PETULIA: Sea bass is nice.\n          ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great.\n          PETULIA: If they grill it,\n          ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass.\n          PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet.\n          ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked.\n          PETULIA: It's such a problem.\n          ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia.\n          PETULIA: Phone.\n\n          56 INT. FISH PLACE\n\n          Archie laughingly hangs up.

Archie approaches it warily,\n          then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids.\n          Archie wants to get back to Petulia.\n\n          58 EXT.

ARCHIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY DAY\n\n          Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty\n          damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of\n          his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers\n\n          60 INT. APARTMENT\n\n          It is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone.\n          All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess.\n          The television set is on: a program without sound of\n          soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that\n          Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting\n          the same type of program.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          A nice, neat kid.\n          After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere\n          things are scattered about.\n\n          61 INT. BEDROOM\n\n          The bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket\n          have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall\n          mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed.\n          Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets\n          and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes.\n          Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets.\n          Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          57\n\n          61 CONTINUED\n          Th\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to\n          turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't\n          sure she has one,\n          Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23.\n          Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up\n          from the broken rib that this is impossible.\n          Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get\n          her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant\n          then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an\n          emergency number.\n          Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse\n          in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling.\n          As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy\n          as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't\n          open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection\n          with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making\n          than a life-saving procedure.\n\n          62 INT./EXT. HALLWAY & STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE' S APARTMENT\n\n           Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on\n\n          0\n          a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber\n          oxygen mask over her mouth.\n          We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp-\n          ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo,\n          facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments;\n          boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied.\n          Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come\n          out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with\n          enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples\n          Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his\n          shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the\n          dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should\n          seem like a nightmare.\n          The dog's owner goes berserk.\n\n          DOG'S OWNER\n          Don't you hit Lennie!\n          Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond.\n          At every door there is a tenant.

All through this we have also been aware of many\n          T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence.\n          One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and\n          we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the\n          Jungle by helicopters.\n          Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead\n          the way down the steps. Half a dozen \"hippies\"' loaded\n          down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up\n          the steps. Everything is chaos.\n          The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the\n          narrow stairway.

A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHT\n\n           This is the stretch of highway 1 - 01 going north from.Mexico.\n          The restaurant is a mass of neon, and does very well in,the\n          hot coffee department as the sleepy travellers take a\n          break on their way north.\n          Among the cars many are filled with bull fight\n          afficianados.\n          It's about ten p.m. There is a general feeling of\n          exhaustion and spent passions. People are bleary-eyed,\n          recovering from hangovers, beginning to feel the effects\n          of sunburns. All this we see later. First we see Oliver.\n          Oliver is sitting in the car staring coldly at David who\n          0 has just awakened.

In one of these scenes we pass through\n          the orthopaedic room.\n\n          69 INT. ORTHOPAEDIC ROOM\n\n          Oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath. He's\n          only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely\n          notices him, simply waving to him as he does to other\n          patients who don't need his care anymore. Oliver is\n          too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn\n          about the doctor. Archie goes and we stay with Oliver.\n\n          0\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          68\n\n          69 CONTINUED\n\n          OLIVER'S ATTENDANT\n          Come on, come on, get on with it.\n\n          70 INT. A SMALL BEDROOM IN THE DANNER HOUSE\n\n\n          JUST BEFORE DAWN\n          Three weeks ago. Oliver is wide awake, wolfing down a\n          loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen.\n          As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct\n          sounds from the master bedroom. moans and groans,\n          a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds\n          of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark.\n          Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the\n          hall. She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a\n          blouse, and is struggling into a coat. Her hair is\n          tousled, her face filled with anguish.\n\n          71 INT. STAIRWAY DANNER HOUSE\n\n          Petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed\n          Oliver down the steps. He is protesting. Before they\n          can reach the front door, the door of the master\n          bedroom opens. David is standing there in his\n          pyjama pants.\n\n          DAVID\n          Hey, \"San Francisco\"!\n          He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down\n          the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid.\n\n          DAVID\n\n          (GENTLY)\n          I sure hope there's no hard feelings.\n          Oliver understands none of this, and of course David\n          knows this, but it doesn't stop him.\n\n          DAVID\n          It isn't a question of hospitality, I\n          want you to understand that. I feel\n          terrible.

Even this is too skinny so David starts\n          fastening it around Oliver's lower leg. Oliver\n          has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's\n          heart tells him he is being given something very\n          valuable. Petulia is repelled.\n\n          DAVID\n          (to Oliver)\n          You see the basic problem is we just don't\n          have the room for all the folks my old\n          lady invites for a visit.

David\n          tries to fit it around the boy's neck.

He knocks on the door but\n          there is no answer. He goes around to the back. There's\n          an old car without wheels, butane tanks, other junk but no\n          sign of life. Archie knocks on the back door and finally\n          the door is opened. Beyond the screen door is the Mexican\n          we have seen earlier. He has been awakened from sleep and\n          is annoyed.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Mr. Mendoza?\n          Mendoza yawns sleepily.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          I'm Dr. Bollen.

An old man lies\n          in the bed with a rubber stop in his mouth to keep him from\n          swallowing his tongue until he regains consciousness. His\n          false teeth lie on the table beside him. Archie is plunged\n          deeper into the sense of the unreal.\n\n          76 INT.

PETULIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM\n\n\n          0\n          The bell is still ringing signifying the end of visiting\n          hours and the other patient's visitors sigh, put the playing\n          cards together and prepare to leave. Mr. Danner makes no\n          move to leave,\n\n          MR. DANNER\n          In the hospital of my dreams people\n          won't be chased out like sheep. People\n          are better than most of the medicines\n          they give you. David has finally'got\n          around to repairing that wharf. He hired\n          a couple of boys. The three of them are\n          really working up a sweat. He's thinking\n          of sailing all the way down the coast to\n          Lima. That's in Peru.\n          All through this there's no response whatever from Petulia.\n          Her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe.\n\n          MR. DANNER\n          They say Lima is a terrific city. If\n          you watch out for flies and take sensible\n          sanitary precautions. I'll tell you a\n          secret but don't you snitch: I'm using\n          propaganda on David so that the four of\n          0 us can go. Mother's a better sailor than\n          I am. Even though I served eighteen\n          months on a mine sweeper.

Mr. Danner is really trembling\n          now from his controlled emotion. Petulia will not take her\n          eyes from the giraffe. The patient in the next bed is\n          grumbling something about \"what's sauce for the goose should\n          be' sauce for the gander\", etc. Mr. Danner abruptly takes a\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 small leather bound photograph from his pocket. It's the\n           wedding picture of Petulia and David. Without a word he puts\n           it on the night stand. Petulia will not look at it.\n\n           79E EXT.

Its\n          a tiny bus station and hardly anyone is around this time of\n          mo'rnin'g. Petulia waits with Oliver who is very annoyed at\n          what has been done to him. A few other early travelers are\n          about.- As the bus comes into sight, Oliver, grasping his last\n          chance of freedom, suddenly darts away. IN A SERIES OF\n          FLASHES we see Oliver; hit by a car; the look of agony on\n          Petuliaa's face; the reaction of the spectators; and finally\n          the ultimate image: the boy pinned under the wheel.\n\n          MR..

At the wharf is the\n          yacht. Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins\n          ringing the bell.\n\n           85 INT.

With the\n          exception of Mr. Danner, he has never seen so many\n          cheerful people in one place.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          (to Petulia)\n          You told the policeman you had a\n          dizzy spell.\n\n          PETULIA\n          Right.

Real mouth-\n          watering Creole cooking.\n          He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this\n          were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to\n          Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He\n          doesn't know what to do.\n\n          PETULIA\n\n          (HAPPILY)\n          I'm fine Archie. Except I burp a lot.\n          Everybody gets dizzy spells.\n          Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed\n          brushing the nurse's hair; to David; to Mr. Danner who's\n          obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs. Danner\n          who is in the dining room setting up an extra place\n          for Archie. What can he do? Abruptly he rushes from\n          the house.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          87\n\n          86 EXT. HOUSE\n\n          Archie runs toward the lift that will move him up the\n          cliff. He can't get away fast enough. He climbs into\n          the lift and pushes the button. The lift begins moving,\n          but too slowly for him. He hops off the lift and begins\n          scrambling up the side of the cliff.\n\n          87 INT. PETULIA'S BEDROOM\n\n          Petulia looks out the window and sees Archie scrambling\n          up the cliff, She fits a curler into the nurse's hair.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          Going back to the house was the only\n          thing I could do.\n           scenes 87A B D .,and E occur only in Petulia's mind.\n\n          87A EXT. ATOP CLIFF DAY\n\n          Petulia is waiting for Archie at the top of the cliff\n          as he staggers toward her. Since everything is taking\n          place in her mind, this is how Petulia really is.\n\n          PETULIA\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          Where else could I go? A lonely hotel\n          room? I don't have a penny of my own.\n          Mr. Danner promised me I'd never be left\n          alone. I thought I'd try it for a few\n          days. Don't be-angry. It was nobody's\n          fault. Actually, if anyone is to blame,\n          it's you, Archie.\n\n          ARCHIE\n\n           (GASPING)\n           Me?I.o\n\n          87B INT. FAIRMONT HOTEL NIGHT\n\n          Petulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie.\n          Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket\n          to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with\n          none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but\n          with absolute desperation. Archie is dressed as he\n           is on the hill (Scene 86).\n\n           PETULIA\n           I'm Petulia Danner . save me like\n           you saved Oliver ... save me from David!\n           Don't lust scramble up the hill like a\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 b oody fool o\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          88\n          87B Continued\n          Archie is stunned.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          I'm looking for the ticket for my raincoat.\n\n          PETULIA\n\n          NOL\n\n          87C INT. PETULIA'S BEDROOM\n\n          From her bedroom window Petulia watches Archie scramble\n          up the hill.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          Coming for me in that pokey little car.\n\n          87D EXT. A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY ROAD DAY\n\n          In Petulia's mind, a great white ambulance is moving\n          majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia\n          to safety.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          9 Why didn't you bring a proper ambulance?\n          As though you really meant it.\n\n          ARCHIE'S VOICE\n          I didn't know what to do. I was going\n          from one moment to the next.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          Spectacular entrance, lousy exit. Sounds\n          familiar, Archie.\n          Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE:\n          No, it's not your fault.\n\n          87E THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DAY\n          Petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because\n          she has something very serious to say to Archie. She\n          is with him on the rocks below the bridge.\n\n          PETULIA\n          I went back to the house because I owed it\n          to David. I have a brown thumb when it\n          comes to men. I put them on the Cross and\n          call them Jesus. And there they hang. I\n          don't know why I do it. Not because of any\n          high opinion of myself... oh, Archie, if you\n          only knew...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          89\n          87E Continued\n          She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David\n          standing there. An incredibly heroic figure in a white\n          blazer and turtle neck sweater. Yet somehow we must\n          sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment\n          in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death.\n\n          PETULIA\n          Look at him. Isn't he super. A six foot\n          three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did\n          that. I'd ruin you, Archie.\n\n          87F INT. BEDROOM\n\n          We are now back in visual reality with Petulia, and\n          the playful David who is trying to make Petulia laugh,\n          which she does.\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          David was the gentlest man I ever knew.\n\n           88 EXT. CLIFF\n\n           Archie has neared the top of the cliff. His pants are\n           ripped, his hands are scraped, he is gasping in anguish.\n\n          \u00c2\u0080\u00a2\n\n          PETULIA'S VOICE\n          I'd ruin you. In five weeks, I'd be\n          running around with a black eye.\n          By now, Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is\n          a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the\n          Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist\n          maniacally.\n\n          89 EXT0 MUIR WOODS DAY\n          During the following SEQUENCE OF SCENES Archie is\n          trying to get back to normality. He's having a nice\n          sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance. It\n          is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are\n          being told about the forest by an Irish guide. In the\n          background Archie's two children are playing with\n          Warren's child.\n\n          WARREN\n          It's never too soon to think of the\n          boys' education.\n          Warren winks at him knowingly.\n\n          ARCHIE\n          Have you thought of doing something\n          about that?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          90\n\n          89 CONTINUED\n\n           WARREN\n           What ?\n\n          ARCHIE\n          ; ; ^ ^ \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd,, That twi Lch v v d.\n\n          WARREN\n          What twitch?

Archie and May are having champagne\n          cocktails. They clink glasses and look at each other\n          through candlelight. Archie spills some of his cock-\n          tail but May doesn't spill a drop. Archie smiles\n          hopefully.\n\n          91 INTO DISCOTHEQUE NIGHT\n          Archie dances with many girls, some hippies, some chic,\n          all terribly young and unsmiling.

The car\n          has stopped at the t p of the hill as has the car going\n          the other way. in the other car is Petulia by herself.\n          Petulia waves f.rst. Archie waves back. Petulia has\n          shopping parcels.\n\n          AR C HIE\n          You look better.\n\n          PETULIA\n          Feel marvelous.

PENGUIN PLACE DAY\n\n          Thirty penguins march around the rim of their pool to the\n          music of Pomp and Circumstance. Through the Public\n          Address System, a voice explains that the penguins\n          represent all nations and are gathered 'here for their\n          own Olympics which they originated two million years ago,\n          when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes.\n          Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees\n          Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels. He\n          tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but\n          he cannot. Actually, he doesn't want to ignore Petulia.\n          He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily.\n          Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then\n          starts toward Petulia.\n          The penguins are now going through various acrobatics\n          while the narrator is telling more about their exotic\n          origins. Archie stumbles through laughing children,\n          ruins a tourist's snapshot, etc., until he finally reaches\n          Petulia.\n          Now one penguin is pushing another penguin in a baby\n          carriage. Everyone thinks it's adorable.\n          Archie sits beside Petulia not really knowing what to say.\n          He hasn't decided whether to be angry that she has followed\n          him,- or amused, or delighted -- or all three.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          92\n\n          0 93 CONTINUED\n          Now the taped music is blaring a Loud marching song as\n          the penguins lumberingly form into a Roman legion, The\n          laughter,, music and applause ?make any intimate conversa-\n          tion almost impossible. But Petulia is waiting for\n          Archie to say something.\n          Archie sees that Mike has turned from the penguins to\n          stare at his father accusingly. Mike won't stop staring.\n          Mike now tries to make Stevie turn and look accusingly\n          with him, Archie doesn't know what to do0\n          Finally, Petulia rises and gathers her parcels,, still\n          quite pleasant. She drops a parcel and Archie retrieves\n          it for hero Its from a sportswear shop,, colorful and\n          gay. As Archie gives Petulia the parcel, she touches\n          his hand, running her fingers lightly over his skin,\n          thoughtful, as though wanting to remember something.\n          Petulia moves quickly through people toward the exit.\n          Archie almost calls her back, but there is too much noise.\n\n          9. INT. CORRIDOR ARCHIE'S APARTMENT DAY\n\n          Archie is returning from work, weighted down with\n          books for his research, plus miscroscope.\n          He sees his apartment door ajar. His heart stops.\n          He kicks his door open with his foot, not daring to\n          think who will be inside.\n\n          95 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT\n\n          No, you're wrong.
