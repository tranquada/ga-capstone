A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a \n               bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of \n               the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. \n               There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--\n\n               --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we\n\n               PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n               PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really \n               a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western \n               themed.\n\n               He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous \n               mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered \n               along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows \n               stronger--there could be a storm.\n\n               PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he \n               continues to type.\n\n               He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good \n               face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other \n               words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen \n               years and for half that time, the most recent half, a \n               remarkably successful one.\n\n               He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a \n               hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another \n               burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the \n               table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this \n               last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, \n               folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of \n               pages.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, as he holds his book to him.

PAUL goes to it, opens it and \n               pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather \n               briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the \n               briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, \n               and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a \n               child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself \n               a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--\n               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales \n               deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles.\n\n               HOLD BRIEFLY, then--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               LODGE - DAY\n\n               PAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws \n               it, hitting a sign.\n\n                                     PAUL\n                         Still got it.\n\n               He throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, \n               holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives \n               away.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A SIGN that reads \"Silver Creek Lodge.\" Behind the sign is \n               the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes \n               out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As \"Shotgun\" \n               by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the \n               mountains.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE SKY.

He looks around the room and listens for \n               sounds. All he hears are the SOUNDS OF A WINTER NIGHT in the \n               mountains. After a few beats, he takes a deep breath and \n               then begins his greatest effort of all: to force his body \n               out of bed, to make it move.\n\n               He's still weak from what he's endured, but that's not the \n               main thing: it's the pain. Any attempt at movement and his \n               legs scream. He sags back, lies there still a moment. Slowly \n               he tries to maneuver his body off the bed. He rolls over \n               onto his stomach, then tries to lower himself onto the floor \n               by moving down head first. His good arm hits the floor, and \n               he is able to hold himself up but, realizing there is no way \n               to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain, he girds \n               himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to \n               the floor.\n\n               The pain is excruciating. After he regains his composure, he \n               slowly crawls toward the door.\n\n               He reaches up and tries the handle. It is, in fact, locked. \n               He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is \n               much too painful and to no avail. He crawls back over to the \n               bed, realizes there's no way to climb back in, then grabs\n\n               the blanket from the bed, wraps it around himself, and closes \n               his eyes.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               BUSTER'S OFFICE.

He sees something.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               BOBBY PIN on the floor.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's \n               brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops. \n               Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               The BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches \n               down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a \n               deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The \n               bobby pin is in his hands.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to \n               jimmy the lock.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing \n               great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor \n               again.\n\n                                     PAUL\n                              (furious)\n                         Shit...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He \n               reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it, \n               clutches it tight.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE KEYHOLE.

He works at it and works at it, \n               but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally \n               he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. \n               Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, \n               tries it. It's locked from the outside.\n\n                                     PAUL\n                         What a surprise.\n\n               He looks off into the living room, and...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE TELEPHONE\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates. \n               It's a musty room. Over the mantel, a photograph of a six-\n               year-old ANNIE, with her mother and father in front of the \n               family car--a new 1952 Buick. These were happier times.\n\n               The windows have bars on them.\n\n               As PAUL begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE PHONE as PAUL at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the \n               \"operator\" button--\n\n                                     PAUL\n                         Operator...\n                              (nothing)\n                         ...OPERATOR...\n                              (wildly frustrated)\n                         ...Shit!\n\n               He shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up, \n               turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He \n               stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the \n               disappointment plain.\n\n                                     PAUL\n                         You crazy bitch...\n\n               He puts the phone back on the table.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE GENERAL STORE. DAY.\n\n               Annie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her \n               Cherokee and drives off.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE STUDY, as PAUL enters. He looks around.\n\n               It's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots \n               of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort, \n               wheels across it--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A shelf of BOOKS. PAUL SHELDON books. EVERY Paul Sheldon \n               book.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, pausing, looking at her collection. The only book on \n               the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook. The title on \n               the back reads \"My Life.\"\n\n               He glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair \n               across the study, and we\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A SMALL TABLE with little ceramic doodads on top. The \n               wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin, \n               fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and \n               shatter--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it \n               was. He continues his slow way across the room and\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE HALLWAY.\n\n               Out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, PAUL \n               notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly \n               it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the  \n               house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but \n               canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke \n               containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he \n               notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees \n               all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of \n               strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and \n               stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry \n               door and heads to the kitchen.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE KITCHEN\n\n               As PAUL approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he \n               has trouble.\n\n               He backs up slightly, wheels forward again--\n\n               --but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. \n               He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE BACK DOOR. It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to \n               the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front \n               door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, staring at the kitchen door--\n\n               --then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower \n               himself out of the chair\n\n               gently to the floor--\n\n               --only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't \n               have the strength to maneuver properly--\n\n               --and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard \n               against the hard floor.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a \n               moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He \n               is hurting.\n\n               He closes his eyes, gathering strength--\n\n               --and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his \n               body across the floor toward the kitchen door.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body \n               move.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is \n               just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and \n               up and grabs the doorknob--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his \n               face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting \n               from his effort. Then--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his \n               wild excitement, as we\n\n               PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n               Sitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out \n               of a slotted wooden block.\n\n               They seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him.

As Chuck Woolery drones \n               on, Paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper \n               from his pad. He is making a container of some sort. He \n               finishes, then reaches down and grabs the Novril capsules \n               that he has been stashing in the mattress.\n\n               Carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his \n               hand. First he smells it--no odor--then he takes a tiny bit \n               on a finger and tastes it--no taste. Then, he takes his paper \n               container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, \n               then places it under the mattress.\n\n               Now, what to do with the empty capsules. He thinks for a \n               second, then--what the hell--he swallows them. He then places \n               the packet back in the mattress.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE TYPEWRITER.

He empties it into \n               her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his \n               pants, talking the whole time:\n\n                                     PAUL\n                         Did you study decorating, or do you \n                         just have a flair?\n\n                                     ANNIE\n                         Oh, you.

PAUL raises his glass.\n\n                                     PAUL\n                         To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who \n                         brought her back to life.\n\n               ANNIE raises her glass.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n                         Oh, Paul, every time I think about \n                         it, I get goosebumps.\n\n               They clink glasses.\n\n               And with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, \n               she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation, \n               she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the \n               candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n                              (wiping up the spilled \n                              wine with her napkin)\n                         Oh, God, what have I done?

A small article: \n               simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes.\n\n               PAUL turns the page. This headline reads: \"Investment Banker \n               Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall.\"\n\n               \"USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall.\" That's the headline \n               on the next page.\n\n               Now: \"Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate.\"\n\n               Paul turns the page.\n\n               Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: \"Ernest Gonyar, 79, \n               Dies After Long Illness.\"\n\n               Now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--\"after \n               long illness\" is from the next article. \"Long illness\" from \n               the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: \n               \"Short Illness.\"\n\n               Now we're in Pennsylvania: \"New Hospital Staff Announced.\"\n\n               And here come those phrases again on page after page--\"After \n               Long Illness.\" \"After Long Illness.\"\n\n               \"After Long Illness.\"\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states \n               keep changing, moving west.

And always the clippings reporting \n               deaths and deaths and--\n\n               --and now we're in Colorado. \"NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED.\" \n               And now the dead are young and helpless; babies.

It's an article from Newsweek magazine, \n               a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow. \n               Above it this caption: \"Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon.\"\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL.

He tries \n               to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he \n               can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too \n               cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his \n               room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles \n               into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his \n               chest and stares up at the ceiling.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               PAUL'S WINDOW, hours later.

After a few beats, he hears \n               something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP.\n\n               HEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL \n               grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of \n               a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS.\n\n               As the FRONT DOOR OPENS, PAUL girds himself for attack. THE \n               FRONT DOOR CLOSES, then a couple of FOOTSTEPS. Then silence. \n               Then the FOOTSTEPS continue down the hall and up the stairs.\n\n               After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining \n               how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate \n               with no money down.\n\n               PAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the \n               mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the \n               ceiling.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE.

There is another loud THUNDERCLAP \n               which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes.\n\n               He turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard, \n               LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed.\n\n               Before he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls \n               it out and starts out of the room.\n\n               PAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes \n               him to collapse, unconscious.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE ROOM. EARLY MORNING.\n\n               It's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly, \n               we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud--\n               for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: \n               It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going, \n               \"Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me \n               to be back with you in Paris...\" PAUL stirs and awakens to \n               discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his \n               arms, but that's it.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together; \n               her eyes are bright.

Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the \n               sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out, \n               Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. \n               The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, \n               who is still lying on the floor.\n\n                                     BUSTER\n                         Mr. Sheldon?\n\n               But before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD \n               EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through \n               Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, \n               smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar \n               steps.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n                         Don't feel bad, Paul.

I've been waiting for this \n                         sign.\n\n               ANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his \n               gun out of its holster.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n                         I've known for some time why I was \n                         chosen to save you. You and I were \n                         meant to be together forever. But \n                         now our time in this world must end. \n                         But don't worry, Paul. I've already \n                         prepared for what must be done. I \n                         put two bullets in my gun, one for \n                         you and one for me. Oh, darling, it \n                         will be so beautiful.\n\n               With that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar.\n\n               Paul's mind races desperately. He looks at the barbecue again. \n               Next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on \n               it.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE TABLE.

An idea hits him--\n\n               --now, PAUL struggles and crawls over to the table. He grabs \n               the lighter fluid in his hands, jams it into the rear of his \n               pants and scrambles back to where ANNIE left him.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANNIE returning with her .38 Special and a hypodermic needle. \n               She stops at the top of the stairs.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n                         Now don't be afraid.

Then, \n               without a word, she turns and goes back up the stairs.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n                         Here, Paul.

He starts dragging himself over BUSTER and up the \n               stairs.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               PAUL'S ROOM.
