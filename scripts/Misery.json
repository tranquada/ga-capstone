A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a \n               bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of \n               the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. \n               There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND--\n\n               --now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we\n\n<b>               PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n</b>\n               PAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really \n               a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western \n               themed.\n\n               He is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous \n               mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered \n               along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows \n               stronger--there could be a storm.\n\n               PAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he \n               continues to type.\n\n               He's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good \n               face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other \n               words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen \n               years and for half that time, the most recent half, a \n               remarkably successful one.\n\n               He pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a \n               hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another \n               burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then--\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n               THE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the \n               table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words:\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n               A PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table.

Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the \n               briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, \n               and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a \n               child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself \n               a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match--\n               there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales \n               deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles.\n\n               HOLD BRIEFLY, then--\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               LODGE - DAY\n</b>\n               PAUL--exiting his cabin.

It is, in fact, locked. \n               He awkwardly tries to slam up against the door, but it is \n               much too painful and to no avail.
