He runs.\n\n     IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip\n     underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the\n     snorting steed's already bleeding flank.\n\n     The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.\n\n     ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.

Ichabod\n     steps from darkness nearby.  He watches with bitter regret as\n     the corpse is consumed.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  CITY -- DAY\n</b>\n     Market town streets bustle.  Filthy.  Pigs roam free.\n\n<b>     INT.  ICHABOD'S HOME, SECOND FLOOR -- DAY\n</b>\n     Decorated in Early-American Mad Scientist: books, papers and\n     jars of chemicals.

He opens the cage.  The bird flies free.\n\n     Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the\n     street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY\n</b>\n     In motion.  Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the\n     strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of\n     tissue.  Many scars.\n\n     Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.\n\n<b>     EXT.

Ichabod looks out, unnerved.\n\n     One GAUNT MAN watches Ichabod pass.  There is a dead, worried\n     look in the man's eyes.  Others stare at Ichabod.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY\n</b>\n     Ichabod faces two massive, vine-covered PILLARS, unsure.  He\n     turns to watch the driver lead the coach away.\n\n     Ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road.\n     He does not notice, above: THREE DEAD RAVENS hang from a tree\n     limb, twine wrapped round their necks.\n\n<b>     EXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, TOWN SQUARE -- DAY\n</b>\n     Ichabod walks on with baggage.  The square is empty, a CHURCH\n     and GRAVEYARD at one end.  The road ahead is bordered by\n     businesses and homes.\n\n     CONVERSATION DRIFTS from a tavern.  A criminal sits in\n     stocks.  A quiet CRYING is HEARD.  Ichabod hears...\n\n     He looks for its source.  It's from a window above, LOUDER.\n     SOUNDS like the SOBBING of an OLD WOMAN.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.

There's a man in the basket\n     and a huge BELL.\n\n     Ichabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the\n     grand Van Tassel Manor House.\n\n<b>     INT.

He backs away, flanked by\n     peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh.\n\n     Ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The\n     blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees\n     Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.\n\n<b>                             LITTLE GIRL\n</b>               Play along.  You must.\n\n     She tugs him.

A towering savage with misshapen\n     features covered in tumors.  He ducks away.\n\n<b>     BACK TO SCENE ON PORCH\n</b>\n     Ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               He is a behemoth.\n\n<b>                             DOCTOR LANCASTER \n</b>               A diseased monster.\n\n<b>                             BALTUS \n</b>               If you gentlemen will excuse the\n               doctor and I... we have financial\n               matters to discuss.\n\n     Ichabod and Killian nod as Baltus and Lancaster head in.\n\n<b>                             KILLIAN \n</b>               Master Crane, sir.

They have children and a good\n               home and good land.\n\n     Ichabod nods.  He turns to look THROUGH THE WINDOW.  In the\n     DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.  His wife questions his\n     health, but he holds her off and vomits.\n\n     Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING\n</b>\n     Ocher dusk.  Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the\n     ground, miserable.

Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.

Killian leads the men to the graveyard.\n     Steenwyck watches, enraged.  He kicks his horse and rides.\n     Philipse looks worried.\n\n<b>     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)\n</b>\n     A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is\n     exhumed.  Ichabod guides the lifting.  The coffin is put near\n     the headstone \"WINDSOR.\"  Ichabod looks...\n\n     At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now\n     take up the PRAYER.\n\n     Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are\n     pried open.  \"VAN GARRETT, 1799.\"  Killian leads the effort\n     with Young Masbath's aid...\n\n     The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and\n     a little BOY.  Young Masbath backs away.\n\n     At the \"WINDSOR\" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the\n     lid.  WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is\n     aghast.  He looks to the men, angry.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Why was I not told of this?\n\n     No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly.\n\n<b>                             KILLIAN \n</b>               The Widow Windsor.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               Is that all you say?

Now, WE SEE: the belly of the\n     headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was\n     very far along in a pregnancy.\n\n     Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He\n     reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.\n\n     He straightens, greatly troubled.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING\n</b>\n     Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long\n     WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.\n\n     Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches,\n     anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner.\n     Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               What is the common thread between\n               these victims?\n\n<b>                             YOUNG MASBATH \n</b>               I'm sure I don't know.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               We must discover it.  The reason the\n               murderer chose these persons.\n\n     Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               The wounds are the same.  Cauterized.\n               No chopping or half-measures either.\n               One stroke took the head.  Have you\n               seen, doctor... ?\n                     (pointing to it) \n               Even the spinal bone... sliced as\n               smooth as butter.\n\n<b>                             DOCTOR LANCASTER \n</b>               I do not care.

Soon as I finish.\n\n     Ichabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               You should step outside.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING\n</b>\n     Ichabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the\n     church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door.\n\n<b>                             FATHER STEENWYCK\n</b>               The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane.\n               The Lord will not forgive your sins.\n\n     Steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.\n\n\n<b>     INT.

Ichabod... come along.\n\n     The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW\n     to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely\n     woman.  She kisses him.\n\n<b>     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Dark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the\n     room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something\n     to no one.  She turns...\n\n     Young Ichabod pretends he is asleep.\n\n     A DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up,\n     curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.\n\n     It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern\n     with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod\n     replaces it, closes the drawer.\n\n<b>     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY\n</b>\n     A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young\n     Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops\n     to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something\n     captures his attention...\n\n     Across the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a\n     FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch.\n     Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious.\n\n<b>     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     LIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.

Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina\n     seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper\n     disk on string, illustrated thusly:\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               Here it is.

He fills the gun\n     from his powder horn.\n\n     The Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.  The\n     blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,\n     exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.\n\n     Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.\n\n     The Horseman charges.\n\n     Brom stands, pulling out the ramrod.

He and the Horseman go at it.\n     Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows.\n\n     At the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away.\n\n     Ichabod grabs a long handled SICKLE.\n\n     Brom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids.\n\n     Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings\n     the sickle. The Horseman blocks.\n\n     The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...\n     countering every strike, METAL RINGING.\n\n     Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it\n     off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.\n\n     The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.\n\n     Ichabod swings the sickle blade...\n\n     Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.\n\n     The Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking...\n\n     The sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away.\n\n     Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.\n\n     He looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to\n     pull the blade from his body.\n\n     Brom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet.\n\n<b>                             BROM\n</b>               We cannot win this.\n\n     They head towards the forest.\n\n     Behind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.

On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and\n     semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.\n\n     Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.\n\n     The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts\n     and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the\n     woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.\n\n     Ichabod swallows, inches closer.\n\n     Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.\n     She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.\n\n     Ichabod's eyes widen.\n\n     Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing\n     deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over\n     her partner's arching back, smearing blood.\n\n     Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...\n     trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks\n     the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.\n\n     Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.\n\n\n<b>     INT.

Without you\n               hanging on my coattails for a change.\n\n     Ichabod keeps walking.  Young Masbath stops, wounded.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.  The whole area\n     is bright from the light off a giant fire.\n\n     There are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,\n     twisted tree.  The tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,\n     and through every branch to lick the sky.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY\n</b>\n     Dawn.  Ichabod is seated overlooking the Hudson.  He stares\n     at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.\n     Gunpowder is tied to a tree.  BIRDS SING.\n\n     The ledger is open in Ichabod's lap.  He thumbs pages\n     absently, just keeps staring off.\n\n<b>     EXT.  FOREST -- DAY (TIME CUT)\n</b>\n     A fire burns in a circle of rocks.  Ichabod's ledger is\n     thrown in.  The pages catch quickly.\n\n     Ichabod watches, then walks away.  He's about to climb onto\n     Gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and\n     digs out a BOOK.  He walks back to the fire, throws it on...\n\n     \"Romeo and Juliet.\"  Flames devour it.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY\n</b>\n     The clearing is silent.  The twisted tree still stands,\n     smoldering, impressive as ever, or perhaps even more so with\n     the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Ichabod packs up baggage.  Young Masbath is miserable.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG MASBATH \n</b>               Won't you change your mind, sir?\n               What can I say to convince you?\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               Nothing.  To hell with this place\n               and all the people here.\n\n     Ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG MASBATH \n</b>               Why... why are you like this?\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>                     (pause, softening) \n               You do not know all that has happened.\n                     (pause) \n               You cannot understand.\n\n<b>     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     A coach, with Gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the\n     orchard.  Van Ripper comes to meet Ichabod and Masbath.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               Half now.  Half when we reach the\n               city.\n\n     Ichabod hands Van Ripper money.  Van Ripper takes the\n     baggage.  Ichabod looks to the Manor House.  Only one light\n     shines, in a second floor window.\n\n     Katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.\n\n     Ichabod turns to Young Masbath, who is beginning to cry.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               This is farewell.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG MASBATH \n</b>               Take me with you.

They will.  You will be\n               well cared for.\n\n     Young Masbath hugs.  Ichabod hugs back, swallowing.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               I am sorry.\n                     (quietly) \n               Forgive me.  I failed you.\n\n     Ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery\n     unbearable.  He climbs in the coach.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG MASBATH \n</b>               Do not go, Constable.  How can you\n               leave?\n\n     INSIDE THE COACH, Ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes\n     his eyes.  He pounds twice on the coach wall.\n\n     OUTSIDE, Van Ripper whips the reins.  The coach starts.\n     Young Masbath follows.  The coach picks up speed on the long\n     straight road.\n\n     Young Masbath stops, wiping tears.\n\n<b>     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Ichabod's coach moves through the town square.  A few people\n     in the churchyard's tent city come out to watch it pass.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     The door is pushed open.  Young Masbath enters, looks around\n     the empty room.  He goes to sit in a chair at the work table,\n     crossing his arms and resting his head.\n\n<b>     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     A plate of food sits untouched.  Katrina is slumped down in a\n     chair, heartbroken, staring into the fireplace.\n\n     Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Van Ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking\n     the entrance of Sleepy Hollow.\n\n<b>     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window\n     between him and the driver slides open.\n\n<b>                             VAN RIPPER \n</b>               Sir... this is yours.\n                     (offering something) \n               The Van Tassel girl said to give it\n               to you after you were gone.\n\n     Ichabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He\n     studies it.  What melancholy.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Katrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD\n     CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind\n     her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes.\n\n<b>     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     A dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young\n     Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door...\n\n\n<b>     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.\n\n     The paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird\n     appears to be inside the cage.\n\n     Ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.\n\n     A tear rolls down his cheek.\n\n     The bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.\n\n     Ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans\n     forward to the window at front.\n\n<b>     OUTSIDE THE COACH\n</b>\n     Ichabod's face appears behind Van Ripper.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Van Ripper, turn the coach about!\n\n<b>                             VAN RIPPER\n</b>               What did you say?\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Turn around.

Katrina?\n\n     Masbath starts down a hall.  He does not see, in another\n     room, Katrina's body is dragged across the floor.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  TOWN SQUARE, DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     The coach comes to Lancaster's.  Ichabod climbs out before it\n     even stops fully, satchel in hand.  He hurries...\n\n<b>     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, PARLOR -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     Doctor Lancaster, half asleep, comes to answer BANGING on his\n     door.  Ichabod pushes past, taking Lancaster's lantern.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Pardon the intrusion...\n\n<b>     INT.

There are two coffins on the floor.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               I never examined these bodies.\n\n     Ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about\n     to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.\n\n<b>                             DOCTOR LANCASTER\n</b>               ... help yourself, you pompous ass.\n               I will be in bed.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Would you stay, doctor?  I may need\n               assistance.\n\n     Lancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead\n     Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained\n     brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Stains of blood.\n\n<b>                             DOCTOR LANCASTER\n</b>               What of it?\n\n     Ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the\n     magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Jagged flesh. \n                     (pause)\n               The Horseman did not do this.\n\n     Ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand\n     with the stitched gash on its palm.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...\n\n     Lancaster holds the lens so that Ichabod can study the cut\n     through it.  Ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his\n     satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.\n\n     THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               No clotting or gathering of pus.

WINDMILL -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina\n     and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.\n\n     BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,\n     lighting up the night.\n\n     On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame\n     with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.\n\n     Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.\n\n     They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his\n     shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.\n     Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               Okay... come on...\n\n     Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running.\n     Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.\n\n     A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...\n\n     SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of\n     burning wood spin all directions.\n\n     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep\n     running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.\n\n     IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off\n     burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.\n\n     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices\n     something horrible...\n\n     In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>                     (as this registers)\n               Oh, no...\n\n     Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady\n     Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...\n\n     SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.\n\n     Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.\n\n<b>                             LADY VAN TASSEL\n</b>               Should have stayed away, Constable.\n\n     Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only\n     to find it empty.  He moves forward.\n\n<b>                             LADY VAN TASSEL\n</b>               Keep back, or I kill her.\n\n     She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.\n     Katrina ceases struggling.\n\n     Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady\n     Van Tassel shoots a glance...\n\n<b>                             LADY VAN TASSEL\n</b>               See him...\n\n     Par off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage.\n\n<b>                             LADY VAN TASSEL\n</b>               You cannot kill what is already dead.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               Let her go!\n\n<b>                             LADY VAN TASSEL\n</b>               Yes... yes.  I think I will...\n\n     Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving\n     against it.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD\n</b>               No!\n\n     The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward.\n\n     Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and\n     missing.  Ichabod backs off.\n\n     DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.\n\n     The Horseman starts running to meet it.\n\n     UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.\n\n<b>                             LADY VAN TASSEL \n</b>               Say goodbye to her.\n\n     Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.  Ichabod avoids, puts all\n     his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.\n\n     Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,\n     sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...\n\n     The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.\n\n     DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...\n\n     She lands hard...\n\n     The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.\n\n     UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.  He runs towards it.\n\n     Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.  He falls.\n\n     DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.  The Horseman is catching up.\n\n     UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.\n\n     Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head\n     with the wooden plank.  She's out.\n\n     Ichabod scrambles to his feet.\n\n     DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the\n     hair as she falls to her knees and screams.\n\n     UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.\n\n     He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.\n\n     DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready\n     by her hair... raises his sword...\n\n     UPHILL, Ichabod throws the skull...\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               Horseman!\n\n     The skull spins through the air...\n\n     The Horseman drops Katrina, reaches up...\n\n     Catches the skull.\n\n     Katrina runs.\n\n     Ichabod runs to meet her, grabs her as she falls, exhausted.\n     Together, they back away from the Horseman.\n\n     The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his\n     shoulders, to its rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.\n\n     TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the\n     Horseman's throat and grip the skull.\n\n     Young Masbath drops the plank, watching in awe.\n\n     The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids\n     become solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil,\n     human face we saw in Baltus' stories.\n\n     He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.\n\n     Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his\n     sward and climbs into the saddle.\n\n     He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.\n     They are so exhausted they fall down.\n\n     Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the\n     Horseman does not want him either.\n\n     The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious\n     form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.\n\n     He rides away with her.\n\n     Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other,\n     then kiss gratefully.\n\n     Ichabod looks to Young Masbath.\n\n<b>                             ICHABOD \n</b>               How are you?\n\n<b>                             YOUNG MASBATH \n</b>               Tired.\n\n     Ichabod smiles and holds out his arm.  Masbath comes over.\n     Group hug.  Lightning brightens the farmland around them.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, BURIAL GROUND -- NIGHT\n</b>\n     HOOFBEATS.  The Horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand\n     on Lady Van Tassel.  Ahead, the twisted tree awaits.\n\n     Lady Van Tassel is awakening, face bloody.  She turns her\n     head and looks forward.  She screams.\n\n     The twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.\n\n     Daredevil picks up speed...\n\n     Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,\n     striking the Horseman.\n\n     For an instant, Horseman and horse are transformed, SKELETONS\n     OF LIGHT, entering the tree.\n\n     Silence and smoke.  At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand\n     sticks out from the tight-shut suture.\n\n     The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  NEW YORK CITY STREET, ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY\n</b>\n     A bright, busy day in New York.  A coach pulls up to\n     Ichabod's home.  Ichabod is the driver.  He gets off, goes\n     and opens the coach door.  He helps Katrina down.  Next,\n     Young Masbath sticks his head out.\n\n     Ichabod goes about unloading bags.  Katrina holds Young\n     Masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.\n\n<b>     THE END\n</b>\n\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Sleepy Hollow</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Andrew Kevin Walker\" title=\"Scripts by Andrew Kevin Walker\">Andrew Kevin Walker</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Tom Stoppard\" title=\"Scripts by Tom Stoppard\">Tom Stoppard</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Mystery\" title=\"Mystery Scripts\">Mystery</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Sleepy Hollow Script.html#comments\" title=\"Sleepy Hollow comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:16:36.317347"}
