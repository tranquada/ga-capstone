It's an\n\teerie dance of technological black magic.\n\n\tAnother pair of Interpreters loom out of the darkness, side\n\tby side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare\n\tof the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal\n\tball.\n\n<b>\tIMAGES FILL THE SCREEN\n</b>\n\tAerial shots, flashing by.  Cuban countryside from 72,500\n\tfeet.  A MAGNIFYING GLASS swings down on its arm in front of\n\tus, magnifying the carpet of trees... and a row of six canvas\n\tcovered OBJECTS among them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT.

WEST WING - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tKenny, briefcase in hand, weaves his way through the empty,\n\tornate hallways of the West Wing.  Past magnificent doorways,\n\tearly American furniture, paintings.  He finally reaches a\n\tdoorway, goes through into:\n\n<b>\tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tA long, narrow affair, window at the back looking out into\n\tthe Rose Garden.  Kenny dumps his briefcase on the desk,\n\tshucks off his coat, removes a folder from his briefcase,\n\tturns and heads back out...\n\n<b>\tINT.

He passes\n\tthe busts of Presidents past, turns left into an elevator. \n\tThe doors close.\n\n<b>\tINT. 3RD FLOOR - FAMILY QUARTERS - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe doors open.  Kenny strides out onto a DIFFERENT FLOOR,\n\tthe third.  He heads down the long, posh hall of the family\n\tquarters.  Fine furnishings, art.  The living White House.\n\n\tHe approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded\n\tby a cluster of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  An agent opens one of\n\tthe doors.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tMorning, Floyd.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSECRET SERVICE AGENT\n</b>\t\tGood morning, Mr. O'Donnell.\n\n<b>\tINT.

Beyond the open floor-to-ceiling\n\twindows, a CROWD.  The Pulaski Day Parade, a glimpse of '69s\n\tAmericana.  High School bands blare Sousa.  The scene is\n\tdeafening, boisterous.  Pols trail Kenny as he crosses the\n\troom: fast, tough, on-the-go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOL #1\n</b>\t\tWe're putting up Potowski next time. \n\t\tWill you guys come out for him?  \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tWho else you got?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOL #2\n</b>\t\tThere's Richardson.

I hear\n\t\tMacmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.\n\n\tKenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. \n\tA Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is\n\tbehind the wheel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tWe're giving the Brits Polaris instead. \n\t\tBut a story'll just aggravate things.\n\n\tScotty stares at Kenny, determined.  Kenny looks away.  And\n\this eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  She is\n\ttalking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE\n\tAGENTS.  What they're saying is lost in the noise.\n\n\tScotty follows Kenny's gaze.  Then the two men share a look,\n\ta silent understanding.  Kenny glances at the Secret Service\n\tguy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tNot today.  He's got tight schedule.\n\n\tThe Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful\n\tWoman.  Scotty acts like nothing has happened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRESTON\n</b>\t\tPretending there isn't a problem won't\n\t\tfix it.

He pretends\n\tto consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tAll right, you're in.  Half hour.\n\n\tReston's won.  But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel\n\ttough in the bargain.  People like Kenny.\n\n<b>\tINT. POLICE CAR - DAY\n</b>\n\tIn the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade\n\tgoers.  The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman. \n\tDisappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd. \n\tIt's an eerie moment.  Something troubles Kenny, and he\n\tglances up at the sky.  A premonition.  But it's a clear,\n\tclear blue.  A day like this, all is right with the world...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT.

There are grim nods of agreement.\n\n\tThe book is open to a PICTURE of an SS-4 BALLISTIC MISSILE. \n\tA photo from Moscow Mayday parade.  An icon of the nuclear\n\tage escorted like some devil-god to a holocaust...\n\n<b>\tEND MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT.

Thin-haired, bespectacled,\n\tacademic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security\n\tAdvisor.  The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS.\n\n\tKenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black\n\tdisplay cases.  And suddenly the world is slightly off\n\tkilter.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tHey, Mac.  You're up bright and early.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUNDY\n</b>\t\tNo, Ken.  I need to see him now...\n\n<b>\tINT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENTIAL FLOOR - DAY\n</b>\n\tKenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy.  They head down\n\tthe long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail\n\tguarding the doors at the end.  But the familiar route feels\n\tstrange, and lasting an eternity.  Kenny eyes the package\n\tunder Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tMorning, Floyd.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSECRET SERVICE AGENT\n</b>\t\tGood morning, Mr. O'Donnell.

But Kenny relaxes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tJust Cuba?  Okay, I got work to do, see\n\t\tyou guys downstairs.\n\n<b>\tINT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tKenny's office is a raging beehive of activity.

It\n\t\tis the only word in politics.  Loyalty. \n\t\tLOYALTY you motherfucking piece of shit!\n\n\tAs Kenny THROWS the phone down at the receiver, and the\n\tPRIVATE DOOR to the Oval Office suddenly opens.  Kenny\n\tglances up.  President Kennedy stands there in the doorway. \n\tKenny thinks he's reacting to the tirade.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tWhat're you looking at?

The President's ornate desk\n\tsits on the right, windows looking out on the Rose Garden\n\tbehind it.  Kenny's gaze swivels to:\n\n\tTHE OTHER END OF THE ROOM where the Interpreters, their\n\tcrewcut chief, ARTHUR LUNDAHL, 50's, and Bundy stare at him. \n\tThey're surrounded by PRESENTATION BOARDS propped up around\n\tthe fireplace.  The President's rocking chair and sofas.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tYou used to look down a bomb sight for a\n\t\tliving, Ken.  What do you see?\n\n\tIn eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, Kenny makes his way\n\tamong the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery, stops in\n\tfront of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects.  It\n\tunleashes a wave of memories.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tWe hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45. \n\t\t\t(beat, incredulous)\n\t\tIt looks like a rocket base...\n\n\tHe puts his hand out to touch the image, then turns and looks\n\tto the President, knowing what they must be.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUNDY\n</b>\t\tOn Sunday morning, one of our U-2s took\n\t\tthese pictures.

Kenny glances to the other men.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLUNDAHL\n</b>\t\tThey appear to be the SS-4: range of a\n\t\tthousand miles, three-megaton nuclear\n\t\twarhead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tJesus Christ in Heaven...\n\n<b>\tINT.

See you then.\n\n\tKenny hangs up.  The President enters.  A beat.  And in that\n\tbeat, there's a void.  The two men are off their emotional\n\tstride, trying to grope their way out of shock.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tWhere's Bobby?\n\n\tKenny nods, acknowledging the feeling\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKENNY\n</b>\t\tShould be here any minute.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tGood.\n\n\tAnd we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by Bobby's\n\tabsence.

And the\n\ttension goes out of them instantly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tIn here!\n\n\tThey turn to the door as BOBBY KENNEDY, 37, the President's\n\tyounger brother/Attorney General, enters.  Bobby shuts the\n\tdoor behind him, falls into Kenny's chair, and clearly\n\tgrappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOBBY\n</b>\t\tJesus Christ, guys.  What the hell's\n\t\tKhruschev thinking?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tDid you have any indication of this from\n\t\tGeorgi?  Any possible warning or sense\n\t\tof motivation?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOBBY\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tComplete snowjob.

Unconsciously, all three men assume the same\n\tgait: confident, powerful, no longer disoriented.\n\n\tAnd before our eyes, the three men's game faces appear, and\n\tthey become the hard-ass leaders of the United States. \n\tSecret Service Agents throw open the massive double doors to\n\tthe Cabinet Room.\n\n<b>\tINT.

I\n\t\trecommend, sir, air strikes followed by\n\t\tinvasion, perhaps preceded by an\n\t\tultimatum to dismantle the missiles if\n\t\tmilitary necessity permits.\n\n\tTaylor nods, vindicated.  The others murmur their approval. \n\tBobby, at the table in front of Kenny and to his left, trades\n\ta dire look with Kenny.  This is happening too fast.  Bobby\n\tholds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed.\n\n\tThe President sinks back in his chair, staring at Acheson.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tThen it appears we have three options. \n\t\tNumber one.

Bobby is writing something.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tAnd three, invasion.\n\n\tBobby looks over his shoulder at Kenny, and REACHES BACK to\n\thim with a folded NOTE.

Kenny rises, slips the\n\tnote in front of the President.\n\n\tThe President unfolds the note, and we HOLD ON IT and his\n\treaction as in the b.g., out of focus, Taylor speaks:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGENERAL TAYLOR\n</b>\t\tYes, sir, we're preparing to implement\n\t\tall three options, though I must stress\n\t\tagain, sir, there are risks to the\n\t\tstrikes without the follow-on invasion.\n\n\tBundy clears his throat.

They will\n\t\trefuse.  When they do, you will order\n\t\tthe strikes, followed by the invasion. \n\t\tThey will resist, but will be overrun. \n\t\tThey will retaliate against a target\n\t\tsomewhere else in the world, most likely\n\t\tBerlin.  We will honor our treaty\n\t\tcommitments and resist them there,\n\t\tdefeating them per our plans.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTHE PRESIDENT\n</b>\t\tThose plans call for the use of nuclear\n\t\tweapons.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd what is the next step?\n\n\tAcheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache.  A\n\tdramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tACHESON\n</b>\t\tHopefully cooler heads will prevail\n\t\tbefore we reach the next step.\n\n\tA chill runs down Kenny's spine.  He looks in shock to the\n\tPresident.  The President remains calm.  But in place of the\n\tfated look the President has had, there's a hesitation.\n\n<b>\tINT.

Military uniforms dominate the room: General Taylor,\n\tGeneral Sweeney, and a host of briefing officers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGENERAL TAYLOR\n</b>\t\tThe situation is worse than we thought. \n\t\tWe count 40 missiles now, longer range\n\t\tIRBMs.  They can hit every city in the\n\t\tcontinental U.S.\n\n\tThe President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his\n\tback to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60. \n\tBeetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general. \n\tYet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps,\n\tthat suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in.\n\n\tThe only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and\n\tMcNamara.  The pressure from the military is almost physical.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEMAY\n</b>\t\tMr. President, as of this moment my\n\t\tplanes are ready to carry out the air\n\t\tstrikes.  All you have to do is give me\n\t\tthe word, sir, and my boys will get\n\t\tthose Red bastards.\n\n\tThe President continues staring out the window.

American is in\n\t\tdanger.  Those missiles are a threat to\n\t\tour bomber bases and the safety of our\n\t\tnuclear deterrent.  Without our\n\t\tdeterrent, there's nothing to keep the\n\t\tenemy from choosing general nuclear war. \n\t\tIt's our duty, our responsibility to the\n\t\tAmerican people to take out those\n\t\tmissiles and return stability to the\n\t\tstrategic situation.

LeMay steps forward, softer now, sincere.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLEMAY\n</b>\t\tMr. President, the motto I chose for SAC\n\t\tis 'Peace is our Profession.'  God\n\t\tforbid we find ourselves in a nuclear\n\t\texchange.  But if launched, those\n\t\tmissiles in Cuba would kill a lot of\n\t\tAmericans.

In\n\tits place, a severe confidence.  A grandeur Kenny has never\n\tseen.\n\n\tIt makes Kenny pause.  He beholds his best friend become a\n\tman of the ages.  And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door.\n\n<b>\tINT. BOBBY'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tAnd a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history.  HOLD ON\n\tBobby's waiting room.  Silent.  Cavernous.

Two doorways, one at either end of the room.\n\n\tA WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  Dressed in\n\tgray.  Prim.  But beautiful.  A secretary of some sort.\n\n\tOne of the double doors to the hall swings silently open. \n\tKenny glides in.  He sees the other door shut at the far end\n\tof the room.  Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait.\n\n\tHOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent.\n\n\tKenny WHISTLES two notes.  Stops.  And then he begins to\n\tWHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.  He gets a bar into\n\tit -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH.\n\n\tKenny stops.  Then notices the Woman in gray across the room. \n\tHe didn't see her.  It's dim over there.

And begins to WHISTLE again.\n\n\tThe haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling,\n\tfilling the dim room.  Strange, sad, beautiful.  The woman\n\tlistens.  And her face begins to soften.  \n\n\tKenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving\n\tto fill the empty room.\n\n\tKenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming...\n\tand the Woman's voice breaks in.  Kenny stops, looks over. \n\tHer voice is tremulous and beautiful.  Just a snatch of some\n\tsong in Russian.  She stops, awkward.\n\n\tKenny stares.  The Woman stares back.  No smiles.

It's turned to face the occupant of\n\tthe chair behind the desk.  Kenny reaches out, turns it\n\taround.

During this time, the Washington-Moscow\n\thotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis,\n\tmiscommunication would not lead to nuclear war.\n\n\tThe President was assassinated on November 22nd, a year after\n\tthe crisis ended.\n\n<b>\tTHE SUPER:\n</b>\n\tBobby Kennedy ran for president in 1968.  After winning the\n\tCalifornia primary, he called Kenny from the Ambassador Hotel\n\tin Los Angeles and told him, \"I finally feel like I'm out\n\tfrom under my brother's shadow.\"\n\n\tBobby was assassinated minutes later.\n\n<b>\tTHEN SUPER:\n</b>\n\tThe members of EXCOM continued  to serve with distinction in\n\tgovernment in various capacities over the next three decades.\n\tAs Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara\n\turged containment of the Soviet threat in every theatre of\n\tconflict around the world.  He ultimately advised President\n\tJohnson to increase the U.S. military commitment to one of\n\tthese minor backwater conflicts: Vietnam.\n\n<b>\tAND FINALLY SUPER:\n</b>\n\tKenny O'Donnell witnessed the President's assassination from\n\tthe car behind.  He went on to head the Peace Platform at the\n\t1968 Democratic National  Convention, fighting to end the\n\tVietnam War.  He died in 1977.\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Thirteen Days</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Self\" title=\"Scripts by David Self\">David Self</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Thirteen Days Script.html#comments\" title=\"Thirteen Days comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:18:09.056175"}
