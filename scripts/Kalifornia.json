Far below \n               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the \n               drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes \n               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks \n               strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... \n               Closer... Closer...\n\n               Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench \n               it free from its muddy grave. Even closer...

He has no table manners at all. He eats with \n               his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right \n               hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open.

Early takes off his boot, then \n               his well-worn sock. Carrie's look of disgust grows as Early \n               brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he \n               eats.

Brian lifts himself \n               to his feet.\n\n               He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway, \n               and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the \n               leg.\n\n               Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still. \n               Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain \n               around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs. \n               Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's \n               arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt \n               collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that \n               Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm \n               drops back down to his side.\n\n<b>                                     EARLY\n</b>                         Hey Bri...
