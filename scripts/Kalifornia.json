Flashes of lightning reveal momentary \n               glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below \n               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the \n               drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes \n               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks \n               strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... \n               Closer... Closer...\n\n               Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench \n               it free from its muddy grave. Even closer...

NIGHT\n\n               We can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of \n               an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. \n               Flash!!\n\n               Through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a \n               70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting \n               image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright \n               red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her.\n\n               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT\n\n               FLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat \n               up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as \n               he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door.\n\n               The pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in \n               a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs \n               down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She \n               seems nervous... scared even.\n\n                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL\n                         Thanks.\n\n               As she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has \n               been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and \n               stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to \n               a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts \n               his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing \n               against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift \n               into drive.\n\n               Another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls \n               out into the night.\n\n               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! \n               Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly \n               against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN \n               KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, \n               and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight \n               black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical \n               cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one \n               hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into \n               the tape recorder.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Her father worked the night shift \n                         here.

The same strong male hands \n               that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket \n               clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of \n               the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up \n               against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal \n               the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.\n\n               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, \n               revealing another room.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         This is it.

This defroster never works...\n\n               The driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. \n               He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. \n               The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.\n\n                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL\n                         ...Mmm... feels good.\n\n               She closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face.

With Early's food in hand, she makes \n               her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. \n               She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of \n               something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance, \n               she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its \n               window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads \n               \"OPEN.\"\n\n               AT THE FRONT DOOR\n\n               She wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously \n               out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door \n               and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her \n               way to the rear of the diner then notices something.

She starts to \n               try on her new shoes.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         I feel kind of like the wizard of \n                         oz, you know when she gets the red \n                         shoes.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me \n                         that chili there.\n\n               She passes the bag to Early.

She begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by Brian.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Tonight turned out to be pretty \n                         interesting.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         The party?\n\n               She grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         The warehouse.

She has stripped down to her black bra and \n               panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap. \n               A surprised Brian stands there a moment. Looking at Carrie. \n               She looks great.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Carrie pushes Brian back onto the bed.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Carrie climbs on top of him. She kisses his neck. Slowly \n               starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach.\n\n               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING\n\n               A solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house.\n\n               INT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING\n\n               Through the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past \n               the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his \n               right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen \n               half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of \n               Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she \n               sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with \n               water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         You thirsty Lucy?\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               She waters her small cactus (Lucy).\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         Bet that feels good, don't it?\n\n               NEW ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR\n\n               Adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by \n               a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it \n               up.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         Now if that ain't Momma's little \n                         angel.\n\n               Adele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young \n               Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about \n               ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped \n               over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt \n               dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned \n               to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to \n               the news.\n\n               NEW ANGLE ON EARLY\n\n               A handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his \n               eyes.\n\n               The NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder.\n\n                                     NEWSCASTER (O.S.)\n                         ...two more victims last night, when \n                         a twenty pound rock smashed through \n                         the windshield of their car...\n\n               CLOSER - EARLY'S FACE\n\n               Slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off \n               one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops \n               open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The \n               pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The \n               newscaster's voice continues to amplify...\n\n                                     NEWSCASTER\n                         This was the third such attack in \n                         the past month and while an extensive \n                         police operation is underway... no \n                         arrests have yet been made.\n\n               The newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes \n               his eyes and drifts back to sleep.\n\n               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE MORNING\n\n               Early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He \n               looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless \n               junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway \n               of the trailer in her bathrobe.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         Early...\n\n               She glances around to make certain that no one's looking, \n               then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         Have a good one.\n\n               Early smiles.

I forgot to tell you, Mr. \n                         Diebold was by again yesterday.\n\n               Early looks at the run down house next door where Diebold \n               lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         He said, if he ain't got the rest of \n                         his money by the end of the month, \n                         he's gonna \"kick us the...\n                              (spells the word fuck \n                              to avoid saying it)\n                         F-U-C-K outta here.\"\n\n               Early works his jaw, thinking.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         He said that, huh?

Did you \n                         hear from the gallery?\n\n               Brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series \n               of erotic images being projected on the far wall. They are \n               slides of Carrie's photographic work. In regard to the nature \n               and content of Carrie's photographic work, her photographs \n               address the sexual collision of opposites. \"What if's.\" The \n               subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly \n               unlikely partners. Studies in contract. Moments of passion.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                              (tentative)\n                         You got your slides back.\n\n               From across the room, he hears Carrie's disembodied voice. \n               He drifts toward the couch.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         Yeah, same old shit.

Who cares.\n\n               Brian finds her slumped down on the couch. He sits down. \n               She's got a drink in her hand. A bottle on her lap. She \n               continues to click through the slides. As she rambles on, \n               it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of \n               something 90 proof.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         Christ Brian I'm dying here... you \n                         are too, you just don't know it yet. \n                         You're too busy working on that damned \n                         thesis...

Realizing he is in Carrie's photo he stops and \n               poses. Carrie looks to Brian.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Sorry, Early...

A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around \n               the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of \n               them.

Inside the kitchen, right \n               next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a \n               purse on it.\n\n               Suddenly... Early's reflection appears in the window; he has \n               obviously seen the purse.\n\n               AT THE FRONT DOOR\n\n               Brian motions for Carrie to join him.\n\n               AT THE SWING SET\n\n               Adele watches Brian and Carrie for a moment, then loses \n               interest. She stands on the seat of the swing and begins \n               swinging.\n\n               AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE\n\n               Early tries to push up the kitchen window. It barely lifts \n               three inches before jamming. Through the room we see the \n               little girl and her father step to the front door.\n\n               EXT.

His shoulder \n               presses against the window pane. But still he can't reach \n               the purse. So, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it \n               toward him. The purse slides closer, inch by inch. All the \n               while, he keeps one eye on the Farmer across the room.\n\n               EARLY'S POV (ACROSS THE ROOM) The Farmer's back is turned to \n               the kitchen as he listens silently to Brian.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         ...I'm sure you're aware that this \n                         is the Novak house...\n\n               AT THE SWING SET\n\n               Adele swings even higher.

Brian stares at it. Early's \n               eyes open.\n\n               EXT. PARKED LINCOLN - LATER\n\n               A deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is \n               broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian \n               how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old \n               car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of \n               shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Only thing my old man ever gave me \n                         is that goddamn .45.\n\n               Brian fires off another shot, misses again.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Bri', you're jerkin' it when you \n                         pull the trigger, hold it real steady.\n\n               Nearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of \n               her pocket.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         Boys'll be boys.\n\n               Carrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         You know any tricks?\n\n               Carrie shakes her head no. Adele withdraws her offer.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                         You wanna learn some?\n\n               Again Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian.\n\n               ON EARLY AND BRIAN\n\n               Early helps Brian to hold the gun.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Steady... Breath in... now let half \n                         of it out, and... fire.\n\n               BANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie \n               to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to \n               the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow \n               after her... But Early grabs his attention.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Bri, I want you to keep this gun... \n                         consider it a present. Never know, \n                         California could turn out to be a \n                         dangerous place.\n\n               Brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand.\n\n               EXT. AN EMPTY HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n               The Lincoln rolling along.\n\n               INT. LINCOLN\n\n               Brian is driving. Carrie keeps to herself. In her side mirror \n               she catches a glimpse of Early curled up in Adele's lap. She \n               watches a moment longer... and realizes that they are making \n               out. Beginning to kiss and touch one another.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR ABATTOIR - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In \n               the distance, we see a large rundown building.\n\n               INT. AN OLD DESERTED ABATTOIR - AFTERNOON\n\n               The Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian \n               glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele \n               and sees that they are amorously engaged.\n\n               Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens \n               the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the \n               .45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the \n               glove compartment.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little \n                         sleepy,... think Adele and me are \n                         gonna take us a fiesta.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                              (pissed off)\n                         Siesta.\n\n               Carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, \n               locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she \n               and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the \n               structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele \n               leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white \n               top starts to come up.\n\n               INT. ABATTOIR\n\n               Even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building \n               is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last \n               rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. \n               The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat-\n               hooks hanging from the ceiling.\n\n               Carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet \n               and uncommunicative.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               CLOSE, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest \n               on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room. \n               Brian pops a cassette in the player.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         What's that?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         A copy of a tape they found. He \n                         recorded everything.\n\n               Camera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the \n               fact that this place repels her.\n\n               Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The \n               small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we \n               slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman \n               being tortured and pleading for her life.\n\n               FLASH!! FLASH!!\n\n               Carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. \n               Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams \n               from the audio tape bounce off the walls.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                              (speaks into his small \n                              hand held tape \n                              recorder)\n                         His mother had him working in here \n                         before he was eight years old... \n                         killing animals with a sledgehammer \n                         that was bigger than he was.\n\n               Brian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into \n               another room.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         When she was pissed at him, she'd \n                         beat the shit out of him and lock \n                         him in here overnight...\n\n               The pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady \n               whimpering.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         ...Eventually the boy wakes up one \n                         morning, picks up that sledgehammer \n                         and starts hurting back.\n\n               FLASH!! FLASH!!\n\n               Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then \n               she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough. \n               Brian follows after her.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         There's more...\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         I'm finished.\n\n               Carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Look...

Adele is straddling \n               him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button.\n\n               Early's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press \n               up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's \n               finger presses down on the button, CLICK!!\n\n               Then in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back \n               seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... \n               Talking dirty to Adele.\n\n               Keeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through \n               a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the \n               motor drive once all the film is shot out.\n\n               Then unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at \n               Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele.\n\n               A chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. \n               She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's \n               arms.

An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much \n               younger Mr. Musgrave in a '50's kitchen.

The older woman's eyes staring past Adele to the \n               floor nearby. Adele follows the terrified woman's gaze to \n               find... Mr. Musgrave's body lying on the floor. A bloodied \n               wound in the back of his head. All of Adele's enthusiasm \n               drains from her face.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (to Mrs. Musgrave)\n                         Well 'Peaches'... you're a widow \n                         now.\n\n               Mrs. Musgrave collapses to the floor.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER\n\n               Brian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano. Across from \n               them, Early sits in an overstuffed chair looking through \n               Carrie's collection of erotic photography.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (to Brian)\n                         Have you seen this one?

Confused, he turns it upside \n               down, stares at it.\n\n               INT. THE DEN - SAME TIME\n\n               Mrs. Musgrave is laid out on the couch. Adele, deep in \n               thought, watches over the older woman. Finally Adele reaches \n               into her purse, pulls out her small potted cactus then walks \n               across the room to a table. Its top is covered with small \n               potted cacti. She gently places hers among them.\n\n               ON MRS. MUSGRAVE\n\n               Mrs. Musgrave begins to regain consciousness. Her eyes open \n               to find... Adele standing over her. Adele brings her finger \n               to her lips -- Shhhh.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n               Early looks through several more photos. He stops on one of \n               a nude woman's torso. Early looks at it for a moment... then \n               extends the photo out toward Carrie, comparing it to her.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (smiles and shakes \n                              his head in disbelief)\n                         That's you ain't it?\n\n               Carrie doesn't answer him. Then, in the background directly \n               behind Early... Adele and Mrs. Musgrave quietly appear. Carrie \n               notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the \n               kitchen. Early sees Carrie's eyes glance past him. He turns \n               to see why... when...\n\n                                     CARRIE (O.S.)\n                         You're right Early...\n\n               Early stops.

Do you like it?\n\n               Early looks at the photo again. Adele and Mrs. Musgrave now \n               cross safely to the kitchen. Carrie eyes meet Early's. He \n               smiles, pulls the nude photo of her close to his face... and \n               licks it.\n\n               INT.

She looks into \n               Adele's eyes... and knows it's not. The old lady turns and \n               walks out into the dark desert. Adele stands at the open \n               door, watching Mrs Musgrave escape.\n\n                                     ADELE\n                              (in a whisper)\n                         ...Call me.\n\n               INT.

Adele \n               turns to face him. Early looks past her into the night and \n               realizes what she's done. He strides across the room pulling \n               the pistol from his waistband.\n\n               AT THE KITCHEN DOOR\n\n               Early pushes Adele out of the way.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (shouting)\n                         Peaches!

Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she \n               pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward, \n               disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the \n               kitchen door, bewildered. Then...\n\n                                     EARLY (O.S.)\n                         Oww! Oww!! -- FUCK!!!!\n\n               Early re-emerges from the shadows. Adele's eyes widen when \n               she sees him. His cheek has long bloody gashes where the \n               cactus ripped the flesh.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (perplexed)\n                         Honey... What do you think you're \n                         doin'?\n\n               Adele starts to cry.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying \n                         'bout?

I'm not \n                         gonna climb up that Hollywood sign \n                         with you... I decided. I think your \n                         mean, and you hurt people.\n\n               A look comes over Early's face that we've never seen before. \n               That he's never felt before. Hurt. He doesn't know how to \n               deal with it. And he definitely doesn't like it.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS SCENE)\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Carrie, watch for Early.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         What are you going to do?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I'm going to try and lift the end of \n                         the piano. If I can... slide your \n                         cuffs free.\n\n               Carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses \n               his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his \n               strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. \n               Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         What about you?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I don't know.\n\n               Carrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices \n               a chair nearby.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         Can you lift it again? Just lift it, \n                         hurry.\n\n               Carrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes \n               the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano \n               suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor \n               and slips the cuffs free.\n\n               When... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden.\n\n               A moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's \n               pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees \n               Brian and Carrie standing.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         You two been busy in here.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         What happened to Adele?\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Well, let's put it this way.\n                              (beat)\n                         I need me a new woman.\n\n               A shocked silence. Brian and Carrie look to one another. \n               Carrie moves toward the kitchen but Early stops her! Brian \n               rushes at him. Early sticks the .45 automatic in his face!\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Sorry about this Bri...\n\n               He starts to squeeze the trigger.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                              (desperate)\n                         Early, don't.\n\n               Early stops. He looks to Carrie.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                         I'll do whatever you want. You want \n                         me to go with you, I'll go with you. \n                         Just don't kill him.\n\n               Early deliberates the situation, then eases up off the \n               trigger... and smiles to Brian.\n\n               Then, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the \n               butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor \n               unconscious.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING\n\n               As Early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, Little \n               Boy onto the hood. He reaches down and grabs a six pack of \n               beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides \n               into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is \n               now wearing one of Adele's floral dresses.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Think anyone will notice?\n\n               Carrie doesn't answer, Early laughs.\n\n               INT. LINCOLN\n\n               Early looks out over the expanse of the desert. He sees a \n               dirt fire road.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         I'll bet there's a 'door' out there... \n                         save us some time.\n\n               Carrie doesn't understand what he means. Nonetheless, she \n               nods her head in agreement.\n\n               EXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE\n\n               The Lincoln heads out, past the cactus garden, into the \n               darkness.\n\n               THE LINCOLN'S HEADLIGHTS REVEAL\n\n               Adele's lifeless body on the ground near her beloved cacti.\n\n               FADE TO BLACK WITH THE DEPARTING HEADLIGHTS\n\n               INT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - MORNING\n\n               Brian is handcuffed on the floor. His eyes open slowly as he \n               begins to regain consciousness. He senses someone behind \n               him. He pivots around to see Mrs. Musgrave kneeling down to \n               help him.\n\n               EXT. DESERT - SAME TIME\n\n               In the distance, a cloud of dust reveals the Lincoln, \n               traveling at high speed along the dirt fire road.\n\n               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME\n\n               Early still behind the wheel. Carrie sits up against the \n               passenger side door. She is tense and guarded. Out the window, \n               nothing but empty desert.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Pass me a beer hon'.\n\n               Carrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and \n               reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and \n               pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she \n               hesitates a moment...\n\n               NEW ANGLE: EARLY'S POV IN THE DRIVING MIRROR\n\n               Early watches Carrie.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         You wanna hit me with that, huh?\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               Carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the \n               front seat.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                              (not looking at him)\n                         No.\n\n               She hands the bottle to him. Early reaches out for the beer, \n               but instead of taking it, he clasps his hand over hers.\n\n               He looks at her and begins to squeeze...\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Stop lyin'... I can see right through \n                         you.\n\n               Early squeezes even harder -- Carrie begins to wince with \n               pain. She waits for the glass bottle to shatter in her hand.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Who d'ya think you're foolin'?\n                              (beat)\n                         I know you better than you think...\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                              (confused)\n                         ...You're hurting me...\n\n               Early hits the brakes. The car screeches to a halt in a cloud \n               of dust. Early squeezes on her hand even harder and begins \n               to drag her toward him.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         I seen the way you been lookin' at \n                         me since we met...

Pulls her head around -- \n               forcing her to look at him. Early has Carrie right up against \n               him, looking right into her eyes.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (whispers)\n                         You were plenty hot.\n\n                                     CARRIE\n                              (explodes)\n                         You sick twisted fuck!

Early releases Carrie, taking the beer from her. \n               Carrie retreats back into the corner of the passenger side.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         That's better...

LINCOLN - SAME TIME\n\n               Early throws the bottle of beer out the window (it ain't \n               Lucky Lager), slams the Lincoln into \"drive\" and accelerates \n               along the dirt road.\n\n               INT.

MUSGRAVE HOUSE - THE NEXT MOMENT\n\n               An anxious Brian hustles into the cab of the pickup truck. \n               Some tools are in the back. Brian still wears the handcuffs \n               around his wrists. Mrs. Musgrave stands near the front door.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Which way did they go?\n\n                                     MRS.

DESERT - LATER\n\n               The wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire \n               road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see. \n               The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier.\n\n               The gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood.\n\n               INT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME\n\n               Carrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan \n               the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie \n               reaches for her pack of cigarettes. Early, without a word, \n               reaches out and takes the pack from her. He crumples it up \n               and throws it out the window.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               Carrie's eyes go to the instrument panel. The temperature \n               gauge is in the red.\n\n               EXT. DESERT\n\n               The pickup truck arrives at a crossroads and skids to a halt. \n               Brian tries to guess which direction to take. Then he spots \n               Early's discarded beer bottle up ahead. The truck accelerates \n               straight ahead, tires spinning.\n\n               EXT. DESERT - LATER, THE SUN IS ON THE HORIZON\n\n               The winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. \n               The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is \n               streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view.\n\n               Finally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to \n               a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln \n               has had it.\n\n               Early is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards \n               away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old \n               1950's style building.\n\n               INT.

DESERT - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The sun is starting to set behind a distant mountain range. \n               In the far distance... The pickup truck, revealed by its \n               trail of dust, crosses the vast landscape.\n\n               EXT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE\n\n               Early and Carrie struggle through the growing sand storm. \n               Carrie throws a last curious glance back to the Lincoln as \n               they reach the front door.\n\n               INT.

DESERT - THE SMASHED WOODEN GATE\n\n               The last rays of the setting sun reveal the pickup truck \n               heading toward the smashed remains of the wooden gate. The \n               pickup truck hurtles through the opening left by the Lincoln.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               On a collapsed old wooden sign.

'50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows. \n               A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room \n               area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the \n               waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the \n               knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on \n               some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared \n               to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere.\n\n               Amidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed \n               about the room.\n\n               ON EARLY\n\n               Still unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one \n               on the side.\n\n               With the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early... \n               To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie. \n               Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he \n               begins to move toward her. The time has arrived.\n\n               He reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her \n               feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses \n               her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She \n               seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her, \n               until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward \n               crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around \n               his neck and kisses him deep and hard...\n\n               Suddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard \n               across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away, \n               the palm of her right hand is bleeding.\n\n               Early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass \n               protruding from his side.\n\n               He pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and \n               onto his jeans.\n\n               Carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically \n               looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two \n               adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed, \n               intertwined in a grotesque sexual position.\n\n               Carrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts \n               her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her \n               over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she \n               stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the \n               mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (friendly)\n                         You'll like it...\n\n               A violent gust of wind sends several of the erotic photos \n               swirling through the air. One of the photos whips across \n               Early's chest. The wind holds it there momentarily.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Not a lot, but you'll like it.\n\n               Early peels Carrie's photo off him, the blood from his wound \n               covers the back of it. He slaps it against the nearest wall. \n               It sticks. He walks toward her.\n\n               INT. PICKUP TRUCK - BRIAN'S POV\n\n               The high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm. \n               Brian is still driving dangerously fast. The dim lights of \n               the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road \n               ahead and the swirling sand.\n\n               He passes a road sign: 'DEVASTATION DRIVE'\n\n               Then...

DESERT\n\n               Sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked \n               pickup truck. Brian is upside down with his eyes shut. A \n               trickle of blood runs down his face. Camera booms up a dirt \n               slope to reveal the Lincoln, beyond it on the hill above \n               sits the desert house. The glow of the kerosene lamp is \n               visible through the windows.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT. DESERT HOUSE - DAWN\n\n               The storm is over... No sand blowing. No wind. No nothing.\n\n               COMPLETE SILENCE!!!!\n\n               The dawn light reveals the devastated '50's house to be one \n               of a cluster, set at the end of a 'Doom Town' cul-de-sac.\n\n               INT. '50'S HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n               In the darkened bedroom, Early's solitary figure rustles \n               atop the bed. Slowly, he awakens. His eyes open. Across the \n               bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. In \n               the other cuff is Carrie's motionless hand.\n\n               Then, out of the corner of his eye, Early sees something in \n               one of the nearby rooms. Curious, he stands, shoves the .45 \n               automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway.\n\n               As he passes through the living room and enters the hallway, \n               his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment.\n\n               EARLY'S POV\n\n               A blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps \n               around the front door frame... It looks like a magical \"door\" \n               shrouded in a wall of light!\n\n               ON EARLY\n\n               In disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the \"door\"... and \n               sees through a window at the opposite end of the house... \n               the morning sun rising. With that he turns his attention \n               back to the front door!\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         I knew there was doors out here!\n\n               He walks toward the doorway of light. He grins as he opens \n               the \"door\" and steps through it. The sunlight momentarily \n               blinding him.\n\n               EARLY'S POV\n\n               A black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness... \n               Eventually it blocks out all the light until... WHAAMM!!!!\n\n               EXT. DOOR\n\n               A blow knocks Early back through the doorway. He slams to \n               the ground, on his back. The gun falls from his jeans and \n               slides across the floor. A look of joyful amazement over the \n               blood covered remains of his face, he tries to get up, but \n               can't.\n\n               EARLY'S POV\n\n               Brian, silhouetted, steps into the doorway. He holds a shovel \n               raised, ready to deliver a second, fatal blow... but when he \n               sees Early incapacitated on the floor, he lowers the shovel \n               to his side. His handcuffed hands reach down and picks up \n               Early's gun. He trains it on Early, then walks around him to \n               enter the house. Brian's eyes slowly adjust to the interior...\n\n               EARLY'S POV\n\n               From on his back, Early looks out the open \"door.\" He sees \n               two large shards of glass standing vertical in the sand, \n               reflecting the sun's rays back toward the house. He realizes \n               that the glass, placed there by Brian, is what created the \n               effect of the \"door.\" He starts to laugh.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                              (laughing)\n                         That was damn tricky of you Bri.\n\n               Brian searches for Carrie.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Carrie... Carrie... it's over.\n\n               ON BRIAN\n\n               He moves into the back bedroom and finds Carrie. She is \n               crouched on the floor, handcuffed to the bedframe. He moves \n               to help her. As he gets closer, he sees her badly bruised \n               face and realizes what's taken place throughout the night.\n\n               Brian stops. The sympathetic expression on his face changes. \n               With hatred in his eyes, he pivots around, strides out of \n               the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to Early. \n               in the front room Gun in hand, Brian rushes back into the \n               room. He wields the pistol toward the ground where Early \n               lay... but Early's not there.\n\n               Brian's eyes dart around the room... then suddenly, from \n               behind him, Early grabs him!\n\n               He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle knife \n               toward his throat!\n\n               Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before \n               the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vicious \n               wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the \n               gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pulls \n               away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but \n               Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to \n               his knees.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Go ahead Bri, ask me something.\n                              (beat)\n                         You wanna know how I'm feeling'? \n                         Well I'd say I'm feelin' pretty damn \n                         good.\n\n               On all fours, Brian reaches out for the gun, but Early kicks \n               it across the room.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         How 'bout you? You feelin' good?\n\n               Another kick to Brian's chest. The wind rushes out of him.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         ...'Cause you sure don't look so \n                         good.\n                              (beat)\n                         Or maybe you're feelin'... powerful. \n                         That it, you feeling powerful? \n                         Superior? I know I am.\n\n               Early unloads a ferocious kick to the side of Brian's face! \n               His head snaps back, his handcuffed arms buckle and he falls \n               flat to the ground.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         What? Am I angry with my daddy? Now \n                         why would I be angry with my daddy... \n                         you're the one hit me with the shovel. \n                         And you're the one's gonna wish you \n                         hadn't.\n\n               With one last effort, Brian manages to pull himself back up \n               to his knees. He focuses on the gun ahead of him and tries \n               to crawl toward it. But Early's foot shoves Brian. He flips \n               over onto his back, landing in front of the bedroom doorway. \n               Early moves toward him, knife in hand.\n\n               As Early moves toward Brian, unexpectedly from inside the \n               doorway, the torso of the female child mannequin whips past. \n               Her hardened molten face slams into Early's bloodied face. \n               Early stumbles backward.\n\n               Brian crawls for the gun and grabs it. From his knees he \n               turns, steadies the weapon, takes a quick breath... and fires. \n               Hitting Early square in the chest!\n\n               Early falls to the ground on his back. Brian lifts himself \n               to his feet.\n\n               He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway, \n               and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the \n               leg.\n\n               Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still. \n               Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain \n               around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs. \n               Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's \n               arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt \n               collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that \n               Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm \n               drops back down to his side.\n\n                                     EARLY\n                         Hey Bri...
