CAVE NIGHT\n</b>\n               There is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins, and \n               acorns plop through the waist of the hourglass one by one. \n               It sits in a pool of water. In the water swim EYELESS CATFISH \n               in geometric patterns. An underground stream feeds the pool \n               of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse \n               that on occasion emits a LOW RUMBLE.\n\n               INDIANS with torches surround the hourglass, which now we \n               can see is in a cave. And as soon as the acorns have finished \n               passing through the hourglass, a crew of Indians turn it on \n               its opposite end. One of the Indians appears to be JAPANESE.\n\n               ONE INDIAN stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a \n               series of symbolic carvings and scratches, with stone in \n               hand he makes a few hatchmarks, and keeps an eye on the \n<b>               CREVASSE.\n</b>\n               THE CREVASSE RUMBLES once more, loosening a few chunks of \n               rock from the cave.\n\n               The earth begins to shake.\n\n<b>                                     THE CHART KEEPER\n</b>                         She is restless tonight.\n\n<b>                                     ANOTHER INDIAN\n</b>                         She dreams of loving.\n\n<b>                                     STILL ANOTHER\n</b>                         She has the blues.\n\n               View of the chartkeeper's drawings. One is of a crane with a \n               very long neck. Another is a primitive drawing of a naked \n               girl, who has long flowing hair. She also has, pointed out \n               from her sides, thumbs that are three times normal human \n               proportions. A MUSICAL CHORUS sounds at the sight of this \n               drawing of a girl with the thumbs. The chartkeeper puts the \n               finishing touches on the drawing.\n\n               And the song \"Happy Birthday to You\" strikes up on country \n               and western guitar and polka-like accordion. title\n\n<b>                                        BIG THUMBS\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

The nerve of those \n                         twits. What do they know about female \n                         odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my \n                         concept. My ranch out West? It's a \n                         beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few \n                         head of cattle for atmosphere and \n                         tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, \n                         a place where unhappy women -- \n                         divorcees and widows, mainly -- can \n                         go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, \n                         change their hair styles and pretty \n                         themselves up for the next \n                         disappointment. My ranch is named \n                         the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber \n                         Rose douche bag, my own invention, \n                         and bless its little red bladder, \n                         the most popular douche bag in the \n                         world. So get this. It's on the \n                         migratory flight path of the whooping \n                         cranes. The last flock of wild \n                         whooping cranes left in existence. \n                         Well, these cranes stop off at my \n                         little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's \n                         called -- twice a year, autumn and \n                         spring, and spend a few days each \n                         time, resting up, eating, doing \n                         whatever whooping cranes do. I've \n                         never seen them, understand, but I \n                         hear they're magnificent. Very big \n                         specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- \n                         and white as snow, to coin a phrase, \n                         except for black tips on their wings \n                         and tail feathers, and bright red \n                         heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case \n                         you didn't know it, are noted for \n                         their mating dance. It's just the \n                         wildest show in nature.\n                         It's probably the reason why \n                         birdwatching used to be so popular \n                         with old maids and deacons. Picture \n                         these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds \n                         in full dance -- leaping six feet \n                         off the mud, arching their backs, \n                         flapping their wings, strutting low \n                         to the ground. Dears, it's \n                         overwhelming. And picture the birds \n                         doing their sex dance on TV. Right \n                         there on the home screen, creation's \n                         most elaborate sex ritual -- yet \n                         clean and pure enough to suit the \n                         Pope.

In a very \n                         subdued imitation of the female \n                         whooping crane, she dance/walks over \n                         to a large nest in which there sits \n                         a can of Yoni Yum.

I \n                         realize that you've always avoided \n                         all but the most rudimentary \n                         involvements with men, and I might \n                         add, you've been wise. Heterosexual \n                         relationships seem to lead only to \n                         marriage. For men, marriage is a \n                         matter of efficient logistics: The \n                         male gets his food, bed, laundry, \n                         TV, pussy, offspring and creature \n                         comforts all under one roof, where \n                         he doesn't have to dissipate his \n                         psychic energy thinking about them \n                         too much, then he is free to go out \n                         and fight the battles of life, which \n                         is what existence is all about. But \n                         for a woman marriage is surrender.\n\n               The Countess refills his glass. The squirrel starts across \n               Park Avenue again but doesn't make it. The uniformed chauffeur \n               gets out of a limousine and holds the crushed animal up where \n               it can be seen by an elderly woman passenger.\n\n<b>                                     THE COUNTESS\n</b>                         But here you are, still a virgin -- \n                         you are virginal yet, aren't you?\n\n<b>                                     SISSY\n</b>                         Why, yes, technically.

A fairly \n                         common image. The idea of cowgirls \n                         especially for little girls prevails \n                         in our culture.

Trick-riding is \n                         what cowgirls have almost always \n                         done in rodeos. Our society sure \n                         likes to see its unconventional women \n                         do tricks.

Did you realize that \n                         cowgirls have been around for many \n                         centuries? Long before America. In \n                         ancient India the care of the cattle \n                         was always left up to young women \n                         they called gopis. Being alone with \n                         the cows all the time, the gopis got \n                         awfully horny, just like we do here. \n                         Every gopi was in love with Krishna, \n                         a good-looking young god who played \n                         the flute like it was going out of \n                         style When the moon was full, this \n                         Krishna would play his flute by a \n                         river and call the gopis to him. \n                         Then he would multiply himself sixteen \n                         thousand times -- one for each gopi -- \n                         and make love to each one the way \n                         she most desired. There they were, \n                         sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna \n                         on the river bank, and the energy of \n                         their merging was so great that it \n                         created a huge oneness, a total union \n                         of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite \n                         a picture, huh?\n\n               Sissy's thumb twitches. Jelly swallows hard.

The Clock People \n                         see calamitous earthquakes as the \n                         agent of change, and they may be \n                         right, since there are a hundred \n                         thousand earthquakes a year and major \n                         ones are long overdue. But there are \n                         far worse catastrophes coming... \n                         unless the human race can bring itself \n                         to abandon the goals and values of \n                         civilization, in other words, unless \n                         it can break the consumption habit -- \n                         and we are so conditioned to consuming \n                         as a way of life that for most of us \n                         life would have no meaning without \n                         the yearnings and rewards of \n                         progressive consumption. It isn't \n                         merely that our bad habits will cause \n                         global catastrophes, but that our \n                         operative political-economic \n                         philosophies have us in such a blind \n                         crab grip that they prevent us from \n                         preparing for the natural disasters \n                         that are not our fault. So the \n                         apocalyptic shit is going to hit the \n                         fan, all right, but there'll be some \n                         of us it'll miss.

In a \n                         postcatastrophe world, your offspring \n                         would of necessity intermarry, forming \n                         in time a tribe.
