CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n          It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.\n          They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small\n          wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The\n          tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk\n          about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.\n\n          GIRL\n          Now that the war's over, our\n          soldiers get to come home, yes?\n\n          TEACHER\n          Some of them. Some will be\n          stationed on the rim planets as\n          Peace Enforcers.\n\n          BOY\n          I don't understand. Why were the\n          Independents even fighting us?\n          Why wouldn't they look to be more\n          civilized?\n\n          TEACHER\n          That's a good question. Does\n          anybody want to open on that?\n\n          GIRL\n          I hear they're cannibals.\n\n          ANOTHER BOY\n          That's only Reavers.\n\n          ANOTHER GIRL\n          Reavers aren't real.\n\n          ANOTHER BOY\n          Full well they are.

So\n          let's follow up on Borodin's\n          question. With all the social and\n          medical advancements we can bring\n          to the Independents, why would\n          they fight so hard against us?\n\n          4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n\n          RIVER\n          We meddle.\n\n          TEACHER\n          River? \n          RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand\n          and \"typing\" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a\n          long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different\n          columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is\n          a good two years younger than the other kids.\n\n          RIVER\n          People don't like to be meddled\n          with. We tell them what to do,\n          what to think, don't run don't\n          walk we're in their homes and in\n          their heads and we haven't the\n          right.

We're just trying\n          to show them how.\n          She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead\n\n          INT. LAB - NIGHT\n\n           And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER\n          sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one\n          right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a\n          technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.\n          The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.\n\n          2ND TECHNICIAN\n          She's dreaming.\n\n          FIRST TECHNICIAN\n          Nightmare?\n\n          2ND TECHNICIAN\n          Off the charts. Scary monsters.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-\n          drop.\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for\n          that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied\n          with himself.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n          Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And\n          making him a little nervous.\n          The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates\n          -- no\n          substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton\n          longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          See, most of our best work is done\n          when they're asleep. We can\n          monitor and direct their\n          subconscious, implant\n          suggestions...\n          River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector\n          starts forward, slowly.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          It's a little startling to see,\n          but the results are spectacular.\n          Especially in this case. River\n          Tam is our star pupil.\n          The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,\n          staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we\n          will very soon learn, is SIMON.\n\n          SIMON\n          I've heard that.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          She's a genius. Her mental\n          capacity is extraordinary, even\n          with the side-effects.\n\n          SIMON\n          Tell me about them.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          Well, obviously, she's unstable...\n          the neural stripping gives them\n          heightened cognitive reception,\n          but it also destabilizes their own\n          reality matrix. It manifests as\n          borderline schizophrenia... which\n          at this point is the price for\n          being truly psychic.\n\n          SIMON\n          (moves toward her)\n          What use do we have for a psychic\n          if she's insane?\n\n          J\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          I don't have to tell you the\n          security potential of someone who\n          can read minds. And she has lucid\n          periods -- we hope to improve upon\n          the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to\n          ask if there's some reason for\n          this inspection.\n\n          SIMON\n\n          (TURNING)\n          Am I making you nervous?\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          Key members of Parliament have\n          personally observed this subject.\n          I was told their support for the\n          project was unanimous. The\n          demonstration of her power --\n\n          SIMON\n          (turns back to her)\n          How is she physically?\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n           Like nothing we've seen. All our\n          subjects are conditioned for\n          combat, but River... she's a\n          creature of extraordinary grace.\n\n          400\n\n          SIMON\n          Yes. She always did love to dance.\n          He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.\n\n          ANGLE: THE BATON\n          As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),\n          flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting\n          forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,\n          flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.\n          Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her\n          head and swabs her, whispering:\n\n          SIMON\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          River. Wake up. Please, it's\n          Simon. River. It's your brother.\n          Wake up...\n          She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking\n          out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic\n          beneath.\n\n          IWO\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          6.\n          River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.\n\n          RIVER\n          Simon.\n          A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.\n\n          RIVER\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          They know you've come.\n\n          INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUING\n\n          As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret\n          service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls\n          into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.\n\n          INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING\n\n          Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair\n          of double doors.\n\n          SIMON\n          We can't make it to the surface\n          from inside.\n          Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at\n          them from the other side of the doors.\n          4wo SIMON\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          Find a --\n          But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab\n          equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds\n          herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and\n          outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.\n          The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing\n          the lone orderly. Passing right under River.\n\n           EXT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a\n          long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall\n          inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.\n          They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his\n          baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They\n          fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.\n          Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small\n          patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky\n          blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.\n\n          V0\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          7.\n          ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,\n          the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.\n          A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops\n          down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It\n          comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.\n\n          SIMON\n          Get on!\n          He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is\n          right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.\n          Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as\n          the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up\n          in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her\n          holding one of the cables --\n\n           THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)\n          Stop.\n          The action freezes.\n\n           THE OPERATIVE (0.S.)\n\n           (CONTINUING)\n          Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.\n          The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon\n          and River on the gurney just before it rises.\n          f t o\n\n          THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          Stop.\n          There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and\n          he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.\n          The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.\n          He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a\n          suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual\n          wear. He is in:\n\n          INT. INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY\n\n          -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic\n          records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of\n          Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.\n          The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          Biograph.

No one is allowed in\n          the records room without my\n          express permission.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          (over this, quietly)\n          Enter the doctor.\n          (to Mathias)\n          Forgive me. I prefer to see the\n          event alone, without bias.\n          Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          I need to see your clearance.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          You're right to insist. I know\n          you've had security issues here.\n          He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks\n          at the readout, and drops the bluster.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          Apologies. An Operative of the\n          Parliament will of course have\n          full cooperation.\n          (looks at screen)\n          I'm not sure what... I see no\n          listing of rank, or name.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          I have neither. Like this\n          facility, I don't exist. The\n          Parliament calls me in when...\n          when they wish they didn't have\n          to. Let's talk about the Tams.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          I assume you've scanned the status\n          logs...\n\n          VJ\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          9.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          River was your greatest success.\n          A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until\n          her brother walked in eight months\n          ago and took her from you.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          It's not quite so simple.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          I'm very aware of that.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          He came in with full creds. He\n          beat the ap-scan, the retinal...\n          There was no way I could --\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          No, no. Of course. The boy spent\n          his fortune developing the\n          contacts to infiltrate this place.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          Gave up a brilliant future in.\n          medicine as well, you've probably\n          read. Turned his back on his\n          whole life. Madness.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          Madness, no. Something a good\n          deal more dangerous. Have you\n          looked at this scan carefully? At\n          his face?\n          Mathias looks uncertain.\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n\n          (CONTINUING)\n          It's love, in point of fact. He\n          loved his sister and he knew she\n          was in pain. So he took her\n          somewhere safe.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          Why are you here?\n\n          THE OPERATIVE\n          I'm here because the situation is\n          even less simple than you think.\n          (eyeing him)\n          Do you know what your sin is,\n          Doctor?\n\n          J\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          10.\n\n          DOCTOR MATHIAS\n          I.

He looks over at Mal with death\n          in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and\n          grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.\n          He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies\n          4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the\n          Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and\n          pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes\n          swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.\n          He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward\n          the platform from above.\n\n          INT.
