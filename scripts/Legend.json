The setting is \ntranquil and utterly majestic.\n\nOver the brow of a distant hill, a pair of brilliant light beams \nscintillate in an etheral ballet.\n\nNumerous small animals gather to behold this wonder. They stand on \nthe hillcrest, staring down as if at the Nativity.\n\nSquirrels, quail, hedgehogs, mice, pheasants and badgers, natural \nenemies untied by the radiant LIGHT. \n\nA magnificent stag watches, numbers of tiny songbirds perched in his \nbranching antlers.\n\n<b>1A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT \n</b>\nPULL BACK: from the hilltop, through ferns and brambles to a steep \nembankment where umbrella-sized toadstools cluster. \n\nA snarling face APPEARS under a mushroom cap. This is BLIX a brigand \ngoblin hunter. Clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons, \nhe is a terrifying figure. \n\nBlix WHISTLES. The SOUND is unexpectedly lovely, a nightingale's \ncall. \n\nFurther back, three other goblins return the BIRDCALL. They bristle \nwith weaponry. POX is a pig-faced fop wearing tattered lace and \nflithy brocade. Tiny BLUNDER and TIC are both masked by grotesque \nhelmets. Swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads. They creep \nforward to join Blix. \n\n<b>1B GOBLIN'S POV : HILLTOP \n</b>\nThe distant animals silhouetted by dazzling LIGHT. \n\n<b>1C EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT\n</b>\nBlix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest \ntowards the hilltop.\n\nA moth lands on a twig two feet from Tic's head. He turns. His \nincredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the \nmoth and retracting with it, quick as a flash.\n\nAs the goblins near the hilltop, the fantastic LIGHT gradually \nilluminates their hideous features. A tiny mouse runs out of the \neye-slits on Blunder's helmet, circles the crest, and runs back in \non the other side. \n\nBlix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out.\n\nThe goblins crawl separately through the underbrush.\n\nPox comes snout to snout with a wild piglet. Terrified, the little \nshoat SQUEALS and scampers off. \n\n<b>2 DELETED\n</b>\n<b>2A CLOSE : ANIMALS \n</b>\nAlerted by the NOISE, they face the impending threat. The startled \nanimals run for cover down the hillside. \n\n<b>3 DELETED \n</b>\n<b>3A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT \n</b>\nBlix charges forward, brandishing his crossbow. \n\nBLIX: Kill. . . . ! \n\nBlix runs over the top of the hill and down into the gully beyond, \nclosely followed by Tic, Pox, and Blunder. Brilliant clumps of \nforget-me-nots are everywhere, like disgarded jewels. \n\n<b>3B GOBLIN'S POV : DISTANT FOREST \n</b>\nThe pair of shining LIGHT BEAMS race away between the trees. \n\n<b>4 DELETED \n</b>\n<b>5 DELETED\n</b>\n<b>5A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT\n</b>\nThe goblins watch the LIGHT BEAMS disappear. Blix GROWLS in \nfrustration. \n\nBLUNDER(musing): . . . . Fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire. . \n<b>. . \n</b>\nBlunder spots a SHINING silver hair caught on the bark. He reaches \nup and plucks it free. \n\nPOX: What's that . . . . ? L-l-let me see, old chap. \n\nBLUNDER: No! It's mine! \n\nBlunder hides the hair behind his back, but Pox quickly grabs the \nother end. \n\nPOX: Give it to m-m-m-me! \n\nBoth goblins pull on the hair. Miraculously, it does not break, but \nstretches between them like spun steel. \n\nBLUNDER: Turn loose, anus features! \n\nPOX: Hard cheese! \n\nA furious tug of war. Pox pulls his knife and tries unsuccessfully \nto cut the hair. \n\nBLUNDER: It's mine you rectum! Mine! Mine! \n\nBlix marches up and furiously bangs their heads together. Pox and \nBlunder fall dazed to the ground. \n\nBlix holds the silver hair shining above his head and studies it. \n\nBLIX: Disgusting and pure, like a prayer. . .. \nThere be magic in this hair.\nThe beast ran off, faster and faster. \nWe must take this to our Master. \n\n<b>6 EXTERIOR VAST LANDSCAPE NIGHT \n</b>\nAn incredible landscape, fantastically contoured hills rise above \nthe monnbright mist. The four goblins dismount, tie up their devil \nsteeds, and disappear over the brow of a hill. \n\n<b>6A EXTERIOR HILLSIDE NIGHT \n</b>\nThe goblins scramble down a steep hillside towards a desolate \nwasteland below. A mysterious malevolant shape looms on the far \nhorizon. \n\n<b>7 EXTERIOR SINISTER EVERGLADE NIGHT\n</b>\nA miasmic Jurassic swamp. Stunted trees rise like amputated limbs \nfrom the fetid water. \n\nThe goblins pick their way across the bog towards a distant island, \nstepping from submerged logs to crumbled chunks of masonary to \nfloating lily pads.\nA cracked marble plinth juts out of the water. The goblins creep by \na towering skeletal statue playing a bone violin. \n\n<b>7A EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT \n</b>\nA v-shaped ripple undulates past them like the wake of a submerged \ncrocodile. \n\nBlix unhooks a dead rat from his game belt and tosses it from his \ngame belt and tosses it onto the scummy surface. There is an angry \nswirl and it is gone. \n\nBlix waves the goblins on and they climb onto a huge root twisting \nout of the water like a petrified serpant. \n\nThe ominous wake cruises back and forth like a shark. Blunder \nfollows its progress with fear-widened eyes. \n\nBLUNDER:Wish i was still a leprecaun. . . .\nStay clear of nasty places\nlike this and do nothing all day but \nsing and dance and guzzle wine in the sunshine. . . .\n\nFurious, Blix turns on him, his finger to his lips. \n\nBLIX: Shhhh! \n\nUnchastened, Blunder whirls on Pox and repeats the gesture: \n\nBLUNDER: Shhhh! \n\nPox follows suit with Tic: \n\nPOX: Shhhh! \n\nNot to be outdone, Tic turns to silence whoever might be behind him. \n\n<b>TIC: SHHHHH! \n</b>\n<b>7B EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT \n</b>\nHAIRY MEG MUCKLEBONES rises out of the bog, huge and hideous. The \nwater hag is half corpse, half serpant. She seizes Tic and \ndisappears beneath the foul surface. The goblin's final CRY trembles \nin the chill night air. \n\n<b>7C EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT\n</b>Blix, Pox, and Blunder are terrified. They scramble over the twisted \nroot in a wild panic, leaping onto a floating log. \n\nBLUNDER: Run. . . . ! Panic. . . . ! Emergency. . . . ?\n\nThe log rolls beneath their frantic feet. They barely keep their \nbalance. \n\nPOX: Frog spit!\n\nBLUNDER: Snail Sperm!\n\nBLIX: All together. . . .now or never!\n\nThe goblin co-ordinate like tiny lumberjacks, running in unison. The \nrolling log drifts forward.\n\nPOX: J-j-jolly good! Team spirit and all that!\n\nThe log runs against the island and the goblins hop ashore.\n\n<b>8 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT\n</b>\nAn enormous blasted tree crowns the ruins of a forgotten castle. \nTangled roots grip the anicient stones like the tenacles of a \nmalformed sea monster. An atmosphere of eternal evil hovers over the \nsite. \n\nThe goblins stare back across the bog. \n\nBLUNDER: Poor Tic. . . .\n\nBLIX(growling with anger): Forget Tic! Less is always more.\n\nPOX: Better we spilt three ways than four! \n\nBlix hurries up the crumbling steps. Pox and Blunder follow. \n\nThe steps lead under gigantic twisting roots. Blix finds a small \nopening and slips inside. \n\nPox and Blunder like this less and less but follow their leader \nwithout complaint.\n\n<b>9 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT \n</b>\nThe three goblins tumble down a steep slope. The giant tree is a \nvast hollow stump, open to a moonlit sky, surrounding a smaller tree \ntransfixed by a curved bronze horn, an instrument of unspeakable \nevil. \n\nPox and Blunder stare up like open-mouthed tourists. Blix is \nimpatient. \n\nBLIX: Boost me. . . . ! Hurry. . . . ! We must sound the summons \nbefore the dawn. . . . \n\nThe three goblins form a teetering ladder with Blix wobbling at the \ntop and Blunder crushed at the bottom. \n\nBlix blows into the horn with all his might. Nothing happens. \nSuddenly, he breaks wind! \n\nPox and Blunder grimace. \n\nBlix blows again into the horn.\n\nThere is no sound. Dead leaves and dust puff out of the bell, \nfollowed by three SQUEALING bats. \n\nThe supporting goblins wobble. Pox steps on Blunder's head. \n\nBlix blows a third time into the great horn. \n\nThe unholy SOUND reverbarates like the wailing of all the doomed \nsouls in Purgatiory. \n\n<b>10 EXTERIOR FOREST(VARIOUS ANGLES) NIGHT\n</b>\nAs the evil SOUND moans, the forest creatures react with terror. \n\nSquirrels, rabbits, and mice dart fearfully for cover. Birds flock \nto their nests. Only the night creatures, the wolves, weasels, and \nowls perk up thier ears to listen.\n\n<b>11 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT\n</b>\nThe three goblins cower terrified among the gnarled roots.\n\nBLUNDER: Now what. . . . ?\n\nBLIX: We sit. . . . We wait. . . . That be our fate! \n\n<b>11A EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT\n</b>\nThe goblins wait up on the upper platform of the ruined castle. Blix \nsits apart from the others, staring out across at the bog. The light \nof a campfire casts their shifting shadows against the huge trunk of \nthe hollow tree.\n\nBlix plays with the silver hair.\n\nBLIX(to himself): Moving silent like the breeze.\nSoft as shadows, still as trees,\nDarkness be in all we sees. \nHe lives in silence, he lives in fire, \nHe lives in all that's dark and dire. \n\nA mysterious floating shape approaches out of the distance. It is a \nblack cloak, wafting through the mist like an airborne manta ray. \n\n<b>12 EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT \n</b>\nThe flying cloak wraps about the statue of the skeletal fiddler. The \nwind presses it tight, revealing the skull through the cloth. \n\nSuddenly, the statue's head turns to look at the great tree. \n\n<b>13 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT \n</b>\nBlix walks to to the edge of the platform, peering into the night. \n\nBLIX: Look in the gloom, search out the tomb. \nThat be where you find our sire.\n\nThe pedestal is empty. The statue of the fidder has vanished! \n\nBlix gets down on his knees, genuflecting, toward the the open bog. \n\nThe black shadow of the LORD OF DARKNESS falls across him. \n\nDarkness towers over the ruined castle platform, a huge horned \nfigure drpaed in bacl cloth. An awesome silence ensues. \n\nBlunder and Pox kneel, heaping ashes and dirt upon thier heads. \n\nBLIX: Hail O great One. . . . divine and dark! \nStrong like a lion, swift like a shark. \n\nBlix offers the silver hair up to Darkness. \n\nBLIX: Though I'm not worthy of the task Great Lord, I found this for \nyour amusment. \n\nBlunder leaps to his feet and grabs the hair from Blix. \n\nBLUNDER: Don't listen to them mealy-mouthed lies boss. . . . I'm the \none who found it. . . . Me! Blunder the Bold! \n\nThere is a bight FLASH OF LIGHT. Blunder HOWLS with pain. \n\nBlunder stares at his arm in dismay. His hand is gone, magically \nreplaced by a grotesque birdclaw. \n\nBLUNDER(stunned): Thank you, Lordship . . . . \n\nBlunder experimently clenches and unclenches his new bird claw. \n\nPOX: Quite stylish, actually. . . . \n\nDarkness dangles the shining silver hair in front of him. \n\nDARKNESS: Where. . . . ? \n\nBLIX: In the woods, six leagues back, \n'Tween Twin Oaks and the Dragon's Track. \n\nDARKNESS: Did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which\ncast this spoor? \n\nBLIX: I stalked it, Sire, but much too slow, \nWhat beast it be I do not know. \n\nDARKNESS: This hair is from an angel of light. . . It comes \nthis way rarely. . . I must have this creature!\n\nBLIX: Oh Divine Dark One, teach us how to catch this \ncreature. \n\nPOX: Your instruction would be m-m-most \nap-p-preciated. \n\nBLUNDER: Amen! I wants to learn! I craves knowledge! \n\nDARKNESS: No trap of yours will work. . . . There is only \nlure for such disgusting goddness. . . .one bait which never \nfails. . . . \n\nBLIX: Name the bait, Lord. . . . \n\nDARKNESS: Innoncence! \n\n<b>14 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY \n</b>\nA beautiful flower-spangled meadow alive with songbirds.\n\nBaby rabbits frolic in the tall grass where industrious squirrels \nforage for acorns and nuts. \n\nA delicate fawn gambols under the watchful eye of the doe. Clouds of \nmulti-hued butterflies swirl overhead. \n\nWaist-deep in flower, a young princess skips SINGING across the \nmeadow. Her name is LILI. She wears splendid brocades and carries a \nbouquet wrapped in a lace napkin. Like these blossoms, she is \nbeautiful and fresh and innocent. \n\nTiny birds fly down and land on her head and shoulders. She laughs \nas a warbling wren takes a seed from her lips. \n\nLILI(singing): Come down sparrow, sing me good morning. \nRise up sun, light the arch of the sky. \nLiving river, turn light to diamonds,\nWhen I look in my true love's eyes. \n\nLili runs towards a distant thatched-roofed cottage. \n\n<b>15 EXTERIOR BOULDER AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY \n</b>\nBlix, Pox, and Blunder hide behind a boulder, watching the girl. \n\nBLIX(whipering): Darkness say the perfect lure Always be a virgin \npure. . . . \n\n<b>15A EXTERIOR COTTAGE AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY \n</b>\nThe WOODCARVER'S WIFE is hangin up the washing when Lili sneaks from \nbehind the cottage. \n\nGrinning micheviously, Lili unfastens one end of the clothes-line \nand lets it drop. \n\nThe laundry flutters onto the new-mown grass, A sheet drpaes around \nthe outraged wife. \n\nWIFE: Dad-blamed faeries! \n\n<b>16 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY \n</b>\nThe cottage is snug and homey with smoke-blackened beams and hand-\npegged furniture. A WOODCARVER sleeps by his bench surrounded by \nwood-shavings and roughed-out toys. \n\nLili steps into the sunlight streaming through the open doorway. Her \nbeauty is etheral, an angel descending. \n\nFinches peck at newly-made tarts laid on a trestle table to cool. \nThey rise to the rafters as at Lili's approach. \n\nThe Princess peeks around the room. She tiptoes to the hearth and \nlifts the stewpot lid, dipping a finger in for a taste. \n\nSpying the tarts, she grabs one and eats it hurriedly, leaving a \ntelltale crumb on her upper lip. \n\nThe clock tolls the hour. A carved wooden maiden piroettes from the \ninterior, pursued by a skeletal fiddler playing a bone fiddle. Lili \nis fancinated. \n\nThe Woodcarver's Wife enters. She curtsies to the Princess. \n\nWIFE: God Bless Your Highness. A royal visit is ever a joy. \n\nLILI: I've not come to visit, Nell \n\nWIFE: Won't you stay for a tart? \n\nNell pulls a tray from the oven. \n\nWIFE(cont): They're fresh-baked. \n\nLILI: I've no time today. \n\nWIFE(teasing): The Princess must have a sweetheart waiting. \n\nLILI: Nonsense! \n\nWIFE: Surely the king forbids such folly \n\nLILI: What my father doesn't know won't hurt him. \n\nWIFE: The wilful heart invites despair, \nLike blind men creeping in a dragon's lair. \n\nWith Nell's back turned, Lili steals another tart, hiding it among \nthe flowers in her bouquet. \n\nLILI: Neither country provebs nor king's command can keep me\nout of the woods today.\n\nWIFE: Then it's common sense ought. These woods be thick\nwith spriggen and banshee!\n\nLILI: Is that why you've hung a bell over the door? \n\nWIFE: Aye, and spread the floor with flax and salt. My babe \nwon't be stole by faeries. \n\nThe Princess starts merrily for the sun-bright doorway. \n\nLILI(laughing): More salt, Nell. . . .! You'll worry \nyourself to death if you're not careful. \n\nLili runs out like a naughty child. The Woodcarver's Wife \nleans against the door jamb and calls after her:\n\nWIFE: Beware of toadstool rings and willow trees. . . . ! \nStay away from old oaks! \n\n<b>17 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH TO GLADE DAY \n</b>\nHiding behind a moss-coverd log, Blix, Pox, and Blunder watch \nPrincess Lili run SINGING through the woods, oblivous to any sign of \ndanger. \n\nBLIX(scowling): May be innocent. . . . May be sweet. . . . \nAin't half as nice as rotten meat. . . . ! \n\n<b>18 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY \n</b>\nA lovely glade surrounded by tall trees, Breathlessly, Lili runs in \nfrom the woods. She is familair with this spot. It is her trysting \nplace \n\nLILI(calling): Jack. . . . ! I know you're here. . . . Jack! \n\nLili looks around in exasperation. Behind her, something wild and \nmysterious swings through the trees like an animal. \n\nLILI(cont): Jack? Where are you. . . . ? Answer me! \n\nLili is apprehensive at getting no reply. She hears the RUSTLE of \nthe leaves but does not see the sun-dappled figure leaping from limb \nto limb overhead. \n\nLILI(frightened)(cont): Oh, Jack. . . . please say something if \nyou're here. . . . \n\nJACK O' THE GREEN, a legendry \"Green Man\" who lives the free life of \na hermit in the woods, drops down from a tree behind the Princess, \nlanding without a sound. He is barefoot, about sixteen, and wears \nwoven ivy leaves and skins. \n\nStartled, Lili SCREAMS. \n\nLILI(cont): Jack! You scared the life out of me. \n\nJack says nothing, staring at her shyly. Lili hands him the flowers. \n\nA JAY flies down out of the greenery and lands RASPING on Jack's \nshoulder. He imitates the bird expertedly, The Jay answers him in \nEnglish: \n\nJAY: She brings a gift as fair as herself. \n\nLili LAUGHS, It all seems magic to her. \n\nLILI: You're so clever, Jack. . . . See what you can find in \nthe flowers. \n\nJack pokes in the bouquet and discovers the stolen tart. He stuffs \nit immediately into his mouth. \n\nJACK: Mmmmmmm. . . . \n\nLILI: Sweet? \n\nJAY: Sweets from the sweet. \n\nJACK: I know someone sweeter.\n\nLili blushes. \n\n<b>19 EXTERIOR ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST DAY\n</b>\nConcealed behind the trees, Blix, Pox and Blunder watch the Green \nMan and the Princess wander down a meandering path.\n\nPox picks a spider from his web, pops it in his mouth, and crunches \nit down with a happy smile.\n\n<b>19A EXTERIOR MEANDERING PATH DAY \n</b>\nSeveral birds perch on Jack's head and shoulders. Squirrels, rabbits \nand hedgehogs play about his feet. Jack feeds them nuts and berries \nfrom his pouch, answering their chatter expertedly. Jack understands \nthe language of all wild creatures. \n\nWhen a frisky wren flies warbling overhead, Lili hesitantly returns \nits call. \n\nJACK: That was very good. . . .just right. \n\nLILI: Teach me rabbit like you promised.\n\nJACK: Rabbit is much harder than wren. \n\nLILI: Let me try. I'm a very good student. . . . My father \nthinks I'm brilliant. . . \n\nLili toys with the silver madallion pendant she wears, causing \nreflected sunlight to shine in Jack's eyes. \n\nLILI(cont): See how brilliant I am! \n\nJACK(laughing): Stop it. . . . ! I can't see! \n\nLILI: Don't I dazzle you with my wisdom? \n\nLili seems to glow with sunlight. Jack stares at her, rapt with \nlove. \n\nJACK: Much more than wisdom dazzles me. \n\nLili LAUGHS and hangs her madallion around his neck. \n\nLILI: Then teach me rabbit. \n\nJACK: Not today. . . . There's something really special I \npromised to show you. \n\nLILI(delighted): Oh, Jack. Do you mean it? \n\nJACK: If it pleases you. \n\nLILI: More than anything! \n\nJACK: This is their season. They won't pass here again \nfor a long, long time. . . . If you want to see them, you \nmust do everything I tell you. \n\nLILI: I swear. . . on my honour! \n\nJACK: I'm taking you to a very special place. . . it's \nsort of sacred. Nobody but me knows where it is, and, \nwell. . . . \n\nLILI(impatient): What? Tell me! \n\nJack unwraps the lace napkin from Lili's bouquet. \n\nJACK: You'll have to wear a blindfold. \n\nLILI(coyly): Don't you trust me, Jack? \n\nJACK: I'll always trust you, Lili. . . . \n\n<b>20 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH, GLADE TO STREAM DAY \n</b>\nJack holds Lili's hand, leading her blindfolded along a path through \nthe woods. Distant thunder RUMBLES. \n\nJACK: Storm's coming. . . .\n\nLILI: Who cares? Haven't you a cosy place to hide? \n\nJACK: Many places. . . .None fit for a princess. . . . \n\nLILI: In these woods you are the prince, Jack. . . . \nI am only a pauper here. . . .\n\nJack turns to face a radiantly smiling Lili. He bends towards her, \ncloser and closer, and, for a moment, seems about to steal a kiss. \nShe waits, smiling, sensing what is about to happen. In the end, \nJack's innoncence and timidity get the best of him and he turns \naway. Without his knowledge Lili lifts a corner of the blindfold and \nmischievously peeks. \n\n<b>20A EXTERIOR BEHIND A TREE NEAR THE PATH DAY\n</b>\nThe three goblin peer around a mossy trunk. \n\nBLUNDER: Yuck!

His mate \nstands at the edge of the woods. \n\nLILI(OS): Ohh....They're so beautiful.... \n\nThe unicorn dips his horns into the stream. \n\nJACK(OS): The alicorn purifies the water. . . . \n\nThe stallion watches his mare approach to drink.

Only Jack stands his ground.\n\nThe mare charges straight at Jack. He is knocked to his knees as she \ngallops past.\n\nThe unicorn wheels about. Jack scrambles to his feet.\n\nShe charges again, skidding to a stop on the frozen grass. Her \nalicorn is aimed straight at Jack's throat.\n\nGUMP: Run, Jack!\n\nJACK: The fault was mine. I owe her \nmy life.\n\nGUMP: Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility\nis her gift in return.\n\nThe mare makes a soft NOISE deep in her throat.

What's\nit mean?\n\nBROWN TOM (shrugging): Search me.... I speak\nsome rabbit, but not a word of unicorn.\n\nThe unicorn continues, a SOUND as close to music as anything in \nnature. Jck listens intently and answers her.\n\nGUMP: Come on Jack, don't keep us in\nthe dark.\n\nJACK: The dark is where we'll stay....\nWe're cursed. All warmth and light\nwas lost when the stallion died.\n\nBROWN TOM: Is there naught we can do?\n\nJACK: We must get the alicorn back.\nOnly then will the world return to normal.\n\nGUMP: And how do faeries fight a demon?\n\nJACK: She says we're to find a champion....\na mortal, bold of heart and pure in\nspirit.\n\nSCREWBALL: Look....!

There is nothing but the wailing wind.\n\nLILI (softly): Jack....? Oh, Jack....\n\nA solitary tear starts from her eyes, only to freeze on her cheek \nlike a diamond beauty spot.\n\nLILI (cont): Please God.... help me!\n\nLili drops sobbing to her knees. Through her grief, she sees the \nunicorn's track in the snow, each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming \nflowers.\n\nHer courage restored, Lili follows this meandering trail of \nburgeoning life through the forest.\n\n<b>52 EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY\n</b>\nGumps leads the way a huge BOULDER lodged uner the roots of a giant \ntree.\n\nGUMP (proudly): Here's my home, Jack....

Immediately, two eyes blink open on the front of the \nboulder, and he is seen to have facial features.\n\nBOULDER: Morning', Gump....\n\nThe Boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from \nunder the tree roots, REVEALING the entrance to a cavern.\n\nHe promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows, his tiny \nstone feet kicking wildly in the air.\n\nGUMP (bowing): After you, Jack....\n\nJack enters apprehensively udner the twisting roots.\n\nJACK: Thank you....\n\nThe other faeries follow, leading the unicorn.\n\n<b>53 INTERIOR MOUTH TO CAVE DAY\n</b>\nAn earthern antechamber under the tree, high enough for Jack and the \nunicorn.

Stay here with the\nunicorn and guard her well.\n\nBROWN TOM: Like me own life!\n\nGUMP: Better than that! She's the last \nof her kind.\n\nGump marches to the little wooden door.

He \nswats futilely at her.\n\nJACK: Stop it....! Go away....!\n\nGUMP: Easy.... Luna only seeks a little \naffection.\n\nLuna hovers beside Jack's cheek.\n\nJACK: I meant no disrespect, but....\nouch! Make her stop, will you,\nGump!\n\nGUMP: Does your blood run so cold? You'll \nbe a corpse before your time.\n\nGump unstoppers a silver wine decanter and pours three goblets full.\n\nJACK: What does she want from me?\n\nGUMP: Foolish question....\n(handing Jack a goblet)\nDrink, and wamr your heart.\nThe answer's at the bottom of \nyour cup.\n\nJack sniffs his goblet suspiciously. This time, he is careful not to \ndrink when the faeries do.\n\nGUMP (cont): Now then.... down to business.\n\nGump pulls a bejewlled broadsword free from its scabbard. It is a \nremarkably beautiful weapon. \n\nJACK: What's this....? Something to cook\nwith?\n\nGump and Screwball exchange a hopeless look.\n\nGUMP(patiently): This is a weapon, Jack.... As fine\na weapon as you'll ever see.\n\nJACK(curious: So, that's a weapon....

He whirls the weapon in a \ngleaming blur, slicing the drifting handkerchief neatly in half.\n\nGUMP(cont): With such a blade you could behead\nan ogre as easily as uncapping a \nsoft-boiled egg.\n\nJACK: That's really something.... Can I\ntry?\n\nGump hands the sword to Jack.\n\nGUMP: You're the champion, aren't you?\n\nJack picks up half the kerchief off the jewel-littered floor and \ntosses it into the air. As it flutters down, he swings wildly with \nthe broadsword. Gump has to duck to avoid having his own head \nchopped off.\n\nGUMP(cont): Watch out....! You'll get the hang of \nit in time.... Now, we best see \nabout some armour..... Screwball!\n\nSCREWBALL: Coming right up!\n\nScrewball flips open the lid of a chest. Folded inside is a golden \nchain-mail coat of exquisite workmanship.\n\nGUMP: Go on.... see if it fits.\n\nJack slips the coat over his head. It fits perfectly.\n\nGUMP (nodding approval): It will turn a broadhead arrow\nar fifty yards.\n\nSCREWBALL: He might pass for a champion in \nthat.\n\nGUMP: Have a look at yourself, Jack.\n(pointing: Use yonder shield for a mirror.\n\nJACK(confused): ....Shield?\n\nGUMP(exasperated): The round shiny thing over there.\n\nSCREWBALL: Clothes never made the man....\n\nGump silences Screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a \nsmall carved desk.\n\nThere is a loud, MUSICAL CHIME.

Hurry up!\n\nSCREWBALL: All the time me.\nSame old story.\n\nScrewball clibs up onto a floating lily pad.\n\nAn undulating v-shaped wake moves through the water alongside as \nthey step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long, \ntwisting root.\n\nWithout warning, an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and \ngrabs Screwball. He is gone under the surface with a scream.\n\nBROWN TOM: Screwball!\n\nJACK: What was that?\n\nGUMP: Big trouble!\n\nJack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where \nScrewball disappeared.\n\nJACK: We've got to do something.\n\nBefore Jack can finish, Meg Mucklebones rises out of the bog behind \nhim. She tosses Screwball aside and hauls Jack into her cadaverous \nembrace.\n\nMEG: Foul tasting faerie.....! Come to\nme, juicy boy!\n\nJack YELPS in horror.\n\nMEG (cont): Who be this tender morsel\ndisturbing Meg Mucklebones' rest?\n\nJACK(terrified): They call me Green \nJack ma'am.\n\nThe faeries watch in dismay.\n\nBROWN TOM: Our champion's a goner, he is.\n\nThe fearsome hag pinches Jack with her wicked talons.\n\nMEG: What a fine fat boy you are....\n\nJACK: You don't mean to eat me,\ndo you ma'am?\n\nMEG: Oh, indeed I do....\n\nJACK: That would be a shame, Miss Meg.\nYou're so lovely. You deserve far \nbetter than scrawny little\nme....\n\nThe flattery gives Hairy Meg a pause; she simply can't resist it.\n\nMEG: Hmmmm....think me fair, do you, Jack?\n\nJACK: All the heavenly angels must \nenvy your beauty.\n\nMEG: Ooooo....what a find meal you'll make,\nbe the rest of you as sweet\nas your tongue.\n\nJACK: Let me go and I'll sing songs\nof praise to you.\n\nMEG: Let you go? Don't be daft. I've\nhad naught but muskrat and snakes \nall this month.... bit of rancid\ngoblin, too....\n\nJACK: But....but....don't you like\nmy words?\n\nMEG: Words are little help in \nfilling an empty stomach....\n\nJACK: Then fill your soul with loveliness.\nLook into your glass and feast on\nbeauty.\n\nMEG: There's no looking-glass here....\nSometimes, when the moon is full,\nI'll chance to see my reflection\nin the bog.\n\nJack glances at the shield hanging over his shoulder.\n\nJACK: My shield would serve you well.\n\nMeg Mucklebones takes Jack's shield, partially releasing him from \nher clammy clutches.\n\nMEG: What a splendid idea! \nYou be so clever, Jack.\n\nHanging onto Jack with one hand, Hairy Meg bends over the shield.\n\nJACK: Your radiance is the alchemy\nthat makes rusted steel shine like \nsilver.\n\nMeg primps and preens: an obscene parody of a pretty maiden at her \nvanity table.\n\nMEG: Oooo! That's nice! I be the envy\nof any princess in the land.\n\nWhile Meg is pre occupied with her grotesque reflection, Gump \ncatches the Jack's eyes. The cunning elf silently mouths the word: \n'sword', pointing to his waist at the same time.\n\nJACK: Better, you are a queen without\na peer.... a reigning angel.\n\nJack nods to Gump and silently draws his sword. Meg doesn't notice \nthing.\n\nMEG: You have such discerning taste \nfor so young a boy....\n\nMeg turns to face him with a fearful pucker of her tattered lips.\n\nMEG (cont): Come, Jack....give us\na kiss before dining.\n\nJack petrified with fear.\n\nGUMP(shouting): Give her the kiss of \ncold steel, Jack!\n\nJack swings blindly with his eyes closed. It is a lucky stroke, Meg \nMucklebones' head flies from her shoulders.\n\nJACK(astonished): I did it!\n\nThe decapitated hag sinks back beneath the scummy surface.\n\nGUMP: Like a chmapion, Jack.\n\nBROWN TOM: Bravo!\n\nJACK: How's Screwball?\n\nSCREWBALL: Chewed, but not disgested....\n\nJack points his sword at the hollow tree.\n\nJACK: Then on to victory!\n\nFAERIES (all together): On to victory!\n\n<b>65D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY\n</b>\nA huge fire blazes in the gaping hearth. Darkness stands before it, \nalmost a shadow in his midnight cloak.\n\nDARKNESS: I've been an exile for too long....\nbanished by the sun.... forced to\nhide in the bowels of the earth....\nOn the eve of my greatest victory, this....\nchild of nature appears....

This\ninnocent creature fascinates you because \nonly she can appreciate the enormity\nof your achievement.\n\nDARKNESS: I'll take her then!\n\nVOICE: A hollow victory!

Don't listen to him. \nNever believe what you see.....\n\nJACK: He won't fool me.\n\nGUMP: Don't be so sure! No human has \never set foot in this place before! \n<b>66 INTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY\n</b>\nJack and the faeries stare up at the massive horn embedded in the \ninner tree.\n\nScrewball starts to climb towards it.\n\nSCREWBALL: What a nice big trumpet....! Bet\nit sounds louder than anything....\n\nGump hauls him back down by the seat of his pants.\n\nGUMP: Don't touch it! Our lives are\nlost if it blows!\n\nJack finds an opening hidden between the roots of the inner tree.\n\nJACK: In here! I've found a passage!\n\nJack drops inside.\n\n<b>66A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY\n</b>\nThe moment Jack enters the inner tree, a deep TREMOR reverberates \nthrough the subterranean Castle of Darkness.\n\nDraped in shadows before the fire, the Dark Lord looks up at this \ndisturbance.\n\nDARKNESS (to the fire): I feel a presence....!\nSome power invades my sanctity....\n\nVOICE (from the flames): Every wolf suffers \nfleas.... 'tis easy enough to\nscratch!\n\nThe flames surge out towards Darkness, embracing him.\n\n<b>67 INTERIOR TINY ANTECHAMBER DAY\n</b>\nLike the catacombs of Paris, the walls are decorated with bones and \nhuman skulls. At each corner of the open ceiling is a carved demonic \nhead. Jack and the faeries stand looking up.\n\nGUMP(gloomily): The decor of death....\n\nBROWN TOM: Tells you somthing 'bout\nhim what lives here.\n\nSCREWBALL: It's a dead end....\n\nJack searches along the ossuary walls.\n\nJACK: Doesn't make sense.... Check\nthe walls. There must be some sort\nof secret key....\n\nScrewball doesn't join the other faeries in the search. He is \nattracted by several round stone balls lying in the rubble. Picking \nup three with a happy grin, he begins to juggle.\n\nSCREWBALL: One-two-three....\nfidde-dee-dee....\n\nGump sees what Screwball is doing and flies into a rage.\n\nGUMP: Screwball! Drop those this \nminute!\n\nScrewball tosses the balls carelessly over his shoulder. One lands \nin the stone cornice near the ceiling and rolls along, gathering \nmomentum as it passes through the open mouths of each gargoyle.\n\nThe balls disappears into the mouth of the final gargoyle. It is \nswallowed with an emphatic GULP.\n\nAll at once, the roof slides shut above.\n\nBROWN TOM(alarmed): Newt-finger marmalade!\n\nThe floor pulls suddenly open and they all plummet SCREAMING into \nempty space. Luna circles, a dot of light above tthe bottomless pit.\n\nLUNA (wee voice): Oh, dear.... Oh, dear...\n\nThe tiny faerie whirls in a blur of indecision before streaking down \ninto the dark opening after her falling friends.\n\n<b>68 INTERIOR CAVE CHUTE DAY\n</b>\nLike prisoners on a fairground helter-skelter, Jack and the faeries \nspin down a seemingly endless curvinbg chute.\n\nGUMP(singing): When times're hard and thing look bad,\nDon't feel blue and don't feel sad....\n\nJACK: How can you sing at a time\nlike this?\n\nGUMP: Can you think of anything \nbetter to do?\n\nThey hurtle through festooned cobwebs, stirring up smokey clouds of \nancient dust.\n\n<b>69 INTERIOR CAGE AND ALCOVE DAY\n</b>\nThe end of the chute opens into an iron cage. Jack and the faeries \ntumble through onto a pile of straw. Luna is right behind, bright as \na firefly.\n\nBROWN TOM: Ouch! Ow!\n\nSCREWBALL: Where are we?\n\nGump stares woefully at the iron bars.\n\nGUMP: Some place we don't want to be!\n\nA scuffling NOISE in the far side of the cage attracts their \nattention. Blunder pops up from a pile of straw, still wearing his \nhelmet.\n\nBLUNDER: Shhhh! What is this?\nA chatterbox convention?\nSCREWBALL: Who be you, bucket-head?\n\nGUMP: Stay clear of that imp! He's\na hell hound goblin!\n\nBLUNDER: What I am won't help me \nnone, nor you neither....\n\nBlunder pulls off his helmet. He is Screwball's indenical twin!\n\nBLUNDER(cont): ....even if you is my brother!\n\nScrewball can't believe his eyes.\n\nSCREWBALL(astonished) Blunder...!\n\nBLUNDER: Screwball....!\n\nThey rush into each other's arms.\n\nGUMP (to Jack): A Buttercup family reunion....!\nI can't believe it.... Last I remember,\nhe sold Screwball a jug of dragon's tears\nthat turned out to be cow piss!\n\nSCREWBALL: What happened to you?\n\nBLUNDER(flexing his bird claw): It's a long story....\nLet's just say I went look for adventure and \nfound more'n I could handle....\nDoesn't matter now anyway... We're all of us\nin the same fix....\n\nJACK: Just what sort of fix is that?\n\nBLUNDER: The kitchen of the Lord of \nDarkness! All of us be on his menu!\n\nSCREWBALL: I knew it! I knew it!

Spring the lock, Gump!\n\nGump examines the huge padlock with a frown.\n\nGUMP (wearily): Iron is sore trouble for elves.\n\nSCREWBALL: Magic's no good against it.\n\nJack slumps down in the corner to think things over. The faeries \nmill about by the opposite wall.\n\nJack stares at the bars. Luna orbits his head.\nJACK: I know I promised.... but it's the only way....\n\nLuna buzzes him furiously.\n\nJACK(cont): Sure it's a secret... It'll\nkeep forever when we're all dead....\n\nJack glances guiltily at the whirling dot of LIGHT.\n\nJACK(cont) (to Gump): Why not have Luna fly\nout between the bars and find a key?\n\nGUMP(shaking his head): She's much too small....\ncould never lift it...\n\nJACK(blurting it out): Not if she changes \nsizes like she can!\n\nGUMP: What?\n\nThere is a bright FLASH of faerie-light and Luna stands full-sized \nbefore them, her gossamer wings a-tremble.\n\nGUMP(cont)(outraged): You wilful sprite! How dare \nyou keep such secrets?\n\nLUNA: They're mine to keep! But I'll do\nwhat you ask.... if you kiss me, Jack.\n\nJACK: That's easy enough.\n\nJack kisses her chastely on the cheek.\n\nLUNA: Call that a kiss? Am I not sweet?\n\nJACK(eager to please): Sweeter than bee\npollen on a summer wind.\n\nLuna moves in close to Jack.\n\nLUNA: Sweet is the wind thats blows me to \nyou....\n\nJack gently pushes her away.\n\nJACK: It's not possible. I'm in love....\n\nLUNA: A faerie's love makes anything \npossible....\n\nA soft cocoom of faerie LIGHT engulfs Luna. She metamorphoses within \nit, emerging as Princess Lili.\n\nLUNA/LILI: ....even you heart's desire.\n\nLuna/Lili embraces Jack. It is sweet and tempting.\n\nJACK(resisting): No.... this isn't real....\n\nScrewball and Blunder giggle and snigger.\n\nLUNA/LILI: Oh, but it is.... I'm warm and alive\nand happy to be in your arms.\n\nJack is nearly enchanted, but after a delicious moment, he pushes \naway.\n\nJACK: I can't do it....! This is faerie glamour!\n\nA brilliant aura of faerie LIGHT envelops Luna/Lili and she \nTRANSFORMS into her true winged-form\n<b>. \n</b>LUNA(bitterly): You....! You....mortal! I\ncould vex you! Dance you life away!\n\nJACK: Threats can't make you love you.\nHuman hearts don't work that way.\n\nLUNA: What care I for human heart?\nSoft and spiritless as porridge!\nA faerie's heart beats fierce and free.\n\nThere is a furious pytotechnic whirlwind and, in an instant, Luna \nreturns to a tiny dot of LIGHT.\n\nJACK: Luna....?\n\nWithout an answer, Luna flies out between the iron bars.\n\nJACK(cont) (to the faeries): I.... didn't mean\nto hurt her.\n\nGUMP(scornful): Your fine senseibilities\nhave left us here to rot.\n\nThe SOUND of heavy footsteps approaches, accompanied by rough, \ntuneless SINGING.\n\nCOOK(os): ....this li'l piggie went to market....\nanudder li'l pigge got eat.... pig-meat\npie, l'l piggie die....\n\nBLUNDER: Oh, no! He's coming...!\nHide! Hide! Hide!\n\nBlunder conceals himself under a pile of straw. A deformed shadow is \ncast across the cage.\n\nSCREWBALL: Blunder's got the right idea!\n\nScrewball hides in the straw. Jack and the other immediately do the \nsame.\n\nA fiendish demon COOK opens the cage door. He is ten feet tall and \nunspeakably ugly. He peers blindly inside, sniffing the air with his \nhideous nose.\n\nCOOK: ....pig-pig-pig...\n<b>. \n</b>The Cook gropes inside the cage.\n\nThe Cook reaches deep into the straw pile in teh corner and grabs \nBlunder.\n\nBLUNDER: Help....! Lemme go...?\nTurn me loose, you tub o' guts!\n\nThe cook hauls Blunder out, kicking and screaming. He locks the cage \nabd stumps away.\n\nBLUNDER(cont): I hope I give you heart-burn!\n\nAfter a bit, the faeries and Jack peer up out of the straw.\n\nSCREWBALL(woefully): Fricasseed faeries, the lot of us....\n\nBROWN TON: Lambs to the slaughter....\n\nJack draws his sword.\n\nJACK: Not without a fight!\n\nTransformed back to full-size, Luna tip-toes into the alcove outside \nthe cage, her hands coyly behind her.\n\nGUMP: Luna....!\n\nLUNA(maliciously): You look like mourners at your\nown funeral.\n\nGUMP(angry): Come back to dance on \nour graves!\n\nLUNA: I'd gladly frolic on Jack's....\n\nShe LAUGHS and holds up a large iron key.\n\nLUNA(cont): ....but this cage shan't be \nyour tomb!\n\nLuna tosses the key in to Gump. Instantly, she reduces to a tiny dot \nof LIGHT and flies out of the alcove.\n\nGUMP: Well done!\n\nGump unlocks the barred door and they all clamber out. Screwball \nsteps on Brown Tom's head in his eagerness.\n\nSCREWBALL: Lemme outta this stink hole!\n\nBROWN TOM: Mind you bleeding foot!\n\nGUMP: Shhhh! \n\nJack is the last of all.\n\nJACK: Keep behind me in case\nthere's trouble.\n\nSword in hand, Jack ;eads the faeries out of the alcove into\nthe kitchen.\n\n<b>70 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY\n</b>\nHuge ovens belch fire and smoke. The vast hearth blazes. Like the \nlower reaches of Hell, the Dark Lord's kitchen is a place where all \nhope is abandoned.\n\nJack and the faeries creep through the brimstone haze.\n\nBROWN TOM: Terrible sight for a sober\nman to see....\n\nJACK: Quiet!\n\nThe demon Cooks blocks the way, chopping meat with a montrous \ncleaver, A SECOND COOK, every bit as terrifying, SNORES by the \nhearth. Trussed to a spit, Blunder hangs upside-down nearby.\n\nJack motions the faeries on. The blind Cook turns them, sniffing the \nair.\n\nCOOK: Whut be there?\n\nJack and the faeries duck behind a huge bellows.\n\nSCREWBALL: ....Back in the frying pan!\n\nGump clamps his hand over Screwball's mouth.\n\nGrasping his cleaver, the Cook advances towards them.\n\nCOOK(sniffing): Be it live victuals?\n\nFrom where he hangs, Blunder sees the faeries' plight.\n\nBLUNDER(calling out): Hey....!\nLard belly!\n\nThe Cook turns, angered by this insult.\n\nCOOK: Whut say, pip-squeak?\n\nBLUNDER: Two things down here look \njust alike!\n\nCOOK: Wuzzat?\n\nBLUNDER: Your face and my ass!\n\nThe Cook GROWLS with fury.\n\nCOOK: Bash in you face! Den it no be \nso pretty!\n\nThe Cook backhands poor Blunder, smacking him about like a punching \nbag.\n\nJack and the faeries make a break for the exit.\n\nBlunder manages to work one arm free from his bonds.\n\nCOOK(cont): Whut you got to say now,\npork pie?\n\nBlunder rears back and punches the Cook in the jaw. Stunned,\nhe topples over over backwards a great CRASH.\n\n<b>70A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \n</b>\nThe reverberations tremble through the immense underground castle. \nDarkness listens by the fire. \n\nDARKNESS: Do you feel it, Father....? \nA force....loose in my domain.... \n\nVOICE(out of fire): Guard well what is yours! \n\nDARKNESS(roaring): BRING INNOCENCE TO ME! \n\n<b>71 INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY \n</b>\nThe faerie band gathers in the foul, dripping corridor. Irregular \ntorchlight casts a lurid glow across the broken stones. \n\nBROWN TOM (gasping for breath): \n.....saved....by a goblin.... Never \nthought....I'd see....the day.... \n\nJACK: Wish we could repay the favour! \n\nSCREWBALL: My brother can take of himself. \n\nGUMP: Screwball's right! It's more important \nwe find the unicorn. \n\nJACK: And Lili! \n\nBROWN TOM: Where do we start? \n\nGUMP: We must find the dungeons. Legend has \nis they house such sirriw that death \nis a gift....albeit one rarely granted. \n\nScrewball sits down defiantly. \n\nSCREWBALL: Think I'll stay right here thank you \nvery much. \n\nGump grabs hold of Screwball's ear and hauls him back up. \n\nGUMP: Not so fast! You search with the \nrest of us! \n\nScrewball hugs Jack's leg. \n\nSCREWBALL: All right! I'm going with Jack! \n\nGUMP: No you won't. Be faster if we \nsplit up. \n\nScrewball looks both ways, deciding which seems safest. \n\nSCREWBALL: Fine! I'm going this way! \n\nBROWN TOM: I'm going that way! \n\nThey both turn and collide, falling flat on their rumps. \n\nJACK: Wait....! Better to search in \nteams, Gump and me together. Brown \nTOm, you and Screwball look in the \nother direction. \n\nGump hauls out his ornate timepeice. \n\nGUMP: Right! Let's synchronise! We meet \nback here in twice five hundred \nbeats of a bluebird's heart. \n\nBrown Tom takes a similar timepeice from under his tunic and studies \nits intricate interior. \n\nBROWN TOM: Best to allow another couple dozen \nbutterfly breaths in case we get \nthirs....er, get lost.... \n\nGUMP: No grog shops down here, Brown Tom. \n\nJACK: Let's hurry! \n\nJack and Gump run off along the corridor, followed by Luna's glowing \nLIGHT. Screwball watches without moving. \n\nSCREWBALL: Know what I want to know? \n\nBROWN TOM: What? \n\nSCREWBALL: Why me? \n\nBrown Tom gives Screwball a swift kick in his rear. \n\nBROWN TOM: Why not? \n\nThe two little elves scamaper off together. \n\nSCREWBALL: I hate it....I hate it.... \nI hate it.... \n\n<b>72 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY \n</b>\nThe iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, \nher eyes aglow with animal fire. She crouches beside the unicorn, \nresting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion. \n\nLili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion \nluring her toward the open doorway. \n\nThe chained unicorn WHINNIES pitifully. Princess Lili looks back \nwithout expression as she leaves. \n\n<b>73 DELETED \n</b>\n<b>74 DELETED \n</b>\n<b>75 INTERIOR ANOTHER CORRIDOR DAY \n</b>Luna's bobbing LIGHT leads the way as Jack and Gump hurry along the \nrubble-choked corridor. Alerted by the SOUND of something, they dart \ninto the shadows. \n\nGUMP: Quick, Jack! \n\nJack and Gump watch in horror as a cracked EGG the size of a \nwatermelon runs down the corridor on armor-scaled chicken legs, led \non either side by a Demon holding a chain leash. \n\nJack draws his sword. The Demons stop and the Egg begins to crack. \n\nJACK: I'll scramble that one! \n\nGump restrains him. The Egg cracks apart. \n\nGUMP: Don't trust your eyes! All is \nenchanted here. \n\nThe Egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges; a \ndiabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl. It emits a fearsome \nSHRIEK and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin \nattendant Demons. \n\nJack and Gump hurry on in the opposite direction. \n\n<b>75A INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY \n</b>\nScrewball and Brown Tom creep timorously forward. They are alerted \nby the SOUNDS of something approaching. A hideously deformed shadow \nfall across the opposite wall. \n\nThe two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the \nshadows. \n\nIt is Princess Lili! She passes the evles' hiding place as if in a \ntrance. \n\n<b>76 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY \n</b>\nJack and Gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast \ncentral of the undreground castle. Similiar viaducts, above and \nbelow, bridge the awesome chasm. \n\nThe Green Man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all. \n\nJACK: Not even kings live like this.... \n\nOn a high span above, Jack sees Princess Lili drifting by like a \nsomnabulist. \n\nJACK (cont): My God! Gump, look! It's Lili! \n\nGUMP: Don't believe it, Jack. \n\nJACK (yelling): Lili ! \n\nThe SOUND ECHOES through the vast space. \n\n<b>77 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY \n</b>\nThe Princess pauses. A section of parapet has broken off and she \nwanders to the edge, staring down into the void. For a precarious \nmoment, she teeters on the brink, seemingly about to fall. \n\nJACK (os) (calling): Li-li ! \nThe Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow \nedge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug \nchunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss. \n\nJACK (cont) (os) (calling): It's Ja-ack ! \n\nLili's face is blank. She turns and continues blindly on her way. \n\n<b>78 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY \n</b>\nJack stares up at Lili's retreating form. \n\nJACK: It's her. I know it. \n\nGUMP: Don't be so hasty! Remember who we're dealing with. \n\nJACK: I've got to reach her! \n\nJack races off. Gump runs along behind. \n\n<b>78A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \n</b>\nThe shadowy figure of Darkness looms over a band of deformed PYGMIES \nwith needle-sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork \ntines. \n\nDARKNESS: My enemies approach.... destory them! \nDarkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry CACKLING off. \n\n<b>79 DELETED \n</b>\n<b>80 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY \n</b>\nJack and Gump hurry out onto the arching span. The Princess is \nnowhere in sight. \n\nGUMP (running after): Slow down....! \nUse some caution! \n\nJACK: This way! \n\nJack runs on into the corridor in the direction taken by Lili. Gump \nfollows after. \n\n<b>81 INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY \n</b>\nLili wanders down a long colonnade with dangling vine-like roots. A \nglistening magic rain falls from the granite ceiling. Her blank eyes \nstare straight ahead. \n\nJack and Gump appear at the opposite end of the passage in time to \nsee the Princess drift out of sight. \n\nJACK: There she is....! Lili....! \n\nJack and Gump run to catch up, pushing through root tendrils agleam \nwith rain. Suddenly, they are attacked by SCREAMING Pygmies. \n\nGUMP: Jack! \n\nJACK (drawing his sword): Demons! \n\nThe nimble Pygmies leap about them, lethal talons slashing through \nthe drizzle. \n\nJack and Gump retreat, backing between clingling rootlets. \n\nGUMP: Quick! In here! \n\nGump yanks open a heavy oaken door in the side wall and they duck \ninside, slamming it shut in the teeth of the attacking Pygmies. \n\n<b>81A INTERIOR SEALED CORRIDOR DAY \n</b>\nJack strains against the door handle, struggling to keep the portal \nshut tight. There is less space than in a closet. The corridor \nbehind them is completely bricked over. \n\nGUMP: Trapped....! \n\nCLOSE ON DOOR: With great force, the Pygmies' claws stab through the \nthick wood like stiletties. Their needle tips are mere inches from \nJack and Gump. \n\nThe door's inner surface is studded with talons. Jack suddenly SLAMS \nthe door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a \nloud CRASH. \n\nThe Pygmies' frenzied SCREAMING ends in abrupt SILENCE. \n\nJack and Gump peer cautiously out. \n\n<b>81B INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY \n</b>\nThe Pymies hang unconscious on the other side of the door, dangling \nfrom their imbedded talons. \n\nJACK: Come on! \n\nJack and Gump run into the rain. \n\n<b>82 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY \n</b>\nJack and Gump hurry around the corner just as Lili heads towards a \npair of massive doors swinging slowly open at her approach. \n\nJACK (calling): Lili! Wait! \n\nGump grabs Jack's arm and yanks him to a stop. \n\nGUMP: Don't be daft! She's under a spell! \n\nLili enters and the doors swing closed behind her. \n\n<b>83 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY \n</b>\nAn enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall \nBaroque columns. Winged demons writhe in the shadows above. A long \nblack table reaches down the centre of the room. All is lit by \nfirelight. The gaping hearth, with its entablature of monumental \nsculpture, is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones, carved in \na hideous, twisting mass of tendons, sinews and museles. \n\nWhen the imposing doors swing closed, Lili's spell is broken. She \nstares in terror at her news surroundings. \n\nSomething weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped \nshadows. It is a magnificent high-collared black gown, waltzing like \na ghost across the black marble floor. There is no one wearing the \ngarment! \n\nFascinated, Lili watches the dress circle towards her. She finds it \nirresistable. Taking hold of the gown's empty sleeves she begins to \ndance, spinning round and round to the impulsive music. \n\n<b>84 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY \n</b>\nJack paces back and forth in front of the sealed doors. \n\nJACK: Why did you stop me? \n\nGUMP: We best reconnoitre.

She is now WEARING the splendid black gown! \n\nReflected firelight GLITTERS in the shadows. An open jewel box \nspills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table. Lili is lure \nlike a moth to the flame. \n\nShe steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table. The ebony \ncasket brims with gemstones. Lili's eyes dazzle. A carved ebony \nfigure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre, holding in its \nup lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind \ncan imagine. \n\nThe Princess sucks in her breath. The temptation is too great. She \nimpulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool. \n\nThe high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and \nwithout thinking, she backs towards the wall, fumbling behind her \nneck. \n\nShe leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment, \nconcentrating on the tricky clasp. All at once, a piece of sculpture \nbecomes ANIMATE. Powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace. For \na moment Lili doesn't notice, grateful for the help. Then, she \nrealises what is happening and SCREAMS. \n\nThe musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror. \nLili turns to run, but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall \ncheval glass mirror. She looks furtively about, making certain she \nis unobserved. Alone, she admires her perfect image. \n\nCLOSE ON MIRROR: Beneath Lili's pleased expression we see the evil \nface of Darkness APPEAR like a man emerging from under water. \n\nDarkness penetrates the surface of the mirror. \n\nLili backs away, GASPING soundlessly with terror. \n\nDarkness steps forth through the glass into the room, clad in black \nfinery. \n\nLili staggers. Darkness reaches to embrace her and the Princess \nSHRIEKS at the top of her lungs. The moment he touches her shoulder, \nshe slumps tothe floor, unconscious. \n\nDarkness stands over the fallen girl, his heartbeat pulsing like \nmuffled thunder. Something almost like a smile creases his hideous \nfeatures as he rolls a lock of Lili's hair between his clawed \nfingers. \n\nThe Princess blinks and opens her eyes. She is horrified to find \nDarkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away. \n\nDARKNESS: Do not be afraid, lady.... \n\nLili GASPS like a stranded fish. She is catatonic with fear. \n\nDARKNESS (cont): I mean you no harm. \n\nDarkness offers the Princess his hand. \n\nDARKNESS (cont): How like you my gifts...? Does \nthe gown not please you? Come.... \ntell me.... \n\nLili's terror renders her speechless. \n\nDARKNESS (cont): The colour is most suitable... We \nsanctify the death of the old world \nand the birth of a new order.... \nYou are the guest of honour. \n\nLili WEEPS and tugs at the black dress. \n\nLILI: ....of dishonour...! Take this \naway.... Please! I beg you! \n\nDarkness advances on Lili. The slow kettldrum THROB of his heart \nunderscores his words. \n\nDARKNESS: Your soul in like some dark nectar.... \nI cannot rest unril I taste its \nsweetness. \n\nLILI (frantic): Never!

It is like \nspringtime, with bold patches of green showing through the frozen \nlandscape.\n\nA bright beam of LIGHT APPROACHES, weaving between the giant trees. \nIt is Jack and Lili, mounted on the unicorn.\n\nJack rides up onto the high rock overinghanfing the ponnd and slides \neasily to the ground with Lili in his arms.\n\nThe unicorn doesn't move. She stands watching as Jack gently rests \nLili down on the mossy earth.\n\nJack strips off his golden mail coat and steps on the edge of the \npromontory. He dives gracefully into the pond.\n\n<b>128A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY \n</b>\nScrewball in the lead, the faeries CRASH down through the trees, \nbouncing to a stop on the forest floor.\n\nSCREWBALL: Ow!\n\nBROWN TOM: Ouch!\n\nGUMP (cheerfully): Home again!\n\nThe bedraggled faeries scowl at Gump.\n\n<b>129 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY \n</b>\nJack streaks down, streaming air bubbles like a comet's tail.\n\n<b>129A EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY \n</b>\nThe faeries gather around the frozen unicorn stallion. His alicorn \nhas been restored. Wreathed in flowers, it stands majestically out \nfrom his forehead.\n\n<b>129B EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY \n</b>\nJack strokes deeper and deeper into the pond, past undulating weeds \nand curious fish.\n\n<b>129C EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY \n</b>\nFaeries are all about, dancing and SINGING around the statuesque \nunicorn. They pelt one another with petals. The mare stands demurely \nto one side, draped in blossoms.\n\n<b>129D EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY \n</b>\nAt the bottom, Jack moves carefully, trying not to stir up the muck. \nHe gently parts the drifting trendrils, searching among the water \nweeds.\n\n<b>129E EXTERIOR TREETOP DAY \n</b>\nHigh above the faerie celebration, beautiful MUSIC is HEARD. It is \nGump, playing his violin in uppermost branches of a towering pine. \nDelicate as the call of a meadow lark, Gump's music rises sweetly \ninto the heavens. It is just dawn. The sun's GLOW blazes in the \neast.\n\n<b>129F EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY \n</b>\nA winking GLEAM catches Jack's eyes and he reaches out an eager \nhand.\n\nA cloud silt issues from his grasp as he opens his fingers. Centred \non his palm, golden and perfect, is Lili's ring.\n\n<b>129G EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY \n</b>\nRound and full, the sun rises. The golden sun rays pierce through \nthe trees and start across the open meadow. Gump's music continues, \nmore lyrical than ever.\n\nAs the sunlight advances, bright spring flowers push up through the \nonce-frozen earth.\n\n<b>129H EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY \n</b>\nJack turns and strokes upwards, higher and higher, towards the \nshining ceiling of light far above.\n\n<b>129I EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY \n</b>\nGump's music swells to a crescendo. The life-giving sunlight reaches \nacross the meadow and strikes the flank of the dormant stallion.\n\n<b>130 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY \n</b>\nJack breaks the surface, holding the ring triumphantly above his \nhead.\n\n<b>130A EXTERIOR CLIFF ABOVE POND DAY \n</b>\nThe Princess sleeps under the tree. She no longer wears the black \nwedding gown, but is dressed as before. Jack's armour has also \ndisappeared.\n\nJack kneels before Lili and slips the ring onto her finger.\n\nHe takes the girl into his arms and kisses her passionately on the \nmouth.\n\nLili smiles. Her eyelids flutter.\n\n<b>131 DELETED\n</b>\n<b>132 DELETED\n</b>\n<b>133 DELETED\n</b>\n<b>134 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY\n</b>\nThe unicorn's sunlit flesh twitches, dislodging a butterfly warming \nhis wings on his haunch.\n\nIn a single, beautiful movement, the stallion rises to his feet. He \narches his powerful neck and CALLS to his mate. The magic animals \ngallop off together across the open meadow.\n\n<b>135 DELETED\n</b>\n<b>136 DELETED\n</b>\n<b>136A EXTERIOR RING POND DAY\n</b>\nPrincess Lili awakens.\n\nLILI: Oh....! Jack! What a dream\nI've had!\n\nThe Princess smiles when she sees the ring on her finger.\n\nLILI (cont): Such a terrible dream....\nI could never tell you....\n\nLili looks around, but Jack is nowhere in sight.\n\nLILI (cont): Jack....? Where are you....?\n(calling)\nGreen Jack!\n\nGetting no reply, Lili wanders off in search of Jack.\n\n<b>137 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY \n</b>\nPuzzled, Lili searches the familiar place.\n\nLILI (calling): Jack....! Where are you\nhiding now?\n\nThe wind surges through the treetops. The leaves all move together \nas if they were a single living organism.\n\nJack's VOICE is heard out of the waving trees.\n\nJACK (os): I'm everywhere, Lili....my\nspirit lives in everything....\n\nLILI: Jack.... Don't play games with me!\nI love you!\n\nJACK (os): I....love.....you...\n\nLILI: Will you be here tomorrow?\n\nUnseen in the bushes, Gump and the faeries hide, grinning as\nthey watch Lili.\n\nJACK (os): I'm always here, Lili....\nwhenever you come....\n\nMystified, but happy, Princess Lili picks a flower and wanders off \ninto the sun-bright woods.\n\n<b>END CREDITS ROLL\n</b>\n<b>138 EXTERIOR MEADOW DAY \n</b>\nA lush broad expanse, boldly pattered with wild flowers. Breasting \nthe waving grass like a swimmer in the sea, the unicorn bounds \njoyfully in total freedom.\n\nMounted on the animal's back, his arms in victory, Jack rides like a \ntriumphant angel. His hair and skin are tinted green! He is the \nincarnation of all that is magical in Nature.\n\n\n<b>T H E E N D\n</b>\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Legend</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=William Hjortsberg\" title=\"Scripts by William Hjortsberg\">William Hjortsberg</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Legend Script.html#comments\" title=\"Legend comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:09:41.831892"}
