It is a gala day.  Soldiers are lined up \n               in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are \n               arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the \n               adjoining countries.  Two trumpeters at the head of the stairs \n               announce the arrival of each notable.\n\n               In the large reception hall, Mrs. Teasdale, wife of the late \n               president, is greeting the newcomers.  The room is filled \n               with distinguished guests.  At the moment we see Mrs. \n               Teasdale, she is talking with a notable.  In the near \n               background is a group of distinguished men, members of her \n               own cabinet.  Her words to the notable are not lost on them, \n               and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the \n               exchange of disapproving glances.\n\n<b>                                     MRS.

As she approaches Harpo, he toots his horn to \n               attract her attention, she throws him a indignant look and \n               continues on down the street.  Harpo turns his motorcycle \n               around and starts after her.  She looks around, sees Harpo\n\n               pursuing and breaks into a run... CUT BACK to Harpo following \n               her, putting on speed... he lowers the Freedonian flag and \n               simultaneously raises a pirate flag -- with skull and cross-\n               bones on it, displayed prominently.  A motorcycle cop is \n               parked on the corner waiting for prospective violators...  \n               he sees Harpo chasing the girl and quickly starts his motor \n               and follows in pursuit...\n\n               The girl, as she reaches the executive mansion, rushes up \n               the stairs in an effort to escape.  Harpo comes into the \n               scene and rides up the stairs after her... As Harpo gets \n               about half way up the stairs the motorcycle cop is seen \n               approaching the mansion.\n\n               CUT TO reception room of mansion as the girl is running madly \n               through the room... a moment later we see Harpo on his bike \n               following... there is panic among the guests.  Then we see \n               the girl tearing up the stairs leading to the circular \n               balcony...\n\n               CUT BACK to Harpo.  He looks behind him as he rides and sees \n               the motorcycle cop following on his bike.  On the balcony \n               above,  the girl is running, with an occasional glance over \n               her shoulder as she runs out of scene... Harpo rides into \n               scene.  This time he is bent over his handle-bars in the \n               manner of a six day bicycle rider... following closely behind \n               him rides the motorcycle cop.  They circle the mezzanine... \n               Harpo in the lead, looking back now and then over his shoulder \n               at his pursuer... this is done in imitation of a six day \n               bicycle race... The motorcycle cop is closing in on Harpo... \n               the latter approaching a large open door, rides through the \n               opening, but the cop continues on around the balcony...  as \n               he gets to the opposite side of the circular balcony he passes \n               another open doorway.  Harpo comes riding out of it and is \n               now in pursuit of the cop...\n\n               CUT down stairs to Groucho... One hand is upraised holding a \n               gun.  As he looks at a wrist watch, he fires gun, then \n               addresses guests looking into CAMERA.\n\n<b>                                     GROUCHO\n</b>                         That concludes the nine o'clock \n                         sprints...

Harpo is passing the cop...  He holds \n               up his hand for the cop to stop... they both come to a halt... \n               Harpo gets off his motorcycle, walks over angrily to cop, \n               takes out his book, writes out a summons and hands it to the \n               cop as we FADE OUT...\n\n<b>                                   END OF SEQUENCE \"A\"\n</b>\n<b>                                       SEQUENCE \"B\"\n</b>\n               FADE IN on interior of Freedonian House of Representatives.  \n               This interior although not a replica of our own House of \n               Representatives, should be close enough technically to sell \n               the idea... Each seat is occupied by an officious-looking \n               dignitary.  On the platform are a few desks... perhaps a \n               pulpit which Groucho uses when he arrives...  The one to the \n               right is the court stenographer's desk, occupied by Bob \n               Firefly.  He takes notes as the meeting progresses.\n\n               Throughout the House runs a ripple of excitement, which is \n               stopped by the rapping of the gavel by the Speaker of the \n               House.\n\n<b>                                     SPEAKER\n</b>                         Gentlemen, gentlemen, remember for \n                         forty-six years we have enjoyed the \n                         friendship of Amnesia, so ably \n                         represented by Ambassador Trentino.\n                              (Indicating the \n                              Ambassador who is \n                              present)\n                         We owe it to ourselves to listen to \n                         what he has to say...\n\n               Trentino takes the floor\n\n<b>                                     TRENTINO\n</b>                         Gentlemen, while I admit it is unusual \n                         for a representative of one country \n                         to advise the legislative body of \n                         another, I assure you that I have \n                         the interest of Freedonia at heart \n<b>                         ...\n</b>                              (Deferential applause)\n                         We have lent you money in the past -- \n                         we are willing to lend you money \n                         again -- but, we cannot do it if \n                         your leader is allowed by you, to \n                         carry out his ridiculous proposals... \n                         In self-protection it is my --\n\n               Bob rises to interrupt\n\n<b>                                     BOB\n</b>                         I object!...  we have no right to \n                         discuss this matter in the absence \n                         of my father.\n\n<b>                                     SPEAKER\n</b>                              (To House)\n                         We have been meeting every morning \n                         for eight days and not once has His \n                         Excellency been on time...\n\n<b>                                     TRENTINO\n</b>                              (Looking at his watch)\n                         Gentlemen, I cannot wait much \n                         longer...\n\n<b>                                     SPEAKER\n</b>                              (To Bob)\n                         Would you mind calling your father \n                         again?\n\n               Bob presses a button, either on desk or wall...\n\n               CUT TO - the corner of Groucho's bedroom, showing fireman's \n               pole.

We pick him up finishing the slide down the \n               pole into the House of Representatives.  As he arrives the \n               members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the \n               national anthem.\n\n<b>                                     MEMBERS\n</b>                              (Singing)\n                         HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the \n                         brave and free...\n\n               Groucho hurries toward Speaker's desk, putting on his coat \n               as he goes...

As Groucho \n               is trying to reach for the plans, Vera dances into scene, \n               makes a graceful pirouette and with her outstretched hands \n               takes the plans from Harpo.  As she dances away she deposits \n               the plans in her bodice...\n\n               Vera's male dancing partner enters from the wings, walks out \n               about four feet - stops and strikes a pose with uplifted \n               hand.  Vera is dancing on the opposite side with her back \n               turned.

Groucho and Vera are dancing \n               together.  During the dance Groucho tries to get the paper.\n\n               He bends her way over in an effort to make the paper drop \n               out of her bodice.  Harpo and Chico, watching the struggle, \n               quickly tear off their capes and coats and leap from the box \n               on to stage in their shirts.\n\n               This develops into a four-cornered adagio dance.\n\n               She hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she \n               dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a \n               twirl together.  Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's \n               shoulder.  Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - \n               Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the \n               floor.  They all make a dive for them.

Night.  Subdued light.  \n               We begin with an EXTREME CLOSE CLOSE SHOT of a hand depositing \n               the plans of war in a vault.  This vault is about the height \n               of a man, the door flush with wall.  The CAMERA TRUCKS back \n               and discloses that the one depositing the papers is Mrs. \n               Teasdale -- she is in negligee.  She closes the vault door, \n               pulls a cord, closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault.  \n               The CAMERA PANS to the balcony above where Vera Trentino,  \n               also in negligee, is watching the action in the living room \n               below.  She tiptoes quietly from the scene.\n\n               Downstairs, Mrs. Teasdale turns out the center table light \n               and moves toward the stairway.\n\n               CUT TO Vera Trentino's bedroom.  Vera comes toward window, \n               raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief, evidently \n               signalling somebody below.\n\n               CUT TO EXTERIOR of house.  Chico and Harpo are waving back \n               to signify that they have caught the signal.  The boys try \n               to raise the window which is located next to the main \n               entrance, but it is locked and they can't budge it.\n\n<b>                                     CHICO\n</b>                              (Peeved)\n                         It's all your fault.

He raises it from the inside \n               and Harpo climbs in through the window and joins Chico.\n\n               CUT TO INSIDE.  They are walking cautiously across the room \n               when they hear the following coming over scene -- \"Psst... \n               Psst...\"  They stop and look around, trying to locate the \n               source of the sound.  We CUT TO the balcony and see Vera \n               Trentino, still dressed in her negligee.  Once more she tries \n               to attract them.\n\n<b>                                     VERA\n</b>                         Psst...\n\n               The boys look up and see her.\n\n<b>                                     VERA\n</b>                              (In a half whisper - \n                              mysteriously)\n                         In the safe -- behind the drapes --\n                              (Pointing in the \n                              direction of the \n                              safe)\n\n<b>                                     CHICO\n</b>                              (Also in a half whisper)\n                         All right -- I'll meet you behind \n                         the drapes.\n\n<b>                                     VERA\n</b>                              (In a half whisper)\n                         No, no -- I mean the plans are in \n                         the safe.\n                              (Pointing to safe \n                              again)\n\n               Harpo hasn't taken his eyes off of Vera during all this, \n               makes a sudden dash for her, as she turns to her room.\n\n               Chico stops him on the second or third step of the stairs.\n\n<b>                                     CHICO\n</b>                         Come on, we gotta no time for that.\n\n               Chico goes over to the safe and draws the curtains, disclosing \n               safe.

After a short pause, the doors of \n               the French window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a \n               double bed which is on wheels.

Harpo pauses, brings to light a cuspidor \n               from under his coat, puts it on the carpet and spits into \n               it, and continues on, following Chico, who is now ahead of \n               him.  Harpo breaks into a run and he and Chico dash madly to \n               the table.  They take seats on either side of Groucho and \n               without hesitating, start to eat the food in front of them.  \n               The guests are standing.  Trentino and Vera arrive at their \n               places and everyone sits down.\n\n               Harpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture \n               on it, pushes his plate away, breaks the service plate with \n               a knife... it breaks into little pieces like a jig-saw puzzle.  \n               He mixes the pieces up, and then starts to put them together \n               again ... Groucho watches him... then helps him...\n\n<b>                                     GROUCHO\n</b>                              (Stopping Harpo as he \n                              tries to fit a piece)\n                         No, no, this is the one...\n                              (Picking up a piece \n                              and placing it...)\n\n               A waiter places a dish of tasty food in front of Groucho... \n               he is just about to dig into it with his knife and fork when \n               Harpo turns the table toward himself.
