It is a gala day.  Soldiers are lined up \n               in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are \n               arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the \n               adjoining countries.  Two trumpeters at the head of the stairs \n               announce the arrival of each notable.\n\n               In the large reception hall, Mrs. Teasdale, wife of the late \n               president, is greeting the newcomers.  The room is filled \n               with distinguished guests.  At the moment we see Mrs. \n               Teasdale, she is talking with a notable.  In the near \n               background is a group of distinguished men, members of her \n               own cabinet.  Her words to the notable are not lost on them, \n               and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the \n               exchange of disapproving glances.\n\n                                     MRS.

You must \n                         indeed have great faith in your new \n                         dictator to give him such a \n                         magnificent reception.\n\n                                     MRS.

He has the \n                         statesmanship of Gladstone, the \n                         humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom \n                         of Pericles.\n\n               The notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene.  \n               As he does, the background group moves into Mrs. Teasdale.  \n               Their spokesman addresses Mrs. Teasdale.\n\n                                     FIRST CABINET MEMBER\n                              (Protestingly)\n                         Mrs. Teasdale, as members of \n                         Freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve \n                         of your choice.

We see Trentino enter with a beautiful \n               brunette at his side.  He is followed by two or three of his \n               fellowmen.  He moves across the reception hall to Mrs. \n               Teasdale, bows most graciously and presses his lips to the \n               back of her hand, then introduces his companion.\n\n                                     TRENTINO\n                         Mrs. Teasdale... my niece, Vera.\n\n               Mrs. Teasdale shakes the girl's hand warmly.\n\n                                     MRS.

He passes several notables, one of whom is wearing \n               an impressive looking medal.  Groucho deprives him of it \n               without stopping his forward movement, and pins it on himself.  \n               He pauses only when he is facing the principal group.\n\n                                     MRS.

This is a \n               pretentious affair.  In central foreground a wall, in the \n               center of which is a large wrought-iron double gate.

The two guards open gates moving in \n               military manner.  Immediately the gates are wide open, Harpo \n               appears on his motorcycle, that carries a side car.\n\n               The motorcycle is decorated... perhaps a crest in relief on \n               the side of the car...  a thin staff, about four or five \n               feet high is fastened to the handle bars...  As Harpo rides \n               along, he hoists the Freedonian flag to the staff.  Further \n               along the road he hits a man... he looks behind to see what \n               damage he's done, but continues riding... A CUT BACK to the \n               man shows that he is lying prostrate on the ground.\n\n               We CUT BACK to Harpo, who is just getting off motorcycle... \n               he takes another look back at the man, lowers the flag to \n               half-mast, takes bugle, which is hanging on his car and blows \n               a few bars of taps... he mounts motorcycle again and starts \n               off...\n\n               CUT TO top of mansion steps as Groucho comes from mansion... \n               the two guards standing stiffly erect, form a seat by crossing \n               hands...

As she approaches Harpo, he toots his horn to \n               attract her attention, she throws him a indignant look and \n               continues on down the street.  Harpo turns his motorcycle \n               around and starts after her.  She looks around, sees Harpo\n\n               pursuing and breaks into a run... CUT BACK to Harpo following \n               her, putting on speed... he lowers the Freedonian flag and \n               simultaneously raises a pirate flag -- with skull and cross-\n               bones on it, displayed prominently.  A motorcycle cop is \n               parked on the corner waiting for prospective violators...  \n               he sees Harpo chasing the girl and quickly starts his motor \n               and follows in pursuit...\n\n               The girl, as she reaches the executive mansion, rushes up \n               the stairs in an effort to escape.  Harpo comes into the \n               scene and rides up the stairs after her... As Harpo gets \n               about half way up the stairs the motorcycle cop is seen \n               approaching the mansion.\n\n               CUT TO reception room of mansion as the girl is running madly \n               through the room... a moment later we see Harpo on his bike \n               following... there is panic among the guests.  Then we see \n               the girl tearing up the stairs leading to the circular \n               balcony...\n\n               CUT BACK to Harpo.  He looks behind him as he rides and sees \n               the motorcycle cop following on his bike.  On the balcony \n               above,  the girl is running, with an occasional glance over \n               her shoulder as she runs out of scene... Harpo rides into \n               scene.  This time he is bent over his handle-bars in the \n               manner of a six day bicycle rider... following closely behind \n               him rides the motorcycle cop.  They circle the mezzanine... \n               Harpo in the lead, looking back now and then over his shoulder \n               at his pursuer... this is done in imitation of a six day \n               bicycle race... The motorcycle cop is closing in on Harpo... \n               the latter approaching a large open door, rides through the \n               opening, but the cop continues on around the balcony...  as \n               he gets to the opposite side of the circular balcony he passes \n               another open doorway.  Harpo comes riding out of it and is \n               now in pursuit of the cop...\n\n               CUT down stairs to Groucho... One hand is upraised holding a \n               gun.  As he looks at a wrist watch, he fires gun, then \n               addresses guests looking into CAMERA.\n\n                                     GROUCHO\n                         That concludes the nine o'clock \n                         sprints... Next Saturday night the \n                         winner of the six day bicycle race \n                         will receive ten thousand dollars in \n                         gold... the following morning we go \n                         off the gold standard...\n\n               CUT BACK to balcony... Harpo is passing the cop...  He holds \n               up his hand for the cop to stop... they both come to a halt... \n               Harpo gets off his motorcycle, walks over angrily to cop, \n               takes out his book, writes out a summons and hands it to the \n               cop as we FADE OUT...\n\n                                   END OF SEQUENCE \"A\"\n\n                                       SEQUENCE \"B\"\n\n               FADE IN on interior of Freedonian House of Representatives.  \n               This interior although not a replica of our own House of \n               Representatives, should be close enough technically to sell \n               the idea... Each seat is occupied by an officious-looking \n               dignitary.  On the platform are a few desks... perhaps a \n               pulpit which Groucho uses when he arrives...  The one to the \n               right is the court stenographer's desk, occupied by Bob \n               Firefly.  He takes notes as the meeting progresses.\n\n               Throughout the House runs a ripple of excitement, which is \n               stopped by the rapping of the gavel by the Speaker of the \n               House.\n\n                                     SPEAKER\n                         Gentlemen, gentlemen, remember for \n                         forty-six years we have enjoyed the \n                         friendship of Amnesia, so ably \n                         represented by Ambassador Trentino.\n                              (Indicating the \n                              Ambassador who is \n                              present)\n                         We owe it to ourselves to listen to \n                         what he has to say...\n\n               Trentino takes the floor\n\n                                     TRENTINO\n                         Gentlemen, while I admit it is unusual \n                         for a representative of one country \n                         to advise the legislative body of \n                         another, I assure you that I have \n                         the interest of Freedonia at heart \n                         ...\n                              (Deferential applause)\n                         We have lent you money in the past -- \n                         we are willing to lend you money \n                         again -- but, we cannot do it if \n                         your leader is allowed by you, to \n                         carry out his ridiculous proposals... \n                         In self-protection it is my --\n\n               Bob rises to interrupt\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I object!...  we have no right to \n                         discuss this matter in the absence \n                         of my father.\n\n                                     SPEAKER\n                              (To House)\n                         We have been meeting every morning \n                         for eight days and not once has His \n                         Excellency been on time...\n\n                                     TRENTINO\n                              (Looking at his watch)\n                         Gentlemen, I cannot wait much \n                         longer...\n\n                                     SPEAKER\n                              (To Bob)\n                         Would you mind calling your father \n                         again?\n\n               Bob presses a button, either on desk or wall...\n\n               CUT TO - the corner of Groucho's bedroom, showing fireman's \n               pole.

We pick him up finishing the slide down the \n               pole into the House of Representatives.  As he arrives the \n               members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the \n               national anthem.\n\n                                     MEMBERS\n                              (Singing)\n                         HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA Land of the \n                         brave and free...\n\n               Groucho hurries toward Speaker's desk, putting on his coat \n               as he goes...  Just as he reaches the desk the singing \n               subsides.

This is an afternoon tea in the \n               garden of the Teasdale estate.   Spotted in the set-up are \n               innumerable colorful umbrellas, under which are tea tables.\n\n               The guests include the notables we saw in the mansion in the \n               first sequence.  The only two people absent are Ambassador \n               Trentino and Mrs. Teasdale.  Vera Trentino is seated at one \n               of the tables and her presence is established there in the \n               opening shot.  Music is heard over the scene and should be \n               continued through the scene as if being played by an orchestra \n               on the premises.  Suddenly the chatter ceases as the following \n               announcement is heard coming over scene.\n\n                                     GUARD'S VOICE\n                              (From off scene)\n                         His Excellency, Rufus T.

From his attitude it \n               is evident that he is intent on finding Ambassador Trentino.  \n               Suddenly he stops, having seen something of interest off \n               scene.

On the \n               door leading to the Secretary's private office, we see the \n               lettering: PRIVATE.

Bob closes the door behind her.  The CAMERA now \n               moves along the row of girls and the sixth or seventh girl \n               in the row is Harpo, dressed as a girl.  On the other side \n               of him are more girls.

He slaps the story-teller on the \n               leg.\n\n               Her laughter ceases instantly.  She slaps him back, and gets \n               another slap on the leg in return.

The office is cluttered \n               with war implements, maps, etc.  The examination of the girl \n               is in progress.

She lets go after a \n               little while and Chico comes up for air.  He staggers around \n               in a daze.  Then he takes the watch from his vest pocket, \n               hands it to her, extends his wrist and says:\n\n                                     CHICO\n                         Now you feel my pulse.\n\n               Suddenly the screaming of girls is heard coming from the \n               anteroom, and we cut to the anteroom in the midst of \n               confusion.  The girls are running helter-skelter, one or two \n               of them are standing on chairs with their skirts lifted above \n               their knees.  There is a little white mouse running about \n               the room.\n\n               Harpo is sitting innocently on the bench.  The girl just \n               interviewed by Chico comes from the office, sees the mouse, \n               screams and joins in the general confusion.  Groucho enters \n               as the girls are running about - zig-zags among them and \n               continues through the room into the private office of Chico - \n               closing door behind him. The girls clear out of anteroom and \n               Harpo is left all alone.  He takes a small mouse trap from \n               his large pocketbook, puts it on the floor, crouches down \n               and whistles to the mouse in the manner of a man trying to \n               call a dog.  The mouse in answer to the whistle runs into \n               the trap.\n\n                                                                     CUT TO\n\n               The Secretary of War's office.

He walks past Groucho in a seductive \n               manner, swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously.  \n               Groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling.\n\n                                     CHICO\n                              (To Harpo)\n                         Have you got any credentials?\n\n               Harpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg \n               of the two hearts.

He squeezes him very hard.  In \n               the midst of this there is a loud report.\n\n               A startled look from Groucho and Chico.  We see that Harpo \n               is minus one breast.

CUT BACK to \n               Harpo - he places the toupe on the bare back side of a figure \n               of Cupid carved on the arch.

The line instantly \n               tightens and a large carp fish is yanked out of the pool...  \n               as the line is drawn in the fish nearly hits Mrs. Teasdale.\n\n               She covers her face with her hands.

Harpo and Chico, watching the struggle, \n               quickly tear off their capes and coats and leap from the box \n               on to stage in their shirts.\n\n               This develops into a four-cornered adagio dance.\n\n               She hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she \n               dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a \n               twirl together.  Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's \n               shoulder.  Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - \n               Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the \n               floor.  They all make a dive for them.  Groucho gets the \n               papers and dashes with them to the lower box just as Mrs. \n               Teasdale enters same.\n\n               The following is a close shot of Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale.  \n               The latter standing on stage right by the box.\n\n                                     GROUCHO\n                              (Handing paper to \n                              Mrs. Teasdale)\n                         Here -- put these plans where no one \n                         will ever find them - sleep on them.\n\n               CUT TO - Dressing room just a Vera, Chico and Harpo enter. \n\n                                     VERA\n                              (Apologetically)\n                         I'm sorry boys -- I did my best -- \n                         it's all my fault.\n\n                                     CHICO\n                         It's not-a your fault.

Night.  Subdued light.  \n               We begin with an EXTREME CLOSE CLOSE SHOT of a hand depositing \n               the plans of war in a vault.  This vault is about the height \n               of a man, the door flush with wall.  The CAMERA TRUCKS back \n               and discloses that the one depositing the papers is Mrs. \n               Teasdale -- she is in negligee.  She closes the vault door, \n               pulls a cord, closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault.  \n               The CAMERA PANS to the balcony above where Vera Trentino,  \n               also in negligee, is watching the action in the living room \n               below.  She tiptoes quietly from the scene.\n\n               Downstairs, Mrs. Teasdale turns out the center table light \n               and moves toward the stairway.\n\n               CUT TO Vera Trentino's bedroom.  Vera comes toward window, \n               raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief, evidently \n               signalling somebody below.\n\n               CUT TO EXTERIOR of house.  Chico and Harpo are waving back \n               to signify that they have caught the signal.  The boys try \n               to raise the window which is located next to the main \n               entrance, but it is locked and they can't budge it.\n\n                                     CHICO\n                              (Peeved)\n                         It's all your fault.

He raises it from the inside \n               and Harpo climbs in through the window and joins Chico.\n\n               CUT TO INSIDE.  They are walking cautiously across the room \n               when they hear the following coming over scene -- \"Psst... \n               Psst...\"  They stop and look around, trying to locate the \n               source of the sound.  We CUT TO the balcony and see Vera \n               Trentino, still dressed in her negligee.  Once more she tries \n               to attract them.\n\n                                     VERA\n                         Psst...\n\n               The boys look up and see her.\n\n                                     VERA\n                              (In a half whisper - \n                              mysteriously)\n                         In the safe -- behind the drapes --\n                              (Pointing in the \n                              direction of the \n                              safe)\n\n                                     CHICO\n                              (Also in a half whisper)\n                         All right -- I'll meet you behind \n                         the drapes.\n\n                                     VERA\n                              (In a half whisper)\n                         No, no -- I mean the plans are in \n                         the safe.\n                              (Pointing to safe \n                              again)\n\n               Harpo hasn't taken his eyes off of Vera during all this, \n               makes a sudden dash for her, as she turns to her room.\n\n               Chico stops him on the second or third step of the stairs.\n\n                                     CHICO\n                         Come on, we gotta no time for that.\n\n               Chico goes over to the safe and draws the curtains, disclosing \n               safe.  Harpo follows and takes from his back pocket a rather \n               large electrical drill with a cord and plug attached to it.  \n               Chico takes the cord and plugs it into the wall socket.\n\n               Harpo starts to drill the safe door, making a terrific noise -- \n               the usual reaping whir-r-r of an electric drill.  Chico grabs \n               his hand and stops him from drilling.\n\n                                     CHICO\n                         Wait a minute...  we make too much \n                         noise...  Turn on the radio so they \n                         can't hear what we're doing.\n\n               Harpo goes over to radio and turns it on... a dance tune \n               comes over the air.  Harpo grabs Chico and whirls him around \n               as if he were dancing with a dame...\n\n                                     CHICO\n                              (Jerking himself away \n                              from Harpo)\n                         What's-a matter, you crazy... ?\n\n               Chico goes to radio and adjusts dial to another station... \n               the following comes over the air...\n\n                                     RADIO POLICE ANNOUNCER\n                         Calling car 125... car 125... go to \n                         vacant lot at Tenth and Elm... a \n                         woman walking around in her nightgown ---\n\n               Harpo drops the drill and makes a wild dash for door obviously \n               to go to the woman...

The sound of Chico's second \n               whistle coming over scene attracts Harpo, who lets go of the \n               covers and runs out of the room.\n\n               We pick him up outside of the room on balcony.

He lets down a rope ladder from \n               under the saddle, climbs the ladder, mounts the horse and \n               starts off.\n\n               DISSOLVE to CLOSE UP of Harpo riding at breakneck speed.  As \n               he looks grimly ahead he reaches down out of scene and brings \n               up a three-cornered colonial hat and puts it on his head.\n\n               DISSOLVE to a Moving Insert - Harpo bringing the horse to a \n               stop in front of a farm house.  He blows a blast on a regular \n               army bugle... immediately a few old men rush out of the house \n               in their nightgowns, carrying guns, and into the scene from \n               all directions rush other men, answering the call, similarly \n               attired.  Harpo starts his horse and we DISSOLVE to him \n               pulling up to another farm house.\n\n               This house has a single door on the extreme end of it and a \n               very large French window covering almost the rest of the \n               house.  Harpo stops and sounds the bugle call.  This time \n               there is no answer to his call.  He waits a second, then \n               turns his horse in the direction of the house and rides \n               through the single door.  After a short pause, the doors of \n               the French window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a \n               double bed which is on wheels.  Harpo is standing at the \n               foot of the bed, braced against the bedpost, holding the \n               reins.  There is an old couple, man and woman, fast asleep \n               in the bed - (This couple might be the blase gentleman and \n               young wife used by Peter Arno in his cartoons.)  After riding \n               a few feet Harpo leaps from the bed onto the horse's back \n               and rides off leaving the bed and its occupants on the road.\n\n               DISSOLVE to Harpo pulling up to another farm house.\n\n               He stops, sounds his bugle.  A very pretty young girl, in \n               her night clothes pokes her head out of the second story \n               window.  Harpo takes a good look at her, leaps off his horse \n               and dashes into the house.  A moment later he comes out of \n               the house with a feed bag and puts it on the horse's head....  \n               then he dashes back into the house again.  Almost instantly \n               he comes tearing out of the house, followed by an old geezer \n               in his nightgown, who is chasing him, with rifle in hand...\n\n               He fires a few shots -\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n                                   END OF SEQUENCE \"H\"\n\n                                       SEQUENCE \"J\"\n\n               DISSOLVE through the shooting of previous scene to STOCK \n               SHOT of artillery fire on battle field - a profile SHOT with \n               all the activity of an actual battle, but without an \n               indication of falling men.  DISSOLVE from this to interior \n               of Groucho's headquarters behind the front - a wooden shack.  \n               The sound of a distant booming of guns is heard over this \n               scene.
