Water\n     slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The\n     creaking of wood.\n\n     Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of\n     sirens.\n\n     SUDDENLY, a single match ignites and invades the darkness. It\n     quivers for a moment. A dimly lit hand brings the rest of the\n     pack to the match. A plume of yellow-white flame flares and\n     illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON, age forty. His\n     salty-gray hair is wet and matted. His face drips with water\n     or sweat. A large cut runs the length of his face from the\n     corner of his eye to his chin. It bleeds freely. An un-lit\n     cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.\n\n     In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a\n     large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. He sits\n     with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house.\n     His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. He\n     looks down.\n\n     A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the\n     darkness. Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of\n     matches before throwing them into the liquid.\n\n     The liquid IGNITES with a poof.\n\n     The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity.\n     It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck\n     towards the stern.                                                       \n\n<b>2     EXT.

They are stacked on\n     a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge\n     crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at\n     it's base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.\n\n     The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles\n     weakly to himself.\n\n     The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another\n     stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles out\n     pitifully with a hiss.\n\n     Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto the\n     deck from between them.\n\n<b>                                            BLUE 06/01/94\n</b>\n<b>                                                               2.\n</b>\nThe sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move over\nto where Keaton rests at the wheel house.\n\nCRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of\ncigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter\nfrom the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over\nthe flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and\nstrikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,\n\nsomewhat showy.\nKeaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses his\nface. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally\nresignation.\n\n<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>           How are you, Keaton?\n\n<b>                             KEATON\n</b>           I'd have to say my spine was broken,\n           Keyser.\n\nHe spits the name out like it was poison.\n\nThe man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under\nhis jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.\n\n<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>           Ready?\n\n<b>                             KEATON\n</b>           What time is it?\n\nThe hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on\nits wrist upward.\nThe sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.\n\n<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>           Twelve thirty.\n\nKeaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away and\ntakes another drag.\nThe hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy  \nhis last drag before pulling the trigger.\n\n<b>GUNSHOT\n</b>\nThe sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.\n\n<b>                                          YELLOW 06/11/94\n</b>\n\n<b>                                                             3.\n</b>\nMOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline\nstill flowing freely.\n\nThe sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front\nof us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle\naround the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking\nthe spouting stream as it pours from the hole.\n\nMOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.\n\nThe pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD\nBODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie\nscattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a\nfierce fire-fight.\n\n<b>A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.                                             \n</b>\nOn the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders.          \nThe mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon           \nbeneath its base.                                                    \n\n<b>MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.\n</b>\nSirens are close now.

The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled\n      pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right\n      foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It\n      is clear that the knee does not extend fully.\n\n      The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a\n      steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into\n      step with the first. Another steel door and another set of\n      feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet\n      walk single file down the hall.\n\n      The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to\n      another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and\n      rivets.\n\n<b>      CRANE UP TO REVEAL:\n</b>\n      ROGER KINT, VERBAL to his few friends. He has a deeply lined\n      face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best. From\n      his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a\n      slight but not debilitating palsy. Behind him are Dean\n      Keaton, Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney.                      t\n\n      Verbal steps through the door, followed by the rest.\n\n<b>                              VERBAL (V.O.)\n</b>                It didn't make sense that I be there.

One might note it's sturdy construction and it's\n     convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten\n     and disregarded notes and facts. Years of police trivia that\n     has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a\n     use for it all someday. One might want such a bulletin board\n     for one's self.

He finds a\n      picture of Rabin in the far corner. He stands beside a scale\n      in fishing gear. He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly\n      caught marlin. His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an\n      eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a\n      THREE HUNDRED POUND BLACK MAN. Kujan glazes over his name, it\n      is irrelevant. His aliases stand out.\n\n      Slavin, BRICKS, Shank, REDFOOT, Thee, Rooster...\n\n      KUJAN'S EYES WIDEN with sudden realization.

The\n      cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours.\n\n      Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words\n      printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the\n      cheap mug.\n\n<b>                           KOBAYASHI PORCELAIN.\n</b>\n<b>150   EXT.
