Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view\n     allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the\n     forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small\n     shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth\n     oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by\n     this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.\n\n\n\n2    <u>ED - CAR</u>\n\n\n     Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of\n     a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other\n     peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be\n     heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving\n     away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-\n     pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a\n     dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.\n\n\n\n3    <u>ID - CAR</u>\n\n\n     Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY\n     and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.\n     Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear \"Michigan State\" T-shirts,\n     and are students along with the others at that univer-\n     sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up\n     front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen\n     to an old \"Baby Moses And The Thrillers\" song on the\n     radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it\n     were a drum.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               (Singing with the music)...

Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-\n     mobile speeding along the narrow highway below.\n\n\n\n5    <u>ID - CAR</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY traces a route on the map with his finger.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               ...Which would put us...which would\n               put us...\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Jesus Christ, just tell us already\n               will ya?\n\n\n     ASHLY zeroes in on the map with his finger.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               ...Right...\n\n\n     SCOTT is growing impatient.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               ...Right...\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Yes?\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Here!\n\n\n     Suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks\n     from SCOTT's hand.\n\n\n\n6    <u>ED - CAR</u>\n\n\n     The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane.\n     A large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming\n     races toward the car on a collision coarse.\n\n\n\n7    <u>ID - CAR</u>\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               Scotty, watch out!\n\n\n\n8    <u>ED - CAR</u>\n\n\n     The truck races closer.\n\n\n\n9    <u>ID - CAR</u>\n\n\n     Their steering wheel is locked.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Turn!\n\n\n\n10   <u>ED - CAR</u>\n\n\n     At the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can\n     be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its\n     own lane.\n\n\n\n11   <u>ED - CAR</u>\n\n\n     The truck speeds harmlessly past them.\n\n\n\n12   <u>ID - CAR</u>\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Damn it Scott, what the hell was that?\n               You trying to kill us?\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Don't yell at me, it's your lousy\n               steering wheel.

Only thing\n               that works on the whole car is the\n               lousy horn.\n\n\n     SCOTT honks the horn.\n\n\n\n13   <u>ED - CAR</u>\n\n\n     Several local MEN walking down the highway respond to\n     the horn by waving.\n\n\n\n14   <u>ID - CAR</u>\n\n\n     SCOTT yells out the window at them.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Aw, go to hell, I'm not waving at ya!\n\n\n     He looks in the rear view mirror.

ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the\n     bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks.\n\n\n                         <u>ASHLY and LINDA</u>\n\n               ...With good friends.\n\n\n     They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY\n     tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of\n     LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes\n     the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite \"No,\n     thank you,\" then back up front to SCOTT.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Hey Scotty, what's this place like\n               anyway?\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Well, the guy that's renting it says\n               it's an old place, little run down,\n               but it's right up in the mountains-\n               totally secluded.

Carefully, the vehicle crosses.\n\n\n\n20   <u>ED - CAB</u>\n\n\n     It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their\n     destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by\n     thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-\n     ues to sputter and backfire.\n\n\n\n21   <u>ID - CAR</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY reacts to his car.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up.\n               but I'm just not paying for it.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               This place is perfect.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               The woods come awfully close to the\n               house don't they?\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               So what's wrong with the woods, they\n               can't bite ya.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               It's just a little claustrophobic\n               that's all.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Well, I think it's beautiful.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-\n               end.\n\n\n\n22   <u>ED - CAB</u>\n\n\n     SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds\n     a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the\n     door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               It's supposed to be one of these on\n               here.\n\n\n     After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.\n\n\n\n23   <u>ID - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT\n     opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway\n     for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.\n     The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings\n     made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,\n     and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set\n     into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently\n     in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door\n     in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed\n     containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon\n     the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap\n     door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Hey, this place has a dungeon.\n\n\n     CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over\n     to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing\n     the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring\n     to SHELLY.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Put these back will you?\n\n\n     SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the\n     hatch but cannot.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               They nailed it shut.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Good, I don't like cellars.

She repositions a balance weight, and it\n     begins to tick.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Ta daaaaaa!\n\n\n     The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.\n\n\n\n24   <u>ET - CAB</u>\n\n\n     The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.\n\n\n\n25   <u>IT - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She\n     is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the\n     ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil\n     and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-\n     ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-\n     ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can\n     see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-\n     mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the\n     room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale\n     white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.\n     She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some\n     unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch\n     a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open\n     window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the\n     drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now\n     retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale\n     cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks\n     up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some\n     form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.\n     She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping\n     of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns\n     to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-\n     sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.\n     Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from\n     the cellar.\n\n\n\n26   <u>IT - K/M.R.</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-\n     ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between\n     her and the trap door.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               What're you drawing Cheryl?\n\n\n     He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his\n     shoulder to glance at it.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               I...I don't know.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Is it a bible?\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               No, no it's no bible. (She glances\n               again at the cellar, knowing some-\n               thing is down there) I don't know\n               what it is.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Well, this one of the clock's not\n               bad.\n\n\n     LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock\n     with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to\n     the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She\n     is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL\n     wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front\n     of her to speak secretly.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               (In a whisper) I got it right here.\n\n\n     He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking\n     past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's\n     feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.\n     LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Cheryl, this is really good. I like\n               how you did the numbers in that wood-\n               ish style.\n\n\n     ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it\n     quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on\n     a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She\n     is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although\n     nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with\n     it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               (Still in a whisper) I knew you'd\n               like it.\n\n\n     Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his\n     lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-\n     rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back\n     on CHERYL's small drawing table.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               It's really good Cheryl. Very close\n               to the origional.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               (In a relieved whisper) Yes, very\n               close.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               I'm gonna check dinner.\n\n\n     LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               You better get washed up. I'll see\n               ya in there.\n\n\n     He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL\n     again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of\n     view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-\n     ing...waiting.\n\n\n\n27   <u>IT - K</u>\n\n\n     A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.\n     SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.\n\n\n\n28   <u>IT - D.R.</u>\n\n\n     She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner\n     table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA\n     and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               (In a whisper) Dead bodies in the\n               cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Will you stop it?\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Scott, leave her alone will ya?\n\n\n     SCOTT turns toward LINDA.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Will you relax, I'm just kidding\n               around. She can take a joke-\n\n\n     He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He\n     turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in\n     his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,\n     then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               (Jokingly) I'll get ya.\n\n\n     With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               I'll get ya for this Cheryl.\n\n\n     ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               I'd like to make a toast for all\n               here this evening.

CHERYL is slighly more nervous\n     than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               (Slowly) What is this?\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Whatever it is, it's still down there.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               I don't like cellars, let's close it\n               up. (She does not want to deal with\n               it) It's probably just some animal.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-\n               that's the stupidest thing I ever\n               heard in my life. Jesus Christ.\n\n\n     SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He\n     traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Maybe it is just some animal.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Yeah, probably right. It's probably\n               just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why\n               don't you make sure.\n\n\n     He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it\n     back.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Scotty, I'm not going down there!\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Scotty don't. You're crazy if you\n               go down there.

What courage! A kiss\n               my brave hero.\n\n\n     SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends\n     the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               I, your virgin queen eagerly await\n               the precious moment when you will\n               ascend.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-\n\n\n     He disappears below the floor.

ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,\n     lights the wick, and descends into the basement.\n\n\n\n30   <u>IN - C</u>\n\n\n     Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls\n     and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In\n     front of him stands an old door which leads to another\n     section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.\n     Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with\n     a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into\n     the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the\n     cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow\n     pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his\n     light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Scott?\n\n\n     ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from\n     the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into\n     a pair of arms which grab him.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Ahhhhhhh!\n\n\n     It is only SCOTT behind him.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               What the hell are you doing down\n               here, jerkin' off? How come you\n               didn't answer me?\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               When?\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Just now, I mean upstairs.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               I didn't hear you.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Oh well, did you find anything?\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Uh-uh.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               What's this?\n\n\n     SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals\n     several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,\n     he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort\n     of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the\n     cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover\n     a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and\n     other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.\n\n\n\n31   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.\n\n\n\n32   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking\n     quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed\n     around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once\n     this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man\n     is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Shhh, listen to this.\n\n\n                             <u>VOICE</u>\n\n               My name is Julian Knowby.

Here, I am\n               staying with my wife for a few weeks\n               so that I may continue my research un-\n               disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc-\n               iate professors and myself have been\n               excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I\n               believe I have made an important find\n               in that area, and thus the reason for\n               this log.

The first few pages that I have\n               translated warn that these demons are\n               dangerous, everpresent, and exist\n               primarily through this book. As legend\n               has it, only the sacred high priests\n               of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess\n               these books, for they alone could\n               properly control the resurrected de-\n               mons.

He glances behind to LINDA. She closes CHERYL's\n     door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the\n     box in his hand. She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens\n     his eyes to watch. LINDA looks at him, but his eyes are\n     closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. LINDA\n     turns her attention back to the box. ASHLY watches again\n     wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand. Quickly,\n     LINDA turns to him but as expected, ASHLY is sleeping\n     like a baby. She begins to turn back toward the box\n     and ASHLY opens his eyes, but LINDA turns back again\n     in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Ah ha!\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               (Laughing) Stealing from the blind\n               eh?

Through the outside window, ASHLY and\n     LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them\n     moves around the house to another window. The silhouette\n     of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force\n     continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside,\n     she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a\n     moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window.\n     She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks\n     at it, then out to the dark woods.\n\n\n\n44   <u>IN - C.B.</u>\n\n\n     CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the\n     same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A\n     noise almost like that of something breathing.\n\n\n\n45   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL\n     walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be\n     seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind\n     shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering\n     about.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               (Calling to the woods) Is anybody\n               out there?\n\n\n     There is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage\n     toward the woods.\n\n\n\n46   <u>EN - W</u>\n\n\n     The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive.\n     CHERYL stops.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               I know someone's out there...I\n               heard you...I heard you in the cellar.\n\n\n     Suddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms\n     around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening.\n     There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind\n     blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest\n     a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can\n     be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows\n     somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of\n     something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth\n     again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin\n     when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty\n     yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.\n     Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She\n     turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,\n     leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then,\n     all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry\n     of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap\n     around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches\n     near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now\n     moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to\n     break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges\n     from the woods and into the clearing. The force is\n     still following.\n\n\n\n47   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked. She\n     begins pounding upon the door.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Help, help, let me in.

Open up!\n\n\n     CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where\n     SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran-\n     tically jams one key after another into the lock, but\n     still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer\n     with each key.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Please, someone please!

She bends\n     down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is\n     SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She\n     pushes him in the door and slams it tightly.\n\n\n\n48   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               What the hell happ-\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               (In hysterics) It...it tried to kill\n               me.

SCOTT enters the cabin and\n     passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side\n     of the fireplace. He throws a log in, and heads back\n     outside.\n\n\n\n56   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     From inside, LINDA speaks.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Cheryl, wanna play some cards?\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               (Turning with a smile) Uh-uh.\n\n\n     CHERYL turns to face the window again.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find\n               some way around that cliff into town\n               okay?\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Okay.\n\n\n     Outside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights\n     fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with\n     the ear plug.\n\n\n                             <u>VOICE</u>\n\n               March 12th. Suzanne came after me\n               and almost murdered me. My own wife.\n               At first I thought it was a mental\n               or physical disorder because of what\n               had happened to her eyes, but I was\n               only fooling myself. I knew what it\n               was.\n\n\n     Outside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather\n     wood.

Finally, in\n               desperation I dragged her out to the\n               shed and dismembered her so that what-\n               ever it was could not get up again.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               Cheryl, did you see that?\n\n\n     CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the\n     window.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               Try this one.\n\n\n     She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Okay, lemme think, uh...\n\n\n     She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-\n     ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               ...Um, it's a seven.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               Oh my God, what suit?\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Diamonds, no wait!

I should\n               have never tampered with the \"Book\n               Of The Dead.\" I now know that what-\n               ever it is I have resurrected through\n               this book, is coming for me.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               You know, I always thought I had\n               some sort of extra sense.

She holds\n     up another card.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Four of hearts.\n\n\n     The card is a four of hearts. SHELLY bites her lip in\n     fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen\n     in silence.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Eight of spades.\n\n\n     SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Two of spades- jack of diamonds-\n               jack of clubs-\n\n\n     Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY\n     can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward\n     the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of\n     cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor.\n     CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about\n     like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un-\n     like her own.\n\n\n                             <u>CHERYL</u>\n\n               Why have you disturbed our sleep,\n               awakened us from our ancient slum-\n               ber? You will die. Like the others\n               before you. We will take you one by\n               one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-\n\n\n     She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the\n     floor.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here!\n\n\n     SHELLY does not respond.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Hurry!\n\n\n     She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL\n     and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but\n     behind her, she reaches for a pen.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Did you see her eyes? I'm scared.\n               What's wrong with her?\n\n\n     ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               What happened to her?\n\n\n     CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly.\n\n\n                             <u>LINDA</u>\n\n               Look at her eyes.\n\n\n     SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them,\n     but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward,\n     then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon.\n     LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied\n     pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping\n     her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining\n     arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin\n     floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting\n     him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book-\n     case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight.\n     SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward\n     ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull\n     himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when\n     SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses\n     him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to\n     his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above\n     ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the\n     jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA\n     and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She\n     begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut\n     upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push\n     the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top\n     and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the\n     butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented\n     screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand\n     is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the\n     chain across the hatch.\n\n\n\n57   <u>IN - LB</u>\n\n\n     Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping.\n     ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks\n     to the door, closing it quietly behind him.\n\n\n\n58   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in\n     the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and\n     laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's\n     breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her\n     breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               She'll be okay Ash, she just took a\n               bad bump.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               (Quietly) Yeah.\n\n\n     SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below\n     as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               We've still got a few hours before\n               morning.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               I don't know if I can wait that\n               long.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               You have to. We all have to. Then,\n               once it's light out, we'll try to\n               find a way to get around that chasm.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               (Covering her ears) Why does she keep\n               making those horrible noises?\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               I don't know.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               And what about her eyes?\n\n\n     ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               What about her eyes? (Desperately)\n               For God's sake what happened to\n               her eyes?!\n\n\n     CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a\n     streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the\n     trap door. Her head is slightly tilted as she watches\n     and listens to what is said above. From her point of\n     view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Everything's gonna be all right.\n\n\n     CHERYL's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow\n     liquid drools out between her teeth. She grins.\n\n\n\n59   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     Outside, the forest is very dark. The unseen force moves\n     from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs\n     as it advances. The cottage comes into view and the evil\n     entity glides up to it. The figure of a girl in the cabin\n     window can be seen looking out. The force stops and moves\n     behind a bush.\n\n\n\n60   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     Inside, SHELLY is studying the woods.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               Scotty, I...I think there's some-\n               thing out there.\n\n\n     SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out.\n\n\n\n61   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     From within the woods, this force watches SCOTT peer out,\n     but he can see nothing. Through the window he says some-\n     thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away.\n\n\n\n62   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     Inside, SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               ...Is to get some rest.

Come\n               morning- you'll see.\n\n\n     SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the\n     fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with\n     the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY\n     glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock.\n     It stands silent.\n\n\n\n63   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees\n     SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another.\n     She begins to undress near the window. The force now\n     moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous\n     speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window.\n     She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream\n     stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.\n\n\n\n64   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the\n     small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places\n     the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Shelly, are you okay?\n\n\n     She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns\n     to ASHLY.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute.\n\n\n\n65   <u>IN - S.B.</u>\n\n\n     SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing\n     amidst the shadows.\n\n\n<b>                             SCOTT\n</b>\n               Shelly?\n\n\n     He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows\n     upon the curtains.\n\n\n\n66   <u>IN - S. BATH</u>\n\n\n     SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the\n     shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Shelly?\n\n\n     He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT\n     turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the\n     doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT.\n     Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's\n     face and clothes with her nails.\n\n\n\n67   <u>IN - S.B.</u>\n\n\n     Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY\n     still upon him biting at his throat.\n\n\n\n68   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to\n     knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace. She\n     remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot\n     coals. SCOTT rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her\n     out. SHELLY's face and hair on one side of her head are\n     seared and blackened. She blinks her eyes open, turns\n     her charred head to SCOTT, and speaks in a rasp.\n\n\n                             <u>SHELLY</u>\n\n               Thank you. I don't know what I would\n               have done if I had remained on the hot\n               coals burning my pretty flesh. You\n               have pretty skin- give it to us!\n\n\n     Cackling, SHELLY clutches SCOTT's neck and begins throttl-\n     ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip. He tries\n     to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with\n     a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-\n     ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from\n     SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up\n     the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat\n     with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.\n     ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT\n     grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings\n     his camping knife from its side sheath and slices\n     deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.\n     A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits\n     an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's\n     throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches\n     terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling\n     hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and\n     bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor\n     with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now\n     almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the\n     dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming\n     the blade into her spine.\n\n     SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the\n     old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all\n     at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her\n     remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife\n     protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours\n     from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY\n     stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.\n     Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes\n     about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-\n     ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to\n     his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Ahhhhhhh!\n\n\n     Some force reanimates her, even though the body is\n     dead.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               No...no...no...\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Hit her!\n\n\n     SHELLY's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet,\n     and laughing madly.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Hit it!\n\n\n     SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands\n     with the axe, paralyzed. Gurgling black ooze, SHELLY\n     advances toward them with one remaining arm. SCOTT\n     grabs the axe from ASHLY, pushes him away and slams\n     it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and\n     CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe\n     down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the\n     final chop, there is silence.\n\n     SHELLY's body remains on the floor for quite some time-\n     until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and\n     something must be done.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Uh...Scott.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Yeah.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               What is uh...what are we gonna do?\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Bury her.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               You...can't bury Shelly.

He re-\n     moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. As he does\n     this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-\n     credible speed. ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still\n     sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with\n     white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. She lets\n     out a low growl.\n\n\n\n82   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through\n     the front door. He steps outside and stops to look back\n     in. He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to\n     see in LINDA's room, being lost in the shadows. Something\n     ragged and bloody grabs him. It is SCOTT's mutilated\n     body ripped and torn to shreds. He is still alive. ASHLY\n     looks behind him through the door to LINDA's room. He\n     can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching\n     him with glaring white eyes. ASHLY helps SCOTT to the\n     couch so he can sit.

CHERYL in the cellar joins in\n     the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but\n     she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on\n     the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety\n     and places the barrels against LINDA's head.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               God forgive me Linda.\n\n\n     The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal.

I- I know it's bad.\n               But I can't be alone now, I can't.\n               I'd lose my mind.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               Please Ash, please.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               You'll get better- you'll see.\n\n\n     LINDA's laughter is faintly heard outside. ASHLY moves\n     to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no\n     longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-\n     ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be\n               better and we'll both get out of\n               here tomorrow.\n\n\n                             <u>SCOTT</u>\n\n               There is no tomorrow! You- you've\n               got to kill her and cut- cut her\n               up- your sister too.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               No, that was only with Shelly. You\n               had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves\n               me. You're delirious- I...I'll get\n               you some water.\n\n\n     ASHLY places a glass to Scott's lips.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Now, now the sun will be up in an\n               hour or so and we'll get out of here\n               ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly-\n               n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go\n               home together. Wouldn't you like to\n               be going home? You'd like that I'd\n               bet, wouldn't ya?\n\n\n     There is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of\n     his mouth.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               ...Scott.\n\n\n     SCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY\n     walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There\n     is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the\n     Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting\n     his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs\n     her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it.\n     She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs\n     her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against\n     SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled\n     arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and\n     grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm\n     so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY\n     pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-\n     ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The\n     blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach.\n     Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in\n     a deep growl once, then all is quiet.\n\n     ASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of\n     SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below,\n     through the back door and out to the work shed.\n\n\n\n85   <u>IN - W.S.</u>\n\n\n     He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body\n     to it with a number of chains which hang from nails\n     along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the\n     wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves\n     toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a\n     position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks\n     into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He\n     turns off the saw.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               (In a whisper) Linda...\n\n\n     He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's\n     body.\n\n\n\n86   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the\n     shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial.\n     He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel.\n     Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create\n     strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's\n     grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of\n     her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel\n     and looks at her. She appears to be dead.\n\n\n\n87   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists\n     against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants\n     out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to\n     loosen.\n\n\n\n88   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to\n     CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.\n\n\n\n89   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the\n     trap door in tact.\n\n\n\n90   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on\n     top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up\n     when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and\n     grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-\n     ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied\n     hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she\n     will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out\n     of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's\n     leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large\n     log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again\n     and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs\n     the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him\n     up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY\n     hits the ground with considerable force and for the\n     first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing\n     he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's\n     nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on\n     the ground.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Stay back.\n\n\n     His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA\n     advances toward him, laughing.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Linda please, if you can still hear\n               me. Keep away.\n\n\n     His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream,\n     she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the\n     spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into\n     the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-\n     ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from\n     her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from\n     underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.\n     He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace\n     upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and\n     staggers back to the cabin.\n\n\n\n91   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               Oh.....\n\n\n     It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open\n     and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.\n     A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing\n     SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the\n     rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.\n\n\n\n92   <u>IN - S.B.</u>\n\n\n     He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs\n     back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward\n     it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only\n     clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of\n     the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him.\n     He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL\n     backs away and spots the open front door.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               The door...\n\n\n     He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.\n\n\n\n93   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.\n\n\n\n94   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door.\n\n\n\n95   <u>IN - MR</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started\n     reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams\n     his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard\n     as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam\n     the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-\n     ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to\n     the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is\n     his last shell.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               (To himself) More shells. Where did\n               I see that box of shells?\n\n\n\n96   <u>IN - C</u>\n\n\n     From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY\n     decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his\n     weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks\n     himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway\n     beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds\n     the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.\n     He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.\n\n\n\n97   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks\n     up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-\n     wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,\n     ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows\n     louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he\n     fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind\n     whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the\n     floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for\n     something to happen. He is tense and more determined\n     than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why\n               are you torturing me like this?\n\n     Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something\n     in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's\n     necklace.\n\n\n                             <u>ASHLY</u>\n\n               ...Linda. (He whispers)\n\n\n     The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest\n     sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through\n     the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to\n     the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.\n     CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole\n     in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and\n     fires at her head.\n\n\n\n98   <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL\n     is jolted from the door.\n\n\n\n99   <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in\n     the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens\n     its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He\n     turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.\n     Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it\n     across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into\n     his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several\n     steps, then continues after ASHLY.\n\n\n\n100  <u>EN - CAB</u>\n\n\n     Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.\n\n\n\n101  <u>IN - M.R.</u>\n\n\n     ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of\n     The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at\n     SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer.\n     The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges\n     of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY\n     and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The\n     front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY\n     brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL\n     breaks through the front door and begins to push the\n     dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-\n     ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and\n     slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and\n     his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its\n     pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and\n     enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from\n     the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto\n     the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives\n     him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent\n     sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with\n     her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl-\n     ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the\n     book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back-\n     ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her\n     clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker.\n     ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's\n     necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp\n     toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls\n     him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a\n     last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the\n     final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as\n     ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls\n     the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and\n     tosses it upon the blaze.\n\n     CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in\n     a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL\n     as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods.\n     The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks\n     into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The\n     bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward\n     upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering\n     heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing\n     and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies\n     once were.\n\n     The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly\n     climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open-\n     ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force\n     retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the\n     darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural\n     sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as\n     Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam\n     over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally\n     come.\n\n\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Evil Dead</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Sam Raimi\" title=\"Scripts by Sam Raimi\">Sam Raimi</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Evil Dead Script.html#comments\" title=\"Evil Dead comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:04:55.330743"}
