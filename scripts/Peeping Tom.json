Nothing to be alarmed about. It \n               might be a small contented motor.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT\n\n               LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing \n               professionally alone at the end of the street.\n\n               It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling \n               'Stardust' merrily to herself.\n\n               CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.\n\n               We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - \n               haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.\n\n               As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then \n               turns round for a better look.\n\n               Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the \n               man's.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still \n               young enough to need two glances at the customers.\n\n               She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She \n               hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... \n               and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed \n               at.\n\n                                     DORA\n                         It'll be two quid...\n\n               Evidently we have two quid.  \n\n               She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, \n               jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.\n\n               CAMERA TRACKS after her.  Overlaid is the sound of the \n               man's footsteps.\n\n               Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the \n               man who is following her.\n\n               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT\n\n               A wider street than the last - but just as empty.  \n\n               Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS \n               at a respectful distance.\n\n               CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin.  \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the \n               dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film.  CAMERA \n               PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.\n\n               Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - \n               glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs. \n\n               CAMERA TRACKS after her.\n\n               She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - \n               under his breath - does the Man who is following her.  \n\n               A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the \n               stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great \n               curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera.\n\n               Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.\n\n               INT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside.\n\n               INT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, \n               lights the gas fire  then turns round.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling.\n\n               And suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound.\n\n               CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with \n               great curiosity.\n\n               It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to \n               fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have \n               it.\n\n               Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her \n               mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.\n\n               The sound purrs on.\n\n                                                              FADE OUT: \n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE\n\n               The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone \n               at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA - \n               and smile at us.\n\n               We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK \n               AND WHITE.\n\n               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour.\n\n               INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               A darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images \n               are in BLACK AND WHITE.  \n\n               We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently \n               over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is \n               breathing quickly.\n\n               We see Dora's hips waggling their way home.\n\n               The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen.\n\n               When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two-\n               toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing \n               her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us.\n\n               WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then \n               backing away from CAMERA in fear.\n\n               WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long \n               race.\n\n               As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across \n               her face - the title:\n\n                                      PEEPING TOM\n\n               Blots out what is happening to her.\n\n               OTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands \n               pushing something away.\n\n               Before the DIRECTOR'S CREDIT:\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. A PARK - NIGHT\n\n               It is very dark.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs.\n\n               Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S.\n\n               They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant \n               shaft of light is trained onto them.\n\n               Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.\n\n               CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor \n               purring... a blinding spotlight.\n\n               CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is \n               overlaid.\n\n               The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light.\n\n               He advances towards the tree.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Hey, you peeping...\n\n               The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps \n               running away \u0097 and the night is at peace again.\n\n               And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               LONG SHOT. AMBULANCE - DAY\n\n               It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house.\n\n               WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.\n\n               EXT.

She is on a couch, lying on her stomach \n               at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her \n               face and naked shoulders.\n\n               From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated \n               camera.\n\n                                     MILLY\n                         Well, can you?\n\n               Mark's voice is MUFFLED under the hood.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         ...think so, Milly.\n\n                                     MILLY\n                         Then be quick about it, sonny!

He is standing by the side of the \n               camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote-\n               control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several \n               lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks \n               back under the hood.\n\n                                     MILLY\n                         There he goes again!

Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. \n               A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom \n               they are singing:\n\n                                     YOUNG PEOPLE\n                              (singing)\n                         Happy birthday to you, \n                         Happy birthday to you,\n\n               CAMERA TRACKS towards them.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of TONY HUNTER, a well-built youngster in his \n               middle twenties.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         Happy birthday... dear Helen\n\n               He obviously means it.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         happy birthday to you.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'.

Someone switches on a gramophone and \n               the young couples start dancing at once.

MARK'S HOUSE - EVENING - LOW SUN\n\n               The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window. \n               From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key \n               of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly \n               the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's \n               shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with \n               the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling \n               as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS \n               BACK with him.\n\n               We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but \n               with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious \n               street.\n\n               Mark hurries towards a side entrance.\n\n               INT.

REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The lights are on.\n\n               WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which \n               leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard. \n               Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.\n\n               INT. HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the \n               door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party \n               fills the hall.\n\n               Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door \n               opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:\n\n                                     HELEN (O.S.)\n                         Excuse me!\n\n               Mark hesitates, then turns round. \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - smiling at him.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         I don't know how many times we've \n                         passed each other on the stairs?\n\n               Mark looks at her as if he does.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         ... but tonight I'm determined at \n                         least to say hello to you!

MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               His cine-projector points straight at us.  A flickering \n               light shines in our eyes. We can see him crouching behind \n               the projector.\n\n               Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... \n               Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing \n               very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from \n               downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp.\n\n               There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it.  \n\n               CAMERA PANS to the door of the room. It is blacked-out \n               like a photographic dark-room. The knock is repeated.  \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He switches off the projector instantly.\n\n               CAMERA PANS to an open cupboard in the corner.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of the shelves.

He has a pleasant, \n               normally untidy bedsitting room.\n\n               He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries \n               to the door.

For a moment the screen is \n               in darkness. A dark-room darkness.\n\n               INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               We can HEAR - faintly \u0097 the dance music from downstairs.  \n               There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in \n               diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.\n\n               As certain events of possible interest are to take place \n               in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.\n\n               The room is the product of three rooms which have been \n               knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well \n               constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a \n               laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, \n               and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The \n               two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched \n               all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting \n               in the light.\n\n               In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a \n               'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There \n               are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of \n               equipment above the 'dry'.\n\n               This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning \n               in the ceiling above the benches.\n\n               The other part of the room has a window at the far end of \n               it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.\n\n               Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the \n               16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots \n               light this part of the room. There is a small control panel \n               on the wall.  \n\n               Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. \n               All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.\n\n               There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone \n               except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid \n               for it all.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, \n               watching Helen.\n\n               From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes \n               as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. \n               For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch \n               on the wall.

As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's \n               finger automatically wags back.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Baden looking at his watch.

Back at two!\n\n               Baden walks out without a word to anyone. A hubbub of \n               chatter breaks out.

ENTRANCE TO SET - DAY\n\n               A Constable is standing outside the entrance to the set.  \n               From his POV WE SEE the Inspector and Mark approach.  The \n               Constable stiffens...

COURTYARD - DAY\n\n               The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone \n               in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of \n               Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round \n               carefully, then slips inside.\n\n               INT. STAGE E. - DAY\n\n               Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond \n               this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this \n               yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the \n               furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can \n               faintly be heard coming from this set. \n\n               Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to \n               the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb \n               the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark \n               moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above \n               the Policemen.\n\n               Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.\n\n               Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the \n               Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into \n               an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark \n               raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo \n               round the studio.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is \n               sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt. \n\n               Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the \n               Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and \n               nodding.\n\n               A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.\n\n                                     DOCTOR (O.S.)\n                         No doubt at all... wounds were \n                         caused by the same instrument...\n\n               Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). \n               The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the \n               finder over the lid of the trunk.\n\n                                     DOCTOR (O.S.)\n                         ... both women... subjected to the \n                         most violent shock...\n\n                                     INSPECTOR (O.S.)\n                         What sort of shock?\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         ...still cannot determine - but \n                         look!\n\n               He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's \n               eye-line.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.\n\n               He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his \n               head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them \n               shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. \n               They make three separate landings.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up.\n\n               From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...\n\n                                     INSPECTOR\n                         Quiet, everyone.  Please...\n\n               The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the \n               normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete \n               silence.\n\n               Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... \n               And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own \n               minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. \n               The Inspector listens intently.\n\n                                     DETECTIVE\n                         I thought I heard a putty cat!\n\n               There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.\n\n                                     INSPECTOR\n                         I don't want to spoil anyone's \n                         fun, but we do have a maniac on \n                         our hands, and if we don't get him \n                         quickly there'll be a third unsolved \n                         murder to report to the \n                         Commissioner. So let's hurry things \n                         up, shall we?\n\n                                     DETECTIVE\n                         Sorry, Chief!\n\n               The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the \n               trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, \n               we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high \n               in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no \n               one else is. The flashlight dies away.  \n\n               The scene fades with it.  \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of a knitting-needle held upwards.\n\n               Another knitting-needle scales down it like a fireman \n               descending a ladder.\n\n               CAMERA PULLS BACK\n\n               INT.

The screen grows dark - and \n               the dark-room grows out of it.\n\n               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into \n               a box. A small motor drives it.  CLOSE SHOT of the box. \n               Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. \n               Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image.\n\n               CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image.\n\n               Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the \n               film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and \n               hurries out with it.\n\n               Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts \n               the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, \n               then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.  \n\n               Behind him something moves in the shadows \n\n               REVERSE SHOT of Mark.  \n\n               Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the \n               shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching \n               on the screen.\n\n               HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY -\n\n               From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow. \n               He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at \n               the shadows at the back of the room.\n\n               Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector.  \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand - switching on the light.  Mark \n               turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he \n               can be.\n\n               CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room.  \n\n               Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand \n               rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare \n               unerringly towards the light switch.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Good evening, Mark...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         ...how did you?\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         The young man bathing himself \n                         brought me to your door... I managed \n                         the rest of the adventure alone...\n\n               He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless. \n               Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares \n               at her. The only movement in the room is her smile.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         This is one room I expected to \n                         find locked.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I was never allowed a key..., can't \n                         get used to them.\n\n               Mrs. Stephens' sightless eyes stare at him.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I brought her home early.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of her hand - tightening on the heavy stick.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Thank you...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Is there something you...\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         ... a talk.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Next door would be more...\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         I'm at home here... I visit this \n                         room every night.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Visit?\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         The blind always live in the rooms \n                         they live under...\n\n               Mark nods.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Every night you pace for hours \n                         above my head! Why?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I've no one to talk to... in the \n                         rooms I live over...\n\n               Mrs. Stephens nods. Her hand touches the black cloth loading \n               bag, lying on the table.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         I'm told that you stare too much... \n                         so do I.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of her hand - touching the black cloth bag. \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - walking slowly towards her. \n\n               At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards \n               him.  \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a \n               sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on \n               Mark's camera.\n\n               Mark stares at the stick, fascinated.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the \n               black cloth bag with her free hand.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Cloth... with something hard inside \n                         it...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         It's a changing bag... we put films \n                         in it - so that the light won't \n                         spoil them...\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         How odd - that the light can spoil \n                         anything...\n\n               The screen greys out.\n\n               In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's \n               projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very \n               faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Every night you switch on that \n                         film machine.\n\n               We hear his tiny intake of breath.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         What are these films you can't \n                         wait to look at?\n\n               The sound of his footsteps softly approaching.  Like a \n               chair?\n\n                                     MARK (O.S.)\n                         Like a chair?\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)\n                         What is the film you're showing \n                         now?\n\n               Very faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath.  \n\n               FADE IN: \n\n               The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal.  \n\n               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick \n               in front of her.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Why don't you lie to me? I'd never \n                         know...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         You'd know at once -\n\n               Mrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the \n               16mm screen.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Take me to your cinema.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Yes.\n\n               He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us.\n\n               Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - \n               her face only inches from the screen - the light from the \n               projector flickering on to her.  \n\n               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches \n               out her hands and touches the screen.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         What am I seeing, Mark?\n\n               Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but \n               between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's \n               terrified eyes.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Why don't you answer?\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Mrs. Stephens.\n\n                                     MARK\n                              (staring at the \n                              screen)\n                         It's no good - I was afraid it \n                         wouldn't be.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         What?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         The lights failed too soon.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                              (pause)\n                         They always do.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I'll have to try again.\n\n               He hurries to his cine-camera.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         I've yet to meet an artist who \n                         could judge his own work...\n\n               Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         What do you think you've spoiled?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         An opportunity... now I must find \n                         another.\n\n               He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. \n               A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses \n               another switch, and then another, until the whole of her \n               face is shining with light.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Why are you putting those lights \n                         on my face?\n\n               He walks towards her. She starts to back away.\n\n               The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE \n               SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod.  \n\n               Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world.  \n\n               WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than \n               we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog \n               which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching... \n               the purring changes direction.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)\n                         Mark...\n\n                                     MARK (O.S.)\n                         It's almost over...\n\n               The purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud.\n\n               FADE IN: \n\n               Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped \n               her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from \n               her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly \n               on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her \n               face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Please let me finish! It's for \n                         Helen!\n\n               She edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks \n               it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then \n               carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it \n               tightly.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         What do you mean? It's for Helen?\n\n                                     MARK\n                         She wants to see something I've \n                         photographed!\n\n                 He returns excitedly to his camera.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         My daughter sees enough of my face \n                         without photographs...\n\n               On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her \n               hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.\n\n                                     MARK (O.S.)\n                         Please... don't be frightened.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         Not frightened! Hot!\n\n               But it is fear that we are looking at.\n\n                                     MRS. STEPHENS\n                         So put that camera away...\n\n               On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips \n               nervously.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Yes!\n\n               He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the \n               tripod.

CAR - DAY\n\n               Through the windscreen WE SEE the entrance to the studio. \n               The driver glances round at his passenger whose face is \n               completely obscured by the book. All WE CAN SEE is a shock \n               of white hair protruding above\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         We're there, Doctor.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                              (to Sergeant on \n                              gate)\n                         Dr Rosen!  What a pity.\n\n               He continues reading. The car enters the studio.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. STAGE E. - DAY\n\n               The (studio) camera is ready for a tracking shot. The set \n               is redressed as the Hat Department of the store. The \n               Inspector stands on the dolly, looking round with interest.  \n\n               The Doctor is sitting in a chair watching everything like \n               an excited schoolboy. The Sergeant has positioned himself \n               near the sound crew.  \n\n               Baden walks on to the set, his arm round Diane's shoulder. \n               He is talking to her softly. She keeps her eyes on the \n               floor; he leads her to the front of the studio camera.\n\n                                     BADEN\n                         Try it, darling... We'll all be \n                         with you.\n\n               He pats her arm reassuringly. The Chief Cameraman nods to \n               Mark.\n\n               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark pull a tape measure \n               from the front of the camera and hold it to Diane's \n               forehead. From Mark's POV WE SEE the Inspector watching \n               him over the top of the studio camera. A man with a shock \n               of white hair is also watching him... and the Sergeant \n               stares at him from the other side of the set. The tape \n               measure in Mark's hand remains steady.\n\n               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark replace the tape \n               measure and take up his position on a small stool by the \n               side of the camera.\n\n                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n                              (shouting)\n                         Quiet, everyone. Let's run it!\n\n               The Doctor sneezes violently - and all heads turn towards \n               him.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Terribly sorry.\n\n               In the nervous laughter that follows, the Assistant \n               Cameraman whispers to the Chief Cameraman.\n\n                                     ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN\n                         That sneezer geezer's a \n                         psychiatrist!...

WE SEE Mark swing out into space on his stool, \n               turning the handle of the focus-puller. Diane approaches \n               the hat counter. The Assistant smiles at her.\n\n                                     DIANE\n                         I'd like to see... that one...\n\n               The Assistant hands her a hat. Diane tries it on.\n\n                                     DIANE\n                         ... have you it... in red...?\n\n                                     ASSISTANT\n                         Certainly, madam.\n\n                                     DIANE\n                         ... in... red\n                              (suddenly she covers \n                              her face in her \n                              hands')\n                         I can't! I can't, Arthur!\n\n               She bursts into tears and runs off the set. From the \n               Inspector's POV WE SEE Baden whisper to the Assistant \n               Director - then hurry after Diane.\n\n                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n                         Ten minutes break, everyone!\n\n               The unit dissolves into small, chattering groups. The \n               Assistant Director hurries up to the Doctor.\n\n                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n                         Can you suggest anything, Doctor?\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         No. It looked jolly interesting to \n                         me.\n\n                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n                         I mean to help her \n                         psychologically...\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Yes. Give the girl a proper rest... \n                         Ten minutes is useless!\n\n                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR\n                              (hastily)\n                         Thank you, Doctor.\n\n               He bustles off and the Doctor is left alone. He glances \n               round thoughtfully.\n\n               From the Doctor's POV WE SEE the small, chattering groups. \n               Then we see Mark standing a few yards away, watching him. \n               The Doctor smiles at him pleasantly.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         What's your job?  \n\n                                     MARK\n                         I'm a focus-puller...\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Oh... so am I, in a way.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I was wondering if you knew my \n                         father - Professor Lewis...\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Professor... but of course I knew \n                         him. He lectured to me.\n\n               He looks at Mark with renewed interest. So does the \n               Inspector.\n\n               From his POV WE SEE Mark and the Doctor talking. The Doctor \n               is fidgeting with his watch chain. Mark fidgets with his \n               jacket button. The Inspector then glances towards the Hat \n               Salesman, who is holding court in the comer. We return to \n               Mark and the Doctor.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         He was an extraordinary man - quite \n                         brilliant!\n\n                                     MARK\n                         You know what he was interested in \n                         before he died?\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         No?

The Sergeant edges \n               up to the Inspector.\n\n                                     SERGEANT\n                         Wonder what all that's about?\n\n                                     INSPECTOR\n                         We'll find out afterwards...

Mark picks \n               up his camera - then reaches for the lunch basket.

The Clapper Boy is standing there. The \n               Clapper Boy glances round carefully. The Inspector and \n               Sergeant are wandering casually towards the door.\n\n                                     CLAPPER BOY\n                         Can't wait to show you this!\n                              (bringing out a \n                              small postcard)\n                         I ought to charge you!  \n\n               He winks at Mark, gives him the postcard.  \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of the postcard.

She has her coat on.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Darling...\n\n               She shakes her mother's shoulders. Mrs. Stephens snores \n               on.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Darling.\n\n               She shakes her again \u0097 but it is hopeless. Helen pulls the \n               bedclothes round her mother, then turns away. She picks up \n               a large envelope and her handbag, and hurries to the door.\n\n               INT. PASSAGE. MARK'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Helen walks towards the stairs. The door of Tony's room \n               opens, and he pokes his head round.\n\n                                     TONY\n                         Hallo.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Hallo, Tony...\n\n                                     TONY\n                         Where are you going?\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         To leave something for Mark...\n\n                                     TONY\n                         You haven't much time for me these \n                         days.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Tony...\n\n                                     TONY\n                         It's all right - I'll be here - if \n                         you want me.\n                              (he turns to his \n                              room)\n                         ... by the way... your mother was \n                         yelling out something before you \n                         came in... about Mark photographing \n                         her.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Photographing Mother?

See you sometime.\n\n               He goes into his room, closing the door. She stares after \n               him for a moment, then hurries up the stairs.\n\n               INT. PASSAGE BY MARK'S ROOM - DAY\n\n               Helen knocks on the door.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Mark...?\n\n               No answer. She knocks again, then opens the door and goes \n               inside.\n\n               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Helen enters and glances towards the door of the dark-room.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Mark?  No answer. She looks \n                         thoughtfully at the envelope in \n                         her hand - then goes in to the \n                         dark-room.\n\n               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM\n\n               Helen fumbles for a switch... she finds one and presses \n               it. A spotlight falls on Mark's projector, throwing its \n               shadow on to the dazzling white screen. Helen smiles, and \n               walks towards the projector.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Taxi arrives and Mark gets out.\n\n               INT. POLICE PHONE BOOTH - EARLY EVENING\n\n                                     DETECTIVE\n                         ... don't know what to make of it, \n                         sir ... He went to a library, a \n                         solicitor's office, and a \n                         newsagent's shop - private \n                         photography there, if you ask me. \n                         Shall I hang around outside the \n                         house, sir? Don't think so, \n                         either... All right, sir, I'll \n                         give you the details when I get \n                         back... Bye, sir.\n                              (he replaces the \n                              receiver)\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She is standing by the projector, \n               holding her envelope thoughtfully.\n\n               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM\n\n               She smiles suddenly and opens her envelope. She takes out \n               a bound manuscript. We see a label on the manuscript: The \n               Magic Camera by Helen Stephens. She takes a pencil from \n               her pocket, and opens the manuscript. Then she sits at \n               Mark's table and writes a note on the flyleaf. The projector \n               is at her elbow.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               A telephone by a man's elbow. It rings.\n\n               INT. SCOTLAND YARD - EVENING\n\n               The Chief Inspector snatches up the telephone.\n\n                                     CHIEF INSPECTOR\n                         Chief Inspector Gregg!

Did you \n                         say news...?\n\n               He slams down the receiver, and jumps to his feet.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. ROAD - EVENING\n\n               An empty taxi cruising down the street. It passes the \n               Detective in the raincoat walking away from Mark's house.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of a note on a flyleaf which reads 'From one \n               Magic Camera - which needs the help of Another'.\n\n               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the \n               side of the projector. She turns to leave - then looks \n               curiously at the projector.  \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - hesitating. Like a small girl in \n               front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector \n               tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. A \n               beam of light shoots out. We watch Helen's face as she \n               looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - \n               then something starts to happen to the comers of her \n               mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot \n               stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of \n               her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to \n               stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps \n               on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, \n               she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards \n               the door.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing there - watching her.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen staring at him... again we hear that \n               sound from the back of her throat. He looks away from her \n               at once.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Don't let me see you... \n                         frightened...\n                              (he pushes the door \n                              wide open...)\n                         Leave!\n                              (he looks at her - \n                              then looks quickly \n                              away)\n                         Hurry, Helen!\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Not...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Leave!\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Not...\n                              (she turns away \n                              from him and forces \n                              the words out)\n                         ... till I know...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Now!\n\n               She stands with her back to him.

Show me!\n\n               He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases \n               the tripod.\n\n               CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the \n               wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.\n\n                                     MARK (O.S.)\n                         Do you know... what the most \n                         frightening thing in the world \n                         is?...\n\n               She is looking at something, puzzled.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         It's fear.\n\n               The sound of his footsteps approaching...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         So I did something... very simple...\n\n               WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Very simple.\n\n               WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is \n               looking at something else.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         When they felt the spike... touching \n                         their throats... and knew I was \n                         going to kill them...\n\n               The spike is touching her throat.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         ... I made them - watch their own \n                         deaths!\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. \n               She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying \n               mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The \n               mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There \n               is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of \n               the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted \n               face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle \n               of her forehead.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Made them see their own terror as \n                         the spike went in... and if death \n                         has a face, they saw that too!\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat \n               pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of \n               the camera.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Not you! Not you! I'll never \n                         photograph you! I promised - I \n                         promised - Not you!  \n\n               Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her \n               throat.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark \u0097 his face turned away from the \n               viewfinder.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         ... frightened ... for you...\n\n               There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the \n               other room.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The Police arrive: three cars.  Mark appears at an upstairs \n               window with his camera.\n\n                                     SERGEANT\n                         Look out!\n\n               He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his \n               camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge \n               for the house. Mark disappears.\n\n               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He \n               knows exactly what he has to do.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I've been ready for this... for \n                         such a long time...\n\n               Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then \n               he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards \n               him...\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         What are you...\n\n                                     MARK\n                         It'll be all right.\n\n               He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, \n               then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the \n               Policemen pounding on the door.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I can beat that!\n\n               He crosses to a switch - presses it.  The room is filled \n               with a small boy's screaming.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Give yourself up... Mark!\n\n               He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of \n               cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with \n               a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of \n               the older cameras have flashlights attached.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         Watch them, Helen... Watch them \n                         say goodbye - one by one -\n                              (he presses a master \n                              switch on the wait)\n                         I've timed this... so often...\n\n               Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic \n               disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye \n               of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off \n               with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of \n               footsteps hurrying up the stairs.\n\n               Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer \u0097 are the spikes of \n               the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the \n               approach - and Helen's terrified face.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         No - No!\n\n               The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches \n               the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his \n               projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I wish... I could have found your \n                         faces for you... \n\n               The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door. \n\n                                     MARK\n                         Helen - I'm afraid!\n\n               We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The \n               spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is \n               winking rapidly.\n\n                                     MARK\n                         I'm glad I'm afraid!\n\n               Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... \n               as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. \n               The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls \n               back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. \n               He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by \n               the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face \n               like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine-\n               camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of \n               The Magic Camera.\n\n               The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless \n               at what they see.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands.\n\n               The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute \n               silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:\n\n                                     FATHER'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Don't be a silly boy... there's \n                         nothing to be afraid of...\n\n               And a small voice answers.\n\n                                     CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Good night, Daddy...\n\n               The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the \n               16mm screen fades slowly into greyness...\n\n               The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small \n               child.\n\n                                                               FADE OUT:\n\n               THE END \n\n\n\n\n\nPeeping Tom\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Leo Marks\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:32:48.688953"}
