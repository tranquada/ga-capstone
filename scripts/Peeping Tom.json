Nothing to be alarmed about. It \n               might be a small contented motor.\n\n<b>               FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

We can HEAR the Woman whistling \n               'Stardust' merrily to herself.\n\n               CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.\n\n               We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - \n               haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.\n\n               As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then \n               turns round for a better look.\n\n               Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the \n               man's.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still \n               young enough to need two glances at the customers.\n\n               She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception.

Overlaid is the sound of the \n               man's footsteps.\n\n               Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the \n               man who is following her.\n\n<b>               EXT.

It stands next to a chemist shop.\n\n               Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - \n               glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.\n\n<b>               INT.

She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have \n               it.\n\n               Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her \n               mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.\n\n               The sound purrs on.\n\n<b>                                                              FADE OUT: \n</b>\n<b>               FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>               BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE\n</b>\n               The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone \n               at the end of a street.

He opens it - Helen is standing there.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         I hope I'm not disturbing you?\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - shaking his head, smiling shyly.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         I knew you wouldn't come down... \n                         so I've brought you this.\n\n               She holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake.\n\n<b>                                     MARK\n</b>                         Thank you...\n\n               He takes the plate.\n\n<b>                                     MARK\n</b>                         ... very much...\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         I mustn't keep you from your work \n\n               She turns to go.\n\n<b>                                     MARK\n</b>                         I'd like to offer you a drink.\n\n               She turns round.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         Thank you, Mark.\n\n<b>                                     MARK\n</b>                         I haven't one.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         I'd adore some water.\n\n               She smiles.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         a hostess can't drink water at her \n                         own party, it looks like a hint to \n                         the guests.\n\n<b>                                     MARK\n</b>                         Will you... would you... like to \n                         come in?\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         Yes, Mark...\n\n               She steps over the threshold.

For a moment the screen is \n               in darkness. A dark-room darkness.\n\n<b>               INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               We can HEAR - faintly \u0097 the dance music from downstairs.  \n               There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in \n               diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. \n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.\n\n               As certain events of possible interest are to take place \n               in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.\n\n               The room is the product of three rooms which have been \n               knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well \n               constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a \n               laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, \n               and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The \n               two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched \n               all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting \n               in the light.\n\n               In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a \n               'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There \n               are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of \n               equipment above the 'dry'.\n\n               This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning \n               in the ceiling above the benches.\n\n               The other part of the room has a window at the far end of \n               it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.\n\n               Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the \n               16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots \n               light this part of the room. There is a small control panel \n               on the wall.  \n\n               Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. \n               All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.\n\n               There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone \n               except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid \n               for it all.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, \n               watching Helen.\n\n               From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes \n               as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. \n               For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch \n               on the wall.

STAGE E. - DAY\n</b>\n               Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond \n               this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this \n               yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the \n               furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can \n               faintly be heard coming from this set. \n\n               Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to \n               the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb \n               the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark \n               moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above \n               the Policemen.\n\n               Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.\n\n               Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the \n               Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into \n               an open trunk.

As he does, the metallic \n               disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye \n               of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off \n               with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of \n               footsteps hurrying up the stairs.\n\n               Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer \u0097 are the spikes of \n               the tripod.

He crashes against the small table, which falls over. \n               He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by \n               the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face \n               like a canopy.
