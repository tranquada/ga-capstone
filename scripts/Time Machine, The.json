COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)\n\n     Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading\n     over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the\n     laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded\n     from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.\n     A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of\n     the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all\n     this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.\n\n     A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and\n     KNOCKS on it impatiently.\n\n\n\n     AT THE DOOR                                            2\n\n     The knock is answered by MRS.

The silence is accentuated by the\n     merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the\n     capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about\n     the room.\n\n     Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly\n     takes his chair.\n\n\n\n     SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS                                  4\n\n               DR.

HILLYER\n               I say, this is outright rude of the man!\n\n                         FILBEY\n               He's undoubtedly been detained.  That's\n               all.\n\n     Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-\n     thing but is interrupted by\n\n                         KEMP (unscrews the cigar from\n                    his tight lips)\n               This is such a confounded waste of\n               time!  If he's not coming, I've any\n               number of more important things to do.\n\n     All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the\n     door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her\n     hand she stands there, hesitating.\n\n                         DR.

HILLYER (indicating the\n                    note)\n               What does it say, Filby?

Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door\n     open and turns around.\n\n                         MRS.

HILLYER (agreeing)\n               To say nothing of the waste of\n               time.\n\n     Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining\n     table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the\n     others settle down.  This time the chair at the head\n     of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.\n\n                         BRIDWELL (arises, lifting\n                    his glass)\n               One thing I will say for George, he\n               keeps the best cellar in the south of\n               England...and Mrs. Watchett is the\n               finest cook in the world. - I think\n               I'll drink to that!\n\n     The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at\n     the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.\n     All look in the direction of another door across\n     the room.\n\n\n\n     THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9\n\n     It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,\n     dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.\n     The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the\n     men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,\n     she points toward the long corridor now revealed by\n     the open door.\n\n                         MRS. WATCHETT (frightened)\n               There!...there...\n\n     All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife\n     clasped in his hand.\n\n\n\n     CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10\n\n     We see the figure of a man approaching, a black\n     silhouette against the pale glow at the end of\n     the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and\n     sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes\n     closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,\n     but as he nears the doorway, the light from the\n     room strikes first his legs, then his body and\n     finally his face.  Here he stops.\n\n     This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER\n     (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At\n     this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing\n     is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and\n     scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For\n     a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light\n     and then takes another swaying step into the room.\n\n\n\n     FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11\n\n     They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass\n     of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down\n     before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.\n\n                         FILBY\n               Good lord! - What's happened?\n\n     Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.\n     Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer\n     back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,\n     moves forward under his own power.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               I'm all right...just some food...a\n               drink...\n\n     He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With\n     trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass\n     of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.\n     The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               Are you all right?\n\n     A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time\n     Traveller empties his glass.\n\n                         BRIDEWELL (a delayed\n                    answer)\n               Of course.  I'm...all right...\n\n     Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller\n     like a mother hen.\n\n                         MRS.

Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.\n\n                         DR. HILLYER\n               Well, can't you speak, man?  What\n               happened to you?

CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62\n\n     The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door\n     at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,\n     removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then\n     slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of\n     the picture.\n\n\n\n     INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63\n\n     The laboratory has the appearance of having once been\n     a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The\n     glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by\n     rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight\n     is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-\n     ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving\n     the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-\n     ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps\n     through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets\n     of drawings and scientific instruments situated around\n     the perimeter.\n\n     But the most conspicuous object in the room is the\n     Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model\n     already seen.\n\n     However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,\n     ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While\n     the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the\n     full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering\n     moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the\n     power of movement.\n\n\n\n     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64\n\n     Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-\n     manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,\n     then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here\n     a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.\n     The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the\n     crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it\n     sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his\n     lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy\n     strains of \"The Land Of The Leal.\"  A clock near him on\n     the workbench reads:  \"9:30.\"\n\n     Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming\n     handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the\n     saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no\n     sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his\n     settling himself into the saddle is any more than a\n     routine position he has taken before to work on the\n     Machine.\n\n     Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:\n\n\n\n     INSERT:  SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)         65\n\n     Passing clouds.\n\n\n\n     BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66\n\n     He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand\n     slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the\n     lever. - Gently he urges it forward.\n\n     A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,\n     but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from\n     within the Machine.\n\n\n\n     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANEL                             67\n\n     The luminous dials show:  \"31 December 1899.\"  The\n     meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.

Then almost\n     at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the\n     lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.

THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200\n\n     There is no Time Machine.\n\n\n\n     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201\n\n     In stunned shock.\n\n\n\n     THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202\n\n     Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries\n     toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn\n     looking for his Machine, beating the branches with\n     his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,\n     a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and\n     disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the\n     Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn\n     where the Machine was last seen.\n\n     (NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot\n             where the Time Traveller's house once stood.)\n\n     He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.\n     Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-\n     denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the\n     pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he\n     had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.\n     Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his\n     knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes\n     the grass.\n\n\n\n     THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203\n\n     The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as\n     though some heavy object had been dragged across.\n     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves\n     and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-\n     prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned\n     earth.\n\n\n\n     TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204\n\n     He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.\n     Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-\n     ing the grooves.\n\n\n\n     BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205\n\n     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves\n     straight across the lawn to the flagstones around\n     the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the\n     stones leading to the wide panel in the base of\n     the pedestal.  Here the marks end.\n\n\n\n     AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206\n\n     The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an\n     exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.\n\n     The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the\n     claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,\n     he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either\n     to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife\n     from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's\n     edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.\n\n     Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a\n     loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this\n     heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow\n     it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times\n     he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock\n     shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.\n\n\n\n     CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207\n\n     He senses he is under observation by an unseen\n     presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up\n     to:\n\n\n\n     THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208\n\n     The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in\n     the torch light.\n\n\n\n     BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209\n\n     He turns and peers toward:\n\n\n\n     THE BUSHES                                             210\n\n     In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a\n     wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the\n     flame of the torch.\n\n\n\n     TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213\n\n     He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly\n     paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-\n     proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,\n     followed by a ghostly impression of pale,\n     fleeing creatures.\n\n     The Time Traveller halts and turns in another\n     direction.  The same thing happens.\n\n     Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch\n     against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now\n     in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering\n     around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves\n     into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.\n\n\n\n     THE PATH                                               214\n\n     Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure\n     approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.\n\n\n\n     TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215\n\n     The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the\n     other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment\n     there is a struggle and then the other figure lies\n     perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to\n     get a look at it.\n\n\n\n     THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216\n\n     It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller\n     reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an\n     expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be\n     waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does\n     not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the\n     Time Traveller and her face records a wave of\n     relief.\n\n     The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time\n     Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.\n\n                         WEENA\n               I heard you pounding...I came to\n               tell you...\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               How do you open that panel?\n\n                         WEENA\n               No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks?\n\n     A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts\n     her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.\n     Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns\n     her to face him.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               Why are you afraid of the Morlocks?\n\n     Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups\n     his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her\n     head back so that her eyes meet his.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               Tell me.\n\n                         WEENA\n               When they call, we must go below.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               Do the Morlocks live beneath the\n               earth?\n                    (Weena nods)\n               Why must you obey their command?\n\n                         WEENA\n               They give us the food we eat, the\n               clothes we wear.

Then she glances high into the dark sky\n     and the old fear returns.\n\n                         WEENA\n               It is night.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               Only children are frightened by\n               the dark. - But then you are a\n               child, aren't you?\n                    (Weena glances around\n                    warily into the shadows,\n                    her anxiety mounting)\n               I'll build a fire.\n\n                         WEENA (taking his\n                    hand, rises)\n               Let us go from here.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER (getting\n                    up)\n               I can't, child.\n                    (walking toward the sphinx)\n               My Machine is inside there, I\n               intend to wait here 'til morning,\n               then find some way of getting\n               inside.\n\n                         WEENA (catching up)\n               No, you must not.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER (stops,\n                    then)\n               Help me gather some wood.\n\n\n\n     THE LAWN AND THE BASE - LONG SHOT                      217\n\n     Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which\n     she hands over to him.\n\n                         WEENA\n               Where are you from?\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER (picks\n                    up dry branches)\n               As a matter of fact, I'm from\n               right here.\n                    (gesturing)\n               There's where my house stood many\n               thousands of years ago.

THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383\n     (MATTE)\n\n     The face is broken in half.  It is left with only\n     a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the\n     remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the\n     sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins\n     of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and\n     gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time\n     Traveller and Weena come through the charred\n     bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.\n\n\n\n     THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384\n\n     The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling\n     smoke.

Weena follow,\n     hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to\n     halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,\n     the Time Traveller enters.\n\n\n\n     INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386\n\n     Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time\n     Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes\n     in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands\n     on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her\n     radiant features.\n\n     Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around\n     as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and\n     starts to fit the lever into place.\n\n\n\n     REVERSE ANGLE                                          387\n\n     The Time Traveller working eagerly.

From without he hears Weena's\n     POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living\n     presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is\n     silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,\n     weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-\n     thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls\n     around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the\n     enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding\n     them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into\n     the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as\n     he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and\n     try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and\n     smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling\n     bodies.\n\n\n\n     INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390\n\n     The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and\n     finally grasps it.\n\n\n\n     OMITTED                                                391-403\n\n\n\n     INSERT OF DIALS                                        404\n\n     Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls\n     over the instruments, followed by a burst of\n     whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.\n     There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total\n     darkness.\n\n\n\n     TIME TRAVELLER - MED.

He reels in the saddle, then coming\n     from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.\n     As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the\n     daylight returns, we can see that his face is\n     covered with perspiration.

Mrs. Watchett\n     is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller\n     is puffing on his pipe.

The front door opens letting out\n     the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.\n     They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping\n     the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to\n     leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage\n     looking back to the Time Traveller who stands\n     motionless in the doorway.\n\n                         FILBY\n               Goodnight, George.\n\n\n\n     AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416\n\n     The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.\n\n                         TIME TRAVELLER\n               Thank you, David, for being such\n               a good friend - always.\n\n     With this he turns and goes into the house, closing\n     the door slowly.\n\n\n\n     AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417\n\n     Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,\n     but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.\n     Kemp thrusts his head from the window.\n\n                         KEMP\n               What do you think, Filby?\n\n                         FILBY (after a pause)\n               One thing is certain.

He looks about the labora-\n     tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's\n     arm and leads her from the room.
