TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mancini's \"Ave Maria\" fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the road.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CREDITS ROLL\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel. We never see her face. Hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix. Her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells. A silver bracelet dangles from her wrist.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A slow-moving semi obstructs her path. The woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane. She steps on the gas. She's in the wrong lane and can't get over. There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly, the headlights are upon her. And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs. She cuts the wheel hard, but too late. The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">SLO-MO\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The accident is violent and horrible. The BMW cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction. The music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof. And as the BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment, the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. MIDDLE AMERICAN TOWN - PRE-DAWN\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning. Vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes. Dairy Queens, Hardee's, and Walmarts line the main drag. Stars and Stripes flutter from lampposts.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A man sits propped up against pillows, his sleeping wife snuggled next to him. His name is JOHN QUINCY ARCHIBALD. His strong, handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear. From across the room, last night's news broadcast drones on the TV. The President is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">JOHN Q. watches impassively, the irony not lost on him. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Something's not right. He jumps out of bed, wearing only a pair of BVDs.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WIFE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Honey, what is it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - MORNING\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The screen door bangs open. John Q. bursts onto the porch to find a tow truck parked in front of his house. TWO TRUCKERS are winching a hook and cable to a ten year old Chevy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, what the hell are you doing?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">What does it look like?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Aw, come on.

That's not what the bank says.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in. John Q. just watches as the truck speeds away, dragging the car along the cement.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The neighbors now stand on their porches, staring. J.Q. turns to see his wife, DENISE, standing in the doorway. She's not a happy camper. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Their nine year old son, MIKE, appears at his mother's side, wiping the sleep from his eyes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's going on?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSE ON a hand circling want-ads in red ink. J.Q. sits at the kitchen table drinking a half-filled cup of coffee, his eyes scouring the classifides. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Denise enters, dressed in her brown and red supermarket cashier's uniform. Without speaking, she passes J.Q. and starts making breakfast. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sorry.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Denise doesn't respond. A chill fills the air.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I talked to the bank.

That's it. It was either the car or the house, so I thought...\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You thought.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What did you want me to do? Have us put out on the street? I'm down to twenty hours a week a the plant. They shipped off half the damn jobs down to Mexico.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">My car is gone, John.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know I'm out there trying to find a second job.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What do you want me to say? That it's fine? Alright, it's fine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The car's still ours, Denise. We own it. All we have to do is wait two weeks until my check comes in.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike enters dressed for school. He strikes a body builder's pose, flexing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yah! Ronnie Coleman, Mr. Olympics two years running. Yah!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He moves to the bread box and grabs a donut.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sit down, honey. Eat some breakfast.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(mouthful of food)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I am eating.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">A donut isn't breakfast.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah it is. It's a continental breakfast.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, well, you're not a continent right now.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh, Dad, what do you call North America?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Denise sets down two plates of hot food.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Enough about that. You're not going to school without breakfast. Now eat. Both of you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike and John Q. wolf down their food three bites at a time.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I can't believe those jerks took our car, can you, Mom?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Denise gives J.Q. the hairy eyeball.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, I can't.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What are we going to do? You're not going to do something, right, Dad? You know what I'd do? I'd get so big and mad, I'd just go crazy and kick someone's butt.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Watch your language.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I would. I swear. When I grow up I'll be so strong no one will ever take nothing from us.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You've been watching too much of that W.W. wrestling.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not wrestling, Dad. Body building. There's a big difference.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Alright, alright. Get your books. You're going to be late.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike runs out of the room.

The CAMERA PUSHES IN on a mammoth-sized printer, furiously pounding letters onto a fact sheet. We catch glimpses of peoples' names, hometowns, other vital information. Vernell Tilson, Des Moines. Arthur Friedlander, Jefferson City. Amy Podgorsky, Topeka.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. JOHN Q.'S TRUCK - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">John, Denise and Mike. Denise in the middle.

Wait for your pitch.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The catcher flashes fingers. The pitcher nods and fires. Mike hits a sharp ground ball between first and second. The second baseman moves over but doesn't have the angle.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The first baseman charges the ball, scoops it on the run, then underhands it to the Dodger pitcher, who gallops off the mound towards first.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike's foot hits the bag at exactly the same time the ball plops in the pitcher's outstretched glove.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FIRST BASE UMP\n</p><p id=\"dia\">SAAAAAAAAFFFEEE!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DODGER PITCHER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No way!

The Dodger pitcher wheels around and fires. Too late, the runner scores.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HOME PLATE UMP\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Saaaaaffee!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Seeing an opening, Mike races from first to second, arms pumping, breathing hard.

SMACK. The ball lands in the shortstop's glove.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike wobbles, doubles over and falls face first into the dirt. The Dodger shortstop stands over Mike. He can't decide if he should tag him. Players, spectators look on dazed, shocked.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE - BLEACHERS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">PUSH IN ON J.Q.'s FACE, panicked.

Jesus God.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He lifts Mike's head, holds it in his hands. Denise arrives, hysterical.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mike?! Mikey, can you hear me?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike is semi-conscious, eyes dilated, barely breathing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JIMMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Somebody call an ambulance.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not waiting for an ambulance.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. lifts Mike into his arms and races with Denise through the crowd towards the parking lot.

RESUSCITATION ROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Maguire helps J.Q. lower Mike onto an examination table, and immediately several emergency technicians start applying the resuscitation equipment. Their movements are swift and precise. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped around Mike's arm, an oxymeter to the tip of his finger, and sensors are stuck all over his chest.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The E.R. doctor is MARJORIE KLEIN, early 30's. Klein is all business, assessing Mike's condition.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Pulse is 150. B.P. 68 over 34. Collapsed playing baseball.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. notices Maguire glancing worriedly at Klein.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He was running.

KLEIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let's get him on some oxygen.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Maguire reaches for the Oxygen tank, lays the mask over Mike's nose, turns the screw. As Mike inhales the hissing air, Klein turns Mike on his side, probes his lung and lower back areas.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He's going to be alright, isn't he?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR.

It's possible your son may need a transfusion.

PEDIATRIC I.C.U. - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. and Denise walk past rows of quiet, glassed-in rooms full of patients and life-support machines. They enter Mike's room to find REGGIE, a twenty-four year old nurse, hooking Mike up to the high monitor above the bed.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike is lying supine, awake but groggy, hooked up to a heart monitor, IV drips, hideous plastic tubes up his nose, down his throat, on full inotropic support. Denise leans over, kisses Mike.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hi, sweetheart.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, slugger, how are you doing?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike smiles weakly, struggles to speak, points to the tubes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I can't...talk.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Relax, buddy.

Respiratory rate. Pulse oximetry. Heart rate. And this one is blood pressure. Diastolic and systolic.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Reggie points to a bank of monitors. In the middle is a flashing number 88.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">REGGIE (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We'd like this top number to stay above ninety, but between eighty-five and ninety is acceptable for now. Anything less than eighty is dangerous. If his blood pressure drops, we're going to have to do something. We can't have him going below seventy again.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What would that mean?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">REGGIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Seventy and below, he's in heart failure.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Reggie exits. J.Q. and Denise watch the blood pressure monitor, holding steady at 88. Plink. Suddenly, the number drops a notch to 87. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Mother's a cashier in a supermarket.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">how's the family's insurance?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She shakes her head - \"we've got a problem.\" Payne sees J.Q. and Denise enter and she is immediately on her feet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Rebecca Payne, hospital director. This is Doctor Turner, head of our cardiology department.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">How's our boy doing?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Please sit down.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">John and Denise sit, and the lights are dimmed. Dr. Turner approaches an illuminated display of X-rays. He uses a pointer to clarify.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This X-ray is that of a normal, nine year old heart. This one is your son's.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">John Q. and Denise stare nervously at the fleshy fist-sized organs on the translucent glass.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There are septal defects here, here, and here, which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema, and malignant ventricular ectopy. As you can see, Mike's heart is approximately three times normal size.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He points to Mike's heart, huge in comparison.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm sorry. I don't understand. Could you pout that in layman's terms?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Of course. Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs. Sort of like a sponge getting wet. Mike's heart is trying, but I'm afraid it's working too hard.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So what's he need? An operation?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Turner gathers himself, takes off his glasses.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Your son's heart is useless. He is going to need a transplant.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The room goes silent.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He's nine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wait a second. There are other options.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What options?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">To do nothing. Medicate him. Keep him as comfortable as possible. You need to start thinking about quality of life now.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't understand. We were just with him. He seemed fine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He's going to seem fine. But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left. You might want to make it a happy time. Say goodbye.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh my God.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And transplantation is a high risk operation. You could lose your son on the table. You may not want to take that chance.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What do you think, Dr. Turner?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This isn't my decision.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know that. I'm asking for your opinion. Without surgery, how long does he have?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not long. Months. Weeks. Days.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">This is too much for Denise. She breaks into tears. John puts his arms around her, steadies her, gathers his thoughts.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What would you do if it was your son?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mr. Archibald...\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not you. Him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'd do the transplant. Absolutely.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. looks at Denise, who nods.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Okay. Let's do it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've got major medical. Don't worry, I'm covered.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Actually, we've already checked with your carrier. There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There must be some kind of mistake. My son is covered. I've got full medical. He's covered.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What about you, Mrs. Archibald? Do you have coverage?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. I've only been working at the market a short time. You need to be there two years before you get benefits.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Payne flips through the Archibald family file.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I see that you don't own your own home. No investments, stocks, bonds. And you have a little over one thousand in savings.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Did you hear what I said? I'm telling you, I'm insured.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that. In the meantime, I'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">How much does a transplant cost?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What are you saying? If I don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly. If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice. But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients. We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What kind of down payment?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thirty percent. Seventy-five thousand.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. Seventy-five thousand dollars to put my kid's name on a list?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PAYNE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, it takes money to provide health service. It's expensive for you and for us. My job is to keep this program alive. For everyone. Now, I'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

You don't want to do that.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't, huh? Watch me. It's a county hospital. They have to treat him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No they don't. Transplantation is always considered an elective procedure. This hospital's politics are particularly infuriating, but you're in the right place. Believe me. You want Dr. Turner. His bedside manner is terrible, but he's one of the foremost surgeons in the country.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What do you want us to do? You heard Payne. We're a cash account.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. KLEIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I know it's outrageous, but don't give up. Talk to your insurance company. Check with our Human Resources Department for medical assistance, State Children's Services, Medicaid. Just don't take no for an answer. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Non-management, part-time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But I'm not part-time. I'm a full-time employee. It's just slow right now.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">INSURANCE REP.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sure. But your coverage is based on house worked. Like I said, you only qualify for second tier, and that has a maximum payout limit of twenty-thousand dollars.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wait a minute.

Mercedes didn't install passenger airbags until 1988.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A long uncomfortable silence ensues as the group looks at Mitch, realizing the obvious. Busted.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I was drunk. Alright?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Tears stream down Julie's proud face, for the first time, Mitch is speechless.

Mike's blood pressure drops from 75 to 74. Mike is resting, eyes closed. Denise stands vigilantly by Mike's bedside. Reggie enters. Carrying an armload of medicine. He replaces the IV bag and starts to administer the meds. One after the other, Reggie injects them into the IV line, and Mike stirs.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's that?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">REGGIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Lasix. It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up. But it's potassium sparing, so he needs this one to supplement.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And those?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">REGGIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Dopamine.

Pain, maybe.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Pain?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">REGGIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't know, Mrs. Archibald. I just do what they tell me.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike groans.

But I'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on. How does that sound?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike forces a smile, dips his head slightly. \"Sounds good.\" Reggie leaves the room. Something catches Denise's eye. Down the Pediatric ICU, she sees the hospital chaplain again. There is a commotion. The parents are crying. And a sheet is pulled over her face of the now dead child. The chaplain tries to console the devastated mother, who screams as her child is wheeled out of the room.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mom?

You're worthless. You know that? Some security guard. You should have zapped the bastard.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">With what? Besides, I'm not putting my neck on the line. Not for eight-fifty an hour.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mitch reaches, pulls a cas cart closer. He carefully slides open a drawer, steals a sharp-edged scalpel, slips it into his pocket. Next he spots a spray top cannister marked Ethychloride.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What the hell are you doing?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Looking out for number one.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You want to stay alive? Sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wake up, fat boy. The cops are coming in shooting. They don't give a shit about his kid.

Everybody is chowing down.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The thing I don't understand is why no one caught it before. Mike had check ups every year since the day he was born. Why didn't his doctors pick it up?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, he was. About a week after he was born. But his doctor said that was normal. That it happens all the time.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He might not have been tested thoroughly enough.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Why not?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You got an HMO, right? There's your answer. HMO's pay their doctors not to test. Their way of keeping costs down. Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them. The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser. Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the HMO sends the doc a big, fat bonus check. J.Q. looks at Turner.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is that true?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Possible. Not likely, but possible.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along? And he could have been treated years ago?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who knows?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LESTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You see,here's the problem. Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead. That's how they make money. And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead. They want you sick. That's the way they make money.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LESTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's all about getting paid, man.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war. It's a game. And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LESTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Because then no one gets paid.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JULIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But what about that thing you guys take? That promise? What do they call it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STEVE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The Hippocratic oath.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LESTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">More like the hipp-crit-cial Oath to me. How's that go, Doc? \"I solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical?\"\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth. The shit happens all the time. Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath. Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JULIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hospitals can't turn people away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STEVE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah. I thought there were laws about that.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There are laws. But there are also ways around the laws. All we have to do is stabilize them. After that, we're off the hook.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Turner is getting hot.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's not how it works.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's exactly how it works. Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Finally, Turner explodes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Shut up. Enough already. I've heard all the bitching and moaning I can stand. Sure, the system sucks. There's red tape and there's worse. There's tough luck. And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under. And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine. I'm the bad guy. But who's holding the fucking gun?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Turner gets up and walks into the treatment room.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JULIE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wow.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's his problem?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STEVE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've got to be honest, if my kid was dying and I couldn't get help, I don't know what I'd do.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DEBBY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Me, neither.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STEVE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">But I'd do something.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. glances quickly at the clock.

It's basically a pump inserted into the chest cavity, wired to the heart to keep it stimulated.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">All this time there's been a way to save his life and you never said anything?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR.

Mike's immune system may be too weak.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Will it give him time?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not long.

HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - GOLDEN HOUR\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The police are unceremoniously disconnecting Channel 8's pirated signal, hassling Lampley's crew, and telling them they are all going to be arrested.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LAMPLEY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're going to bust me? Get real. You just shot an innocent man on primetime TV.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A roar from the crowd indicates something big is happening. J.Q. is coming outside. He's got the sniper in tow, using him as a human shield. The crowd behind the barricade is huge now, holding up signs like \"Have a Heart,\" \"Save Mike,\" and \"John Q.

Is that what you want to hear, goddammit? Now quit breaking my stones. I need you to save my ass on this one.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Frank Grimes smiles before grabbing a megaphone from one of the uniforms and stepping out from behind the barricade with Monroe and Moody.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hold your fire.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. looks around at the hundreds of weapons all pointing right at him.

They're getting rowdy now. The cops are getting jumpy, their rifles trained, their trigger fingers ready.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONROE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">John, listen to me. Lieutenant Grimes had nothing to do with that. It was my call.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't lie to me. I don't need to be bullshitted by some lying flunky cops.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What are we, friends all of a sudden? All of a sudden, we owe you something? You pulled the gun. You're the one that took the hospital. What did you think would happen? You want truth Here's some truth. This is going to end up bad for you. There's only two ways out of here.

Look at all of it. It's crazy. You don't want to do this.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I just want my life back.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I understand. It's hard to be a man these days. Hard to know what the right thing is. Put the gun down, John. It's all over. You got everything you asked for. Mike is on the list.

The faces are those of outrage and passion. Some even with tears streaming down their faces. J.Q. looks out the overwhelming display of support.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, what are you doing? Stay with me, John. You think these people give a shit about you? They don't. You're just the cause of the moment. Believe me, in a couple of days, they'll be outraged about something else. Nobody cares, John. That's the real truth. Nobody cares. Only you. It's only you and me out here, and all these guns pointed at you. So, what do you want to do? It's your call.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I want my son.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MOODY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Bring me my son.

I'm going to need some equipment but I've got two surgeons inside that are ready to go.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONROE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You listen to me, you sonofabitch. You give this up right now, turn yourself in. And your son will have any and every means of assistance. If not, if you keep this up, this is going to be very bad for you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Are you threatening me, Chief? Take your best shot. Oh, I forgot, you already did. No, we'll do this my way. You give me my boy, they do the surgery and then I give up. Nobody gets hurt and everyone goes home.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Monroe studies J.Q. and considers.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONROE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What do you think, Frank?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I say give it to him. He's not going to hurt his boy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Monroe takes his time making his decision.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MOODY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sir, the object is to get hostages out, not to let more in.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONROE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">The boy is not a hostage.

Move it back, folks.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The mob swarms around the speeding bed, trying to get a look at Mike, who considers the circus atmosphere surrounding him. As the bed hits the police barricade, the cops take over.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let me through.

It's been a long time, so forgive me if I'm a little rusty. I know you do things your own way.

KLEIN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">We just can't remove your heart and put it into Mike's body.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There's too many unknowns. Matching a donor and receiver is extremely complicated. There's several critical tests that have to be taken.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Like what?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Cross matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements. If both blood tissues aren't compatible, there's a very high likelihood of rejection.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come on, Doc. I know all about compatibility. We've been tested up the wazoo. Mike and I are both B-Positive. Our tissues are a match. And his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit. You know damn well we're compatible.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No, we don't. You're an adult. Mike is strong, but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for Mike.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll take that chance. It's better than letting him die.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR. TURNER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Out of the question.

I think it's very brave.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, it's all very noble and brave. But what do you think Mike would want? Or your wife?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mike is too young to know what's good for him. I'm his father. It's my job to protect him, and Denise would do the same thing if she was in my place.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">SECURITY GUARD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Are you saying Mike's life is more important than yours?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Or that it's okay that Mike grows up without a father?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You can have more children, John.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LESTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What happened to Mike is bad, man. It's the worst. It ain't fair, but you can't kill yourself. Sometimes you've just got to let go and let God take care of it.

In order for Mike to live, someone has to die. I'm the father. It might as well be me.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. and Turner's eyes meet.

You can't just throw your entire career for this man.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MITCH\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, you're not God.

We're all going to die.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MAGUIRE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not for nothing, Doctor. But if you do this, you're finished.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DR.

Even Rebecca Payne cracks a smile.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JURY FORMAN (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">On the final count, False Imprisonment, we find the defendant, guilty. The crowd erupts in protest. The media rush out to file their stories.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JUDGE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Quiet! Sentencing will be one week from today.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. stares straight ahead and takes a breath. After a moment, the public defender leads him over to the rail, where he is greeted by Jimmy, Gina, Denise and Mike.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">PUBLIC DEFENDER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He's going to do some time. But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year. And with time served, John will be home very soon.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. leans over to talk to his son.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You alright?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's okay, slugger. I'll be home soon. If you need anything, ask your mother. And Jimmy and Gina will be around.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't worry. If anybody messes with us, I'll take care of it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. embraces his boy and moves over to Denise.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">A year, huh? I could have lost you forever. I guess I can live with that.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A hand taps him on the shoulder. J.Q. looks up. Sees Grimes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Time to go, John.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DENISE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">John? I'm proud of you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. smiles and Grimes starts to lead him away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JIMMY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Give 'em hell, Johnny. Don't worry about nothing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MIKE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Bye, Dad.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Not goodbye. Remember? See you later.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. COURTROOM - MORNING\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">An enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps. They cheer their support as J.Q. emerges. Grimes steers J.Q. out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in J.Q.'s face. They ask ridiculous questions about justice, health care, and politics. J.Q., uncomfortable with all the attention, has no comment. He pushes past politely, head down, his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VOICE IN CROWD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, John. Good luck, man.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">J.Q. recognizes the voice, turns and sees LESTER. Both smile to each other as J.Q. is pushed further through when --\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">REPORTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">John Q.? Do you feel like your country has let you down?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(quietly)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. It's a wonderful country.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">REPORTER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Could you repeat that?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He said, \"America is the greatest goddamn country in the world.\" Now excuse us, I have to take this man to jail.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They push past the barricades and into the street. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MEDIA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">John Q.! John Q.!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look at all this. You're a celebrity, John.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah? Check with me in a couple of days.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They move to the street and Grimes opens the car door. J.Q. climbs inside. He looks up to see the CROWD, in all its glory, cameras flashing, microphones pointed at J.Q.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q. (CONT'D)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This is ridiculous. I don't even know these people.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What can I tell you? You're their hero.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">J.Q.\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not hero, Frank. I'm just a regular guy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRIMES\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, right.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Grimes slams the door. The \"cherry\" light spins, the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">On the street, J.Q. sees Mike wave to him from the sidewalk, trying to get John's attention. Mike is saying something. J.Q. turns to look closer and finally he gets it: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Mike's lips say \"Thank you.\"\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">John winks at his boy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Mike makes a muscle.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">John smiles, and the car picks up speed.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The cop car pulls away. Away from the courtroom. The circus. Finally disappearing from view and we --\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">FADE TO BLACK.  \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE END\n\n\n\n</p></div>\n\n<b>\n</b><b>\n</b>\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>John Q</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=James Kearns\" title=\"Scripts by James Kearns\">James Kearns</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/John Q Script.html#comments\" title=\"John Q comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:08:54.007757"}
