STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M.\n\n            We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets,\n            blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small\n            containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up\n            colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little\n            color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and\n            four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant\n            Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry.\n\n            We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his\n            domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling,\n            uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes,\n            they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge\n            has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a\n            COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Double double decaf low-fat Cap.\n\n                                BRUCE\n                      You got it, buddy.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Good choice very good choice.\n\n            Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet\n            'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks.\n\n                                SAM (CONT'D)\n                      Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half\n                      low, half non.

LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY\n\n            Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street. \n            He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for\n            anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHT\n            BETWEEN THEM.\n\n                                SAM\n                      It's time.  It's time.\n\n            Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping. \n            Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!  Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS.\n\n                                SAM (CONT'D)\n                      It's time, it's time for you to go.\n\n            INT. HALLWAY - LATER\n\n            Sam plows down the hall and comes to room 324.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Rebecca!\n\n            Sam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: A\n            HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL.\n\n            REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is\n            the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that\n            stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black\n            Nurse, looks up from the monitor.\n\n                                GERTIE\n                      You the one responsible for this?\n\n            Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally.\n\n                                SAM\n                      I'm sorry.\n\n                                GERTIE\n                      Too late for sorries, daddy, get over\n                      here and hold her hand.\n\n            Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER\n            CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS.\n\n                                NURSE\n                      You got a live one, Gert.\n\n            INT. LABOR ROOM - LATER\n\n                                DR. JAMISON\n                      Okay, this is it!\n\n                                SAM\n                          (spins in circles)\n                      This is it!  This is it!\n\n                                DR. JAMISON\n                      And it's a girl...\n\n            The BABY lets out her first cry.  Sam watches, awestruck. \n            Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to\n            Rebecca.  Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW.  Gertie walks\n            over to Sam.\n\n                                GERTIE\n                      There's someone who's been waitin' an\n                      awful long time to see you, Sam.\n\n            She places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS.  Suddenly Sam's whole\n            body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca,\n            but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.  Then in\n            quiet amazement:\n\n                                SAM\n                      This is it.\n\n                                GERTIE\n                      What's her name?\n\n                                SAM\n                          (looks at clock)\n                      Let me see let me see let me see. \n                      12:17, March 2nd.  Lucy in the Sky with\n                      Diamonds.  Recorded March 2nd.  1967. \n                      Lyrics by John Lennon, music by Paul\n                      McCartney.  Lucy Diamond Dawson.\n\n            We hear LIKE A LULLABY, \"Picture yourself on a boat in a\n            river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies...\"\n\n            EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING\n\n            Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out,\n            walk down the steps of the hospital holding their\n            complimentary plastic baby bag.  Sam is nervous haling the\n            precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus\n            pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they\n            can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks\n            to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around\n            and no sign of her. \n            Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of\n            her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He\n            screams.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Becca!  Becca!\n\n            The more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's\n            no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block\n            holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.\n\n            We hear, \"Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but\n            she's gone.\"\n\n                                                           SMASH CUT TO:\n\n            INT. BUS - NIGHT\n\n            Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.  Next to him is\n            the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two\n            cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is\n            surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground\n            at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two\n            against the world.\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN\n\n            A marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on\n            hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded\n            T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A\n            carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift\n            bookshelves.\n\n            Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's\n            things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an \"Hold\n            Everything\" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been\n            transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers\n            lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a\n            clothes line of baby clothes.\n\n            The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera\n            follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a\n            blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An\n            exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He\n            swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back\n            to sleep.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Didn't you just fall asleep, little\n                      girl?\n                          (Lucy cries harder)\n                      Okay, if you say it's time to get up,\n                      then it's time to get up, time to get\n                      up.\n                          (Sam sniffs the air)\n                      Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of\n                      business.\n\n            He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's\n            pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with\n            promotional buttons: one says \"Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals\",\n            the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads \"Go, Lakers,\n            Go!\"  Sam undoes it.\n\n                                SAM (CONT'D)\n                      Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Let me\n                      see let me see let me see.\n\n            Sam attempts to clean and diaper her.  He finally manages to\n            pin the buttons so that it at least stays on.\n\n                                SAM (CONT'D)\n                      You look very beautiful this morning,\n                      very beautiful.\n\n            He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles.\n\n                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n            We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf:\n\n            HUGGIES, PAMPERS, EXTRA ABSORBENT PAMPERS, LUVS...\n\n            INT. WALMART - DAY\n\n            Sam stares at the \"Great Wall of Diapers\", awed.  He reaches\n            for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the\n            Huggies.  Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in\n            place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA\n            AISLE.  Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified.  He\n            stops.  Lucy WAILS.  WE HEAR THE SONG \"HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY\"\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 9 P.M.\n\n            Sam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs.\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 11:25 P.M.\n\n            Sam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock.  He's exhausted,\n            but she's just getting started.  He puts another blanket on\n            her.\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 1:30 A.M.\n\n            Peace.  A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the\n            cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate. \n            He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - \"YES!\"  He doesn't\n            get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming.  Defeated, he\n            picks her up.  HELP.  The PHONE RINGS.  HE PRESSES speaker.\n\n                                RASPY WOMAN (O.S.)\n                      What the hell are you doing to that\n                      baby?!\n\n            He looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor\n            on the phone, watching him through her window.  She is a\n            strange creature with very thick glasses.  We sense a\n            uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Everything's so tiny, tiny.

SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING\n\n            We are watching \"Hogan's Heroes\".  We hear SHULTZ'S INFAMOUS\n            RESPONSE: \"I know nothing, absolutely nothing!\"  Sam feeds a\n            content Lucy.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - LATER\n\n            \"Father Knows Best\" on TV.  Lucy blissfully falls asleep in\n            Sam's arms.  Euphoric, he tiptoes to the cradle and places\n            her ever so gently, when suddenly, the FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN.\n\n            Sam's BEST FRIENDS DESCEND inside: IFTY, a Pakistani\n            gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a\n            large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it.  BRAD, who sees\n            himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah\n            Fawcett T-shirt; and ROBERT, highly paranoid, thinks the\n            world's out to get him.  Lucy WAILS.  Sam RUNS to the CRIB.\n\n                                SAM\n                      What are you doing here now?!

And I\n                      got hit by a car today.\n\n                                SAM\n                      You did?\n\n                                ROBERT\n                      It's probably that guy from the V.A.\n\n                                BRAD\n                      What guy?\n\n                                ROBERT\n                          (closing window)\n                      I can't discuss it.  And now this.\n\n            Ifty makes ORIGAMI BIRDS out of newspapers.  Lucy's rapt.\n\n                                SAM\n                      She looks smart, doesn't she?\n\n                                IFTY\n                      Of course, look.  She's already reading\n                      the newspaper.  I have five smart\n                      sisters in Pakistan.  I am only brother. \n                      \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" was a\n                      wonderful movie I forgot to bring last\n                      week for Video Night...\n\n                                BRAD\n                      Did you get \"Blade Runner\" for tonight?\n\n                                ROBERT\n                      Now it's all my fault?!\n\n                                BRUCE\n                      Don't tell me you forgot again.  I broke\n                      a date with a daydream to come here.\n\n            There's a knock at the door.  Ifty goes to get it.  Brad\n            moans when he sees his 65 YEAR OLD MOTHER, ESTELLE, standing\n            in the doorway.\n\n                                BRAD\n                      Mom!  I told you Video Night's over at\n                      nine!  It's only six-thirty!\n\n                                ESTELLE\n                          (unaware of the baby)\n                      Sorry.  I'll wait in the lobby.\n\n            She exits.  Lucy begins to CRY.  Brad takes her - like a hot\n            potato, Robert takes her - now Ifty runs around in circles.\n\n                                IFTY\n                      She needs motion.  My father drove my\n                      sisters in his taxi to get them to go to\n                      sleep.

She out yet?\n\n            The camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the\n            back.  Sam lies with Lucy spooned into the crook of his arm,\n            almost asleep.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Almost there, almost there.  One more\n                      round and she'll be down for the night.\n\n            We hear the song \"Golden Slumbers\".  In a SERIES OF\n            DISSOLVES, we see Lucy and Sam in DIFFERENT SLEEPING\n            POSITIONS on the bus seat.  Gradually, she GROWS in HIS\n            PROTECTIVE EMBRACE --  \n\n            ONE MONTH,  THEN TWO.  NOW FIVE.  She's BIG AND ROUND at SIX\n            MONTHS.  And on and on into the night...\n\n            INT. WALMART'S PHOTO BOOTH - DAY\n\n            We see Sam and Lucy CRAMMED into the booth, wearing birthday\n            hats, taking HER FIRST BIRTHDAY picture.  We see the PHOTO\n            STRIP as it comes out of the slot.  Sam's shoulder with\n            Lucy's ear - Lucy's nose with Sam's elbow, their faces never\n            made it into the picture.\n\n            INT. STARBUCKS - 8:30 A.M.\n\n            The place is packed.  Sam moves from table to table,\n            cleaning.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Double macciatto, low foam, low-fat. \n                      Good choice, very good choice.\n\n            Sam turns and WE SEE LUCY attached to him in a handmade\n            snugly, crocheted by Annie.  She faces outward, all hands,\n            all 16 MONTHS of her; too big for the snugly.  She grabs a\n            croissant from a customer.  George looks confused.  Then\n            makes a SWIPE for a customer's coffee, knocking it to the\n            ground.  It SPLATTERS all over an anorexic, on-her-fourth\n            double-latte WOMAN in a designer exercise outfit.  She begins\n            shrieking.  George looks at Sam, this can't go on.\n\t\t\t\n            INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MORNING\n\n            Sam, Lucy by his side, has his foot in Annie's door.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Please, Annie!

Very first word.\n\n            Annie opens the door, takes Lucy's hand, and pulls her in.\n\n                                ANNIE\n                      And people worry you're not smart.\n\n            INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - ONE WEEK LATER\n\n            The apartment looks like a fallout shelter.  The kitchen\n            contains enough canned goods to last a year.  Brightly\n            colored crocheted doilies - Annie's hobby - adorn every\n            available surface.  The BRIGHTLY COLORED WEB of an\n            AGORAPHOBE.\n\n            Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson.  WE\n            SEE LUCY'S TINY FINGERS on the keys.  In a SERIES OF\n            DISSOLVES, it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note,\n            now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord.  Until finally\n            the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of \"Twinkle,\n            Twinkle, Little Star\".\n\n                                ANNIE\n                      This is Mozart.  He did twenty-two\n                      variations of \"Twinkle Twinkle Little\n                      Star\".  You smell good.  You can tell a\n                      lot about a person by their smell.  If\n                      they've got too much perfume on they're\n                      covering something up.  You gotta watch\n                      someone who smells like soap.  Gotta\n                      wonder what their priorities are. \n                      Nervous people.  People who try too\n                      hard.  They smell like fish.  But you. \n                      You smell like milk.  Milk and hope.\n\n            Lucy leaves the piano and toddles over to Annie's loom and\n            plays with a ball yarn.\n\n                                VOICE (O.S.)\n                      Groceries, Annie.\n\n                                ANNIE\n                      Thanks.\n\n            Annie opens the door to pull in the groceries.  The ball of\n            yarn ROLLS OUT the door and Lucy chases after it.  Annie,\n            terrified, bellows:\n\n                                ANNIE (CONT'D)\n                      Lucy!

And in the\n                      classroom, it's becoming clear she's\n                      holding herself back.

SCHOOL HALLOWEEN PARADE - AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\n            Two children, dressed as Batman, march followed by\n            CINDERELLA.  We see Lucy dressed in NEWSPAPER - an ORIGAMI\n            BIRD.  And behind her, marching more proudly than any child,\n            is Sam, dressed as PAUL McCARTNEY, in the black suit era -\n            with Beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest.  Sam is\n            the only adult participating in the parade.\n\n            Music BLASTS over the loudspeaker.  Sam begins to dance with\n            joyous abandon.  Lucy joins him.  They dance together\n            happily.\n\n            Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning\n            to laugh.  She slows and watches through their eyes Sam pony\n            around the room.  Conner pulls up his pants high on his waist\n            and begins to imitate Sam.  Another kid joins him.\n\n                                KID\n                      I'm a Super Freak!\n\n                                CONNER\n                      And I thought my dad was a dork.\n\n            Lucy's face hardens for the first time.

Unfortunately, I've\n                      learned the hard way that it's better\n                      too soon than too late.  For now the\n                      court will decide what's in Lucy's best\n                      interest.\n\n            Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain. \n            Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Run, Lucy, run!\n\n            We see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his\n            grasp.  She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.  She\n            runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a\n            cop follows.

BUS - MORNING\n\n            Sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood.  On\n            his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's\n            birthday cake.  It's lopsided from having been thawed and\n            refrozen.\n\n            EXT. BUS STOP - NOON\n\n            Sam waits for his transfer.  He sets the cake down on the\n            bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written\n            on it.  The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper\n            once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake.\n\n            The bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.  Sam\n            jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues\n            on its way.  Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up. \n            Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.  He\n            feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is\n            starting to leak ice cream.\n\n            INT.

Sam has passed judgement on himself.\n\n            EXT. CHILD AND FAMILY PROTECTIVE SERVICES - HALLWAY\n\n            Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward\n            Margaret Brown's office.  Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam\n            both see -\n\n            LUCY\n\n            Sitting, hopeful on the bench.  She searches Sam's face for\n            the verdict.  The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she\n            knows.  She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      No Daddy!  No Daddy!  No Daddy!\n\n            In a SERIES OF WORDLESS DISSOLVES, they hold each other in\n            the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit.  The\n            only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the\n            background.  Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy.\n\n                                MARGARET BROWN\n                      C'mon, Lucy.  It's time to say goodbye.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      NOOOO!  Don't let go don't let go don't\n                      let go -\n\n            Sam's tears mix with Lucy's as they sob, clinging to each\n            other.  With such fierce love; a parent and a child.\n\n                                LUCY (CONT'D)\n                      Don't let them Daddy don't let them! \n                      Don't ever let me go!\n\n            He can't let her go.  That he can't do.  Margaret, steel\n            herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done\n            this.\n\n                                MARGARET BROWN\n                      Please help me.\n\n            Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago,\n            shakes her head, NO.  Now, Margaret literally has to wrench\n            Lucy away from her father's arms.  Lucy bellowing as she\n            pulls her down the hallway.  Sam is frozen in incalculable\n            pain.\n\n            EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n            We hear \"Fool on the Hill\".  We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID\n            melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile\n            of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY\n            ICE CREAM.  Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the\n            record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall.\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n            The CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW.  Inside, the lights are dim. \n            Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike.  Sam, curled into a\n            ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over\n            again against the wall, overcome with grief.\n\n            INT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n            The POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the\n            doorway, watching her sleeping child.  This stranger that\n            she's raised.  She moves to cover him, this tough little boy,\n            when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm.  She tucks them\n            both in, tenderly.\n\n            EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY\n\n            Saturday in idyllic suburbia.  Sam, directions and a map in\n            his hands, tentatively rounds the corner.  A small bouquet of\n            flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT --\n\n            REVERSE ANGLE\n\n            Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.  She\n            stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock\n            and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS.  There's a tiny\n            chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.\n\n            CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY\n\n            The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with\n            her.\n\n                                RANDY\n                      Your teacher told me you were an artist.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      You wear too much perfume.  You're\n                      trying too hard.\n\n                                RANDY\n                      I am, aren't I.  Maybe you could teach\n                      me how to paint.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      My daddy's coming today.  We're going to\n                      open my birthday presents.  Why don't\n                      you just go do something.\n\n            BACK TO SAM\n\n            From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything\n            she deserves.  He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand -\n            feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers\n            from a garden he's passing.  Puts them in his bouquet.  Then\n            stops.  Feels guilty.  Tries to put the flowers BACK.  He\n            stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.\n\n            Lucy sits on the steps.  Randy sits right next to her.\n\n            BACK ON SAM\n\n            Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE.  The flowers lay in\n            the dirt.  From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits.  And\n            waits.  And waits.\n\n            INT. STARBUCKS - DAY\n\n            It's Saturday.  The place is buzzing.  Sam listlessly cleans\n            the tables, without the usual energy and verve.  A TODDLER\n            marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his\n            parents.\n\n                                MAN\n                      Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee,\n                      could you clean this up?\n\n            Sam sees a FAMILY at a table covered with spilled coffee.\n\n                                MAN (CONT'D)\n                      I said I need a refill and a towel over\n                      here.\n\n                                SAM\n                          (snapping)\n                      You need a towel?

You have everything -\n                          (all his fury and frustration)\n                      Everything.  But it's not enough.  Take\n                      my daughter, too!\n\n            Sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he\n            backs into a shelf of MUGS he so carefully arranged.  They\n            CRASH onto the floor.\n\n                                                           SMASH CUT TO:\n\n            EXT. CARPENTER PORCH - DAY\n\n            Paints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS\n            THEM OVER.  Totally out of control.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      You gave him the wrong address!  You're\n                      hiding me from him!\n\n            As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her.\n\n            EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DUSK\n\n            Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch.  Her eyes\n            swollen from crying.  Finally, she gets up and moves to the\n            tiny chair that Randy put out for her.  Straightens the easel\n            and begins to paint.\n\n            The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her\n            face and hair.  Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel\n            and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.  Randy and\n            Lucy paint in silence for a long time.  Then -\n\n                                LUCY\n                      You're going to send me away now, aren't\n                      you?\n\n                                RANDY\n                          (tenderly)\n                      No.\n\n            We hear what sounds like a child's hand playing the song\n            \"Here, There and Everywhere...\"\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING\n\n            We see SAM sitting at Lucy's miniature toy piano as he plays\n            with one finger.  IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES, as DAYS and WEEKS\n            PASS, we see SAM'S HANDS at the PIANO -\n\t\t\t\n                                                               INTERCUT:\n\n            EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY\n\n            With Lucy and Randy's hands as they PAINT side by side to\n            Sam's sad melody.  Lucy's pictures start ANGRY, angular with\n            blacks and blues, then GRADUALLY soften and the dark figures\n            recede.  By the END, there is a BRUSHSTROKE of the red of\n            Randy's smock peeking into the corner of Lucy's picture.\n\n            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n            We come back to Sam, having withdrawn completely into himself\n            serenading no one.\n\n            INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n            We see Lucy and Randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the\n            birthday presents.  TIME HAS PASSED.  They look close, almost\n            like a mother and daughter.  Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's\n            present and we see a stack of ONE HUNDRED DENNY'S NAPKINS.\n\n                                RANDY\n                      Oh, he must've forgotten to put the gift\n                      in.\n\n            Randy picks up one of Lucy's pictures and moves to the wall.\n\n                                RANDY (CONT'D)\n                      You know, this wall really needs\n                      something special on it.\n\n            Lucy half-smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the\n            Denny's napkins into an origami bird.  Then crushes it.

SAM'S APARTMENT - WEEKS LATER - DAY\n\n            Sam sits in a dark corner; maniacally folding newspaper into\n            an odd origami pattern.  There's a knock at the door - Sam\n            doesn't move, he just continues folding his paper.\n\n                                RITA (O.S.)\n                      Sam it's me!

And\n            staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling. \n            He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes,\n            her tears.  And something ignites between them - something\n            confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate\n            ache.\n\n                                SAM (CONT'D)\n                      Lovely Rita...\n\n            On a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come\n            together, whole again.\n\n            EXT.

Harding was the twenty\n                      ninth President of the United States?\n\n                                SAM\n                      No.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      Remember - the twenty-ninth President. \n                      In case the Judge asks.\n\n            EXT. RANDY'S STREET - NIGHT\n\n            Sam, in his pajamas, holds a sleeping Lucy in his arms.  He\n            turns a corner and heads up the walkway to Randy's house.  He\n            knocks on the door.  Finally the door opens and we see Randy\n            and Bill in their pajamas SHOCKED at seeing Sam and Lucy.\n\n                                SAM\n                      She couldn't sleep.\n\n                                RANDY\n                      Give me my daugh -\n                          (she stops herself)\n                      Give me - I'll take Lucy.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three\n                      times, tell her two stories and give her\n                      half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a\n                      third of a glass of milk she'll sleep. \n                      Good night.\n\n            Randy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks\n            purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on\n            the quiet street.\n\n            SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. --\n\n            EXT.

LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n            Until FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house\n            looking out the windows, which have now been completely\n            covered with BARS.  Her room is filled with origami birds\n            from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.  Lucy gets\n            out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly\n            opening the door.\n\n            INT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n            We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the\n            stairs.  She gets to the front door.  It's been DEAD BOLTED\n            where she cannot reach it.  From the darkness we hear --\n\n                                RANDY\n                          (tenderly)\n                      Lucy.  Come here.\n\n            Randy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF\n            MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.\n\n                                RANDY (CONT'D)\n                      I made us a midnight snack.\n\n            Lucy stares at the muffin and milk.  Torn.\n\n                                RANDY (CONT'D)\n                      I understand that you want to see your\n                      daddy.  And I don't want to keep you\n                      from him.  I honestly don't.  So you\n                      tell me when you want to see him.  You\n                      can see him anytime you want.  But we\n                      have to arrange it first.  Do you\n                      understand?\n                          (Lucy nods)\n                      Now would you like a snack?\n\n            Lucy nods.  Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch. \n            But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up\n            the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      Thank you.  Goodnight.\n\n                                RANDY\n                          (words caught in her throat)\n                      Goodnight, Lucy.\n\n            INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n            We PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a\n            YELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER.  A KNOCK\n            at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there,\n            looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit.\n\n                                RITA\n                      My husband left this when he moved out.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid.\n\n                                RITA\n                          (entering)\n                      Nice place.

I'm the lucky one.  I have\n                      the lawyer that never loses.\n\n                                RITA\n                          (covering)\n                      That's me...okay, let me see, let me\n                      see, let me see.\n                          (pulls out notes)\n                      They're going to put Bill and Randy on\n                      the stand first and then you.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Them first, then me.  They're a nice\n                      couple.  They have a nice house.  She's\n                      pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell. \n                      The manager of the salad bar is gonna\n                      testify, isn't he?  That will help us.\n\n            For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam\n            overwhelms her.\n\n                                RITA\n                      Absolutely.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Nobody believed that George Harrison\n                      could really be a song writer.  But he\n                      wrote \"Here Comes the Sun\".  John and\n                      Paul said it was one of the best songs\n                      on ABBEY ROAD.\n\n                                RITA\n                          (tenderly)\n                      George was always my favorite Beatle.\n\n                                SAM\n                      Lucy's was Paul.\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n            INT. RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.\n\n            Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something.  She\n            opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her.\n\n                                LUCY\n                      Now.\n\n                                RANDY\n                      What honey?\n\n                                LUCY\n                      Now.  I want to see him now.\n\n            INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - 3:30 A.M.\n\n            We see Sam sleeping in bed.  There's a KNOCK at the door. \n            Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers. \n            We see that he's wearing the Armani suit.  Sam opens the door\n            to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her\n            arms.\n\n                                RANDY\n                      She fell asleep on the car ride over.  I\n                      was gonna turn back and tuck her in to\n                      her bed...with the pink canopy...and the\n                      quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd\n                      wake up at our house...\n                          (fighting the ache in her soul)\n                      ...and want to come home.\n\n            Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion.\n\n                                RANDY (CONT'D)\n                      I was gonna tell the judge that I could\n                      give Lucy the kind of love she never\n                      had.  But I would be lying.\n\n                                SAM\n                      I hope I hope I hope that you're saying\n                      what I think you're saying even though\n                      you're not saying it.\n\n            Randy nods and hands the sleeping Lucy into Sam's strong\n            arms.  For a moment they BOTH HOLD LUCY between them in the\n            most unique embrace.  Randy finally lets go and struggles to\n            say goodbye.\n\n                                RANDY\n                      Goodnight.  I'll see you in court.  Save\n                      me a seat...on your side.\n\n            Randy walks away.  Stunned, Sam watches her, holding Lucy in\n            his arms.  Then, from a very brave place:\n\n                                SAM\n                      Randy!

Robert, in\n            sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him.  Brad follows\n            around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to\n            her.  Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.  \n\n            They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.  Lucy\n            and a kid named PHILLIP go after the ball.\n\n                                OBNOXIOUS MOM\n                      Get her!

Sam does every coaching gesture,\n            and referee hand signal from every sport known to man.  It\n            looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.\n\n            ON LUCY\n\n            She does it right back at him.  Their secret code.

Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed\n            toward the goal.  Sam is running right alongside them, so\n            excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and\n            intercepts the ball!  Sam runs valiantly down the field with\n            it!
