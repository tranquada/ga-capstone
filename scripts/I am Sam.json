With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up\n            colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little\n            color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and\n            four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant\n            Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry.\n\n            We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his\n            domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling,\n            uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes,\n            they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge\n            has not etched it's path across this face.

Her face is\n            the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that\n            stops Sam dead in his tracks.

Suddenly Sam's whole\n            body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca,\n            but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.

Sam is nervous haling the\n            precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus\n            pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they\n            can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks\n            to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around\n            and no sign of her. \n            Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of\n            her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He\n            screams.\n\n<b>                                SAM\n</b>                      Becca!  Becca!\n\n            The more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's\n            no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block\n            holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.\n\n            We hear, \"Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but\n            she's gone.\"\n\n<b>                                                           SMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>            INT.

Next to him is\n            the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two\n            cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is\n            surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground\n            at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two\n            against the world.\n\n<b>            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN\n</b>\n            A marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on\n            hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded\n            T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A\n            carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift\n            bookshelves.\n\n            Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's\n            things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an \"Hold\n            Everything\" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been\n            transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers\n            lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a\n            clothes line of baby clothes.\n\n            The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera\n            follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a\n            blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An\n            exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He\n            swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back\n            to sleep.\n\n<b>                                SAM\n</b>                      Didn't you just fall asleep, little\n                      girl?\n                          (Lucy cries harder)\n                      Okay, if you say it's time to get up,\n                      then it's time to get up, time to get\n                      up.\n                          (Sam sniffs the air)\n                      Oh my, oh my, oh my.

Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in\n            place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA\n            AISLE.  Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified.

He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand -\n            feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers\n            from a garden he's passing.  Puts them in his bouquet.  Then\n            stops.  Feels guilty.  Tries to put the flowers BACK.  He\n            stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.\n\n            Lucy sits on the steps.  Randy sits right next to her.\n\n<b>            BACK ON SAM\n</b>\n            Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE.  The flowers lay in\n            the dirt.

Finally, she gets up and moves to the\n            tiny chair that Randy put out for her.  Straightens the easel\n            and begins to paint.\n\n            The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her\n            face and hair.  Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel\n            and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.  Randy and\n            Lucy paint in silence for a long time.

RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.\n</b>\n            Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something.  She\n            opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her.\n\n<b>                                LUCY\n</b>                      Now.\n\n<b>                                RANDY\n</b>                      What honey?\n\n<b>                                LUCY\n</b>                      Now.

There's a KNOCK at the door. \n            Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers. \n            We see that he's wearing the Armani suit.  Sam opens the door\n            to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her\n            arms.\n\n<b>                                RANDY\n</b>                      She fell asleep on the car ride over.  I\n                      was gonna turn back and tuck her in to\n                      her bed...with the pink canopy...and the\n                      quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd\n                      wake up at our house...\n                          (fighting the ache in her soul)\n                      ...and want to come home.\n\n            Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion.\n\n<b>                                RANDY (CONT'D)\n</b>                      I was gonna tell the judge that I could\n                      give Lucy the kind of love she never\n                      had.

For a moment they BOTH HOLD LUCY between them in the\n            most unique embrace.  Randy finally lets go and struggles to\n            say goodbye.\n\n<b>                                RANDY\n</b>                      Goodnight.  I'll see you in court.

Robert, in\n            sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him.  Brad follows\n            around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to\n            her.  Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.  \n\n            They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.
