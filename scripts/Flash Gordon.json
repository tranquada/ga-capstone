Suddenly it changes amazingly:\r\n          the white disc goes through a rapid series of color\r\n          transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible\r\n          BLOOD RED.

It\r\n          buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's\r\n          almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

One is DALE ARDEN,\r\n          a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and\r\n          reading a book entitled \"KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A\r\n          Guide to Survival In The City.\" A few rows forward, near the\r\n          open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.\r\n          He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed\r\n          things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows\r\n          indicating the directions of movement.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks\r\n          the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with\r\n          sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture\r\n          that's habitual to her in moments of stress.\r\n                         \r\n          There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds.

Floating\r\n          high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-\r\n          filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we\r\n          discern a MAN moving about actively on a platform inside the\r\n          central tower, about half-way up:\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and\r\n          dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. As\r\n          Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a\r\n          grim-voiced TV.

Faster\r\n          and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back\r\n          against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.\r\n                         \r\n          We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part\r\n          of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted\r\n          by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving\r\n          as he speaks with enormous effort:\r\n                         \r\n           ZARKOV,\r\n           Friendship...Built this to send to\r\n           them in...Friendship...The end\r\n           now...End of the world....Unless we\r\n                          \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\r\n           (every sound an effort\r\n                          NOW)\r\n           Unless...We...Three...Can...\r\n                         \r\n          ZARKOV'S eyes close.

There is a clatter as AMAZONS cast away\r\n          their spears. A cry goes up as if from one throat!\r\n                         \r\n           ALL THE MONGONS\r\n           Hail, Flash Gordon!\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.
