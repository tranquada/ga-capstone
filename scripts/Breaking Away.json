QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1\r\n\r\n          A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation.\r\n          Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the\r\n          road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it\r\n          through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys\r\n          walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their\r\n          walk. MII\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is singing. The others are humming along. The\r\n          melody of the song of \"0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie\"\r\n          but it's a loose version.\r\n\r\n                         MIME\r\n\r\n          AND WHEN I DIE...WON'T YOU BURY ME\r\n\r\n          ON THE\"PARKING LOT OF THE A AND P\r\n\r\n          BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND BLOW OUT TIE LAMPS\r\n\r\n          AND LIGHT MY PYRE WITH MY TRADING STAMPS\r\n\r\n          I HAD TWO BOOKS BUT I NEEDED THREE R\r\n\r\n          TO DELIVER ME FROM THE A AND P.\r\n\r\n          I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR\r\n\r\n          TO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL.\r\n          By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is\r\n          handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER\r\n          is very short.

More\r\n          and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed\r\n          by them.

His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road\r\n          falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The\r\n          4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave.

The Italian music is\r\n          still playing as he catches up to them and pulls up behind\r\n          Rod who's riding on the inside. They are going around the\r\n          curve. Rod drifts out a bit and that's all the room that\r\n          Dave needs. He takes the inside edge as they come around\r\n          for the final stretch. All three of them stand up and begin\r\n          their final sprint. It looks dead even as they're\r\n          approaching the finish line. A man is waving the checkered\r\n          flag. Then, with about forty yards to go, Dave suddenly\r\n          explodes ahead and wins by an inch or so. He raises his arms\r\n          in the air.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         NEW ANGLE\r\n          Cyril, Moocher and Mike are running toward Dave.
