Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse \n               locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes \n               and pulls.\n\n               He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from \n               his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink.

PARKER MOUNTAIN - DAY\n</b>\n               Pop's red truck is parked behind Jack Hewitt's 4x4 on a snow-\n               banked road. Wade, hunting rifle pointed up, traces Jack's \n               footsteps down the slope of the mountain.\n\n<b>                                     ROLFE (V.O.)\n</b>                         It's how we keep from destroying in \n                         turn our own children and terrorizing \n                         the women who have the misfortune to \n                         love us; how we absent ourselves \n                         from the tradition of male violence; \n                         how we decline the seduction of \n                         revenge.\n\n               Wade spots Jack poised in a spruce grove, watching for deer. \n               Wade bolts his rifle, releases the safety, aims and FIRES.\n\n               Jack, hit in the chest, falls bleeding between trees. Blood \n               stains the snow.\n\n<b>                                     ROLFE (V.O.)\n</b>                         Jack's truck turned up three days \n                         later in a shopping mall in Toronto. \n                         Even without the footprints, the \n                         bullet, Wade's utter disappearance \n                         seemed evidence enough of his guilt.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY\n</b>\n               Camera glides from room to room, glimpsing details, fragments \n               of former times, as if this were an historical site or \n               memorial. The walls resonate: lives were molded here.\n\n<b>                                     ROLFE (V.O.)\n</b>                         LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed \n                         in business. The Parker Mountain Ski \n                         Resort is now advertised all across \n                         the country. Jimmy Dame tends bar at \n                         the lodge. Chub Merritt opened a \n                         snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham \n                         runs the new Burger King. Margie \n                         Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her \n                         mother; Lillian and Jill went with \n                         Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle.\n\n               Out a window, workers gather charred timbers from the barn, \n               throw them on a truck.\n\n<b>                                     ROLFE (V.O.)\n</b>                         We want to believe Wade died, died \n                         that same November, froze to death \n                         on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot \n                         understand how a man, a normal man, \n                         a man like you and me, could do such \n                         a terrible thing. Unless the police \n                         happen to arrest a vagrant who turns \n                         out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe \n                         he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will \n                         have turned himself into one of those \n                         faceless fellows working at the video \n                         store and lives in a town-house \n                         apartment at the edge of town until \n                         his mailman recognizes him from the \n                         picture at the post office -- unless \n                         that happens, there will be no more \n                         mention of him and his friend Jack \n                         Hewitt and our father. The story \n                         will be over.
