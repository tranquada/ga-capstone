The battered terrain shows \n               the effects of battle.\n\n               In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with \n               camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage.  \n               Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and \n               the ground.

They play \n               THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit.\n\n               The General stands at attention through the first chorus, \n               visibly moved.  During the second chorus he starts up the \n               aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is \n               bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help.  \n               Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, \n               faces the men and salutes them.  The men return the salute.  \n               (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the \n               enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.)

We reveal a number of \n               enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including \n               Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.

Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the \n               end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.

This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which \n               he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, \n               brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song \n               left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

The notion behind this \n               scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due \n               to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of \n               playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it: \n               Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully \n               realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, \n               consciously, her affection.

Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, \n               etc.  Bob and Betty are seen singing.  Throughout action of \n               this number Phil and Judy dance.  In addition there is staged \n               movement by the ensemble.  Bob and Betty are on each side of \n               the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is \n               preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating \n               with one hand behind the cutout tree.\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them \n               behind the tree.  It is now that we see very clearly that \n               the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has \n               opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered \n               by the falling snow.  Also, we see pine trees in the snow \n               that are decorated.\n\n               Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of \n               mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock \n               she gave him in scene 110.  Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe \n               and the sock, and smiles at Betty.\n\n               She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is \n               wearing the other sock.  They laugh and embrace.\n\n<b>               REVERSE SHOT - FROM DINING ROOM\n</b>\n               The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real \n               trees and falling snow in b.g. are completely visible.
