The battered terrain shows \n               the effects of battle.\n\n               In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with \n               camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage.  \n               Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and \n               the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is \n               nearby.\n\n               MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA\n\n               We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep \n               with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's \n               car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation \n               area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside \n               him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON.\n\n               JEEP - MED. CLOSE\n\n               As it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and \n               weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long \n               wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean \n               and fresh from the Pentagon.\n\n               He is staring off at the recreation area.\n\n                                     GENERAL CARLTON\n                              (To Adjutant)\n                         What's this all about, Colonel?\n\n                                     ADJUTANT\n                              (Turning)\n                         A little entertainment for the men, \n                         sir.

The men get a \n                         little loose.  But I know I'm leaving \n                         them in good hands.\n\n                                     GENERAL CARLTON\n                              (Stiffly)\n                         Thank you.\n                              (To Driver)\n                         Sergeant, take me to headquarters \n                         immediately!  We'll have those men \n                         turned out on the double!\n\n               The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.\n\n                                     GENERAL WAVERLY\n                         Goodbye, Sergeant.  Take the short \n                         cut.\n\n                                     SERGEANT\n                         Yes, sir!\n\n               The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant \n               makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him.\n\n               TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT\n\n               The Adjutant turns to him.\n\n                                     ADJUTANT\n                         That's not the way to headquarters!\n\n                                     GENERAL WAVERLY\n                         Joe, you know that, and I know that, \n                         but the new General doesn't know it.\n                         Or he won't for about an hour and a \n                         half.\n\n                                     ADJUTANT\n                         That Sergeant'll be a private \n                         tomorrow!\n\n                                     GENERAL WAVERLY\n                         Yes... isn't he lucky?\n\n               He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the \n               recreation area.\n\n               RAISED PLATFORM - MED. SHOT\n\n               CAPTAIN BOB WALLACE (BING CROSBY) is wearing a makeshift \n               beard and Santa Claus hat and PRIVATE PHILIP DAVIS (DONALD \n               O'CONNOR) is in combat clothes.  They are doing a number to \n               entertain the soldiers, WHAT DOES A SOLDIER WANT FOR \n               CHRISTMAS?  During introduction, we\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               5A.\n\n               TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT\n\n               just starting to take seats, off to one side where they are \n               not noticed by the performers.\n\n               5B.\n\n               GROUP SHOT - ABOUT 6 SOLDIERS\n\n               seated in audience.  They look off, see General, start to \n               rise.\n\n               5C.\n\n               TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT\n\n               The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again, \n               indicating he doesn't want attention called to himself.\n\n               5D.\n\n               PLATFORM - FULL SHOT\n\n               The number concludes to applause.  Bob holds up his hand for \n               silence.  He removes his beard.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Thanks, fellows.  I guess by now you \n                         know the Old Man's being replaced by \n                         a new Commanding General fresh out \n                         of the Pentagon... this divisions's \n                         been awfully lucky so far, but tonight \n                         they're running a special on St. \n                         Christophers at the PX... The Old \n                         Man's heading back to the rear - \n                         he's never moved in that direction \n                         in his life.  All I can say is, we \n                         owe so much to General Waverly and \n                         the way --\n\n                                     WAVERLY'S VOICE\n                              (A bellow)\n                         ATTENTION!\n\n               Automatically, Bob stiffens.  Phil does the same.\n\n               AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT\n\n               Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where \n               General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of \n               the platform.\n\n                                     GENERAL WAVERLY\n                         Captain Wallace, button your shirt.\n                         You're out of uniform!\n                              (Bob, grinning, hastily \n                              buttons his shirt)\n                         This division is now under the command \n                         of General Harold G. Carlton, and I \n                         don't want anyone to forget it -- \n                         not that he'll let you.  He's tough -- \n                         just what this sloppy outfit needs.  \n                         You'll be standing inspection night \n                         and day -- you may even learn how to \n                         march.  And if you don't give him \n                         everything you got, I may come back \n                         and fight for the enemy.  Merry \n                         Christmas!\n\n               The boys respond with \"Merry Christmas\".\n\n                                     GENERAL WAVERLY\n                              (Embarrassed)\n                         Well -- I guess that's about it - uh - \n                         uh --\n\n               Bob, covering his embarrassment:\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Perhaps I can help you out, sir.\n\n               He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat.  They play \n               THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit.\n\n               The General stands at attention through the first chorus, \n               visibly moved.  During the second chorus he starts up the \n               aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is \n               bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help.  \n               Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, \n               faces the men and salutes them.  The men return the salute.  \n               (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the \n               enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.)  There is a Red Cross \n               ambulance standing by.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - (NIGHT) - TINY CANDLE\n\n               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on \n               a tiny makeshift Christmas tree.  We reveal a number of \n               enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including \n               Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.  Now \n               another does.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH\n\n               The hand is approaching midnight.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER\n\n               He is looking at his wristwatch.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH\n\n               The second hand is pointing to the hour.\n\n               FULL SHOT OF SCENE\n\n               This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE \n               CHRISTMAS.  Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the \n               end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.  A \n               shell BURSTS in the vicinity.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL\n\n               Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel \n               burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which \n               he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, \n               brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song \n               left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE\n\n               Perhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant.  They're \n               warm.  One woman has a fan, some use programs.  They are \n               enjoying the show, however.  There are some vacant seats \n               apparent.  This theatre is a modern traveling tent show, \n               such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and \n               beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida.\n\n               FULL SHOT - AUDIENCE\n\n               APPLAUDING the conclusion of the number.\n\n               MED.

Phil and Bob are met \n               by COOKE, the Company Manager.\n\n               RITA, a luscious Latin type, and some of the remaining chorus \n               girls and other players ad lib, \"Couldn't be cuter!\"  \"Great.\"  \n               \"Very funny!\"\n\n                                     COOKE\n                              (To Bob and Phil)\n                         New York's on the telephone.\n\n               Bob and Phil, with Cooke, go to the backstage telephone.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                              (Into phone)\n                         Hello.\n                              (He listens.

OSCAR is their \n               representative and manager, not their employer.\n\n               He is sixty and looks competent.  He refers to a telegram in \n               his hand.

That's Bob, \n                         smoking a pipe and petting a cocker \n                         spaniel.  Still, Phil could learn to \n                         smoke a pipe.  Breaking a fellow in \n                         to suit you is something every girl \n                         should go through.  I hear it's half \n                         the fun.

Betty is wide awake.\n\n               She is looking toward the window.  As the curtains billow \n               outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, \n               putting out his pipe.  This is followed by an equally diffused \n               figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, \n               and joining Bob.  Bob takes her in his arms.  At this point \n               we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter.  \n               This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of \n               bed and puts on her robe.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

The notion behind this \n               scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due \n               to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of \n               playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it: \n               Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully \n               realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, \n               consciously, her affection.

He, as does the audience, \n               realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to leave, \n               Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a little \n               longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with \n               the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after \n               the train, puzzled.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight.  \n               Betty wipes away a tear.

No telling \n                         who might be dropping in.\n\n               Martha salutes.\n\n                                     MARTHA\n                         Yes, sir!\n\n               She and the General gaze at the snow falling beyond the lobby \n               door which is blown open by the wind.\n\n               Underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory \n               music to WHITE CHRISTMAS, which is the number now in progress \n               on the stage.  Waverly now turns and walks into the dining \n               room.\n\n               INT. DINING ROOM - MOVING CAMERA\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS Waverly on his entrance.  As he passes Susan, \n               we see she is reacting to something on the stage.\n\n               CAMERA PASSES Waverly and moves to:\n\n               STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA\n\n               Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas \n               tree.  Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, \n               etc.  Bob and Betty are seen singing.  Throughout action of \n               this number Phil and Judy dance.  In addition there is staged \n               movement by the ensemble.  Bob and Betty are on each side of \n               the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is \n               preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating \n               with one hand behind the cutout tree.\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them \n               behind the tree.  It is now that we see very clearly that \n               the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has \n               opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered \n               by the falling snow.  Also, we see pine trees in the snow \n               that are decorated.\n\n               Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of \n               mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock \n               she gave him in scene 110.  Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe \n               and the sock, and smiles at Betty.\n\n               She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is \n               wearing the other sock.  They laugh and embrace.\n\n               REVERSE SHOT - FROM DINING ROOM\n\n               The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real \n               trees and falling snow in b.g. are completely visible.  One \n               by one, the trees are lighted.\n\n               AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE\n\n               Martha and Susan are standing happily beside the General, \n               each holding one of his arms.\n\n               EXT. VERMONT TOWN - EXTREME HIGH SHOT - (MINIATURE)\n\n               A church bell is framed in the foreground, and, far in the \n               distance, we see the town and the Inn and the snow as we\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Christmas\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Norman Krasna\u00a0\u00a0Melvin Frank\u00a0\u00a0Norman Panama\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Musical\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:38:46.279122"}
